### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 19:1</span></span>

And there came two - Probably two of the three that had just before been
with Abraham, the two created angels who were sent to execute God's
purpose concerning Sodom.

[Genesis 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 19:3</span></span>

And he pressed upon them greatly - Partly because he would by no means
have them to expose themselves to the perils of lodging in the streets
of Sodom, and partly because he was desirous of their converse.

[Genesis 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 19:4</span></span>

Here were old and young all from every quarter - The old were not past
it, and the young were soon come up to it. Either they had no
magistrates to protect the peaceable, or their magistrates were
themselves aiding and abetting.

[Genesis 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 19:8</span></span>

I have two daughters - This was unadvisedly and unjustifiably offered.
It is true, of two evils we must chose the less, but of two sins we must
chose neither, nor ever do evil that good may come of it.

[Genesis 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 19:11</span></span>

And they smote the men with blindness - This was designed to put an end
to their attempt, and to be an earnest of their utter ruin the next day.

[Genesis 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 19:13</span></span>

We will destroy this place - The holy angels are ministers of God's
wrath for the destruction of sinners, as well as of his mercy for the
preservation and deliverance of his people.

[Genesis 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 19:14</span></span>

Up, get you out this place - The manner of expression is startling. It
was not time to trifle, when the destruction was just at the door. But
he seemed to them as one that mocked - They thought perhaps that the
assault which the Sodomites had just now made upon his house had
disturbed his head, and put him into such a fright that be knew not what
he said. They that made a jest of every thing, made a jest of that, and
so perished in the overthrow. Thus many who are warned of the danger
they are in by sin, make a light matter of it; such will perish with
their blood upon their heads.

[Genesis 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 19:16</span></span>

Tho' Lot did not make a jest of the warning as his sons - in - law, yet
he lingered, he did not make so much haste as the case required. And it
might have been fatal to him, if the angels had not laid hold on his
hand, and brought him forth. Herein the Lord was merciful to him,
otherwise he might justly have left him to perish, since he was loath to
depart. If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our
ruin.

[Genesis 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 19:17</span></span>

Look not behind thee - He must not loiter by the way; stay not in all
the plain - For it would all be made one dead sea: he must not take up
short of the place of refuge appointed him; escape to the mountain -
Such as these are the commands given to those who through grace are
delivered out of a sinful state. Return not to sin and Satan, for that's
looking back to Sodom. Rest not in the world, for that's staying in the
plain. And, Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the
mountain, short of which we must not take up.

[Genesis 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 19:22</span></span>

I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither - The very presence of
good men in a place helps to keep off judgments. See what care God takes
for the preservation of his people!

[Genesis 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 19:24</span></span>

Then the Lord rained - from the Lord - God the Son, from God the Father,
for the Father has committed all judgment to the Son. He that is the
Saviour will be the destroyer of those that reject the salvation.

[Genesis 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 19:25</span></span>

And he overthrew the cities, and all the inhabitants of them, the plain,
and all that grew upon the ground - It was an utter ruin, and
irreparable; that fruitful valley remains to this day a great lake, or
dead sea. Travelers say it is about thirty miles long, and ten miles
broad. It has no living creature in it: it is not moved by the wind: the
smell of it is offensive: things do not easily sink in it. The Greeks
call it Asphaltis, from a sort of pitch which it casts up. Jordan falls
into it, and is lost there. It was a punishment that answered their sin.
Burning lusts against nature were justly punished with this
preternatural burning.

[Genesis 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 19:26</span></span>

But his wife looked back from behind him - Herein she disobeyed an
express command. Probably she hankered after her house and goods in
Sodom, and was loath to leave them. Christ intimates this to be her sin,
[Luk 17:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031.md), she too much regarded
her stuff. And her looking back spoke an inclination to go back; and
therefore our Saviour uses it as a warning against apostasy from our
Christian profession. And she became a pillar of salt - She was struck
dead in the place, yet her body did not fall down, but stood fixed and
erect like a pillar or monument, not liable to waste or decay, as human
bodies exposed to the air are, but metamorphosed into a metallic
substance, which would last perpetually. Our communion with God consists
in our gracious regard to him, and his gracious regard to us. We have
here therefore the communion that was between God and Abraham in the
event concerning Sodom, as before in the consultation concerning It; for
communion with God is to be kept up in providences as well as in
ordinances.

[Genesis 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 19:27</span></span>

And Abraham gat up early - And to see what was become of his prayers, he
went to the very place were he had stood before the Lord.

[Genesis 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 19:28</span></span>

And he looked toward Sodom - Not as Lot's wife did, tacitly reflecting
upon the divine severity, but humbly adoring it, and acquiescing in it.
Here is God's favourable regard to Abraham, [Gen
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md). As before when Abraham prayed
for Ishmael, God heard him for Isaac, so now when he prayed for Sodom,
he heard for Lot.

[Genesis 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 19:29</span></span>

God remembered Abraham, and for his sake sent Lot out of the overthrow -
God will certainly give an answer of peace to the prayer of faith in his
own way and time.

[Genesis 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 19:30</span></span>

He feared to dwell in Zoar - Here is the great trouble and distress that
Lot was brought into after his deliverance, [Gen
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#029.md). He was frightened out of Zoar,
durst not dwell there, either because he was conscious to himself that
it was a refuge of his own chusing, and that therein he had foolishly
prescribed to God, and therefore could not but distrust his safety in
it. Probably he found it as wicked as Sodom; and therefore concluded it
could not long survive it; or perhaps he observed the rise and increase
of those waters, which, after the conflagration, began to overflow the
plain, and which, mixing with the ruins, by degrees made the dead sea;
in those waters he concluded Zoar must needs perish, (though it had
escaped the fire) because it stood upon the same flat. He was now glad
to go to the mountain, the place which God had appointed for his
shelter. See in Lot what those bring themselves to at last, that forsake
the communion of saints for secular advantages.
