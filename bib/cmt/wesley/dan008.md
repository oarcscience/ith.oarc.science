Was broken - When Alexander was greatest, then was he broken, and that
to pieces, for he, his mother, son, brother, and all his kindred were
destroyed. The four winds Antipater got Greece. Asia was possessed by

[Daniel 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)

A little horn - This little horn was Antiochus Epiphanes. The south -
Egypt where he besieged and took many places. The east - In Syria,
Babylon, Armenia. The pleasant land - Judea, so called because of the
temple and people of God in it, and the fruitfulness of it.

[Daniel 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 8:10</span></span>

The host of heaven - The church of God militant, who worship the God of
heaven, who are citizens of heaven, whose names are written in heaven;
and among these the priests, and champions, who were as stars shining
above the rest; these he profaned and slew cruelly.

[Daniel 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 8:11</span></span>

The prince - Not only against the high - priest, but against God
himself. Was cast down - He took away the use of the temple as to the
holy service and sacrifices.

[Daniel 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 8:12</span></span>

By reason of transgression - Both the transgression of the priests, and
of the people.

[Daniel 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 8:13</span></span>

One saint - That is, one holy angel. How long - How long shall Antiochus
continue his vexations against the people and prevent the worship of
God? This is, the treading down of the sanctuary, and the host.

[Daniel 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 8:14</span></span>

He - That angel. Then - Just so long it was, from the defection of the
people, procured by Menelaus, the high - priest, to the cleansing of the
sanctuary, and the re - establishment of religion among them.

[Daniel 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 8:15</span></span>

The meaning - A more clear discovery of those things. The appearance of
a man - Probably Gabriel.

[Daniel 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 8:16</span></span>

A man's voice - Of him before mentioned, namely, Christ.

[Daniel 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 8:17</span></span>

He came near - That he might speak more familiarly to him, yet Daniel
could not bear the glory of it. How much less can we bear the glory of
God, and how graciously hath the Lord dealt with us, to teach us by men,
and not by angels? O son of man - He calls him son of man, to make him
mind his frailty, and not to be lifted up with this great condescension
of heaven. At the time - In God's appointed time, in the latter day, but
not now in thy life - time.

[Daniel 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 8:18</span></span>

Toward the ground - Being terrified with the splendor and grandeur both
of the messenger and message. Set me upright - By one touch only. The
power of spirits is incomparably greater than that of the strongest of
men.

[Daniel 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 8:19</span></span>

The indignation - God will raise up Antiochus to execute his wrath
against the Jews for their sins, yet there shall be an end of that
indignation.

[Daniel 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 8:23</span></span>

In the latter time - When they were come to the height, and beginning to
decline. When the transgressors - When the Jews were grown to an excess
of wickedness, then God suffered Antiochus to persecute them. Dark
sentences - Full of subtilty: such all histories declare Antiochus to
be.

[Daniel 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 8:24</span></span>

Not by his own power - Not by any heroick deeds, but by making use of
the Jewish factions, through the divine commission to punish a
backsliding nation; and by means of Eumenes and Attalus, by whose help
he got up to this height. Shall destroy - He shall by force, craft, and
cruelty, destroy many of God's people.

[Daniel 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 8:25</span></span>

By peace - Under colour of kindness. Against the prince of princes - He
fought against God, affronting God's laws, profaning God's worship, and
temple, and setting up the image and worship of Jupiter there. Without
hand - By a disease whereof he died, 1 Macc. 6:8.

[Daniel 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 8:26</span></span>

Shut thou up - Lay it up in thy heart. For many days - Three hundred
years after this; long after Daniel's days.

Was sick - Being overwhelmed by a sense of the calamity that should
befall the people of God. Did the king's business - Having recovered
strength, he minded his place, duty and trust, and concealed the whole,
that they might not see it by his countenance.
