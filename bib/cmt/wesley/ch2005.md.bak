### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

The gold - The remainder of those vast sums mentioned, [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 5:5</span></span>

The ark - The ark was a type of Christ, and a token of the presence of
God. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end
of the world, does in effect bring the ark into our religious
assemblies, if we claim it by faith and prayer. And this we should be
earnest for: the temple itself, if Christ leave it, is a desolate place.
Those &c. - As many of them as were fit for use, it is probable, were
still used. The rest were carefully laid up, as monuments of antiquity.

[2 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 5:9</span></span>

To this day - When this history was first written; not when it was
reviewed by Ezra: for after the return from Babylon, neither staves nor
ark were any more seen.

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

By course - According to David's appointment, 1Ch. 24:1-31, 25:1-22,
which was only for the ordinary service, but in extraordinary
solemnities, such as this, they all came together.

[2 Chronicles 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 5:14</span></span>

Glory of the Lord - And this beautified it more than all the gold with
which it was overlaid, or the precious stones with which it was
garnished. Yet even that was no glory, in comparison of the glory of the
gospel - dispensation.
