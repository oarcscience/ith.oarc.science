There met him a man with an unclean spirit - St. Matthew mentions two.

fierce and ungovernable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 5:9</span></span>

himself.

where Jesus himself did not come.

One of the rulers of the synagogue - To regulate the affairs of every
synagogue, there was a council of grave men. Over these was a president,
who was termed the ruler of the synagogue. Sometimes there was no more
than one ruler in a synagogue. [Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018.md); [Luk

John, the brother of James - When St. Mark wrote, not long after our
Lord's ascension, the memory of St. James, lately beheaded, was so
fresh, that his name was more known than that of John himself.

[Mark 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 5:43</span></span>

He charged them that no man should know it - That he might avoid every
appearance of vain glory, might prevent too great a concourse of people,
and might not farther enrage the scribes and Pharisees against him; the
time for his death, and for the full manifestation of his glory, being
not yet come. He commanded something should be given her to eat - So
that when either natural or spiritual life is restored, even by
immediate miracle, all proper means are to be used in order to preserve
it.
