### [Joshua Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 6:3</span></span>

Round about the city once - At a convenient distance, out of the reach
of their arrows. Six days - Every day once. This and the following
course might seem ridiculous and absurd, and is therefore prescribed by
God, that they might learn to take new measures of things, and to expect
success not from their own valour, or skill, but merely from God's
appointment and blessing; and in general, not to judge of any of God's
institutions by mere carnal reason, to which divers of their ceremonies
would seem no less foolish than this action.

[Joshua 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 6:5</span></span>

The wall - Not all of it; which was unnecessary, and might have given
the people better opportunity of escaping, but only a considerable part
of it, where the Israelites might fitly enter: for Rahab's house was not
overthrown, [Jos 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#022.md). Flat - Heb.
under it, it was not battered down with engines which would have made
part of it fall out of its place; but it fell of its own accord, and
therefore in the place it did formerly stand in. God chose this way, to
try the faith and obedience of the people: whether they would observe a
precept, which to human policy seemed foolish, and believe a promise,
which seemed impossible to be performed: whether they could patiently
bear the reproaches of their enemies, and patiently wait for the
salvation of God. Thus by faith, not by force, the walls of Jericho fell
down.

[Joshua 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 6:6</span></span>

Of rams horns - Of the basest matter, and the dullest sound, that the
excellency of the power might be of God.

[Joshua 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 6:7</span></span>

Him that is armed - God would have them armed both for the defense of
themselves and the ark, in case the enemies should make a sally upon
them, and for the execution of the Lord's vengeance upon that city.

[Joshua 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 6:9</span></span>

The rereward - Which being opposed to the armed men, may seem to note
the unarmed people, who were desirous to be spectators of this wonderful
work.

[Joshua 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 6:10</span></span>

Ye shall not shout - Because shouting before the time appointed, would
be ineffectual, and so might give them some discouragement, and their
enemies matter of insulting.

[Joshua 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 6:16</span></span>

Shout - To testify your faith in God's promise, and thankfulness for
this glorious mercy; to encourage yourselves and brethren, and to strike
a terror into your enemies. Given you the city - It is given to them, to
be devoted to God, as the first, and perhaps the worst of all the cities
of Canaan.

[Joshua 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 6:17</span></span>

Accursed - That is, devoted to utter destruction. This he speaks by
direction from God, as is evident from [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md). To the Lord - Partly because
the first - fruits were appropriated to God; partly lest the soldiers
being glutted with the spoil of the rich city, should grow sluggish in
their work; and partly to strike the greater terror into the rest of
their enemies.

[Joshua 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 6:18</span></span>

A curse - By provoking God to punish them for your sin, in which they
may be one way or other involved; or the whole camp having sins of their
own, God might take what occasion he saw fit to inflict this punishment.

[Joshua 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 6:19</span></span>

Vessels of brass and iron - Except that of which images were made, which
were to be utterly destroyed. Unto the Lord - Being first made to pass
through the fire, [Num 31:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#022.md).
Treasury of the Lord - To be employed wholly for the uses of the
tabernacle, not to be applied to the use of any private person or
priest.

[Joshua 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 6:21</span></span>

Young and old - Being commanded to do so by the sovereign Lord of every
man's life; and being informed by God before that the Canaanites were
abominably wicked, and deserved the severest punishments. As for the
infants, they were guilty of original sin, and otherwise at the disposal
of their creator; but if they had been wholly innocent, it was a great
favour to them to take them away in infancy, rather than reserve them to
those dreadful calamities which those who survived them were liable to.

[Joshua 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 6:22</span></span>

Harlot's house - Which together with the wall upon which it leaned, was
left standing, by a special favour of God to her.

[Joshua 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 6:23</span></span>

Without the camp of Israel - 'Till they were cleansed from the
impurities of their Gentile state, and instructed in the Jewish
religion, and solemnly admitted into that church, for which Rahab's good
counsel and example had doubtless prepared them.

[Joshua 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 6:25</span></span>

The harlot olive - For that general command of rooting out the
Canaanites seems to have had some exception, in case any of them had
sincerely and seasonably cast off their wickedness, and submitted to the
Israelites.

[Joshua 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 6:26</span></span>

Adjured them - Or, made them to fear; caused the people, or some in the
name of all, to swear for the present and succeeding generations, and to
confirm their oath by a curse. Before the Lord - That is, from God's
presence, and by his sentence, as they are said to cast lots before the
Lord, [Jos 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#008.md), [Jos
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md), that is, expecting the design
from God. He intimates, that he doth not utter this upon a particular
dislike of that place, but by divine inspiration. God would have the
ruins of this city remain as a standing monument of God's justice
against this wicked and idolatrous people, and of his almighty power in
destroying so great and strong a city by such contemptible means.
Buildeth - That is, that shall attempt to build it. So this curse is
restrained to the builder, but no way belongs to those who should
inhabit it after it was built, as is evident from [Kg2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#018.md); [Luk
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001.md), [Luk
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005.md). In his youngest son - That is,
he shall lose all his children in the work, the first at the beginning,
others in the progress of it by degrees, and the youngest in the close
of it, when the gates use to be set up. This was fulfilled, [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md).

[Joshua 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 6:27</span></span>

The word of the Lord was with him - (So the Chaldee:) Even Christ
himself, the same that was with Moses. Nothing makes a man appear more
truly great, than to have the evidences of God's presence with him.
