### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 12:1</span></span>

Were come - Rehoboam did not call them thither, but went thither,
because the Israelites prevented him, and had pitched upon that place,
rather than upon Jerusalem, because it was most convenient for all,
being in the center of the kingdom; and because that being in the potent
tribe of Ephraim, they supposed there they might use that freedom of
speech, which they resolved to use, to get there grievances redressed.
So out of a thousand wives and concubines, he had but one son to bear
his name, and he a fool! Is not sin an ill way of building up a family?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 12:3</span></span>

They sent - When the people sent him word of Solomon's death, they also
sent a summons for him to come to Shechem. That the presence and
countenance of a man of so great interest and reputation, might lay the
greater obligation upon Rehoboam to grant them ease and relief.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 12:4</span></span>

Grievous - By heavy taxes and impositions, not only for the temple and
his magnificent buildings, but for the expenses of his numerous court,
and of so many wives and concubines. And Solomon having so grossly
forsaken God, it is no wonder if he oppressed the people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 12:7</span></span>

This day - By complying with their desires, and condescending to them
for a season, till thou art better established in thy throne. They use
this expression, fore - seeing that some would dissuade him from this
course, as below the majesty of a prince. And answer - Thy service is
not hard, it is only a few good words, which it is as easy to give as
bad ones.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 12:8</span></span>

Young men - So called, comparatively to the old men: otherwise they were
near forty years old.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 12:10</span></span>

Shall be thicker - Or rather, is thicker, and therefore stronger, and
more able to crush you, if you proceed in these mutinous demands, than
his loins, in which is the principal seat of strength.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 12:15</span></span>

From the Lord - Who gave up Rehoboam to so foolish and fatal a mistake,
and alienated the peoples affections from him; and ordered all
circumstances by his wise providence to that end.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 12:16</span></span>

In David - In David's family and son; we can expect no benefit or relief
from him, and therefore we renounce all commerce with him, and
subjection to him. They named David, rather than Rehoboam; to signify,
that they renounced not Rehoboam only, but all David's family. Son of
Jesse - So they call David in contempt; as if they had said, Rehoboam
hath no reason to carry himself with such pride and contempt toward his
people; for if we trace his original, it was as mean and obscure as any
of ours. To your tents - Let us forsake him, and go to our own homes,
there to consider, how to provide for ourselves.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 12:17</span></span>

Judah - The tribe of Judah; with those parts of the tribes of Levi, and
Simeon, and Benjamin, whose dwellings were within the confines of Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 12:18</span></span>

Sent Adoram - Probably to pursue the counsel which he had resolved upon,
to execute his office, and exact their tribute with rigour and violence,
if need were.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 12:19</span></span>

Rebelled - Their revolt was sinful, as they did not this in compliance
with God's counsel, but to gratify their own passions.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 12:20</span></span>

Was come - From Egypt; which was known to them before who met at
Shechem, and now by all the people. Was none - That is, no entire tribe.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 12:24</span></span>

From me - This event is from my counsel and providence, to punish
Solomon's apostasy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 12:25</span></span>

Shechem - He repaired, and enlarged, and fortified it; for it had been
ruined long since, [Jdg 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md). He might
chuse it as a place both auspicious, because here the foundation of his
monarchy was laid; and commodious, as being near the frontiers of his
kingdom. Penuel - A place beyond Jordan; to secure that part of his
dominions.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 12:26</span></span>

Said, &c. - Reasoned within himself. The phrase discovers the fountain
of his error, that he did not consult with God, who had given him the
kingdom; as in all reason, and justice, and gratitude he should have
done: nor believed God's promise, [Kg1
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#038.md), but his own carnal policy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 12:27</span></span>

Will turn - Which in itself might seem a prudent conjecture; for this
would give Rehoboam, and the priests, and Levites, the sure and faithful
friends of David's house, many opportunities of alienating their minds
from him, and reducing them to their former allegiance. But considering
God's providence, by which the hearts of all men, and the affairs of all
kingdoms are governed, and of which he had lately seen so eminent an
instance; it was a foolish, as well as wicked course.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 12:28</span></span>

Calves - In imitation of Aaron's golden calf, and of the Egyptians, from
whom he was lately come. And this he the rather presumed to do, because
he knew the people of Israel were generally prone to idolatry: and that
Solomon's example had exceedingly strengthened those inclinations; and
therefore they were prepared for such an attempt; especially, when his
proposition tended to their own ease, and safety, and profit, which he
knew was much dearer to them, as well as to himself, than their
religion. Too much - Too great a trouble and charge, and neither
necessary, nor safe for them, as things now stood. Behold thy gods - Not
as if he thought to persuade the people, that these calves were that
very God of Israel, who brought them out of Egypt: which was so
monstrously absurd and ridiculous, that no Israelite in his right wits
could believe it, and had been so far from satisfying his people, that
this would have made him both hateful, and contemptible to them; but his
meaning was, that these Images were visible representations, by which he
designed to worship the true God of Israel, as appears, partly from that
parallel place, [Exo 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md), partly,
because the priests and worshippers of the calves, are said to worship
Jehovah; and upon that account, are distinguished from those belonging
to Baal, [Kg1 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md), [Kg1
22:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006.md), and partly, from Jeroboam's
design in this work, which was to quiet the peoples minds, and remove
their scruples about going to Jerusalem to worship their God in that
place, as they were commanded: which he doth, by signifying to them,
that he did not intend any alteration in the substance of their
religion; nor to draw them from the worship of the true God, to the
worship of any of those Baals, which were set up by Solomon; but to
worship that self - same God whom they worshipped in Jerusalem, even the
true God, who brought them out of Egypt; only to vary a circumstance:
and that as they worshipped God at Jerusalem, before one visible sign,
even the ark, and the sacred cherubim there; so his subjects should
worship God by another visible sign, even that of the calves, in other
places; and as for the change of the place, he might suggest to them,
that God was present in all places, where men with honest minds called
upon him; that before the temple was built, the best of kings, and
prophets, and people, did pray, and sacrifice to God in divers high
places, without any scruple. And that God would dispense with them also
in that matter; because going to Jerusalem was dangerous to them at this
time; and God would have mercy, rather than sacrifice.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 12:29</span></span>

Beth - el, &c. - Which two places he chose for his peoples conveniency;
Beth - el being in the southern, and Dan in the northern parts of his
kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 12:30</span></span>

A sin - That is, an occasion of great wickedness, not only of idolatry,
which is called sin by way of eminency; nor only of the worship of the
calves, wherein they pretended to worship the true God; but also of the
worship of Baal, and of the utter desertion of the true God; and of all
sorts of impiety. To Dan - Which is not here mentioned exclusively, for
they went also to Beth - el, [Kg1
12:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md), but for other reasons,
either because that of Dan was first made, the people in those parts
having been long leavened with idolatry, [Jdg
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030.md), or to shew the peoples
readiness and zeal for idols; that those who lived in, or near Beth -
el, had not patience to stay 'till that calf was finished, but all of
them were forward to go as far as Dan, which was in the utmost borders
of the land, to worship an idol there; when it was thought too much for
them to go to Jerusalem to worship God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 12:31</span></span>

An house - Houses, or chapels, besides the temples, which are built at
Dan and Beth - el; he built also for his peoples better accommodation,
lesser temples upon divers high places. Of the lowest - Which he might
do, either, because the better sort refused it, or, because such would
be satisfied with mean allowances; and so he could put into his own
purse a great part of the revenues of the Levites, which doubtless he
seized upon when they forsook him, and went to Jerusalem, [Ch2
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#013.md), or, because mean persons
would depend upon his favour, and therefore be pliable to his humour,
and firm to his interest, but the words in the Hebrew properly signify,
from the ends of the people; which may be translated thus, out of all
the people; promiscuously out of every tribe. Which exposition seems to
be confirmed by the following words, added to explain these, which were
not of the sons of Levi; though they were not of the tribe of Levi. And
that indeed was Jeroboam's sin; not that he chose mean persons, for some
of the Levites were such; and his sin had not been less, if he had
chosen the noblest and greatest persons; as we see in the example of
Uzziah. But that he chose men of other tribes, contrary to God's
appointment, which restrained that office to that tribe. Levi - To whom
that office was confined by God's express command.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 12:32</span></span>

A feast - The feast of tabernacles. So he would keep God's feast, not in
God's time, which was the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and so
onward, [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md), but on the
fifteenth day of the eighth month. And this alteration he made, either,
to keep up the difference between his subjects, and those of Judah as by
the differing manners, so by the distinct times of their worship. Or,
lest he should seem directly to oppose the God of Israel, (who had in a
special manner obliged all the people to go up to Jerusalem at that
time,) by requiring their attendance to celebrate the feast elsewhere,
at the same time. Or, to engage as many persons as possibly he could, to
come to his feast; which they would more willingly do when the feast at
Jerusalem was past and all the fruits of the earth were perfectly
gathered in. Fifteenth day - And so onward till the seven days ended.
Like that in Judah - He took his pattern thence, to shew, that he
worshipped the same God, and professed the same religion for substance,
which they did: howsoever he differed in circumstances. He offered -
Either, by his priests. Or, rather, by his own hands; as appears from
[Kg1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md), [Kg1
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#004.md), which he did, to give the more
countenance to his new - devised solemnity. Nor is this strange; for he
might plausibly think, that he who by his own authority had made others
priests might much more exercise a part of that office; at least, upon
an extraordinary occasion; in which case, he knew David himself had done
some things, which otherwise he might not do. So he did - He himself did
offer there in like manner, as he now had done at Dan.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 12:33</span></span>

Devised - Which he appointed without any warrant from God.
