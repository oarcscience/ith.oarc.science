### [Romans Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md)

[Romans 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 2:1</span></span>

Therefore - The apostle now makes a transition from the gentiles to the
Jews, till, at [Rom 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md), he comprises
both. Thou art inexcusable - Seeing knowledge without practice only
increases guilt. O man - Having before spoken of the gentile in the
third person, he addresses the Jew in the second person. But he calls
him by a common appellation, as not acknowledging him to be a Jew. See
verses [Rom 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), [Rom
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md). Whosoever thou art that judgest
- Censurest, condemnest. For in that thou judgest the other - The
heathen. Thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest the same things - In
effect; in many instances.

[Romans 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 2:2</span></span>

For we know - Without thy teaching That the judgment of God - Not thine,
who exceptest thyself from its sentence. Is according to truth - Is
just, making no exception, [Rom 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md),
[Rom 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md); and reaches the heart as
well as the life, [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md).

[Romans 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 2:3</span></span>

That thou shalt escape - Rather than the gentile.

[Romans 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 2:4</span></span>

Or despisest thou - Dost thou go farther still, - from hoping to escape
his wrath, to the abuse of his love?. The riches - The abundance. Of his
goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering - Seeing thou both hast sinned,
dost sin, and wilt sin. All these are afterwards comprised in the single
word goodness. Leadeth thee - That is, is designed of God to lead or
encourage thee to it.

[Romans 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 2:5</span></span>

Treasurest up wrath - Although thou thinkest thou art treasuring up all
good things. O what a treasure may a man lay up either way, in this
short day of life! To thyself - Not to him whom thou judgest. In the day
of wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God - Just opposite
to "the goodness and forbearance and longsuffering" of God. When God
shall be revealed, then shall also be "revealed" the secrets of men's
hearts, [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md). Forbearance and
revelation respect God, and are opposed to each other; longsuffering and
righteous judgment respect the sinner; goodness and wrath are words of a
more general import.

[Romans 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 2:6</span></span>

[Pro 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#012.md)

[Romans 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 2:7</span></span>

To them that seek for glory - For pure love does not exclude faith,
hope, desire, [Co1 15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058.md).

[Romans 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 2:8</span></span>

But to them that are contentious - Like thee, O Jew, who thus fightest
against God. The character of a false Jew is disobedience, stubbornness,
impatience. Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish - Alluding to
[Psa 78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md), "He cast upon them," the
Egyptians. "the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and
trouble;" and finely intimating, that the Jews would in the day of
vengeance be more severely punished than even the Egyptians were when
God made their plagues so wonderful.

[Romans 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 2:9</span></span>

Of the Jew first - Here we have the first express mention of the Jews in
this chapter. And it is introduced with great propriety. Their having
been trained up in the true religion, and having had Christ and his
apostles first sent to them, will place them in the foremost rank of the
criminals that obey not the truth.

[Romans 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 2:10</span></span>

But glory - Just opposite to "wrath," from the divine approbation.
Honour - Opposite to "indignation," by the divine appointment; and peace
now and for ever, opposed to tribulation and anguish.

[Romans 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 2:11</span></span>

For there is no respect of persons with God - He will reward every one
according to his works. But this is well consistent with his
distributing advantages and opportunities of improvement, according to
his own good pleasure.

[Romans 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 2:12</span></span>

For as many as have sinned - He speaks as of the time past, for all time
will be past at the day of judgment. Without the law - Without having
any written law. Shall also perish without the law - Without regard had
to any outward law; being condemned by the law written in their hearts.
The word also shows the agreement of the manner of sinning, with the
manner of suffering. Perish - He could not so properly say, Shall be
judged without the law.

[Romans 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 2:13</span></span>

For not the hearers of the law are, even now, just before God, but the
doers of the law shall be justified - Finally acquitted and rewarded a
most sure and important truth, which respects the gentiles also, though
principally the Jews. St. Paul speaks of the former, [Rom
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md), &c.; of the latter, [Rom
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), &c. Here is therefore no
parenthesis; for [Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md) also
depends on [Rom 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md), not on [Rom
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md).

[Romans 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 2:14</span></span>

For when the gentiles - That is, any of them. St. Paul, having refuted
the perverse judgment of the Jews concerning the heathens, proceeds to
show the just judgment of God against them. He now speaks directly of
the heathens, in order to convince the heathens. Yet the concession he
makes to these serves more strongly to convince the Jews. Do by nature -
That is, without an outward rule; though this also, strictly speaking,
is by preventing grace. The things contained in the law - The ten
commandments being only the substance of the law of nature. These, not
having the written law, are a law unto themselves - That is, what the
law is to the Jews, they are, by the grace of God, to themselves;
namely, a rule of life.

[Romans 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 2:15</span></span>

Who show - To themselves, to other men, and, in a sense, to God himself.
The work of the law - The substance, though not the letter, of it.
Written on their hearts - By the same hand which wrote the commandments
on the tables of stone. Their conscience - There is none of all its
faculties which the soul has less in its power than this. Bearing
witness - In a trial there are the plaintiff, the defendant, and the
witnesses. Conscience and sin itself are witnesses against the heathens.
Their thoughts sometimes excuse, sometimes condemn, them. Among
themselves - Alternately, like plaintiff and defendant. Accusing or even
defending them - The very manner of speaking shows that they have far
more room to accuse than to defend.

[Romans 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 2:16</span></span>

In the day - That is, who show this in the day. Everything will then be
shown to be what it really is. In that day will appear the law written
in their hearts as it often does in the present life. When God shall
judge the secrets of men - On secret circumstances depends the real
quality of actions, frequently unknown to the actors themselves, [Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md). Men generally form their
judgments, even of themselves merely from what is apparent. According to
my gospel - According to the tenor of that gospel which is committed to
my care. Hence it appears that the gospel also is a law.

[Romans 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 2:17</span></span>

But if thou art called a Jew - This highest point of Jewish glorying,
after a farther description of it interposed, [Rom
2:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), and refuted, [Rom
2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md), is itself refuted, [Rom
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md), &c. The description consists of
twice five articles; of which the former five, [Rom
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017.md), show what he boasts of in
himself; the other five, [Rom 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019.md),
what he glories in with respect to others. The first particular of the
former five answers to the first of the latter; the second, to the
second, and so on. And restest in the law - Dependest on it, though it
can only condemn thee. And gloriest in God - As thy God; and that, too,
to the exclusion of others.

[Romans 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 2:19</span></span>

Blind, in darkness, ignorant, babes - These were the titles which the
Jews generally gave the gentiles.

[Romans 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 2:20</span></span>

Having the form of knowledge and truth - That is, the most accurate
knowledge of the truth.

[Romans 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 2:21</span></span>

Thou dost not teach thyself - He does not teach himself who does not
practise what he teaches. Dost thou steal, commit adultery, commit
sacrilege - Sin grievously against thy neighbour, thyself, God. St. Paul
had shown the gentiles, first their sins against God, then against
themselves, then against their neighbours. He now inverts the order: for
sins against God are the most glaring in an heathen, but not in a Jew.
Thou that abhorrest idols - Which all the Jews did, from the time of the
Babylonish captivity. Thou committest sacrilege - Doest what is worse,
robbing Him "who is God over all" of the glory which is due to him. None
of these charges were rashly advanced against the Jews of that age; for,
as their own historian relates, some even of the priests lived by
rapine, and others in gross uncleanness. And as for sacrilegiously
robbing God and his altar, it had been complained of ever since Malachi;
so that the instances are given with great propriety and judgment.

[Romans 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 2:24</span></span>

[Isa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md)

[Romans 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 2:25</span></span>

Circumcision indeed profiteth - He does not say, justifies. How far it
profited is shown in the third and fourth chapters. Thy circumcision is
become uncircumcision - is so already in effect. Thou wilt have no more
benefit by it than if thou hadst never received it. The very same
observation holds with regard to baptism.

[Romans 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 2:26</span></span>

If the uncircumcision - That is, a person uncircumcised. Keep the law -
Walk agreeably to it. Shall not his uncircumcision be counted for
circumcision - In the sight of God?

[Romans 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 2:27</span></span>

Yea, the uncircumcision that is by nature - Those who are, literally
speaking, uncircumcised. Fulfilling the law - As to the substance of it.
Shall judge thee - Shall condemn thee in that day. Who by the letter and
circumcision - Who having the bare, literal, external circumcision,
transgressest the law.

[Romans 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 2:28</span></span>

For he is not a Jew - In the most important sense, that is, one of God's
beloved people. Who is one in outward show only; neither is that the
true, acceptable circumcision, which is apparent in the flesh.

[Romans 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 2:29</span></span>

But he is a Jew - That is, one of God's people. Who is one inwardly - In
the secret recesses of his soul. And the acceptable circumcision is that
of the heart - Referring to [Deu 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md);
the putting away all inward impurity. This is seated in the spirit, the
inmost soul, renewed by the Spirit of God. And not in the letter - Not
in the external ceremony. Whose praise is not from men, but from God -
The only searcher of the heart.
