### [Genesis Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 41:8</span></span>

His spirit was troubled - It cannot but put us into a concern to receive
any extraordinary message from heaven. And his magicians were puzzled;
the rules of their art failed them; these dreams of Pharaoh did not fall
within the compass of them. This was to make Joseph's performance by the
Spirit of God the more admirable.

[Genesis 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 41:9</span></span>

I remember my faults this day - in forgetting Joseph. Some think he
means his faults against Pharaoh, for which he was imprisoned, and then
he would insinuate, that through Pharaoh had forgiven him, he had not
forgiven himself. God's time for the enlargement of his people will
appear, at last, to be the fittest time. If the chief butler had at
first used his interest for Joseph's enlargement, and had obtained, it
is probable, he would have gone back to the land of the Hebrews, and
then he had neither been so blessed himself, nor such a blessing to his
family. But staying two years longer, and coming out upon this occasion
to interpret the king's dreams, way was made for his preferment. The
king can scarce allow him time, but that decency required it, to shave
himself, and to change his raiment, [Gen
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#014.md). It is done with all possible
expedition, and Joseph is brought in perhaps almost as much surprised as
Peter was, [Act 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#009.md), so suddenly is
his captivity brought back, that he is as one that dreams, [Psa
126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md). Pharaoh immediately, without
enquiring who or whence he was tells him his business, that he expected
he should interpret his dream.

[Genesis 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 41:16</span></span>

(1.) He gives honour to God; It is not in me; God must give it. Great
gifts then appear most graceful and illustrious, when those that have
them use them humbly, and take not the praise of them to themselves, but
give it to God, (2.) He shews respect to Pharaoh, and hearty good - will
to him, supposing that the interpretation would be an answer of peace.
Those that consult God's oracles may expect an answer of peace.

[Genesis 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 41:29</span></span>

See the goodness of God, in sending the seven years of plenty before
those of famine, that provision might be made accordingly. How wonderful
wisely has Providence, that great house - keeper, ordered the affairs of
this numerous family from the beginning! Great variety of seasons there
have been and the produce of the earth sometimes more, and sometimes
less; yet take one time with another, what was miraculous concerning the
manna, is ordinarily verified in the common course of Providence; He
that gathers much has nothing over, and he that gathers little has no
lack, [Exo 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018.md).

[Genesis 41:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">gen 41:30</span></span>

See the perishing nature of our worldly enjoyments. The great increase
of the years of plenty was quite lost and swallowed up in the years of
famine; and the overplus of it, which seemed very much, yet did but just
serve to keep men alive.

[Genesis 41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">gen 41:44</span></span>

Without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot - All the affairs of
the kingdom must pass through his hand. Only in the throne will I be
greater than thou - It is probable there were those about court that
opposed Joseph's preferment, which occasioned Pharaoh so oft to repeat
the grant, and with that solemn sanction, I am Pharaoh. He gave him his
own ring as a ratification of his commission, and in token of peculiar
favour; or it was like delivering him the great seal. He put fine
clothes upon him instead of his prison garments, and adorned him with a
chain of gold. He made him ride in the second chariot next his own, and
ordered all to do obeisance to him, as to Pharaoh himself; he gave him a
new name and such a name as spoke the value he had for him, Zaphnath -
paaneah, a Revealer of secrets. He married him honourably to a prince's
daughter. Where God had been liberal in giving wisdom and other merits,
Pharaoh was not sparing in conferring honours. Now this preferment of
Joseph, was, 1st, an abundant recompense for his innocent and patient
suffering, a lasting instance of the equity and goodness of providence,
and an encouragement to all to trust in a good God. 2dly, It was typical
of the exaltation of Christ, that great revealer of secrets, ([Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018),.md) or as some translate Joseph's
new name, the Saviour of the world. The brightest glories of the upper
world are upon him, the highest trusts lodged in his hand, and all power
given him both in heaven and earth. He is gatherer, keeper, and disposer
of all the stores of divine grace, and chief ruler of the kingdom of God
among men. The work of ministers is to cry before him; Bow the knee;
kiss the Son.

[Genesis 41:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">gen 41:50</span></span>

Two sons - In the names he gave them, he owned the divine Providence
giving this happy turn to his affairs. He was made to forget his misery,
but could he be so unnatural as to forget all his father's house? And he
was made fruitful in the land of his affliction. It had been the land of
his affliction, and, in some sense, it was still so, for his distance
from his father was still his affliction. Ephraim signifies
fruitfulness, and Manasseh forgetfulness.

[Genesis 41:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">gen 41:54</span></span>

The seven years of dearth began to come - Not only in Egypt, but in
other lands, in all lands, that is, all the neighbouring countries.
