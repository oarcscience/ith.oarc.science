### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 21:1</span></span>

Nob - A city of priests, where the tabernacle now was. Hither David
resorted, for a supply of his necessities, which he supposed he might
receive here, without danger of being betrayed into Saul's hands: and
principally, that in this great distress, he might receive comfort and
counsel from the Lord. Ahimelech - The chief priest, brother to that
Ahiah, [Sa1 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), and he being now
dead, his successor in the priesthood, for they were both sons of
Ahitub. Was afraid - Suspecting some extraordinary cause of his coming
in such a manner. Alone - For though David had some servants as is
manifest from [Sa1 21:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md), whom
Jonathan probably had sent to a place appointed, yet they were left at
another place: as David himself affirmeth, [Sa1
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md). And David was now alone, as also
he was when he fled to Achish. He who had been suddenly advanced to the
highest honour, is as soon reduced to the desolate conditions of an
exile. Such changes are there in this world, and so uncertain are its
smiles.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 21:2</span></span>

The king, &c. - This seems to be a plain lie extorted from him, by fear.
But it was pernicious to all the priests there. Whence David afterwards
declares his repentance for this sin of lying, [Psa
119:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029.md). To such a place - To a certain
place which it not convenient now to mention; because the whole business
requires concealment.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 21:4</span></span>

There is, &c. - Here in the tabernacle: though doubtless he had other
provisions is his house; but David was in great haste, and in fear of
Doeg whom he saw, and knew and therefore would not stay 'till any thing
could be fetched thence. There was a double impediment to the giving
this bread to them; Its sacredness in itself; which the priest implies,
and David answers [Sa1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md), and the
priest was satisfied therein by David's great necessities. The
abstinence from all women, which he supposed should be in those that use
it; concerning which he now enquires. And though he mentions this only
concerning David's young men, and out of reverence forbears to name him;
yet he is also included in the number, as David's answer shews.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 21:5</span></span>

Three days - As long as the law required, [Exo
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015.md). And so long David, and his men
hid, it seems, hid themselves for fear of Saul, whereby they were kept
both from women: and from food convenient for them. Vessels - That is,
Either, Their garments, or other utensils for their journey. Or their
bodies. The bread - Heb. and this bread; is in a manner common: that is,
considering the time, and our necessity, this maybe used in a manner,
like common bread. For though for a season while it is to stand before
the Lord, it be so holy, that the priest himself might not eat it; yet
afterwards it is eaten by the priest, and his whole family, and so it
may be by us, in our circumstances. Tho' it were - But newly put into
the vessel, it must give place to the great law of necessity, and
charity; because God will have mercy preferred before sacrifice.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 21:7</span></span>

Detained - Not by force but by his choice; he fixed his abode there for
that day; either because it was the sabbath - day; on which he might not
proceed in his journey, or for the discharge of some vow. Before the
Lord - That is, at the tabernacle. An Edomite - By birth, but he was
proselyted to the Jewish religion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 21:9</span></span>

Ephod - That is, behind that holy place allotted for the keeping of the
sacred, or priestly garments; all which are here comprehended under the
ephod; which, as the chief is put for all the rest. Here it was laid up
as a sacred monument of God's power and goodness. None like it - Because
it not only served him for his use, for he was a strong and tall man,
and one that could wield that sword, but was also a pledge of God's
favour to him. Whenever be looked upon it, it would be a support to his
faith, by reminding him of what God had already done.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 21:10</span></span>

To Achish - A strange action; but it must be considered, that Saul's
rage was so great, his power also, and diligence in hunting after him
that he despaired of escaping any other way: and a desperate disease,
produceth a desperate remedy. The king elect is here an exile: anointed
to the crown, and yet forced to run his country. So do God's providences
sometimes run counter to his promises, for the trial of our faith, and
the glorifying his name in accomplishing his counsels, notwithstanding
the difficulties that lie in the way.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 21:11</span></span>

King of the land - Of Canaan. They call him king, either more generally
for the governor, the most eminent captain and commander, or, as the
king elect, the person designed to be king: for, by this time, the fame
of Saul's rejection, and David's destination to the kingdom, was got
abroad among the Israelites, and from them, probably to the Philistines.
Did they not sing, &c. - And therefore consider what to do; and now our
great enemy is in thy hand, be sure thou never let him go alive.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 21:12</span></span>

Was afraid - Lest either their revenge or policy should prompt them to
kill him. Perhaps he was the more apprehensive, because he wore
Goliath's sword, which was probably well known at Gath. He now learned
by experience what he afterward taught us, [Psa
118:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#009.md). It is better to trust in the
Lord, than to put any confidence in princes.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 21:15</span></span>

Mad men - It is highly probable, Achish was aware, that this madness was
counterfeit. But being desirous to preserve David, he speaks as if he
thought it real.
