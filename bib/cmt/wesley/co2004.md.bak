### [2 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 4:1</span></span>

Therefore having this ministry - Spoken of, [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md). As we have received mercy - Have
been mercifully supported in all our trials. We faint not - We desist
not in any degree from our glorious enterprise.

[2 Corinthians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 4:2</span></span>

But have renounced - Set at open defiance. The hidden things of shame -
All things which men need to hide, or to be ashamed of. Not walking in
craftiness - Using no disguise, subtlety, guile. Nor privily corrupting
the pure word of God - By any additions or alterations, or by attempting
to accommodate it to the taste of the hearers.

[2 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 4:3</span></span>

But if our gospel also - As well as the law of Moses.

[2 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 4:4</span></span>

The God of this world - What a sublime and horrible description of
Satan! He is indeed the god of all that believe not, and works in them
with inconceivable energy. Hath blinded - Not only veiled, the eye of
their understanding. Illumination - Is properly the reflection or
propagation of light, from those who are already enlightened, to others.
Who is the image of God - Hence also we may understand how great is the
glory of Christ. He that sees the Son, sees the Father in the face of
Christ. The Son exactly exhibits the Father to us.

[2 Corinthians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 4:5</span></span>

For - The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us.
We preach not ourselves - As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or
sanctify you. But Jesus Christ - As your only wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification. And ourselves your servants - Ready to do the meanest
offices. For Jesus' sake - Not for honour, interest, or pleasure.

[2 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 4:6</span></span>

For God hath shined in our hearts - The hearts of all those whom the god
of this world no longer blinds. God who is himself our light; not only
the author of light, but also the fountain of it. To enlighten us with
the knowledge of the glory of God - Of his glorious love, and of his
glorious image. In the face of Jesus Christ - Which reflects his glory
in another manner than the face of Moses did.

[2 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 4:7</span></span>

But we - Not only the apostles, but all true believers. Have this
treasure - Of divine light, love, glory. In earthen vessels - In frail,
feeble, perishing bodies. He proceeds to show, that afflictions, yea,
death itself, are so far from hindering the ministration of the Spirit,
that they even further it, sharpen the ministers, and increase the
fruit. That the excellence of the power, which works these in us, may
undeniably appear to be of God.

[2 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 4:8</span></span>

We are troubled, &c. - The four articles in this verse respect inward,
the four in the next outward, afflictions. In each clause the former
part shows the "earthen vessels;" the latter, "the excellence of the
power." Not crushed - Not swallowed up in care and anxiety. Perplexed -
What course to take, but never despairing of his power and love to carry
us through.

[2 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 4:10</span></span>

Always - Wherever we go. Bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord
Jesus - Continually expecting to lay down our lives like him. That the
life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body - That we may also
rise and be glorified like him.

[2 Corinthians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 4:11</span></span>

For we who yet live - Who are not yet killed for the testimony of Jesus.
Are always delivered unto death - Are perpetually in the very jaws of
destruction; which we willingly submit to, that we may "obtain a better
resurrection."

[2 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 4:12</span></span>

So then death worketh in us, but life in you - You live in peace; we die
daily. Yet - Living or dying, so long as we believe, we cannot but
speak.

[2 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 4:13</span></span>

Having the same spirit of faith - Which animated the saints of old;
David, in particular, when he said, I believed, and therefore have I
spoken - That is, I trusted in God, and therefore he hath put this song
of praise in my mouth. We also speak - We preach the gospel, even in the
midst of affliction and death, because we believe that God will raise us
up from the dead, and will present us, ministers, with you, all his
members, "faultless before his presence with exceeding joy." [Psa
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md).

[2 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 4:15</span></span>

For all things - Whether adverse or prosperous. Are for your sakes - For
the profit of all that believe, as well as all that preach. That the
overflowing grace - Which continues you alive both in soul and body.
Might abound yet more through the thanksgiving of many - For
thanksgiving invites more: abundant grace.

[2 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 4:16</span></span>

Therefore - Because of this grace, we faint not. The outward man - The
body. The inward man - The soul.

[2 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 4:17</span></span>

Our light affliction - The beauty and sublimity of St. Paul's
expressions here, as descriptive of heavenly glory, opposed to temporal
afflictions, surpass all imagination, and cannot be preserved in any
translation or paraphrase, which after all must sink infinitely below
the astonishing original.

[2 Corinthians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 4:18</span></span>

The things that are seen - Men, money, things of earth. The things that
are not seen - God, grace, heaven.
