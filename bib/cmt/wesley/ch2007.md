### [2 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 7:1</span></span>

The fire &c. - In token of God's acceptance of his prayer. The surest
evidence of God's acceptance of our prayers is the descent of his holy
fire upon us. As a farther token that God accepted Solomon's prayer, the
glory of the Lord filled the house; the heart that is filled with an
holy awe and reverence of the divine glory, to which God manifests his
greatness, and (which is no less his glory) his goodness, is thereby
owned as a living temple.

[2 Chronicles 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 7:3</span></span>

With their faces - Thus expressing their awful dread of the Divine
Majesty, their chearful submission to the Divine authority, and the
sense they had of their utter unworthiness to enter into his presence.
Upon - The cloud first came down upon the house, and then entered into
the house, and was seen both within it by the priests, and without it by
the people.

[2 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 7:6</span></span>

David praised - For David composed the psalms or hymns, and appointed
them to be sung by the Levites, and instrumental music to be joined to
their voices.

[2 Chronicles 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 7:16</span></span>

This house - There will I make myself known, and there will I be called
upon.
