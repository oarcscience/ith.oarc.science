### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

I said - Being disappointed of my hopes from knowledge, I resolved to
try another course. Go to - O my soul! I will try whether I cannot make
thee happy, by the enjoyment of sensual delights. Vanity - Is vain, and
unable to make men happy.

[Ecclesiastes 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 2:2</span></span>

It is mad - This is an act of madness, more fit for fools who know
nothing, than for wise men in this sinful, and dangerous, and deplorable
state of mankind. What doth it - What good doth it? Or how can it make
men happy? I challenge all the Epicures in the world to give me a solid
answer.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

To wine - To gratify myself with delicious meats and drinks. Yet - Yet
resolving to use my wisdom, that I might try whether I could not arrive
at satisfaction, by mixing wine and wisdom together. To lay hold - To
pursue sensual pleasures, which was my folly. 'Till - 'Till I might find
out the true way to contentment and satisfaction, during this mortal
life.

[Ecclesiastes 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 2:6</span></span>

The wood - The nurseries of young trees, which for the multitude of them
were like a wood or forest.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

Peculiar treasure - The greatest jewels and rarities of other kings,
which they gave to me, either as a tribute, or by way of present. Of
provinces - Which were imposed upon or presented by all the provinces of
my dominions.

[Ecclesiastes 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 2:9</span></span>

Great - In riches, and power, and glory. My wisdom remained - As yet I
was not wholly seduced from God.

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

And - Whatsoever was grateful to my senses. Rejoiced - I had the comfort
of all my labours, and was not hindered from the full enjoyment of them
by sickness or war, or any other calamity. My portion - This present
enjoyment of them, was all the benefit which I could expect from all my
labours. So that I made the best of them.

[Ecclesiastes 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 2:11</span></span>

Vexation - I found myself wholly dissatisfied. No profit - The pleasure
was past, and I was never the better for it, but as empty as before.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

I turned - Being frustrated of my hopes in pleasure, I returned to a
second consideration of my first choice, to see whether there was not
more satisfaction to be gotten from wisdom, than I discovered at my
first view. Done - As by others, so especially by myself. They can make
no new discoveries as to this point. They can make no more of the
pleasures of sense than I have done. Let me then try once more, whether
wisdom can give happiness.

[Ecclesiastes 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 2:13</span></span>

I saw - I allowed thus much. Although wisdom is not sufficient to make
men happy, yet it is of a far greater use than vain pleasures, or any
other follies.

[Ecclesiastes 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 2:14</span></span>

Head - In their proper place. He hath the use of his eyes and reason,
and foresees, and so avoids many dangers and mischiefs. Yet -
Notwithstanding this excellency of wisdom above folly, at last they both
come to one end. Both are subject to the same calamities, and to death
itself, which takes away all difference between them.

[Ecclesiastes 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 2:15</span></span>

Why - What benefit have I by my wisdom?

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

For - Their memory, though it may flourish for a season, yet will in a
little time be worn out; as we see it, most of the wise men of former
ages, whose very names, together with all their monuments, are utterly
lost. As the fool - He must die as certainly as the fool.

[Ecclesiastes 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 2:17</span></span>

Life - My life was a burden to me. Is grievous - All human designs and
works are so far from yielding me satisfaction, that the consideration
of them increases my discontent.

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

All my labour - All these riches and buildings, and other fruits of my
labour, were aggravations of my misery. Because - Because I must, and
that everlastingly, leave them all behind me.

[Ecclesiastes 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 2:19</span></span>

Or a fool - Who will undo all that I have done, and turn the effects of
my wisdom into instruments of his folly. Some think he had such an
opinion of Rehoboam.

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

Despair - I gave myself up to despair of ever reaping that satisfaction
which I promised to myself.

[Ecclesiastes 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 2:21</span></span>

Wisdom - Who uses great industry, and prudence, and justice too, in the
use and management of his affairs. To a man - Who has spent his days in
sloth and folly. A great evil - A great disorder in itself, and a great
torment to a considering mind.

[Ecclesiastes 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 2:22</span></span>

For what - What comfort or benefit remains to any man after this short
and frail life is once ended?

[Ecclesiastes 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 2:23</span></span>

Sorrows - Full of sorrows. Tho' he took great and unwearied pains all
his days, yet the toils of his body were accompanied with vexation of
mind. His heart - Because his sleep was broken with perplexing cares.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

Enjoy - That he should thankfully take, and freely and chearfully enjoy
the comforts which God gives him. It was - A singular gift of God.

[Ecclesiastes 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 2:25</span></span>

More than I - Therefore he could best tell whether they were able of
themselves, without God's special gift, to yield a man content, in the
enjoying of them. Who can pursue them with more diligence, obtain them
with more readiness, or embrace them with more greediness?

[Ecclesiastes 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 2:26</span></span>

Wisdom - To direct him how to use his comforts aright; that so they may
be blessings, and not curses to him. Joy - A thankful contented mind. To
heap up - He giveth him up to insatiable desires, and wearisome labours,
that he may leave it to others, yea to such as he least desired, to good
and virtuous men.
