### [Genesis Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 47:3</span></span>

What is your occupation? - Pharaoh takes it for granted they had
something to do. All that have a place in the world should have an
employment in it according to their capacity, some occupation or other.
Those that need not work for their bread, yet must have something to do
to keep them from idleness.

[Genesis 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 47:4</span></span>

To sojourn in the land are we cane - Not to settle there for ever; only
to sojourn, while the famine prevailed so in Canaan, which lay high,
that it was not habitable for shepherds, the grass being burnt up much
more than in Egypt, which lay low, and where the corn chiefly failed,
but there was tolerable good pasture.

[Genesis 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 47:8</span></span>

How old art thou? - A question usually put to old men, for it is natural
to us to admire old age, and to reverence it. Jacob's countenance no
doubt shewed him to be old, for be had been a man of labour and sorrow.
In Egypt people were not so long - lived as in Canaan, and therefore
Pharaoh looks upon Jacob with wonder.

[Genesis 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 47:9</span></span>

Observe Jacob calls his life a pilgrimage, looking upon himself as a
stranger in this world, and a traveller towards another. He reckoned
himself not only a pilgrim now he was in Egypt, a strange country in
which he never was before, but his life even in the land of his nativity
was a pilgrimage. He reckoned his life by days; for even so it is soon
reckoned, and we are not sure of the continuance of it for a day to an
end, but may be turned out of this tabernacle at less than an hours
warning. The character he gives of them was, That they were few. Though
he had now lived 130 years, they seemed to him but as a few days, in
comparison of the days of eternity, in which a thousand years are but as
one day; That they were evil. This is true concerning man in general,
[Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md), he is of few days and full
of trouble: Jacob's life particularly had been made up of evil days. the
pleasantest days of his life were yet before him. That they were short
of the days of his fathers; not so many, not so pleasant as their days.
Old age came sooner upon him than it had done upon some of his
ancestors.

[Genesis 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 47:10</span></span>

And Jacob blessed Pharaoh - Which was not only an act of civility but an
act of piety; he prayed for him, as one having the authority of a
prophet and a patriarch: and a patriarch's blessing was not a thing to
be despised, no not by a potent prince.

[Genesis 47:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 47:21</span></span>

He removed them to cities - He transplanted them, to shew Pharaoh's
sovereign power over them, and that they might, in time, forget their
titles to their lands, and be the easier reconciled to their new
condition of servitude. How hard soever this seems to have been upon
them, they themselves were sensible of it as a great kindness, and were
thankful they were not worse used.

[Genesis 47:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 47:28</span></span>

Jacob lived seventeen years after he came into Egypt, far beyond his own
expectation: seventeen years he had nourished Joseph, for so old he was
when he was sold from him, and now, seventeen years Joseph nourished
him. Observe how kindly Providence ordered Jacob's affairs; that when he
was old, and least able to bear care and fatigue, he had least occasion
for it, being well provided for by his son without his own forecast.

[Genesis 47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 47:29</span></span>

And the time drew nigh that Israel must die - Israel, that had power
over the angel, and prevailed, yet must yield to death. He died by
degrees; his candle was not blown out, but gradually burnt down, so that
he saw, at some distance, the time drawing nigh. He would be buried in
Canaan, not because Canaan was the land of his nativity, but in faith,
because it was the land of promise, which he desired thus, as it were to
keep possession of 'till the time should come when his posterity should
be masters of it: and because it was a type of heaven, that better
country, which he was in expectation of. When this was done, Israel
bowed himself upon the bed's head - Worshipping God, as it is explained,
[Heb 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md), giving God thanks for all
his favours, and particularly for this, that Joseph was ready, to put
his hand upon his eyes. Thus they that go down to the dust should, with
humble thankfulness, bow before God, the God of their mercies.
