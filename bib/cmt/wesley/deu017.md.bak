------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Deuteronomy Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 17:1</span></span>

Bullock or sheep - Either greater or smaller sacrifices, all being
comprehended under the two most eminent kinds.

[Deuteronomy 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 17:2</span></span>

ln transressing his covenant - That is, in idolatry, as it is explained
[Deu 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md), which is called a
transgression of God's covenant made with Israel, both because it is a
breach of their faith given to God and of that law which they covenanted
to keep; and because it is a dissolution of that matrimonial covenant
with God, a renouncing of God and his worship, and a chusing other Gods.

[Deuteronomy 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 17:3</span></span>

The host of heaven - Those glorious creatures, which are to be admired
as the wonderful works of God, but not to be set up in God's stead. By
condemning the most specious of all idolaters, he intimates, how absurd
a thing it is to worship stocks and stones, the works of men's hands. I
have not commanded - That is, I have forbidden. Such negative
expressions are emphatical.

[Deuteronomy 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 17:6</span></span>

Witnesses - Namely, credible and competent witnesses. The Jews rejected
the testimonies of children, women, servants, familiar friends or
enemies, persons of dissolute lives or evil fame.

[Deuteronomy 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 17:7</span></span>

First upon him - God thus ordered it, for the caution of witnesses,
that, if they had thro' malice or wrath accused him falsely, they might
now be afraid to imbrue their hands in innocent blood; and for the
security and satisfaction of the people in the execution of this
punishment.

[Deuteronomy 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 17:8</span></span>

For thee - He speaks to the inferior magistrates, who were erected in
several cities. If thou hast not skill to determine, between blood and
blood - That is, in capital causes. Between plea and plea - In civil
causes, about words or estates. Between stroke and stroke - In criminal
causes, concerning blows, or wounds inflicted by one man upon another.
Matters of controversy - That is, such things being doubtful, and the
magistrates divided in their opinions about it. Chuse - Namely to set up
his tabernacle, or temple there; because there was the abode, both of
their sanhedrim, which was constituted of priests and civil magistrates,
and of the high - priests, who were to consult God by Urim, in matters
which could not be decided otherwise.

[Deuteronomy 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 17:9</span></span>

Unto the priests - That is, unto the great council, which consisted
chiefly of the priests and Levites, as being the best expositors of the
laws of God, by which all those controversies were to be decided. And
the high - priest was commonly one of that number, understood here under
the priests, whereof be was the chief. The judge - Probably the high -
priest, to whom it belonged to determine, some at least, of those
controversies, and to expound the law of God. And he may be distinctly
named, tho' he be one of the priests, because of his eminency, and to
shew that amongst the priests, he especially was to be consulted in such
cases. The sentence of judgment - Heb. The word, or matter of judgement,
that is, the true state of the cause, and what judgment or sentence
ought to be given in it.

[Deuteronomy 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 17:10</span></span>

Thou - Thou shalt pass sentence: he speaks to the inferior magistrates;
who were to give sentence, and came hither to be advised about it.

[Deuteronomy 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 17:11</span></span>

Thou shalt do - In particular suits between man and man, altho' the
judge be hereby confined to his rule in giving the sentence, yet it
seems but fit and reasonable that people should be bound simply to
acquiesce in the sentence of their last and highest judge, or else there
would have been no end of strife.

[Deuteronomy 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 17:12</span></span>

Do presumptuously - That will proudly and obstinately oppose the
sentence given against him. The evil - The evil thing, that scandal,
that pernicious example.

[Deuteronomy 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 17:13</span></span>

When thou shalt - He only foresees and foretells what they would do, but
doth not approve of it. Yea when they did this thing for this very
reason, he declares his utter dislike of it, [Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007.md).

[Deuteronomy 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 17:15</span></span>

Thy God shall chuse - Approve of, or appoint. So it was in Saul and
David. God reserved to himself the nomination both of the family, and of
the person. Thy brethren - Of the same nation and religion; because such
a person was most likely to maintain true religion, and to rule with
righteousness, gentleness, and kindness to his subjects; and that he
might be a fit type of Christ their supreme king, who was to be one of
their brethren.

[Deuteronomy 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 17:16</span></span>

He shall not multiply horses - Tho' he might have horses for his own
use, yet he was not to have many horses for his officers and guard, much
less for war, lest he should trust in them. The multiplying horses is
also forbidden, lest it should raise too great a correspondence with
Egypt which furnished Canaan with them. The Lord hath said - The Lord
hath now said to me, and I by his command declare it to you. Ye shall no
more return that way - Into Egypt, lest ye be again infected with her
idolatries.

[Deuteronomy 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 17:17</span></span>

Turn away - From God and his law.

[Deuteronomy 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 17:18</span></span>

He shall write - With his own hand, as the Jews say. Out of that - Out
of the original, which was carefully kept by the priests in the
sanctuary, that it might be a perfect copy, and that it might have the
greater influence upon him, coming to him as from the hand and presence
of God.

[Deuteronomy 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 17:19</span></span>

All the days of his life - 'Tis not enough to have Bibles, but we must
use them, yea, use them daily. Our souls must have constant meals of
that manna, which if well digested, will afford them true nourishment
and strength.

[Deuteronomy 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 17:20</span></span>

If his heart be not lifted up - He intimates, that the scriptures
diligently read, are a powerful means to keep him humble, because they
shew him in that, tho' a king, he is subject to an higher monarch, to
whom he must give an account of all his administrations, and receive
from him his sentence agreeable to their quality, which is sufficient to
abate the pride of the haughtiest person in the world.
