### [Judges Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001)

[Judges 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 6:1</span></span>

Of Midian - For although the generality of the Midianites had been cut
off by Moses about two hundred years ago, yet many of them doubtless
fled into the neighbouring countries, whence afterwards they returned
into their own land, and in that time might easily grow to be a very
great number; especially, when God furthered their increase, that they
might be a scourge for Israel when they transgressed. Let all that sin,
expect to suffer: let all that turn to folly, expect to return to
misery.

[Judges 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 6:3</span></span>

Children of the east - That is, the Arabians, who are commonly called
the children of the east. Not all the Arabians; but the eastern part of
them.

[Judges 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 6:4</span></span>

Unto Gaza - That is, from the east, on which side they entered, to the
well, where Gaza was, near the sea: so they destroyed the whole land.

[Judges 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 6:5</span></span>

Without number - That is, so many that it was not easy to number them.
And not in a regular army to engage, but in a confused swarm, to plunder
the country. Yet Israel, being forsaken of God, had not spirit to make
head against them; God fighting against them with those very terrors,
with which otherwise he would have fought for them.

[Judges 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 6:8</span></span>

A prophet - We have reason to hope, God is designing mercy for us, if we
find he is by his grace preparing us for it.

[Judges 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 6:10</span></span>

Not obeyed my voice - He intends to bring them to repentance. And our
repentance is then genuine, when he sinfulness of sin, as disobedience
to God, is that in it which we chiefly lament.

[Judges 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 6:11</span></span>

In Ophrah - In Manasseh: there was another Ophrah in Benjamin, [Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023). The Abi - ezrite - Of the
posterity of Abiezer. Threshed - Not with oxen, as the manner was, [Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004), but with a staff to prevent
discovery. Wine - press - In the place where the wine - press stood, not
in the common floor.

[Judges 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 6:12</span></span>

Is with thee - That is, will assist thee against thine enemies. Man of
valour - To whom I have given strength and courage for this end.

[Judges 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 6:13</span></span>

With us - The angel had said, Peace be with Thee: but he expostulates
for All: herding himself with all Israel, and admitting no comfort, but
what they might be sharers in.

[Judges 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 6:14</span></span>

Looked - With a settled and pleasant countenance, as a testimony of his
favour, and readiness to help him. Go - Or, go now, in thy might: in the
strength which thou hast already received, and dost now farther receive
from me. Have not I sent thee - I do hereby give thee command and
commission for this work. God's fitting men for his work, is a sure
evidence of his calling them to it.

[Judges 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 6:15</span></span>

My family - Heb. my thousand: for the tribes were distributed into
several thousands, whereof each thousand had his peculiar governor. Is
poor - That is, weak and contemptible. The least - Either for age, or
fitness for so great a work.

[Judges 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 6:16</span></span>

As one man - As easily, as if they were all but one man.

[Judges 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 6:17</span></span>

That thou - That it is thou, an angel or messenger sent from God, that
appears to me, and discourseth with me. Or, a sign of that which thou
talkest with me; that is, that thou wilt by me smite the Midianites.

[Judges 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 6:18</span></span>

My present - A repast for the angel, whom he thought to be a man. Set it
- That thou mayest eat and refresh thyself.

[Judges 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 6:19</span></span>

An ephah - The choicest part of a whole ephah; as also he brought to him
the best part of a kid dressed; for a whole ephah, and a whole kid had
been superfluous, and improper to provide for one man.

[Judges 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 6:21</span></span>

Consumed the flesh - By which, he shewed himself to be no man that
needed such provisions, but the Son of God; and by this instance of his
omnipotency, gave him assurance, that he both could, and would consume
the Midianites.

[Judges 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 6:22</span></span>

Alas - I am an undone man: I must die, and that speedily; for that he
feared, [Jdg 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023), according to the
common opinion in that case.

[Judges 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 6:23</span></span>

Said unto him - Perhaps by an audible voice. Peace be to thee - Thou
shalt receive no hurt by this vision; but only peace, that is, all the
blessings needful for thy own happiness, and for the present work.

[Judges 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 6:24</span></span>

There - On the top of the rock, as is evident from [Jdg
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026), where that which is here
expressed only in general, is more particularly described. Jehovah -
shalom - That is, the Lord's peace; the sign or witness of God's
speaking peace to me, and to his people: or the place where he spake
peace to me, when I expected nothing but destruction.

[Judges 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 6:25</span></span>

The second bullock - He was to offer one for himself, the other for the
sins of the people, whom he was to deliver. 'Till sin be pardoned thro'
the great sacrifice, no good is to be expected. Thy father hath - Which
thy father built in his own ground, tho' for the common use of the city.
The grove - Planted by the altar for idolatrous uses, as the manner of
idolaters was. This action might seem injurious to his father's
authority; but God's command was a sufficient warrant, and Gideon was
now called to be the supreme magistrate, whereby he was made his
father's superior, and was authorized to root out all idolatry, and the
instruments thereof.

[Judges 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 6:26</span></span>

Of this rock - Heb. of this strong hold: for in that calamitous time the
Israelites retreated to such rocks, and hid and fortified themselves in
them. Ordered place - That is, in a plain and smooth part of the rock,
where an altar may be conveniently built. And offer - Gideon was no
priest, nor was this the appointed place of sacrifice; but God can
dispense with his own institutions, though we may not; and his call gave
Gideon sufficient authority.

[Judges 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 6:27</span></span>

Ten men - Whom doubtless he had acquainted with his design, and the
assurance of success in it, whereby they were easily induced to assist
him. He feared - Not so much, lest he should suffer for it, as lest he
should be prevented from doing it.

[Judges 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 6:28</span></span>

Was offered - Not upon Baal's altar, for which it was designed; but upon
an altar erected in contempt of Baal.

[Judges 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 6:30</span></span>

They said - Probably some of the persons employed in it.

[Judges 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 6:31</span></span>

Will ye plead - Why are you so zealous in pleading for that Baal, for
the worship whereof you suffer such grievous calamities at this day? It
is plain, that Joash had been a worshipper of Baal: but probably he was
now convinced by Gideon. He that will plead - He that shall farther
plead for such a god as this, deserves to die for his folly and impiety.
It is not probable, that this was all which he said for his son: but it
is usual in scripture to give only short hints of things which were more
largely discoursed. While it is morning - That is, instantly, without
delay. Let him plead - As the God of Israel hath often done when any
indignity or injury hath been done him. But Baal hath now shewed, that
he is neither able to help you, nor himself; and therefore is not worthy
to be served any longer. This resolute answer was necessary to stop the
torrent of the peoples fury; and it was drawn from him, by the sense of
his son's extreme danger; and by the confidence he had, that God would
plead his son's cause, and use him for the rescue of his people.

[Judges 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jdg 6:32</span></span>

He called - Joash called Gideon so, [Jdg
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#029), in remembrance of this noble
exploit, and to put a brand upon Baal. Jerub - baal - That is, Let Baal
plead. It is a probable conjecture, that that Jerombalus, whom
Sanchoniathon, (one of the most ancient of all the Heathen writers)
speaks of as a priest of Jao, (a corruption of Jehovah) and to whom he
was indebted for a great deal of knowledge, was this Jerub - baal.

[Judges 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 6:33</span></span>

Of Jezreel - Not Jezreel in Judah, but another in the borders of
Manasseh and Issachar, which was not far distant from Ophrah, where
Gideon dwelt.

[Judges 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 6:34</span></span>

The spirit came - Inspiring him with extraordinary wisdom, and courage,
and zeal to vindicate God's honour, and his country's liberty. The
Hebrew is, The Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon; clothed him as a robe,
to put honour upon him; clothed him as a coat of mail to put a defence
upon him. Those are well clad that are thus clothed. Abiezer - That is,
the Abiezrites, his kindred, and their servants, and others; who finding
no harm coming to him for destroying Baal, but rather a blessing from
God, in giving him strength and courage for so great an attempt, changed
their minds, and followed him as the person by whose hands God would
deliver them.

[Judges 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 6:35</span></span>

All Manasseh - On Both sides of Jordan. Unto Asher, &c. - Because these
tribes were nearest, and so could soonest join with him; and were
nearest the enemy also, [Jdg 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033), and
therefore were most sensible of the calamity, and would in all reason be
most forward to rescue themselves from it.

[Judges 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 6:36</span></span>

Gideon said - In a way of humble supplication, for the strengthening his
own faith, and for the greater encouragement of his soldiers in this
great attempt.

[Judges 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 6:37</span></span>

On all the earth - That is, upon all that spot of ground which
encompasses the fleece.

[Judges 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jdg 6:39</span></span>

On the ground - Which was more preternatural than the former instance,
because if there be any moisture, such bodies as fleeces of wool are
likely to drink it up.

[Judges 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jdg 6:40</span></span>

And God did so - See how tender God is, even of the weak; and how ready
to condescend to their infirmities! These signs were very expressive.
They are going to engage the Midianites. Could God distinguish between a
small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Yes, by this token
it appears that he can. Is Gideon desirous, that the dew of divine grace
might descend on himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew,
to assure him of it. Does he desire, that God will be as the dew to all
Israel? Behold all the ground is wet!
