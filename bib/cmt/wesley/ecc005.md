### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 5:1</span></span>

Thy foot - Thy thoughts and affections, by which men go to God and walk
with him. To hear - To hearken to and obey God's word. Of fools - Such
as wicked men use to offer, who vainly think to please God with their
sacrifices without obedience. For - They are not sensible of the great
sinfulness of such thoughts.

[Ecclesiastes 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 5:2</span></span>

Rash - Speak not without due consideration. To utter - Either in prayer,
or vows. For God - Is a God of infinite majesty, holiness, and
knowledge. Thy words - Either in prayer or in vowing.

[Ecclesiastes 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 5:3</span></span>

A dream - When men are oppressed with business in the day, they dream of
it in the night. Is known - It discovers the man to be a foolish, and
rash, and inconsiderate man. Of words - Either in prayer, or in vowing,
by making many rash vows, of which he speaks [Ecc
5:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md), and then returns to the mention
of multitude of dreams and many words, [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md), which verse may be a comment upon
this, and which makes it probable that both that and this verse are to
be understood of vows rather than of prayers.

[Ecclesiastes 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 5:4</span></span>

In fools - In perfidious persons, who, when they are in distress, make
liberal vows, and when the danger is past, break them.

[Ecclesiastes 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 5:6</span></span>

Thy mouth - By any rash vow. Thy flesh - Thyself, the word flesh being
often put for the whole man. The angel - The priest or ministers of holy
things. Such persons are often called angels, or, as this Hebrew word is
commonly rendered, messengers. And this title seems to be given to the
priest here, because the vow made to God, was paid to the priest as one
standing and acting in God's name and stead, and it belonged to him, as
God's angel or ambassador, to discharge persons from their vows when
there was just occasion. It was - I did unadvisedly in making such a
vow. Angry - Why wilt thou provoke God to anger at these frivolous
excuses? Destroy - Blast all thy labours, and particularly that work or
enterprize for the success whereof thou didst make these vows.

[Ecclesiastes 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 5:7</span></span>

For - There is a great deal of folly, as in multitude of dreams, which
for the most part are vain and insignificant, so also in many words, in
making many vows whereby a man is exposed to many snares and
temptations. But - Fear the wrath of God, and therefore be sparing in
making vows, and just in performing them.

[Ecclesiastes 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 5:8</span></span>

If - Here is an account of another vanity, and a sovereign antidote
against it. Marvel not - As if it were inconsistent with God's wisdom,
and justice, to suffer such disorders. For - The most high God who is
infinitely above the greatest of men. Regardeth - Not like an idle
spectator, but a judge, who diligently observes, and will effectually
punish them. Higher - God: it is an emphatical repetition of the same
thing.

[Ecclesiastes 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 5:9</span></span>

Profit - The fruits of the earth. For all - Necessary and beneficial to
all men. The wise man, after some interruption, returns to his former
subject, the vanity of riches, one evidence whereof he mentions in this
verse, that the poor labourer enjoys the fruits of the earth as well as
the greatest monarch. Is served - Is supported by the fruits of the
field.

[Ecclesiastes 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 5:13</span></span>

To their hurt - Because they frequently are the occasions both of their
present and eternal destruction.

[Ecclesiastes 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 5:14</span></span>

Perish - By some wicked practices, either his own, or of other men.
Nothing - In the son's possession after his father's death.

[Ecclesiastes 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 5:15</span></span>

To go - Into the womb of the earth, the common mother of all mankind.
Take nothing - This is another vanity. If his estate be neither lost,
nor kept to his hurt, yet when he dies he must leave it behind him, and
cannot carry one handful of it into another world.

[Ecclesiastes 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 5:16</span></span>

The wind - For riches, which are empty and unsatisfying, uncertain and
transitory, which no man can hold or stay in its course, all which are
the properties of the wind.

[Ecclesiastes 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 5:17</span></span>

He eateth - He hath no comfort in his estate, but even when he eats, he
doth it with anxiety and discontent. And wrath - When he falls sick, and
presages his death, he is filled with rage, because he is cut off before
he hath accomplished his designs, and because he must leave that wealth
and world in which all his hopes and happiness lie.

[Ecclesiastes 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 5:18</span></span>

Good - Good or comfortable to a man's self, and comely or amiable in the
eye of other men. His portion - Of worldly goods; he hath a better
portion in heaven. This liberty is given him by God, and this is the
best advantage, as to this life, which he can make of them.

[Ecclesiastes 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 5:19</span></span>

To take - To use what God hath given him.

[Ecclesiastes 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 5:20</span></span>

Remember - So as to disquiet himself. The days - The troubles; days
being put here for evil, or, sad days. Answereth - His desires, in
giving him solid joy and comfort.
