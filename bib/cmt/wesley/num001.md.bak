### [Numbers Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 1:1</span></span>

In the wilderness - Where now they had been a full year or near it, as
may be gathered by comparing this place with [Exo
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#001.md), [Exo
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#017.md).

[Numbers 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 1:2</span></span>

Take the sum - This is not the same muster with that [Exo
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026.md), as plainly appears, because
that was before the building of the tabernacle, which was built and set
up on the first day of the first month, [Exo
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#002.md), but this was after it, on the
first day of the second month. And they were for different ends; that
was to tax them for the charges of the tabernacle; but this was for
other ends, partly that the great number of the people might be known to
the praise of God's faithfulness, in making good his promises of
multiplying them, and to their own encouragement: partly for the better
ordering their camp and march, for they were now beginning their
journey; and partly that this account might he compared with the other
in the close of the book, where we read that not one of all this vast
number, except Caleb and Joshua were left alive; a fair warning to all
future generations to take heed of rebelling against the Lord. It is
true, the sums and numbers agree in this and that computation, which is
not strange, because there was not much time between the two numberings,
and no eminent sin among the people in that interval, whereby God was
provoked to diminish their numbers. Some conceive that in that number,
[Exo 30:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#011.md) and [Exo
38:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#025.md), the Levites were included,
which are here excepted, [Num 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047.md),
and that in that interval of time, there were grown up as many more men
of those years as there were Levites of the same age. Israel - So the
strangers mixed with them, were not numbered. Their fathers - The people
were divided into twelve tribes, the tribes into great families, [Num
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#005.md), these great families into lesser
families called the houses of their fathers, because they were
distinguished one from another by their fathers.

[Numbers 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 1:5</span></span>

Reuben - The tribes are here numbered according to the order or quality
of their birth, first the children of Leah, then of Rachel, and then of
the handmaids.

[Numbers 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 1:12</span></span>

Deuel - Called Reuel, [Num 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014.md), the
Hebrew letters Daleth and Resh being often changed.

[Numbers 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 1:19</span></span>

He numbered them - For ought that appears in one day.

[Numbers 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 1:20</span></span>

By their generations - That is, the persons begotten of Reuben's
immediate children, who are here subdivided into families, and they into
houses, and they into particular persons.

[Numbers 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 1:27</span></span>

Threescore and fourteen thousand - Far more than any other tribe, in
accomplishing Jacob's prophecy, [Gen
49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md).

[Numbers 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 1:33</span></span>

Ephraim - Above 8000 more than Manasseh, towards the accomplishment of
that promise, [Gen 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md), which the
devil in vain attempted to defeat by stirring up the men of Gath against
them, [Ch1 7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md).

[Numbers 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">num 1:37</span></span>

Thirty five thousand - The smallest number, except one, though Benjamin
had more immediate children than any of his brethren, [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md), whereas Dan had but one
immediate son, [Gen 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023.md), yet now his
number is the biggest but one of all the tribes, and is almost double to
that of Benjamin. Such great and strange changes God easily can, and
frequently doth make in families, [Sa1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md). And therefore let none boast or
please themselves too much in their numerous offspring.

[Numbers 1:49](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">num 1:49</span></span>

Levi - Because they were not generally to go out to war, which was the
thing principally eyed in this muster, [Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md), [Num
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020.md), [Num
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#045.md), but were to attend upon the
service of the tabernacle. They that minister upon holy things, should
not entangle themselves in secular affairs. The ministry itself is work
enough for a whole man, and all little enough to be employed in it.

[Numbers 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 1:50</span></span>

The tabernacle of testimony - So called here, and [Exo
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#021.md), because it was made chiefly for
the sake of the ark of the testimony, which is often called the
testimony.

[Numbers 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">num 1:51</span></span>

That cometh nigh - The stranger elsewhere is one of another nation, here
one of another tribe. So as to do the offices mentioned, [Num
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#050.md).

[Numbers 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">num 1:53</span></span>

No wrath - From God, who is very tender of his worship, and will not
suffer the profaners of it go unpunished! whose wrath is called simply
wrath by way of eminency, as the most terrible kind of wrath.
