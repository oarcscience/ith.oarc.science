### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 5:2</span></span>

By Dagon - By way of reproach, as a spoil and trophy set there to the
honour of Dagon, to whom doubtless they ascribed this victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 5:3</span></span>

They - The priests of Dagon. Set him - Supposing his fall was casual.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 5:4</span></span>

Cut off - The head is the seat of wisdom; the hands the instruments of
action: both are cut off to shew that he had neither wisdom nor strength
to defend himself or his worshippers. Thus the priests by concealing
Dagon's shame before, make it more evident and infamous. The stump -
Heb. only dagon, that is, that part of it from which it was called
Dagon, namely the fishy part, for Dag in Hebrew signifies a fish. It -
Upon the threshold; there the trunk abode in the place where it fell,
but the head and hands were slung to distant places.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 5:5</span></span>

This day - When this history was written, which if written by Samuel
towards the end of his life, was a sufficient ground for this
expression.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 5:6</span></span>

Emerods - The piles.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 5:8</span></span>

To Gath - Supposing that this plague was confined to Ashdod for some
particular reasons, or that it came upon them by chance, or for putting
it into Dagon's temple, which they resolved they would not do.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 5:9</span></span>

Hidden parts - In the inwards of their hinder parts: which is the worst
kind of emerods, as all physicians acknowledge, both because its pains
are far more sharp than the other; and because the malady is more out of
the reach of remedies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 5:11</span></span>

The city - In every city, where the ark of God came.
