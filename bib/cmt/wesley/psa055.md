------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 55:3</span></span>

Voice - Their clamours and threats, and slanders. Cast - They lay many
crimes to my charge.

[Psalms 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 55:4</span></span>

The terrors - Deadly terrors; such as seize upon men in the agonies of
death.

[Psalms 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 55:8</span></span>

Tempest - From the force and fury of mine enemies.

[Psalms 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 55:9</span></span>

Destroy - Destroy them by dividing. Tongues - Their speech, as thou
didst at Babel, [Gen 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009.md), their
votes, and opinions, and counsels. Which was eminently done among
Absalom's followers, [Sa2 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#023.md).
Strife - Injustice and fraud, oppression and contention rule here,
instead of that public justice and peace which I established. City - In
Jerusalem; which in Absalom's time was a sink of all sins.

[Psalms 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 55:10</span></span>

They - Violence and strife. Go about - Do encompass it, as it were a
garrison. Walls - In the outward parts, as also in the very midst of it.
So that all parts were horribly corrupted.

[Psalms 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 55:11</span></span>

Streets - The places of buying and selling, and of public commerce.

[Psalms 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 55:12</span></span>

Hated - With a manifest or old hatred.

[Psalms 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 55:13</span></span>

Equal - Not in power, but in reputation, for wisdom, and influence upon
my people. Guide - Whose counsel I highly prized, and constantly
followed. All which agrees to Achitophel.

[Psalms 55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 55:15</span></span>

Them - All such as pretend to religion, and have manifestly apostatized
both from the profession and practice of it. The grave - Cut off by a
sudden and violent death. Among them - Heb. in their inwards. Wickedness
is deeply rooted in their hearts.

[Psalms 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 55:17</span></span>

Evening, &c. - The three stated times of prayer among the Jews.

[Psalms 55:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 55:18</span></span>

He hath - He speaks of a future deliverance, as a thing done, because of
the certainty of it. He hath restored me to my former peace and
tranquility. For - For there were more with me than against me; even the
holy angels whom God employed to defend and deliver me.

[Psalms 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 55:19</span></span>

Hear - My prayers. Eternity - Who is eternal, and therefore
unchangeable, and almighty. Because - They meet with no crosses nor
disappointments. Therefore - Their success makes them go on securely,
without any regard to God, or dread of his judgments.

[Psalms 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 55:20</span></span>

He - They, the persons last mentioned.

[Psalms 55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 55:22</span></span>

Burden - All thy crosses, and cares, and fears, lay them upon the
Almighty, by faith and prayer. He directs this speech to his own soul,
and to all good men in like circumstances. Suffer - As he doth wicked
men. Tho' he may for a season suffer them to be shaken, yet not to be
overwhelmed.

[Psalms 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 55:23</span></span>

Them - The wicked. Not live - But shall be cut off by an untimely and
violent death. Trust in thee - And in this confidence I will quietly
wait for deliverance.
