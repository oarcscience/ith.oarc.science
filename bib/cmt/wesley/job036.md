Afar - From remote times, and places, and things. I will not confine my
discourse to thy particular case, but wilt justify God by declaring his
great and glorious works of creation and providence both in the heaven
and in the earth, and the manner of his dealing with men in other parts
and ages of the world. Ascribe - I will clear and maintain this truth,
that God is righteous in all his ways.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 36:5</span></span>

Despiseth - His greatness doth not make him (as it doth men) despise, or
oppress the meanest. Wisdom - His strength is guided by wisdom, and
therefore cannot do any thing unbecoming God, or unjust to his
creatures.

[Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 36:6</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 36:14</span></span>

Die - They provoke God to cut them off before their time. Unclean - Or,
Sodomites; to whose destruction, he may allude. They shall die by some
exemplary stroke of Divine vengeance. Yea, and after death, their life
is among the unclean, the unclean spirits, the devil and his angels, for
ever excluded from the new Jerusalem, into which no unclean thing shall
enter.

[Job 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 36:16</span></span>

He would - If thou hadst opened thine ear to God's counsels. Into - A

[Job 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 36:17</span></span>

The judgment - Or, the sentence, thou hast justified the hard speeches
which wicked men utter against God. Therefore - Therefore the just
judgment of God takes hold on thee. Thou hast maintained their cause
against God, and God passes against thee the sentence of condemnation
due to wicked men.

strongest forces.

[Job 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 36:20</span></span>

The night - The night of death, which Job had often desired, for then,
thou art irrecoverably gone: take heed of thy foolish and often repeated
desire of death, lest God inflict it upon thee in anger.

[Job 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 36:21</span></span>

judgments, than quietly to submit to them.

[Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 36:22</span></span>

Behold - God is omnipotent; and therefore can, either punish thee far
worse, or deliver thee, if thou dost repent. He is also infinitely wise;
and as none can work like him, so none can teach like him. Therefore do
not presume to teach him how to govern the world. None teacheth with
such authority and convincing evidence, with such condescension and
compassion, with such power and efficacy as God doth, he teaches by the
bible, and that is the best book; by his son, and he is the best master.

[Job 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 36:24</span></span>

Remember - Call to mind this thy duty. Magnify - Every work which he
doth; do not condemn any of his providential works, but adore them as
done with admirable wisdom, and justice. Behold - With admiration and
astonishment.

[Job 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 36:25</span></span>

It - The power, and wisdom, and greatness of God are so manifest in all
his works, that all who are not stupid, must see and acknowledge it.
Afar off - The works of God are so great and conspicuous, that they may
be seen at a great distance. Hence Elihu proceeds to give some
instances, in the works of nature and common providence. His general aim
is to shew, That God is the first cause and supreme director of all the
creatures; whom therefore we ought with all humility and reverence to
adore, That it is presumption in us to prescribe to him in his special
providence toward men, when the operations even of common providence
about the meteors, are so mysterious and unaccountable.

[Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 36:26</span></span>

Neither - He is eternal, as in his being, so in all his counsels; which
therefore must be infinitely above the comprehension of short - lived
men.

[Job 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 36:27</span></span>

For - Having affirmed that God's works are incomprehensibly great and
glorious, he now proves it from the most common works of nature and
providence. And hence he leaves it to Job to consider how much more deep
and inconceivable the secret counsels of God must be. Water - He orders
matters so wisely, that the waters which are in the clouds, do not fall
down at once in spouts, which would be pernicious to the earth and to
mankind; but by degrees, and in drops. According - According to the
proportion of vapours which the heat of the sun hath drawn up by the
earth or sea. So it notes that great work of God by which the rain is
first made of vapours, and afterwards resolved into vapours, or into the
matter of succeeding vapours, by a constant rotation.

[Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 36:29</span></span>

Understand - Whence it comes to pass, that a small cloud, no bigger than
a man's hand, suddenly spreads over the whole heavens: how the clouds
come to be suddenly gathered, and so condensed as to bring forth thunder
and lightning. Noise - The thunder produced in the clouds, which are
often called God's tent or tabernacle.

[Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 36:30</span></span>

Light - The lightning; fitly God's light, because God only can light it.
It - Upon the cloud, which is in a manner the candlestick in which God
sets up this light. The sea - The lightning spreads far and wide over
all the parts of the sea, and pierceth deep, reaching even to the bottom
of it.

[Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 36:31</span></span>

Judgeth - By thunder and lightning, and rain from the clouds, he
executes his judgments against ungodly people. Meat - Giveth meat. By
the same clouds, he provides plentiful showers dropping fatness on the
earth.

[Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 36:32</span></span>

Clouds - With thick and black clouds spread over the whole heavens.
Light - The sun. The cloud - Which God interposes as a veil between the
sun and earth.

[Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 36:33</span></span>

The noise - The thunder gives notice of the approaching rain. Also - And
as the thunder, so also the cattle sheweth, concerning the vapour,
concerning the coming of the rain, by a strange instinct, seeking for
shelter, when a change of weather is near.
