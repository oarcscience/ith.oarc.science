### [Acts Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

[Acts 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 4:1</span></span>

And as they were speaking to the people, the priests - came upon them -
So wisely did God order, that they should first bear a full testimony to
the truth in the temple, and then in the great council; to which they
could have had no access, had they not been brought before it as
criminals.

[Acts 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 4:2</span></span>

The priests being grieved - That the name of Jesus was preached to the
people; especially they were offended at the doctrine of his
resurrection; for as they had put him to death, his rising again proved
him to be the Just One, and so brought his blood upon their heads. The
priests were grieved, lest their office and temple services should
decline, and Christianity take root, through the preaching of the
apostles, and their power of working miracles: the captain of the temple
- Being concerned to prevent all sedition and disorder, the Sadducees -
Being displeased at the overturning of all their doctrines, particularly
with regard to the resurrection.

[Acts 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 4:4</span></span>

The number of the men - Beside women and children, were about five
thousand - So many did our Lord now feed at once with the bread from
heaven!

[Acts 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 4:5</span></span>

Rulers, and elders, and scribes - Who were eminent for power, for
wisdom, and for learning.

[Acts 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 4:6</span></span>

Annas, who had been the high priest, and Caiaphas, who was so then.

[Acts 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 4:7</span></span>

By what name - By what authority, have ye done this? - They seem to
speak ambiguously on purpose.

[Acts 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 4:8</span></span>

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost - That moment. God moves his
instruments, not when they please, but just when he sees it needful. Ye
rulers - He gives them the honour due to their office.

[Acts 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 4:10</span></span>

Be it known to you all - Probably the herald of God proclaimed this with
a loud voice. Whom God hath raised from the dead - They knew in their
own consciences that it was so. And though they had hired the soldiers
to tell a most senseless and incredible tale to the contrary, [Mat
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#012.md), [Mat
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#015.md), yet it is observable, they did
not, so far as we can learn, dare to plead it before Peter and John.

[Acts 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 4:11</span></span>

[Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md).

[Acts 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 4:12</span></span>

There is no other name whereby we must he saved - The apostle uses a
beautiful gradation, from the temporal deliverance which had been
wrought for the poor cripple, by the power of Christ, to that of a much
nobler and more important kind, which is wrought by Christ for impotent
and sinful souls. He therein follows the admirable custom of his great
Lord and Master, who continually took occasion from earthly to speak of
spiritual things.

[Acts 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 4:13</span></span>

Illiterate and uneducated men - Even by such men (though not by such
only) hath God in all ages caused his word to be preached before the
world.

[Acts 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 4:17</span></span>

Yet that it spread no farther - For they look upon it as a mere
gangrene. So do all the world upon genuine Christianity. Let us severely
threaten them - Great men, ye do nothing. They have a greater than you
to flee to.

[Acts 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 4:18</span></span>

They charged them not to speak - Privately; nor teach - Publicly.

[Acts 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 4:19</span></span>

Whether it be just to obey you rather than God, judge ye - Was it not by
the same spirit, that Socrates, when they were condemning him to death,
for teaching the people, said, "O ye Athenians, I embrace and love you;
but I will obey God rather than you. And if you would spare my life on
condition I should cease to teach my fellow citizens, I would die a
thousand times rather than accept the proposal."

[Acts 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 4:21</span></span>

They all glorified God - So much wiser were the people than those who
were over them.

[Acts 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 4:24</span></span>

The sense is, Lord, thou hast all power. And thy word is fulfilled. Men
do rage against thee: but it is in vain.

[Acts 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 4:25</span></span>

[Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md).

[Acts 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 4:27</span></span>

Whom thou hast anointed - To be king of Israel.

[Acts 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 4:28</span></span>

The sense is, but they could do no more than thou wast pleased to
permit, according to thy determinate counsel, to save mankind by the
sufferings of thy Son. And what was needful for this end, thou didst
before determine to permit to be done.

[Acts 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 4:30</span></span>

Thou stretchest forth thy hand - Exertest thy power.

[Acts 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 4:31</span></span>

They were all filled - Afresh; and spake the word with boldness - So
their petition was granted.

[Acts 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 4:32</span></span>

And the multitude of them that believed - Every individual person were
of one heart and one soul - Their love, their hopes, their passions
joined: and not so much as one - In so great a multitude: this was a
necessary consequence of that union of heart; said that aught of the
things which he had was his own - It is impossible any one should, while
all were of one soul. So long as that truly Christian love continued,
they could not but have all things common.

[Acts 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 4:33</span></span>

And great grace - A large measure of the inward power of the Holy Ghost,
was upon them all - Directing all their thoughts, words, and actions.

[Acts 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 4:34</span></span>

For neither was there any one among them that wanted - We may observe,
this is added as the proof that great grace was upon them all. And it
was the immediate, necessary consequence of it: yea, and must be to the
end of the world. In all ages and nations, the same cause, the same
degree of grace, could not but in like circumstances produce the same
effect. For whosoever were possessors of houses and lands sold them -
Not that there was any particular command for this; but there was great
grace and great love: of which this was the natural fruit.

[Acts 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 4:35</span></span>

And distribution was made - At first by the apostles themselves,
afterward by them whom they appointed.

[Acts 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 4:36</span></span>

A son of consolation - Not only on account of his so largely assisting
the poor with his fortune; but also of those peculiar gifts of the
Spirit, whereby he was so well qualified both to comfort and to exhort.

[Acts 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 4:37</span></span>

Having an estate - Probably of considerable value. It is not unlikely
that it was in Cyprus. Being a Levite, he had no portion, no distinct
inheritance in Israel.
