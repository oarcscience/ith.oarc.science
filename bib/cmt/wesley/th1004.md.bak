### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 4:1</span></span>

More and more - It is not enough to have faith, even so as to please
God, unless we abound more and more therein.

[1 Thessalonians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 4:3</span></span>

Sanctification - Entire holiness of heart and life: particular branches
of it are subjoined. That ye abstain from fornication - A beautiful
transition from sanctification to a single branch of the contrary; and
this shows that nothing is so seemingly distant, or below our thoughts,
but we have need to guard against it.

[1 Thessalonians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 4:4</span></span>

That every one know - For this requires knowledge, as well as chastity.
To possess his vessel - His wife. In sanctification and honour - So as
neither to dishonour God or himself, nor to obstruct, but further,
holiness; remembering, marriage is not designed to inflame, but to
conquer, natural desires.

[1 Thessalonians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 4:5</span></span>

Not in passionate desire - Which had no place in man when in a state of
innocence. Who know not God - And so may naturally seek happiness in a
creature. What seemingly accidental words slide in; and yet how fine,
and how vastly important!

[1 Thessalonians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 4:6</span></span>

In this matter - By violating his bed. The things forbidden, here are
three: fornication, [Th1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003.md); the
passion of desire, or inordinate affection in the married state, [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005.md); and the breach of the marriage
contract.

[1 Thessalonians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 4:8</span></span>

He that despiseth - The commandments we gave. Despiseth God - Himself.
Who hath also given you his Holy Spirit - To convince you of the truth,
and enable you to be holy. What naked majesty of words! How oratorical,
and yet with what great simplicity! - a simplicity that does not impair,
but improve, the understanding to the utmost; that, like the rays of
heat through a glass, collects all the powers of reason into one orderly
point, from being scattered abroad in utter confusion.

[1 Thessalonians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 4:9</span></span>

We need not write - Largely. For ye are taught of God - By his Spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 4:11</span></span>

That ye study - Literally, that ye be ambitious: an ambition worthy a
Christian. To work with your hands - Not a needless caution; for
temporal concerns are often a cross to them who are newly filled with
the love of God.

[1 Thessalonians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 4:12</span></span>

Decently - That they may have no pretence to say, (but they will say it
still,) "This religion makes men idle, and brings them to beggary." And
may want nothing - Needful for life and godliness. What Christian
desires more?

[1 Thessalonians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 4:13</span></span>

Now - Herein the efficacy of Christianity greatly appears, - that it
neither takes away nor embitters, but sweetly tempers, that most refined
of all affections, our desire of or love to the dead.

[1 Thessalonians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 4:14</span></span>

So - As God raised him. With him - With their living head.

[1 Thessalonians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 4:15</span></span>

By the word of the Lord - By a particular revelation. We who are left -
This intimates the fewness of those who will be then alive, compared to
the multitude of the dead. Believers of all ages and nations make up, as
it were, one body; in consideration of which, the believers of that age
might put themselves in the place, and speak in the person, of them who
were to live till the coming of the Lord. Not that St. Paul hereby
asserted (though some seem to have imagined so) that the day of the Lord
was at hand.

[1 Thessalonians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 4:16</span></span>

With a shout - Properly, a proclamation made to a great multitude. Above
this is, the voice of the archangel; above both, the trumpet of God; the
voice of God, somewhat analogous to the sound of a trumpet.

[1 Thessalonians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 4:17</span></span>

Together - In the same moment. In the air - The wicked will remain
beneath, while the righteous, being absolved, shall be assessors with
their Lord in the judgment. With the Lord - In heaven.
