### [Job Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#001.md)

[Job 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 8:2</span></span>

Strong wind - Boisterous and violent.

[Job 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 8:3</span></span>

Doth God - Heb. The might God, as this word signifies, the Almighty, or
All - sufficient God, as the next name of God implies. These names are
emphatically used, to prove that God cannot deal unjustly or falsely
with men, because he hath no need of it, nor temptation to it, being
self - sufficient for his own happiness, and being able by his own
invincible power to do whatsoever pleaseth him. Pervert - Judge
unrighteously? No, this is inconsistent with God's nature, and with his
office of governor of the world.

[Job 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 8:4</span></span>

If - If thou wast innocent, thy children, upon whom a great part of
these calamities fell, might be guilty; and therefore God is not
unrighteous in these proceedings.

[Job 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 8:5</span></span>

Betimes - Heb. rise early to seek him, if thou wouldest seek him
speedily, early and diligently.

[Job 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 8:6</span></span>

Habitation - The concerns of thy house and family; which thou hast got
and managed with righteousness.

[Job 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 8:8</span></span>

Search - Seriously and industriously search the ancient records.

[Job 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 8:9</span></span>

We, &c. - But lately born, and therefore have but little knowledge and
experience. We live not so long as they did, to make observations on the
methods of Divine Providence.

[Job 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 8:10</span></span>

Utter - Not partially, but sincerely, speaking their inward thoughts;
not rashly, but from deep consideration; not by hearsay, but their own
knowledge.

[Job 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 8:11</span></span>

Can, &c. - The hypocrite cannot build his hope, without some false,
rotten ground or other, any more than the rush can grow without mire, or
the flag without water.

[Job 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 8:12</span></span>

Greenness - Whereby it promises long continuance. Tho' no man cut it
down, it withers of itself, sooner than other herbs.

[Job 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 8:13</span></span>

Paths - Of wicked men. By their paths he doth not understand their
manner of living, but the events which befall them, God's manner of
dealing with them.

[Job 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 8:14</span></span>

Hope - Whose wealth and outward glory, the matter of his hope, and
trust, shall be cut off suddenly and violently taken away from him. Web
- Which tho' it be formed with great art and industry, is easily swept
down, or pulled in pieces.

[Job 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 8:15</span></span>

House - He shall trust to the multitude of his children and servants,
and to his wealth, all which come under the name of a man's house in
scripture. Hold it - To uphold himself by it. But his web, that refuge
of lies, will be swept away, and he crushed in it.

[Job 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 8:16</span></span>

He - The secure and prosperous sinner may think himself wronged, when he
is compared to a rush or flag. Compare him then to a flourishing and
well - rooted tree. Yet even then shall he be suddenly cut off. Green -
Flourisheth in the world. Before the sun - Publickly and in the view of
all men. Branch - His children, who are here mentioned as additions not
only to his comfort, but also to his strength and safety. Garden - A
place where it is defended from those injuries to which the trees of the
field are subject, and where, besides the advantages common to all
trees, it hath peculiar helps from the art and industry of men. So he
supposes this man to be placed in the most desirable circumstances.

[Job 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 8:17</span></span>

Heap - Of stones. This circumstance is added, to signify its firmness
and strength, that it was not in loose and sandy ground, which a violent
wind might overthrow, but in solid ground, within which were many
stones, which its numerous and spreading roots embrace, folding and
interweaving themselves about them. Seeth - The tree reacheth thither,
takes the advantage of that place for the strengthening of itself.

[Job 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 8:18</span></span>

He - God, who is the saviour of good men, and the destroyer of the
wicked. It - The place; to which denying him, and seeing him, are here
ascribed figuratively. Not seen - He shall be so utterly extirpated and
destroyed, that there shall be no memorial of him left.

[Job 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 8:19</span></span>

Behold - This is the issue of the flourishing state. This all his joy
comes to. And, &c. - Out of the same earth or place shall another tree
grow.

[Job 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 8:20</span></span>

Behold - God who will not help the evildoer, will not cast away a good
man, tho he may be cast down. Yet it may be, he will not be lifted up in
this world: and therefore Bildad could not infer, that if Job was not
restored to temporal prosperity, he was not a good man. Let us judge
nothing before the time, but wait 'till the secrets of all hearts are
revealed, and the present difficulties of providence solved, to
universal and everlasting satisfaction.

[Job 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 8:21</span></span>

'Till, &c. - And what I have said in general of good men, shall be made
good to thee, if thou art such: God will not forsake thee, nor desist
from doing thee good, 'till he give thee abundant matter of rejoicing.
