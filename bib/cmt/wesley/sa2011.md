### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

After - When that year ended, and the next begun, which was in the
spring time. When kings - Which is, when the ground is fit for the march
of soldiers, and brings forth provision for man and beast. Tarried at
Jerusalem - Had he been now in his post, at the head of his forces be
had been out of the way of temptation.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 11:2</span></span>

Arose from off his bed - Where he had lain, and slept for some time. And
the bed of sloth often proves the bed of lust. Washing herself - In a
bath, which was in her garden. Probably from some ceremonial pollution.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 11:3</span></span>

He inquired - Instead of suppressing that desire which the sight of his
eyes had kindled, he seeks rather to feed it; and first enquires who she
was; that if she were unmarried, he might make her either his wife or
his concubine.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 11:4</span></span>

Took her - From her own house into his palace, not by force, but by
persuasion. Lay with her - See how all the way to sin is down hill! When
men begin, they cannot soon stop themselves.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 11:8</span></span>

Go down - Not doubting but he would there converse with his wife, and so
cover their sin and shame.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 11:9</span></span>

The servants - With the king's guard. This he did, by the secret
direction of God's wise providence, who would bring David's sin to
light.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 11:10</span></span>

Camest - Wearied with hard service and travel, nor did I expect or
desire that thou shouldest now attend upon my person, or keep the watch.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 11:11</span></span>

The ark - This it seems, was now carried with them for their
encouragement and direction, as was usual. Fields - In tents which are
in the fields. His meaning is, now, when God's people are in a doubtful
and dangerous condition, it becomes me to sympathize with them, and to
abstain even from lawful delights.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 11:15</span></span>

He arose - So far is David from repenting, that he seeks to cover one
sin with another. How are the beginnings of sin to be dreaded! For who
knows where it will end? David hath sinned, therefore Uriah must die!
That innocent, valiant, gallant man, who was ready to die for his
prince's honour, must die by his prince's hand! See how fleshly lusts
war against the soul, and what devastations they make in that war! How
they blind the eyes, fear the conscience, harden the heart, and destroy
all sense of honour and justice!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 11:27</span></span>

The mourning - Which was seven days. Nor could the nature of the thing
admit of longer delay, lest the too early birth of the child might
discover David's sin. Bare a son - By which it appears, That David
continued in the state of impenitency for divers months together; and
this notwithstanding his frequent attendance upon God's ordinances.
Which is an eminent instance of the corruption of man's nature, of the
deceitfulness of sin, and of the tremendous judgment of God in punishing
one sin, by delivering a man up to another.
