### [Ezra Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 5:1</span></span>

The son - His grand - child; for he was the son of Baraciah. Prophesied
- Commanding them from God to return to building the temple, with a
promise of his favour and assistance.

[Ezra 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 5:2</span></span>

Helping - Encouraging the people to work by their presence, and
assurance of success. It is supposed, the work had stopt about fifteen
years. The first chapter of Haggai is the best comment on these two
verses.

[Ezra 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 5:3</span></span>

Shethar - boznai - Not Rehum and Shimshai, &c. who were either dead, or
removed from their office by Darius.

[Ezra 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 5:4</span></span>

We - Jews. Accordingly - According to what they asked. That made this
building - That were the undertakers and encouragers of it.

[Ezra 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 5:8</span></span>

Great God - And indeed, thus far the greater part of the Samaritans
agreed with them.

[Ezra 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ezr 5:17</span></span>

Now therefore. &c. - If the case had been so fairly stated to
Artaxerxes, he would hardly have hindered the work. The people of God
could not be persecuted, if they were not belied.
