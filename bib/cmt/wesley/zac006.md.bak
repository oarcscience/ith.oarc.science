### [Zechariah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 6:1</span></span>

Four chariots - Angels who are sometimes styled chariots of God. These
as employed in the affairs of church and empire, act their part in the
revolution and changes of things, 'till the gospel be preached by the
Messiah, and the apostles. Of brass - These denote the immoveable
decrees of God, his steady execution of his counsels and the insuperable
restraints upon all empires and countries, which God keeps within the
barriers of such impregnable mountains.

[Zechariah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 6:2</span></span>

Red horses - Perhaps denoting bloody times, [Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004.md). Black horses - Perhaps a time of
mortality, and wasting diseases, [Rev
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#005.md).

[Zechariah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 6:3</span></span>

White horses - Signifying joyful and prosperous affairs, [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md). Grisled - A mixt state of
affairs.

[Zechariah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 6:5</span></span>

These are - The angels of heaven, who have a great share in the
management of the affairs both of the church and states. Of the heavens
- Which reside in heaven, 'till employed, go thence when employed, and
having done their work, return thither. Standing - They stand as
servants attending the command of their Lord.

[Zechariah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 6:6</span></span>

The black horses - The angels signified by the black horses are the
executioners of God's just displeasure. Therein - In the second chariot.
The north - country - Babylon. The grisled - The angels signified by
these, managed the Roman power, which was sometimes favourable,
sometimes fierce and severe, to those they had to do with. The south -
country - Egypt and Arabia, which lay south of Judea. It may perhaps
point at their invading Africa too, whose punishments were mixed, with
kindness and mercy more than the punishments of Babylon were.

[Zechariah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 6:7</span></span>

Sought to go - Waited for a commission. He said - Christ who hath all
power in heaven and on earth. Through the earth - Thro' the rest of the
kingdoms of the world remote from Judea, but not remote from God's wise
and sovereign providence.

[Zechariah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 6:8</span></span>

Cried he - Christ spake aloud, and called to him. Quieted my spirit - By
doing what I appointed them in revenge of my peoples injuries, and by
bringing my people back into Canaan.

[Zechariah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 6:10</span></span>

Take - Of those that are come out of Babylon. Come thou - Go fetch them,
if they lodge elsewhere. The same day - The same day in which they come.

[Zechariah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 6:11</span></span>

Make crowns - One of silver, the other of gold. Set them - Put both of
them, one after another. Joshua - Who herein is now a type of Christ,
king and priest for ever for his people.

[Zechariah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 6:12</span></span>

Unto him - Joshua, but in the hearing of others. Whose name is the
Branch - Whom you know by the name of the Branch, who was called so long
since. Thou, O Joshua art the portrait, he is the Branch itself. Out of
his place - Of the tribe and family, and in the place foretold. He shall
build - He it is, though unseen, that stands by you, who build the
material temple, far inferior to the spiritual temple, which Christ will
build, preserve, and dwell in for ever.

[Zechariah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 6:13</span></span>

The glory - Of both kingly and priestly office; the glory of both those
crowns shall abide on him. Shall sit - Which speaks both his royal
magnificence, and the perpetuity of it. A priest - The great high -
priest, to offer the great sacrifice to God, to make reconciliation, to
intercede for his people. The counsel of peace - The peace made for
God's people shall rest upon these two, the kingly and priestly office
of Christ; by his priestly office he shall make their peace with God, by
his kingly office he shall deliver them from their spiritual enemies.

[Zechariah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 6:14</span></span>

The crowns - The two crowns before mentioned. Helem - These persons we
know no more of than their names. A memorial - Of the Messiah's certain
and speedy coming.

[Zechariah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 6:15</span></span>

They that are far off - This verse hath a double reference, one to the
Jews, and the building of the material temple, the other to the bringing
in of the Gentiles. And this - The literal part shall come to pass in
your day, if you will obey the voice of the Lord. The mystical part
shall come to pass also, and, if you will believe and obey, the Gentiles
shall come in and be your brethren, and help to build the temple, the
spiritual temple. But if you rebel and obey not, you shall be cast out
and the Gentiles be taken in, to be God's people.
