### [Genesis Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 44:5</span></span>

Is not this it in which my lord drinketh? And for which he would search
thoroughly - So it may be rendered.

[Genesis 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 44:16</span></span>

God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants - Referring to the
injury they had formerly done to Joseph, for which they thought God was
now reckoning with them. Even in those afflictions wherein we apprehend
ourselves wronged by men, yet we must own that God is righteous, and
finds out our iniquity. We cannot judge what men are, by what they have
been formerly, not what they will do, by what they have done. Age and
experience may make men wiser and better, They that had sold Joseph, yet
would not abandon Benjamin.

[Genesis 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#018.md)

And Judah said - We have here a most pathetic speech which Judah made to
Joseph on Benjamin's behalf. Either Judah was a better friend to
Benjamin than the rest, and more solicitous to bring him off; or he
thought himself under greater obligations to endeavour it than the rest,
because he had passed his word to his father for his safe return. His
address, as it is here recorded, is so very natural, and so expressive
of his present passion, that we cannot but suppose Moses, who wrote it
so long after, to have written it under the special direction of him
that made man's mouth. A great deal of unaffected art, and unstudied
rhetoric there is in this speech. He addressed himself to Joseph with a
great deal of respect calls him his lord, himself and his brethren his
servants, begs his patient hearing, and passeth a mighty compliment upon
him, Thou art even as Pharaoh, whose favour we desire, and whose wrath
we dread as we do Pharaoh's. He represented Benjamin as one well worthy
of his compassionate consideration, he was a little one, compared with
the rest; the youngest, not acquainted with the world, nor inured to
hardship, having been always brought up tenderly with his father. It
made the case the more piteous that he alone was left of his mother, and
his brother was dead, viz. Joseph; little did Judah think what a tender
point he touched upon now. Judah knew that Joseph was sold, and
therefore had reason enough to think that he was not alive. He urged it
closely that Joseph had himself constrained them to bring Benjamin with
them, had expressed a desire to see him, had forbidden them his
presence, unless they brought Benjamin with them, all which intimated,
that he designed him some kindness. And must he be brought with so much
difficulty to the preferment of a perpetual slavery? Was he not brought
to Egypt in obedience, purely in obedience to the command of Joseph, and
would not he shew him some mercy? The great argument he insists upon was
the insupportable grief it would be to his aged father, if Benjamin
should be left behind in servitude. His father loves him, [Gen
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#020.md). Thus they had pleaded against
Joseph's insisting on his coming down [Gen
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen044.htm#022.md). If he should leave his father,
his father would die, much more if he now be left behind, never to
return. This the old man of whom they spake, had pleaded against his
going down. If mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my grey hairs,
that crown of glory, with sorrow to the grave. This therefore Judah
presseth with a great deal of earnestness, his life is bound up in the
lad's life, when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will faint away
and die immediately, or will abandon himself to such a degree of sorrow,
as will, in a few days, make an end of him, And (lastly) Judah pleads,
that, for his part, he could not bear to see this. Let me not see the
evil that shall come on my father. Judah, in honour to the justice of
Joseph's sentence, and to shew his sincerity in this plea, offers
himself to become a bond - man instead of Benjamin. Thus the law would
be satisfied; Joseph would be no loser, for we may suppose Judah a more
able bodied man than Benjamin; Jacob would better bear that than the
loss of Benjamin. Now, so far was he from grieving at his father's
particular fondness for Benjamin, than he is himself willing to be a
bond - man to indulge it.

Now, had Joseph been, as Judah supposed, an utter stranger to the
family, yet even common humanity could not but be wrought upon by such
powerful reasonings as these; for nothing could be said more moving,
more tender; it was enough to melt a heart of stone: but to Joseph, who
was nearer a - kin to Benjamin than Judah himself, and who, at this
time, felt a greater passion for him and his aged father, than Judah
did, nothing could be more pleasingly nor more happily said. Neither
Jacob nor Benjamin needed an intercessor with Joseph, for he himself
loved them. Upon the whole, let us take notice, How prudently Judah
suppressed all mention of the crime that was charged upon Benjamin. Had
he said any thing by way of acknowledgment of it, he had reflected on
Benjamin's honesty. Had he said any thing by way of denial of it, he had
reflected on Joseph's justice; therefore he wholly waves that head, and
appeals to Joseph's pity. What good reason dying Jacob had to say,
Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise, [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md), for he excelled them all in
boldness, wisdom, eloquence, and especially tenderness for their father
and family. Judah's faithful adherence to Benjamin now in his distress
was recompensed long after, by the constant adherence of the tribe of
Benjamin to the tribe of Judah, when all the other ten tribes deserted
it.
