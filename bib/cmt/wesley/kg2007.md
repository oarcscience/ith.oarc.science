### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 7:1</span></span>

Measure - Heb. Seah, a measure containing six cabs, or about a peck and
pottle of our measure.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 7:2</span></span>

Windows - Through which he could rain down corn, as once he did Manna.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 7:6</span></span>

Hittites - Under which name (as elsewhere under the name of the
Amorites) he seems to understand all the people of Canaan. For though
the greatest number of that people were destroyed, yet very many of them
were spared, and many of them upon Joshua's coming, fled away, some to
remote parts, others to the lands bordering upon Canaan, where they
seated themselves, and grew numerous and powerful. Kings - Either the
king of Egypt, the plural number being put for the singular, or, the
princes and governors of the several provinces in Egypt.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 7:7</span></span>

Fled - None of them had so much sense as to send scouts to discover the
supposed enemy, much less, courage enough to face them. God can when he
pleases, dispirit the boldest, and make the stoutest heart to tremble.
They that will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a
leaf. Perhaps Gehazi was one of these lepers, which might occasion his
being taken notice of by the king, [Kg2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 7:13</span></span>

Behold, &c. - The words may be rendered, Behold, they are of a truth
(the Hebrew prefix, Caph, being not here a note of similitude, but an
affirmation of the truth and certainty of the things, as it is taken
[Num 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001); [Deu
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#010),) all the multitude of the horses
of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even all the
multitude of the horses of the Israelites, which (which multitude) are
consumed, reduced to this small number, all consumed except these five.
And this was indeed worthy of a double behold, to shew what mischief the
famine had done both upon men and beasts, and to what a low ebb the king
of Israel was come, that all his troops of horses, to which he had
trusted, were shrunk to so small a number.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 7:20</span></span>

And so it fell out, &c. - See how heinously God resents our distrust of
his power, providence and promise! Whenever God promises the end, he
knows where to provide the means.
