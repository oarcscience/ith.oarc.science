### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 2:1</span></span>

Our gathering together to him - In the clouds.

[2 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 2:2</span></span>

Be not shaken in mind - In judgment. Or terrified - As those easily are
who are immoderately fond of knowing future things. Neither by any
pretended revelation from the Spirit, nor by pretence of any word spoken
by me.

[2 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 2:3</span></span>

Unless the falling away - From the pure faith of the gospel, come first.
This began even in the apostolic age. But the man of sin, the son of
perdition - Eminently so called, is not come yet. However, in many
respects, the Pope has an indisputable claim to those titles. He is, in
an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin
above measure. And he is, too, properly styled, the son of perdition, as
he has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers
and followers, destroyed innumerable souls, and will himself perish
everlastingly. He it is that opposeth himself to the emperor, once his
rightful sovereign; and that exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped - Commanding angels, and putting kings under
his feet, both of whom are called gods in scripture; claiming the
highest power, the highest honour; suffering himself, not once only, to
be styled God or vice - god. Indeed no less is implied in his ordinary
title, "Most Holy Lord," or, "Most Holy Father." So that he sitteth -
Enthroned. In the temple of God - Mentioned [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md). Declaring himself that he is God
- Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone.

[2 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 2:6</span></span>

And now ye know - By what I told you when I was with you. That which
restraineth - The power of the Roman emperors. When this is taken away,
the wicked one will be revealed. In his time - His appointed season, and
not before.

[2 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 2:7</span></span>

He will surely be revealed; for the mystery - The deep, secret power of
iniquity, just opposite to the power of godliness, already worketh. It
began with the love of honour, and the desire of power; and is completed
in the entire subversion of the gospel of Christ. This mystery of
iniquity is not wholly confined to the Romish church, but extends itself
to others also. It seems to consist of, Human inventions added to the
written word. Mere outside performances put in the room of faith and
love. Other mediators besides the man Christ Jesus. The two last
branches, together with idolatry and bloodshed, are the direct
consequences of the former; namely, the adding to the word of God.
Already worketh - In the church. Only he that restraineth - That is, the
potentate who successively has Rome in his power. The emperors, heathen
or Christian; the kings, Goths or Lombards; the Carolingian or German
emperors.

[2 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 2:8</span></span>

And then - When every prince and power that restrains is taken away.
Will that wicked one - Emphatically so called, be revealed. Whom the
Lord will soon consume with the spirit of his mouth - His immediate
power. And destroy - With the very first appearance of his glory.

[2 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 2:10</span></span>

Because they received not the love of the truth - Therefore God suffered
them to fall into that "strong delusion."

[2 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 2:11</span></span>

Therefore God shall send them - That is, judicially permit to come upon
them, strong delusion.

[2 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 2:12</span></span>

That they all may be condemned - That is, the consequence of which will
be, that they all will be condemned who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness - That is, who believed not the truth,
because they loved sin.

[2 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 2:13</span></span>

God hath from the beginning - Of your hearing the gospel. Chosen you to
salvation - Taken you out of the world, and placed you in the way to
glory.

[2 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 2:14</span></span>

To which - Faith and holiness. He hath called you by our gospel - That
which we preached, accompanied with the power of his Spirit.

[2 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 2:15</span></span>

Hold - Without adding to, or diminishing from, the traditions which ye
have been taught - The truths which I have delivered to you. Whether by
word or by our epistle - He preached before he wrote. And he had written
concerning this in his former epistle.
