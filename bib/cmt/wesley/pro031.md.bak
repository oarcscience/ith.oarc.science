### [Proverbs Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 31:1</span></span>

Lemuel - Of Solomon, by the general consent both of Jewish and Christian
writers; this name signifies one from God, or belonging to God, and such
an one was Solomon eminently, being given by God to David and Bathsheba,
as a pledge of his reconciliation to them after their repentance.
Possibly his mother gave him this name to mind him of his great
obligations to God, and of the justice of his devoting himself to God's
service.

[Proverbs 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 31:2</span></span>

What - A short speech, arguing her great passion for him; what words
shall I take? What counsels shall I give thee? My heart is full, but
where shall I begin? Of my womb - My son, not by adoption, but whom I
bare in the womb, and therefore it is my duty to give thee admonitions,
and thine to receive them. My vows - On whose behalf I have made many
prayers and sacrifices, and solemn vows to God; whom I have, as far as
in me lay, devoted to the work, and service, and glory of God.

[Proverbs 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 31:3</span></span>

[Proverbs 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 31:6</span></span>

To perish - To faint; for such need a cordial.

[Proverbs 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 31:8</span></span>

The dumb - For such as cannot speak in their own cause, either through
ignorance, or because of the dread of their more potent adversaries.
Destruction - Who, without such succour from the judges, are like to be
utterly ruined.

[Proverbs 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 31:13</span></span>

Flax - That she may find employment for her servants. Worketh - She
encourages them to work by her example; which was a common practice
among princesses in those first ages. Not that it is the duty of kings
and queens to use manual operations, but it is the duty of all persons,
the greatest not excepted, to improve all their talents, and
particularly their time, which is one of the noblest of them, to the
service of that God to whom they must give an account, and to the good
of that community to which they are related.

[Proverbs 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#014.md)

From afar - By the sale of her home - spun commodities she purchases the
choicest goods which come from far countries.

[Proverbs 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 31:16</span></span>

effects of her diligence. Planteth - She improves the land to the best
advantage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 31:17</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 31:18</span></span>

Perceiveth - She finds great comfort in her labours. Her candle - Which
is not to be taken strictly, but only signifies her unwearied care and
industry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 31:19</span></span>

She layeth - By her own example she provokes her servants to labour. And
although in these latter and more delicate times, such mean employments
are grown out of fashion among great persons, yet they were not so in
former ages, neither in other countries, nor in this land; whence all
women unmarried unto this day are called in the language of our law,
Spinsters.

Tapestry - For the furniture of her house. Silk - Which was agreeable to
her high quality.

[Proverbs 31:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 31:23</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 31:24</span></span>

Openeth her mouth - She is neither sullenly silent, nor full of
impertinent talk, but speaks discreetly and piously, as occasion offers.
In her tongue - Her speeches are guided by wisdom and grace, and not by
inordinate passions. And this practice is called a law in her tongue,
because it is constant and customary, and proceeds from an inward and
powerful principle of true wisdom.

[Proverbs 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#027.md)

business, and the whole carriage of her children and servants.

[Proverbs 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 31:30</span></span>

Favour - Comeliness, which commonly gives women favour with those who
behold them. Deceitful - It gives a false representation of the person,
being often a cover to a deformed soul; it does not give a man that
satisfaction, which at first he promised to himself from it; and it is
soon lost, not only by death, but by many diseases and contingencies.

[Proverbs 31:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 31:31</span></span>

labours deserve. Let her works - If men be silent, the lasting effects
of her prudence and diligence will trumpet forth her praises. In the
gates - In the most publick and solemn assemblies.
