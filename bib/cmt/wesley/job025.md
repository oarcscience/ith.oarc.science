### [Job Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

[Job 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 25:1</span></span>

Answered - Not to that which Job spake last, but to that which seemed
most reprovable in all his discourses; his censure of God's proceedings
with him, and his desire of disputing the matter with him. Perhaps
Bildad and the rest now perceived that Job and they did not differ so
much as they thought. They owned that the wicked might prosper for a
while. And Job owned, they would be destroyed at the last.

[Job 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 25:2</span></span>

Dominion - Sovereign power over all persons and things. Fear - Terror,
that which justly makes him dreadful to all men, and especially to all
that undertake to dispute with him. He - This clause, as well as the
following verse, seems to be added to prove God's dominion and
dreadfulness: he keepeth and ruleth all persons and things in heaven, in
peace and harmony. The angels, though they be very numerous, all own his
sovereignty, and acquiesce in his pleasure. The stars, tho' vast in
their bulk, and various in their motions: exactly keep the order which
God hath appointed them: and therefore it is great folly for thee to
quarrel with the methods of God's dealings with thee.

[Job 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 25:3</span></span>

Armies - Of the angels, and stars, and other creatures, all which are
his hosts. Light - The light of the sun is communicated to all parts of
the world. This is a faint resemblance, of the cognisance and care which
God takes of the whole creation. All are under the light of his
knowledge: all partake of the light of his goodness: his pleasure is to
shew mercy: all the creatures live upon his bounty.

[Job 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 25:4</span></span>

Man - The word signifies man that is miserable, which supposes him to be
sinful; and shall such a creature quarrel with that dominion of God, to
which the sinless, and happy, and glorious angels submit? God - Before
God's tribunal, to which thou dost so boldly appeal.

[Job 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 25:5</span></span>

Moon - The moon, tho' bright and glorious, if compared with the Divine
Majesty, is without any lustre or glory. By naming the moon, and thence
proceeding to the stars, the sun is also included.

[Job 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 25:6</span></span>

Worm - Mean, and vile, and impotent; proceeding from corruption, and
returning to it. The son - For miserable man in the last branch he here
puts the son of any man, to shew that this is true even of the greatest
and best of men. Let us then wonder at the condescension of God, in
taking such worms into covenant and communion with himself!
