### [Judges Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

[Judges 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 3:1</span></span>

Had not known - That is, such as had no experience of those wars, nor of
God's extraordinary power and providence manifested in them.

[Judges 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 3:2</span></span>

Teach them war - That by the neighbourhood of such warlike enemies, they
might be purged from sloth and security, and obliged them to innure
themselves to martial exercises, and to stand continually upon their
guard, and consequently to keep close to that God whose assistance they
had so great and constant need of.

[Judges 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 3:3</span></span>

Five lords - Whereof three had been in some sort subdued, [Jdg
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018.md). but afterwards recovered their
strength. Canaanites - Properly so called, who were very numerous, and
dispersed through several parts of the land, whence they gave
denomination to all the rest of the people. Zidonions - The people
living near Zidon, and subject to its jurisdiction. Baal - hermon -
Which was the eastern part about Lebanon.

[Judges 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 3:4</span></span>

To know - That is, that they and others might know by experience.

[Judges 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 3:6</span></span>

Served their gods - Were drawn to idolatry by the persuasions and
examples of their yoke - fellows.

[Judges 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 3:7</span></span>

And the groves - That is, in the groves, in which the Heathens usually
worshipped their Baalim or idols.

[Judges 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 3:8</span></span>

Served - That is, were made subject to him. Mesopotamia was that part of
Syria which lay between the two great rivers, Tigris and Euphrates. This
lay at such a distance, that one would not have thought Israel's trouble
should have come from such a far country: which shews so much the more
of the hand of God in it.

[Judges 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 3:9</span></span>

Cried - That is, prayed fervently for deliverance.

[Judges 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 3:10</span></span>

Came upon him - With extraordinary influence, endowing him with singular
wisdom and courage, and stirring him up to this great undertaking.
Judged Israel - That is, pleaded and avenged the cause of Israel against
their oppressors.

[Judges 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 3:11</span></span>

Forty years - It rested about forty years, or the greatest part of forty
years: it being most frequent in scripture to use numbers in such a
latitude. Nor is it unusual either in scripture, or in other authors,
for things to be denominated from the greater part; especially, when
they enjoyed some degrees of rest and peace even in their times of
slavery.

[Judges 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 3:12</span></span>

Strengthened Eglon - By giving him courage, and power, and success
against them.

[Judges 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 3:13</span></span>

City of Palm - trees - That is, Jericho. Not the city which was
demolished, but the territory belonging to it. Here he fixed his camp,
for the fertility of that soil, and because of its nearness to the
passage over Jordan, which was most commodious both for the conjunction
of his own forces which lay on both sides of Jordan; to prevent the
conjunction of the Israelites in Canaan with their brethren beyond
Jordan; and to secure his retreat into his own country.

[Judges 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 3:14</span></span>

Eighteen years - The former servitude lasted but eight years; this
eighteen: for if smaller troubles do not the work, God will send
greater.

[Judges 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 3:15</span></span>

A Benjamite - This tribe was next to Eglon, and doubtless most afflicted
by him; and hence God raiseth a deliverer. Left handed - Which is here
noted, as a considerable circumstance in the following story.

[Judges 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 3:16</span></span>

A cubit length - Long enough for his design, and not too long for
concealment. His right thigh - Which was most convenient both for the
use of his left hand, and for avoiding suspicion.

[Judges 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 3:17</span></span>

The present - Which was to be paid to him as a part of his tribute.

[Judges 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 3:18</span></span>

Sent the people - He accompanied them part of the way, and then
dismissed them, and returned to Eglon alone, that so he might have more
easy access to him.

[Judges 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 3:19</span></span>

Turned again - As if he had forgot some important business. Keep silence
- 'Till my servants be gone: whom he would not have acquainted with a
business which he supposed to be of great importance.

[Judges 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 3:20</span></span>

A summer parlour - Into which he used to retire from company: which is
mentioned as the reason why his servants waited so long ere they went in
to him, [Jdg 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md). A message - To be
delivered not in words, but by actions. He designedly uses the name
Elohim, which was common to the true God, and false ones; and not
Jehovah, which was peculiar to the true God; because Ehud not knowing
whether the message came; not from his own false god, he would more
certainly rise, and thereby give Ehud more advantage for his blow;
whereas he would possibly shew his contempt of the God of Israel by
sitting still to hear his message. He arose - In token of reverence to
God.

[Judges 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 3:23</span></span>

Went forth - With a composed countenance and gait, being well assured,
that God, who by his extraordinary call had put him upon that
enterprise, would by his special providence carry him through it. Upon
him - Upon or after himself. Locked them - Either pulling it close after
him, as we do when doors have spring locks; or taking the key with him.

[Judges 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 3:24</span></span>

Covereth his feet - This phrase is used only here, and [Sa1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003.md). A late judicious interpreter
expounds it, of composing himself to take a little sleep, as was very
usual to do in the day - time in those hot countries. And when they did
so in cool places, such as this summer parlour unquestionably was, they
used to cover their feet. And this may seem to be the more probable,
both because the summer parlour was proper for this use, and because
this was a more likely reason of their long waiting at his door, lest
they should disturb his repose. And this sense best agrees with Saul's
case in the cave, when being asleep, David could more securely cut off
the lap of his garment.

[Judges 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 3:25</span></span>

Ashamed - Or, confounded, not knowing what to say or think; lest they
should either disturb him, or be guilty of neglect towards him. A key -
Another key, it being usual in princes courts to have divers keys for
the same door.

[Judges 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 3:27</span></span>

The children of Israel - Whom doubtless he had prepared by his
emissaries gathered together in considerable numbers.

[Judges 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 3:28</span></span>

Fords of Jordan - Where they passed over Jordan, that neither the
Moabites that were got into Canaan, might escape, nor any more Moabites
come over Jordan to their succour.

[Judges 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 3:30</span></span>

Fourscore years - Chiefly that part of it which lay east of Jordan: for
the other side of the country, which lay south - west, was even then
infested by the Philistines.

[Judges 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 3:31</span></span>

An ox goad - As Samson did a thousand with the jaw - bone of an ass;
both being miraculous actions, and not at all incredible to him that
believes a God, who could easily give strength to effect this. It is
probable Shamgar was following the plough, when the Philistines made an
inroad into the country. And having neither sword nor spear, when God
put it into his heart to oppose them, he took the instrument that was
next at hand. It is no matter how weak the weapon is, if God direct and
strengthen the arm.
