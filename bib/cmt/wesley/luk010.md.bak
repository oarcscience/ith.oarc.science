### [Luke Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001.md)

[Luke 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 10:2</span></span>

Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that he would thrust forth labourers -
For God alone can do this: he alone can qualify and commission men for
this work. [Mat 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md).

[Luke 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 10:3</span></span>

[Luke 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 10:4</span></span>

Salute no man by the way - The salutations usual among the Jews took up
much time. But these had so much work to do in so short a space, that
they had not a moment to spare.

[Luke 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 10:6</span></span>

A son of peace - That is, one worthy of it.

[Luke 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 10:7</span></span>

[Luke 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 10:11</span></span>

The kingdom of God is at hand - Though ye will not receive it.

[Luke 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 10:13</span></span>

Wo to thee, Chorazin - The same declaration Christ had made some time
before. By repeating it now, he warns the seventy not to lose time by
going to those cities. [Mat 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md).

[Luke 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 10:16</span></span>

[Mat 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040.md); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020.md).

[Luke 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 10:18</span></span>

I beheld Satan - That is, when ye went forth, I saw the kingdom of
Satan, which was highly exalted, swiftly and suddenly cast down.

[Luke 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 10:19</span></span>

I give you power - That is, I continue it to you: and nothing shall hurt
you - Neither the power, nor the subtilty of Satan.

[Luke 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 10:20</span></span>

Rejoice not so much that the devils are subject to you, as that your
names are written in heaven - Reader, so is thine, if thou art a true,
believer. God grant it may never be blotted out!

[Luke 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 10:21</span></span>

Lord of heaven and earth - In both of which thy kingdom stands, and that
of Satan is destroyed. That thou hast hid these things - He rejoiced not
in the destruction of the wise and prudent, but in the display of the
riches of God's grace to others, in such a manner as reserves to Him the
entire glory of our salvation, and hides pride from man. [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md).

[Luke 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 10:22</span></span>

Who the Son is - Essentially one with the Father: who the Father is -
How great, how wise, how good!

12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md).

[Luke 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 10:27</span></span>

Thou shalt love the Lord thy God - That is, thou shalt unite all the
faculties of thy soul to render him the most intelligent and sincere,
the most affectionate and resolute service. We may safely rest in this
general sense of these important words, if we are not able to fix the
particular meaning of every single word. If we desire to do this,
perhaps the heart, which is a general expression, may be explained by
the three following, With all thy soul, with the warmest affection, with
all thy strength, the most vigorous efforts of thy will, and with all
thy mind or understanding, in the most wise and reasonable manner thou
canst; thy understanding guiding thy will and affections. [Deu
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md); [Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md).

[Luke 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 10:28</span></span>

Thou hast answered right; this do, and thou shalt live - Here is no
irony, but a deep and weighty truth. He, and he alone, shall live for
ever, who thus loves God and his neighbour in the present life.

[Luke 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 10:29</span></span>

To justify himself - That is, to show he had done this. [Lev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md).

[Luke 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 10:30</span></span>

From Jerusalem to Jericho - The road from Jerusalem to Jericho (about
eighteen miles from it) lay through desert and rocky places: so many
robberies and murders were committed therein, that it was called the
bloody way. Jericho was situated in the valley: hence the phrase of
going down to it. About twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there,
who all attended the service of the temple.

[Luke 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 10:31</span></span>

The common translation is, by chance - Which is full of gross
improprieties. For if we speak strictly, there is no such thing in the
universe as either chance or fortune. A certain priest came down that
way, and passed by on the other side - And both he and the Levite no
doubt could find an excuse for passing over on the other side, and might
perhaps gravely thank God for their own deliverance, while they left
their brother bleeding to death. Is it not an emblem of many living
characters, perhaps of some who bear the sacred office? O house of Levi
and of Aaron, is not the day coming, when the virtues of heathens and
Samaritans will rise up in judgment against you?

[Luke 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 10:33</span></span>

But a certain Samaritan came where he was - It was admirably well judged
to represent the distress on the side of the Jew, and the mercy on that
of the Samaritan. For the case being thus proposed, self interest would
make the very scribe sensible, how amiable such a conduct was, and would
lay him open to our Lord's inference. Had it been put the other way,
prejudice might more easily have interposed, before the heart could have
been affected.

[Luke 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 10:34</span></span>

Pouring in oil and wine - Which when well beaten together are one of the
best balsams that can be applied to a fresh wound.

[Luke 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 10:36</span></span>

Which of these was the neighbour to him that fell among the robbers -
Which acted the part of a neighbour?

[Luke 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 10:37</span></span>

And he said, He that showed mercy on him - He could not for shame say
otherwise, though he thereby condemned himself and overthrew his own
false notion of the neighbour to whom our love is due. Go and do thou in
like manner - Let us go and do likewise, regarding every man as our
neighbour who needs our assistance. Let us renounce that bigotry and
party zeal which would contract our hearts into an insensibility for all
the human race, but a small number whose sentiments and practices are so
much our own, that our love to them is but self love reflected. With an
honest openness of mind let us always remember that kindred between man
and man, and cultivate that happy instinct whereby, in the original
constitution of our nature, God has strongly bound us to each other.

[Luke 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 10:40</span></span>

Martha was encumbered - The Greek word properly signifies to be drawn
different ways at the same time, and admirably expresses the situation
of a mind, surrounded (as Martha's then was) with so many objects of
care, that it hardly knows which to attend to first.

[Luke 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 10:41</span></span>

Martha, Martha - There is a peculiar spirit and tenderness in the
repetition of the word: thou art careful, inwardly, and hurried,
outwardly.

[Luke 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 10:42</span></span>

Mary hath chosen the good part - To save her soul. Reader, hast thou?
