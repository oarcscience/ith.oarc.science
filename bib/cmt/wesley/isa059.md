Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 59:3</span></span>

Perverseness - Perverse words are such as are contrary to God's word.
Words every way contrary to God's will.

[Isaiah 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 59:4</span></span>

None - None seek to redress these wrongs, and violences; they commit all
rapines, and frauds with impunity. Bring forth - These two words of
conceiving, and bringing forth, denote their whole contrivance, and
perfecting their wickedness.

[Isaiah 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 59:5</span></span>

Cockatrice eggs - One kind put for any venomous creature, a proverbial
speech signifying by these eggs mischievous designs, and by hatching
them, their putting them in practice. Web - Another proverbial speech
whereby is taught, both how by their plots they weave nets, lay snares
industriously with great pains and artifice. And also how their designs
will come to nothing, as the spider's web is soon swept away.

[Isaiah 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 59:6</span></span>

Webs - Their contrivances shall not be able to cover or defend them.

[Isaiah 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 59:7</span></span>

Wasting - They meditate on little or nothing else. Paths - In what way
or work soever they are engaged, it all tends to ruin and destruction.

[Isaiah 59:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 59:8</span></span>

The way of peace - They live in continual contentions, and discords.
Judgment - No justice, equity, faith, or integrity.

[Isaiah 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 59:9</span></span>

Justice - Judgment, and so justice is here taken for deliverance. God
doth not defend our right, nor revenge our wrong, because of these
outrages, and acts of violence, injustice, and oppression.

[Isaiah 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 59:10</span></span>

As dead men - He compares their captivity to men dead without hope of
recovery.

[Isaiah 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 59:11</span></span>

Mourn - Their oppressing governors made the wicked roar like bears, and
the good mourn like doves.

[Isaiah 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 59:12</span></span>

Transgressions - The word here signifies sins of an high nature, such as
wherein there is much of man's will against light: rebellious sins.
Multiplied - They admit of no excuse; for they are acted before thee,
and multiplied against thee, whereby thou art justly provoked to deny us
all help. Testify - As so many witnesses produced proves our guilt. Are
with us - Are still unforgiven. We know - We are convinced of them.

[Isaiah 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 59:13</span></span>

Lying - Transgressing here, and lying, seem to be one and the same
thing, inasmuch as in their transgressing the law of God, they broke
their solemn engagement to God upon mount Sinai. Departing - Turning
from God to idols. Speaking - As it were, talking of little else one
among another, but how to oppress their neighbours, and apostatize from
God. Uttering - That is, first contriving in their heart false
accusations, false worship to the dishonour of God; laying the
contrivances and uttering them. From the heart - And when they dealt
with men in ways of fraud, it was from the heart, but when they spake
with God it was but from the lip.

[Isaiah 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 59:14</span></span>

Judgment - He speaks here of the sentences in courts of judicature.
Truth - Truth is cast to the ground, and justice trampled under foot,
even in publick. Equity - No such thing will be admitted in their
courts.

[Isaiah 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 59:15</span></span>

Faileth - All things are amiss, neither judgment or justice, or truth,
is to be found among us. A prey - Or, as some render it, is accounted
mad, is laughed at. Josephus tells us, that immediately before the
destruction of Jerusalem, it was matter of scorn to be religions. The
translators reach the meaning of the word by prey: the wicked, like wild
beasts, endeavouring to devour such as are not as bad as themselves:
where wickedness rules, innocency is oppressed.

[Isaiah 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 59:16</span></span>

No man - To appear in the behalf of equity. His arm - He would do his
work without help from any other. Righteousness - His justice; seeing
there could be no justice found among them, he would avenge the innocent
himself.

[Isaiah 59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 59:17</span></span>

For - God, resolving to appear as a man of war, puts on his arms; he
calls righteousness his breast - plate, to shew the justness of his
cause, as also his faithfulness in making good his promises. Vengeance -
Or garments made of vengeance: as God is said to put on the former for
their sakes, whom he would preserve, so he puts on these for their
sakes, whom he will destroy, namely, his peoples enemies. Zeal - For his
own honour, and for his own people. The sum of all these expressions is,
to describe both the cause and effect together; the cause was
righteousness and zeal in God, the effect, salvation to his people, and
vengeance on his enemies.

[Isaiah 59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 59:18</span></span>

Deeds - Heb. recompences or deserts. That is, he will recompence his
adversaries with those effects of his fury that they have deserved.
Islands - To those remoter nations under the king of Babylon, that
thought themselves secure.

[Isaiah 59:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 59:19</span></span>

Fear - Worship the Lord. The west - The western part of the world. His
glory - The glorious God. The rising of the sun - The eastern parts.
When - At what time soever the devil, or his instruments shall make
violent irruptions upon the church. A standard - God shall make known
himself to take their part and defend them, by his spirit alone.

[Isaiah 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 59:20</span></span>

The Redeemer - Christ, of whom the apostle expounds it, [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md), the prophets usually concluding
their promises of temporal deliverances with the promises of spiritual,
especially such, of which the temporal were evident types.

[Isaiah 59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 59:21</span></span>

My covenant - What I have promised, to them that turn from their
iniquity. My words - Which thou hast uttered by virtue of my spirit. Of
thy seed - A promise of the perpetual presence of his word and spirit
with the prophets, apostles, and teachers of the church to all ages.
