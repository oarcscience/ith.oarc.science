### [Ezekiel Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 11:1</span></span>

Jaazaniah - Not him that is mentioned [Eze
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011.md). Pelatiah - Named here for that
dreadful sudden death, whereby he became a warning to others.

[Ezekiel 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 11:2</span></span>

He - The Lord sitting on the cherub.

[Ezekiel 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 11:3</span></span>

It - The threatened danger and ruin by the Chaldeans. The caldron - This
is an impious scoff, yet mixt with some fear of the prophet, [Jer
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013.md).

[Ezekiel 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 11:6</span></span>

Ye - Many murders have you committed yourselves, and you are accountable
to God for all those whom the Chaldeans have slain, seeing you persuaded
them, thus obstinately to stand out.

[Ezekiel 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 11:7</span></span>

Bring you forth - Not in mercy, but in wrath, by the conquering hand of
Babylon.

[Ezekiel 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 11:9</span></span>

Deliver you - Defeating all your projects for escape.

[Ezekiel 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 11:10</span></span>

Will judge - My just judgments shall pursue you, whithersoever you fly.

[Ezekiel 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 11:11</span></span>

Your caldron - The place of your sufferings; greater are reserved for
you in a strange land. Judge you - I will do more against you at Riblah,
where the captive king had his children, and others with them, first
murdered before his eyes, and then his own eyes put out; Riblah is
called the border of Israel: for Syria was adjoining to Israel on the
north, and Riblah was on the frontiers of Syria.

[Ezekiel 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 11:13</span></span>

Pelatiah - Mentioned [Eze 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#001.md), a
principal man among the twenty - five princes, who made all the mischief
in Jerusalem. It should seem this was done in vision now, (as the
slaying of the ancient men, [Eze 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006),.md)
but it was an assurance, that when this prophecy was published, it would
be done in fact. And the death of Pelatiah was an earnest of the
compleat accomplishment of the prophecy. A full end - By slaying all, as
this man is cut off.

[Ezekiel 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 11:15</span></span>

Thy brethren - Thy nearest kindred, which it seems were left in
Jerusalem. Their degeneracy is more noted in the repetition of the word
brethren. Gone far - Ye are gone far from the Lord; as much as the
Heathens accused the Christians of atheism.

[Ezekiel 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 11:16</span></span>

Say - In vindication of them. Although - The obstinate Jews at Jerusalem
will call them apostates; but I the Lord sent them thither, and will own
them there. Scattered - Dispersed them in many countries which are under
the king of Babylon: yet they are dear to me. A little sanctuary - A
little one in opposition to that great temple at Jerusalem. To him they
shall flee, and in him they shall be safe, as he was that took hold on
the horns of the altar. And they shall have such communion with God in
the land of their captivity, as it was thought could be had no where but
in the temple.

[Ezekiel 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 11:18</span></span>

They - They who assemble upon Cyrus's proclamation first, and then upon
Darius's proclamation, shall overcome all difficulties, dispatch the
journey, and come safely to their own land. Take away - They shall
abolish superstition and idolatry from the temple.

[Ezekiel 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 11:19</span></span>

One heart - Cyrus shall give them leave, and I will give them a heart to
return; and on their way shall there be great utility; and, when come to
Jerusalem, they shall own me, and my laws, and with one consent, build
Jerusalem and the temple, and restore true religion. The stony - That
hard, inflexible, undutiful, incorrigible disposition.

[Ezekiel 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 11:21</span></span>

Heart - Soul and affections. Walketh - Either secretly adhere to, or
provide for the service of idols, called here detestable things.

[Ezekiel 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 11:23</span></span>

Went up - The glory of the Lord removes now out of the city, over which
it had stood some time, waiting for their repentance. The mountain -
Mount Olivet. He removed thither, to be as it were within call, and
ready to return, if now at length in this their day, they would have
understood the things that made for their peace.

[Ezekiel 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 11:24</span></span>

The spirit - The same spirit which carried him to Jerusalem, now brings
him back to Chaldea. Went up - Was at an end.
