### [Amos Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

[Amos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 1:1</span></span>

He saw - Received by revelation. Israel - The kingdom of the ten tribes.
Jeroboam - The great grand - son of Jehu. The earth - quake - Of which,
only this text, and [Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md), make
any particular mention.

[Amos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 1:2</span></span>

Will roar - Alluding to the roaring of an hungry lion for prey.
Jerusalem - The city God had chosen where he dwelt, the seat of God's
instituted worship, and the royal seat of the kingdom as God had settled
it, from which in both respects the ten tribes had revolted. The
habitations - Where the shepherds found pasturage they pitch their
tents, and dwelt therein that they might attend their flocks. And this
was the delight and wealth of these men; alluding to which Amos
expresses the wealth and delight of the kingdom of Israel. Shall wither
- Either blasted, or dried up with drought, and turned into barrenness.
So the whole kingdom of the ten tribes, though as fruitful as Carmel
should be made horrid and desolate as a wilderness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 1:3</span></span>

For three - This certain number is put for an uncertain: three, that is,
many. Of Damascus - Here Damascus is put for the whole kingdom of Syria.
Threshed - Treated it with the utmost cruelty. Gilead - There was a
country of this name, and a city, possessed by the Reubenites, Gadites,
and Manassites; Gilead here is put for the inhabitants of this country
and city, whom Hazael, king of Syria most barbarously murdered.

[Amos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 1:4</span></span>

Ben - hadad - Ben - hadad was to the Syrian kings a common name, as
Pharaoh to the Egyptian kings, and Caesar to the Roman emperors.

[Amos 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 1:5</span></span>

The bar - Literally the bar with which the city gates were shut, and
fastened. Of Eden - Some royal seat, of the kings of Syria. Kir - Kir of
Media, [Isa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md), thither did Tiglath
- Pilneser carry the conquered Syrians, [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md), and placed them captives in that
barren mountainous country, about fifteen years after it was foretold by
Amos.

[Amos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 1:6</span></span>

Carried away - All the Jews whom they had taken captive. Edom - Their
most inveterate enemies. These Edomites were ever ready to enslave, and
tyrannize over the Jews, if by any means they could get them into their
hands.

David and Solomon on the other.

[Amos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md)

Pursue - Watched for, and laid hold on every occasion to oppress Israel.

[Amos 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 1:12</span></span>

Teman - The metropolis of Idumea, so called from Esau's grandson of that
name. Bozrah - This was a very strong city, and one of the chief in the
