Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001)

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

Wholesome - Restoring and preserving spiritual health.

[Titus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 2:2</span></span>

Vigilant - As veteran soldiers, not easily to be surprised. Patience - A
virtue particularly needful for and becoming them. Serious - Not
drolling or diverting on the brink of eternity.

[Titus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 2:3</span></span>

In behaviour - The particulars whereof follow. As becometh holiness -
Literally, observing an holy decorum. Not slanderers - Or evil -
speakers. Not given to much wine - If they use a little for their often
infirmities. Teachers - Age and experience call them so to be. Let them
teach good only.

[Titus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 2:4</span></span>

That they instruct the young women - These Timothy was to instruct
himself; Titus, by the elder women. To love their husbands, their
children - With a tender, temperate, holy, wise affection. O how hard a
lesson.

[Titus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 2:5</span></span>

Discreet - Particularly in the love of their children. Chaste -
Particularly in the love of their husbands. Keepers at home - Whenever
they are not called out by works of necessity, piety, and mercy. Good -
Well tempered, sweet, soft, obliging. Obedient to their husbands - Whose
will, in all things lawful, is a rule to the wife. That the word of God
be not blasphemed - Or evil spoken of; particularly by unbelieving
husbands, who lay all the blame on the religion of their wives.

[Titus 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 2:6</span></span>

To be discreet - A virtue rarely found in youth.

[Titus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

Showing thyself a pattern - Titus himself was then young. In the
doctrine which thou teachest in public: as to matter, uncorruptness; as
to the manner of delivering it, seriousness - Weightiness, solemnity.

[Titus 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 2:8</span></span>

Wholesome speech - In private conversation.

[Titus 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 2:9</span></span>

Please them in all things - Wherein it can be done without sin. Not
answering again - Though blamed unjustly. This honest servants are most
apt to do. Not stealing - Not taking or giving any thing without their
master's leave: this fair - spoken servants are apt to do.

[Titus 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 2:10</span></span>

Showing all good fidelity - Soft, obliging faithfulness That they may
adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour - More than St. Paul says of
kings. How he raises the lowness of his subject! So may they, the
lowness of their condition.

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

The saving grace of God - So it is in its nature, tendency, and design.
Hath appeared to all men - High and low.

[Titus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 2:12</span></span>

Instructing us - All who do not reject it. That, having renounced
ungodliness - Whatever is contrary to the fear and love of God. And
worldly desires - Which are opposite to sobriety and righteousness. We
should live soberly - In all purity and holiness. Sobriety, in the
scripture sense, is rather the whole temper of a man, than a single
virtue in him. It comprehends all that is opposite to the drowsiness of
sin, the folly of ignorance, the unholiness of disorderly passions.
Sobriety is no less than all the powers of the soul being consistently
and constantly awake, duly governed by heavenly prudence, and entirely
conformable to holy affections. And righteously - Doing to all as we
would they should do to us. And godly - As those who are consecrated to
God both in heart and life.

[Titus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 2:13</span></span>

Looking - With eager desire. For that glorious appearing - Which we hope
for. Of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ - So that, if there
be (according to the Arian scheme) a great God and a little God, Christ
is not the little God, but the great one.

[Titus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 2:14</span></span>

Who gave himself for us - To die in our stead. That he might redeem us -
Miserable bondslaves, as well from the power and the very being, as from
the guilt, of all our sins.

[Titus 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 2:15</span></span>

Let no man despise thee - That is, let none have any just cause to
despise thee. Yet they surely will. Men who know not God will despise a
true minister of his word.
