Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 5:1</span></span>

Be ye therefore followers - Imitators. Of God - In forgiving and loving.
O how much more honourable and more happy, to be an imitator of God,
than of Homer, Virgil, or Alexander the Great!

[Ephesians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 5:3</span></span>

But let not any impure love be even named or heard of among you - Keep
at the utmost distance from it, as becometh saints.

[Ephesians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 5:4</span></span>

Nor foolish talking - Tittle tattle, talking of nothing, the weather,
fashions, meat and drink. Or jesting - The word properly means,
wittiness, facetiousness, esteemed by the heathens an half - virtue. But
how frequently even this quenches the Spirit, those who are tender of
conscience know. Which are not convenient - For a Christian; as neither
increasing his faith nor holiness.

[Ephesians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 5:6</span></span>

Because of these things - As innocent as the heathens esteem them, and
as those dealers in vain words would persuade you to think them.

[Ephesians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 5:8</span></span>

Ye were once darkness - Total blindness and ignorance. Walk as children
of light - Suitably to your present knowledge.

[Ephesians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 5:9</span></span>

The fruit of the light - Opposite to " the unfruitful works of
darkness," [Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md). Is in - That is,
consists in. Goodness and righteousness and truth - Opposite to the sins
spoken of, [Eph 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md),&c.

[Ephesians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 5:11</span></span>

Reprove them - To avoid them is not enough.

[Ephesians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 5:12</span></span>

In secret - As flying the light.

[Ephesians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 5:13</span></span>

But all things which are reproved, are thereby dragged out into the
light, and made manifest - Shown in their proper colours, by the light.
For whatsoever doth make manifest is light - That is, for nothing but
light, yea, light from heaven, can make anything manifest.

[Ephesians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 5:14</span></span>

Wherefore he - God. Saith - In the general tenor of his word, to all who
are still in darkness. Awake thou that steepest - In ignorance of God
and thyself; in stupid insensibility. And arise from the dead - From the
death of sin. And Christ shall give thee light - Knowledge, holiness,
happiness.

[Ephesians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 5:15</span></span>

Circumspectly - Exactly, with the utmost accuracy, getting to the
highest pitch of every point of holiness. Not as fools - Who think not
where they are going, or do not make the best of their way.

[Ephesians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 5:16</span></span>

With all possible care redeeming the time - Saving all you can for the
best purposes; buying every possible moment out of the hands of sin and
Satan; out of the hands of sloth, ease, pleasure, worldly business; the
more diligently, because the present are evil days, days of the grossest
ignorance, immorality, and profaneness.

[Ephesians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 5:17</span></span>

What the will of the Lord is - In every time, place, and circumstance.

[Ephesians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 5:18</span></span>

Wherein is excess - That is, which leads to debauchery of every kind.
But be ye filled with the Spirit - In all his graces, who gives a more
noble pleasure than wine can do.

[Ephesians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 5:19</span></span>

Speaking to each other - By the Spirit. In the Psalms - Of David. And
hymns - Of praise. And spiritual songs - On any divine subject. By there
being no inspired songs, peculiarly adapted to the Christian
dispensation, as there were to the Jewish, it is evident that the
promise of the Holy Ghost to believers, in the last days, was by his
larger effusion to supply the lack of it. Singing with your hearts - As
well as your voice. To the Lord - Jesus, who searcheth the heart.

[Ephesians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 5:20</span></span>

Giving thanks - At all times and places. And for all things - Prosperous
or adverse, since al\] work together for good. In the name of, or
through, our Lord Jesus Christ - By whom we receive all good things.

[Ephesians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 5:22</span></span>

In the following directions concerning relative duties, the inferiors
are all along placed before the superiors, because the general
proposition is concerning submission; and inferiors ought to do their
duty, whatever their superiors do. Wives, submit yourselves to your own
husbands - Unless where God forbids. Otherwise, in all indifferent
things, the will of the husband is a law to the wife. As unto the Lord -
The obedience a wife pays to her husband is at the same time paid to
Christ himself; he being head of the wife, as Christ is head of the
church.

[Ephesians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 5:23</span></span>

The head - The governor, guide, and guardian of the wife. And he is the
Saviour of the body - The church, from all sin and misery.

[Ephesians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 5:24</span></span>

In everything - Which is not contrary to any command of God.

[Ephesians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 5:25</span></span>

Even as Christ loved the church - Here is the true model of conjugal
affection. With this kind of affection, with this degree of it, and to
this end, should husbands love their wives.

[Ephesians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 5:26</span></span>

That he might sanctify it through the word - The ordinary channel of all
blessings. Having cleansed it - From the guilt and power of sin. By the
washing of water - In baptism; if, with "the outward and visible sign,"
we receive the "inward and spiritual grace."

[Ephesians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 5:27</span></span>

That he might present it - Even in this world. To himself - As his
spouse. A glorious church - All glorious within. Not having spot - Of
impurity from any sin. Or wrinkle - Of deformity from any decay.

[Ephesians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 5:28</span></span>

As their own bodies - That is, as themselves. He that loveth his wife
loveth himself - Which is not a sin, but an indisputable duty.

[Ephesians 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 5:29</span></span>

His own flesh - That is, himself. Nourisheth and cherisheth - That is,
feeds and clothes it.

[Ephesians 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 5:30</span></span>

For we - The reason why Christ nourishes and cherishes the church is,
that close connexion between them which is here expressed in the words
of Moses, originally spoken concerning Eve. Are members - Are as
intimately united to Christ, in a spiritual sense, as if we were
literally "flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone."

[Ephesians 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 5:31</span></span>

For this cause - Because of this intimate union. [Gen
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md).
