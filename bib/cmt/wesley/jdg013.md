### [Judges Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001)

[Judges 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 13:1</span></span>

Did evil - That is, fell into idolatry, not after the death of Abdon the
last judge, but in the days of the former judges. Forty years - To be
computed, not from Abdon's death, but before that time. And it is
probable that great slaughter of the Ephraimites made by Jephthah,
greatly encouraged the Philistines to rise against Israel, when one of
their chief bulwarks was so much weakened; and therefore began to
domineer over them not long after Jephthah's death. These were a very
inconsiderable people. They had but five cities of any note. And yet
when God used them as the staff in his hand, they were very oppressive
and vexatious.

[Judges 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 13:2</span></span>

Of the family - That is, of the tribe or people. Bare not - An
emphatical repetition of the same thing in other words, which is an
usual elegancy both in scripture and other authors.

[Judges 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 13:3</span></span>

The angel - The Son of God, yet distinguished from the Lord, because he
appeared here in the form of a servant, as a messenger sent from God.
The great Redeemer did in a particular manner concern himself about this
typical redeemer.

[Judges 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 13:4</span></span>

Beware - Because the child was to be a Nazarite from the womb, [Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005), and from the conception; and
because the mother's pollution extends to the child, she is enjoined
from this time to observe the following rules belonging to the
Nazarites. Strong drink - Under which are comprehended the other
particulars mentioned, [Num 6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002). Nor
eat - Any of those meats forbidden, Lev. 11:1-47, which were forbidden
to all, but especially to the Nazarites.

[Judges 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 13:5</span></span>

A Nazarite - A person consecrated to God's service. Begin to deliver -
And the deliverance shall be carried on and perfected by others, as it
was by Eli, Samuel, and Saul; but especially by David. God chuses to
carry on his work gradually and by several hands. One lays the
foundation of a good work, another builds, and perhaps a third brings
forth the top stone.

[Judges 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 13:6</span></span>

Man of God - A prophet, or sacred person, sent with a message from God.
Terrible - Or, venerable, awful, full of Majesty.

[Judges 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 13:12</span></span>

Let thy words - Or, thy words shall come to pass: I firmly believe thy
promises shall be fulfilled. How - What rules shall we observe about his
education?

[Judges 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 13:13</span></span>

Let her - Whilst the child is in her womb, and after the child is born
let him observe the same orders.

[Judges 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 13:15</span></span>

Made ready - Supposing him to be a man and a prophet, to whom he would
in this manner express his respect, as was usual to strangers.

[Judges 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 13:16</span></span>

Bread - That is, meat, as bread is commonly taken in scripture. To the
Lord - Not unto a man, as thou apprehendest me to be; but unto the Lord,
as thou wilt by and by perceive me to be.

[Judges 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 13:17</span></span>

Honour - Either by making honourable mention of thee, or by shewing
respect to thee, by a present, which they usually gave to prophets.

[Judges 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 13:18</span></span>

Secret - Hidden from mortal men: or, wonderful, such as thou canst not
comprehend: my nature and essence, (which is often signified by name in
scripture) is incomprehensible. This shews, that this was the angel of
the covenant, the Son of God.

[Judges 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 13:19</span></span>

Meal - offering - Which were generally joined with the chief sacrifices.
A Rock - The angel's presence and command being a sufficient warrant for
the offering of sacrifice by a person who was no priest, and in a place
otherwise forbidden.

[Judges 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 13:20</span></span>

The altar - That is, from that part of the rock which served instead of
an altar, upon which the sacrifice was laid. Ascended - To manifest his
nature and essence to be spiritual. Fell - Partly in reverence to that
glorious presence manifested in so wonderful a manner: and partly, out
of a religious horror and fear of death; for the prevention thereof they
fell down in way of supplication to God.

[Judges 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 13:23</span></span>

Nor would, &c. - This expression seems to have some emphasis in it, to
enhance God's mercy to them, as being afforded them in a time of such
grievous calamity; and in a time when the word of the lord was precious;
and there was no open vision.

[Judges 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 13:24</span></span>

Blessed him - That is, endowed him with all those graces and gifts of
mind and body which were necessary for the work he was designed for.

[Judges 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 13:25</span></span>

To move - That is, to stir him up to heroical designs; to shew forth its
power in the frame of his mind, and in the strength of his body,
discovered to his neighbours in extraordinary actions; to encline his
heart to great attempts for the help and deliverance of God's people, to
give some essays of it to his brethren, and to seek all opportunities
for it. Of Dan - A place so called, either from the expedition of the
Danites, [Jdg 18:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#011), which though
placed after this history, was done before it: or from some other camp
which the Danites had formed there, to give some check to the incursions
of the Philistines.
