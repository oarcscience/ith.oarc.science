### [Matthew Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 28:1</span></span>

[Mar 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md); [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md); [Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 28:2</span></span>

An angel of the Lord had rolled away the stone and sat upon it - St.
Luke and St. John speak of two angels that appeared: but it seems as if
only one of them had appeared sitting on the stone without the
sepulchre, and then going into it, was seen with another angel, sitting,
one where the head, the other where the feet of the body had lain.

[Matthew 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 28:6</span></span>

Come, see the place where the Lord lay - Probably in speaking he rose
up, and going before the women into the sepulchre, said, Come, see the
place. This clearly reconciles what St. John relates, [Joh
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#012.md), this being one of the two
angels there mentioned.

[Matthew 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 28:7</span></span>

There shall ye see him - In his solemn appearance to them all together.
But their gracious Lord would not be absent so long: he appeared to them
several times before then. Lo, I have told you - A solemn confirmation
of what he had said.

[Matthew 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 28:9</span></span>

Hail - The word in its primary sense means, "Rejoice:" in its secondary
and more usual meaning, "Happiness attend you."

[Matthew 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 28:10</span></span>

Go tell my brethren - I still own them as such, though they so lately
disowned and forsook me.

[Matthew 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 28:13</span></span>

Say, his disciples came by night, and stole him while we slept - Is it
possible, that any man of sense should digest this poor, shallow
inconsistency? If ye were awake, why did you let the disciples steal
him? If asleep, how do you know they did?

[Matthew 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 28:16</span></span>

To the mountain where Jesus had appointed them - This was probably Mount
Tabor, where, (it is commonly supposed,) he had been before
transfigured. It seems to have been here also, that he appeared to above
five hundred brethren at once.

[Matthew 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 28:18</span></span>

All power is given to me - Even as man. As God, he had all power from
eternity.

[Matthew 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 28:19</span></span>

Disciple all nations - Make them my disciples. This includes the whole
design of Christ's commission. Baptizing and teaching are the two great
branches of that general design. And these were to be determined by the
circumstances of things; which made it necessary in baptizing adult Jews
or heathens, to teach them before they were baptized; in discipling
their children, to baptize them before they were taught; as the Jewish
children in all ages were first circumcised, and after taught to do all
God had commanded them. [Mar 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md).
