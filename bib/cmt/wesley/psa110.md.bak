### [Psalms Chapter 110](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 110:1</span></span>

The Lord - God the father. Said - Decreed it from eternity, and in due
time published this decree, and actually executed it; which he did when
he raised up Christ from the dead, and brought him into his heavenly
mansion. Unto - Unto his son the Messiah, whom David designedly calls
his Lord, to admonish the whole church, that although he was his son
according to his human nature, yet he had an higher nature, and was also
his Lord, as being God blessed for ever, and consequently Lord of all
things. The Hebrew word Adon is one of God's titles, signifying his
power and authority over all things, and therefore is most fitly given
to the Messiah, to whom God hath delegated all his power [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md). Sit - Now take thy rest and the
possession of that sovereign kingdom and glory, which by right belongeth
to thee; do thou rule with me with equal power and majesty, as thou art
God; and with an authority and honour far above all creatures, as thou
art man. Make - By my almighty power communicated to thee as God by
eternal generation, and vouchsafed to thee as mediator. Enemies - All
ungodly men, sin and death, and the devil. Footstool - Thy slaves and
vassals.

[Psalms 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 110:2</span></span>

The rod - Thy strong or powerful rod, and the rod is put for his
scepter, or kingly power: but as the kingdom of Christ is not carnal,
but spiritual, so this scepter is nothing else but his word. Zion - From
Jerusalem.

[Psalms 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 110:3</span></span>

People - Thy subjects, shall offer thee as their king and Lord, not oxen
or sheep, but themselves, their souls and bodies, as living sacrifices,
and as freewill - offerings, giving up themselves to the Lord, [Co2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005.md), to live to him, and to die for
him. The day - When thou shalt take into thy hands the rod of thy
strength, and set up thy kingdom in the world. In the beauties - Adorned
with the beautiful and glorious robes of righteousness and true
holiness. The dew - That is, thy offspring (the members of the Christian
church) shall be more numerous than the drops of the morning dew.

[Psalms 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 110:4</span></span>

Sworn - That this priesthood might be made sure and irrevocable.

[Psalms 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 110:5</span></span>

The Lord - God the son; the Lord, who is at thy right - hand. Strike -
Shall destroy all those kings who are obstinate enemies to him.

[Psalms 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 110:6</span></span>

Judge - Condemn and punish them. The places - Or, the place of battle.
Dead bodies - Of his enemies. Heads - All those princes who oppose him.
But this and the like passages are not to be understood grossly, but
spiritually, according to the nature of Christ's kingdom.

[Psalms 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 110:7</span></span>

Drink - He shall have a large portion of afflictions, while he is in the
way or course of his life, before he comes to that honour of sitting at
his father's right - hand. Waters in scripture frequently signify
sufferings. To drink of them, signifies to feel or bear them. Therefore
- He shall be exalted to great glory and felicity.
