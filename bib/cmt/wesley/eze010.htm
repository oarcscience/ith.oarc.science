<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 10:4</A></FONT></span></p>The glory - The visible token of the presence of the God of glory. Went up - In token of his departure from the temple. And stood - Shewing his unwillingness to leave, and giving them time to return to him, he stands where he might he seen, both by priests and people, that both might be moved to repentance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005">Ezekiel 10:5</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 10:10</A></FONT></span></p>They - The wheels. This intimates the references of providence to each other, and their dependences on each other: and the joint tendency of all to one common end, while their motions appear to us intricate and perplexed, yea, seemingly contrary. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011">Ezekiel 10:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 10:11</A></FONT></span></p>When - The wheels moved by the cherubim, or that spirit of life, which moved the living creatures.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 10:12</A></FONT></span></p>And - Now he describes both the cherubim and wheels as full of wisdom, and as governed by an excellent wisdom. The wheels - Which the four cherubim had to move, govern, and direct.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">eze 10:17</A></FONT></span></p>For - There is a perfect harmony between second causes in their dependence on, and subjection to, the one infinite, wise, good, holy, and just God. The spirit of God directs all the creatures, upper and lower, so that they shall serve the divine purpose. Events are not determined by the wheel of fortune, which is blind, but by the wheels of providence, which are full of eyes.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019">Ezekiel 10:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">eze 10:19</A></FONT></span></p>And every one - The glory, the cherubim, the wheels, all stood, respiting execution, and giving opportunity of preventing the approaching misery. The east gate - The last court, the court of the people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020">Ezekiel 10:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">eze 10:20</A></FONT></span></p>I knew - Either by special assurance as a prophet, or by comparing them with those which he had often seen in the temple.
