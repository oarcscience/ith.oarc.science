[Amos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 3:2</span></span>

Know - Chosen, adopted to be my peculiar ones. Therefore - Because you
have all these obligations and abused all these mercies.

[Amos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 3:3</span></span>

Agreed - Can you have God's presence while you walk so contrary to him?

[Amos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 3:5</span></span>

Can a bird fall - So here for your sins, God will cast the net over you.
Shall one take up a snare - The fowler will not take up the snare,
before the prey be taken in it.

[Amos 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 3:6</span></span>

Afraid - Affected with the danger. Evil - Such as plague or famine. Done
it - Either immediately by his own hand, or by the hands of those he
employs. Whoever are the instruments, God is the principal agent. Out of
his mouth both good and evil proceed.

[Amos 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 3:7</span></span>

Will do nothing - Usually the Lord doth no great thing for or against
his people, without giving warning of it before it comes.

[Amos 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 3:8</span></span>

Hath roared - As a lion roareth when near his prey: so God hath terribly
threatened what is near to be done. Prophesy - Amos can not but speak
what he had heard.

[Amos 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 3:9</span></span>

Publish - Ye prophets invite strangers to come and observe what cause I
have to do what I threaten. Tumults - The seditious counsels, and
rebellious conspiracies among them. The oppressed - Multitudes of
oppressed ones, as the usurpers took it to be their interest to crush
all they feared or suspected. In the midst - Yea, throughout the whole
kingdom of Samaria.

[Amos 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 3:10</span></span>

Store up - As men lay up wealth in their treasures, perverting judgment,
first condemning the innocent, next seizing all his substance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 3:11</span></span>

Therefore - Because of all the violence and rapine with other crying
sins. An adversary - The Assyrian. Round about - Shall beset the whole
land as one besieged city.

[Amos 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 3:12</span></span>

As the shepherd - As the shepherd doth hardly rescue a small part of a
sheep or lamb from the lion, so a small part of the children of Israel,
shall escape when Samaria is taken. The corner of a bed - Lying in some
dark corner. Damascus - The chief city of Syria taken by Tiglath -
Pilneser about the time when he wasted Israel. In a couch - Some few of
the poor, shall escape, pitied by the enemy, when he finds them sick
upon their couch.

[Amos 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 3:13</span></span>

Hear ye - Prophets. The God of hosts - Who is Lord of all, and hath all
power in his hand.

[Amos 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 3:14</span></span>

Of Israel - The many and great transgressions of the ten tribes.

[Amos 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 3:15</span></span>

The winter - house - Which probably was in the chief city, whither the
great men retired in the winter. The summer - house - The houses of
pleasure, where the nobles and rich men spent the summer time. Of ivory
- Beautified with ivory.
