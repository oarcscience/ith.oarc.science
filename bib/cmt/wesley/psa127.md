### [Psalms Chapter 127](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 127:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 127:1</span></span>

Build - Assist and bless those that build it.

[Psalms 127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 127:2</span></span>

You - Builders, or watchmen. To sit - To use constant and unwearied
diligence. So - By his blessing. Giveth - Freely, without that
immoderate toiling, wherewith others pursue it.

[Psalms 127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 127:3</span></span>

Children - The chief of these blessings. Heritage - Only from God's
blessing, even as an inheritance is not the fruit of a man's own labour,
but the gift of God.

[Psalms 127:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 127:4</span></span>

Youth - These he prefers before other children, because they live
longest with their parents, and to their comfort and support, whereas
children born in old age seldom come to maturity before their parents
death.

[Psalms 127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 127:5</span></span>

Full - Who hath a numerous issue. Shall speak - They shall courageously
plead their cause in courts of judicature, not fearing to be crushed by
the might of their adversaries.
