### [Esther Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#001.md)

[Esther 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 7:3</span></span>

My life - It is my only request, that thou wouldst not give me up to the
malice of that man who designs to take away my life. Even a stranger, a
criminal, shall be permitted to petition for his life. But that a
friend, a wife, a queen, should have occasion to make such a petition,
was very affecting.

[Esther 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 7:4</span></span>

Sold - By the cruelty of that man who offered a great sum to purchase
our destruction. Countervail - His ten thousand talents would not repair
the king's loss, in the customs and tributes which the king receives
from the Jews, within his dominions.

[Esther 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 7:5</span></span>

Who, &c. - The expressions are short and doubled, as proceeding from a
discomposed and enraged mind. Durst - That is, to circumvent me, and
procure a decree, whereby not only my estate should be so much impaired,
and so many of my innocent subjects destroyed, but my queen also
involved in the same destruction. We sometimes startle at that evil,
which we ourselves are chargeable with. Ahasuerus is amazed at that
wickedness, which he himself was guilty of. For he consented to the
bloody edict. So that Esther might have said, Thou art the man!

[Esther 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 7:6</span></span>

Afraid - And it was time for him to fear, when the queen was his
prosecutor, the king his judge, his own conscience a witness against
him. And the surprising turns of providence that very morning, could not
but increase his fear.

[Esther 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 7:7</span></span>

Went - As disdaining the company and sight of so audacious a person: to
cool and allay his troubled and inflamed spirits, and to consider what
punishment was fit to be inflicted upon him. He saw - By the violent
commotion of the king's mind.

[Esther 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 7:8</span></span>

Bed - On which the queen sat at meat. Force - Will he attempt my queen's
chastity, as he hath already attempted her life! He speaks not this out
of real jealousy, but from an exasperated mind, which takes all
occasions to vent itself against the person who gave the provocation.
They - The king's and queen's chamberlains attending upon them. Covered
- That the king might not be offended or grieved with the sight of a
person whom he now loathed: and because they looked upon him as a
condemned person; for the faces of such used to be covered.
