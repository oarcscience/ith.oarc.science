<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002">Psalms 24:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 24:2</A></FONT></span></p>Seas - The whole collection of waters, as well as the sea and the rivers running into it, as that great abyss of waters which is contained in the bowels of the earth. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#003">Psalms 24:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 24:3</A></FONT></span></p>The hill - Zion or Moriah, the place of God's sanctuary and special presence. Having asserted God's dominion over all mankind, he now proposes an important question, by whom God will be served, and his blessing enjoyed? Stand - To minister before him. Standing is the posture of ministers or servants. Who shall serve God, with God's acceptation. Holy place - In the place which he hath sanctified for his service. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004">Psalms 24:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 24:4</A></FONT></span></p>He - Whose actions and conversation are holy and unblameable. Pure heart - Careful to approve itself to God, as well as to men; ordering a man's very thoughts and affections according to God's word. Vanity - Who doth not value or desire the vain things of this life, such as honours, riches, pleasures; but makes God his portion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005">Psalms 24:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 24:5</A></FONT></span></p>The blessing - Grace and glory, and all other good things. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#006">Psalms 24:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 24:6</A></FONT></span></p>The generation - The true progeny which God regards. Face - His grace and favour, which is often called God's face. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007">Psalms 24:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 24:7</A></FONT></span></p>Lift up - He speaks here of the gates and doors of the temple, which by faith and the spirit of prophecy, he beheld as already built, whose doors he calls Everlasting, not so much because they were made of strong and durable materials, as in opposition to those of the tabernacle, which were removed from place to place. These gates he bids lift up their heads, or tops, by allusion to those gates which have a portcullis, which may be let down or taken up. And as the temple was a type of Christ, and of his church, and of heaven itself; so this place may also contain a representation, either of Christ's entrance into his church, or into the hearts of his faithful people, who are here commanded to set open their hearts and souls for his reception: or of his ascension into heaven, where the saints or angels are poetically introduced as preparing the way, and opening the heavenly gates to receive their Lord and king, returning to his royal habitation with triumph and glory. The king - The Messiah, the king of Israel, and of his church, called the King, or Lord of glory, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008">Co1 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001">Jam 2:1</A>, both for that glory which is inherent in him, and that which is purchased by him for his members. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008">Psalms 24:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 24:8</A></FONT></span></p>The Lord - He is no ordinary person, no other than Jehovah, who hath given so many proofs of his almightiness, who hath subdued all his enemies, and is now returned in triumph. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#009">Psalms 24:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">psa 24:9</A></FONT></span></p>Lift up - The same verse is repeated again, to awaken the dulness of mankind, who are so hardly brought to a serious preparation for such solemnities; and to signify the great importance of the matter, contained under these expressions. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010">Psalms 24:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 24:10</A></FONT></span></p>Of hosts - Under whose command are all the hosts of heaven and earth, angels and men, and all other creatures.
