### [Philippians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 3:1</span></span>

The same things - Which you have heard before.

[Philippians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 3:2</span></span>

Beware of dogs - Unclean, unholy, rapacious men. The title which the
Jews usually gave the gentiles, he returns upon themselves. The
concision - Circumcision being now ceased, the apostle will not call
them the circumcision, but coins a term on purpose, taken from a Greek
word used by the LXX, [Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005.md), for
such a cutting as God had forbidden.

[Philippians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 3:3</span></span>

For we - Christians. Are the only true circumcision - The people now in
covenant with God. Who worship God in spirit - Not barely in the letter,
but with the spiritual worship of inward holiness. And glory in Christ
Jesus - As the only cause of all our blessings. And have no confidence
in the flesh - In any outward advantage or prerogative.

[Philippians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 3:4</span></span>

Though I - He subjoins this in the singular number, because the
Philippians could not say thus.

[Philippians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 3:5</span></span>

Circumcised the eighth day - Not at ripe age, as a proselyte. Of the
tribe of Benjamin - Sprung from the wife, not the handmaid. An Hebrew of
Hebrews - By both my parents; in everything, nation, religion, language.
Touching the law, a pharisee - One of that sect who most accurately
observe it.

[Philippians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 3:6</span></span>

Having such a zeal for it as to persecute to the death those who did not
observe it. Touching the righteousness which is described and enjoined
by the Law - That is, external observances, blameless.

[Philippians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 3:7</span></span>

But all these things, which I then accounted gain, which were once my
confidence, my glory, and joy, those, ever since I have believed, I have
accounted loss, nothing worth in comparison of Christ.

[Philippians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 3:8</span></span>

Yea, I still account both all these and all things else to be mere loss,
compared to the inward, experimental knowledge of Christ, as my Lord, as
my prophet, priest, and king, as teaching me wisdom, atoning for my
sins, and reigning in my heart. To refer this to justification only, is
miserably to pervert the whole scope of the words. They manifestly
relate to sanctification also; yea, to that chiefly. For whom I have
actually suffered the loss of all things - Which the world loves,
esteems, or admires; of which I am so far from repenting, that I still
account them but dung - The discourse rises. Loss is sustained with
patience, but dung is cast away with abhorrence. The Greek word
signifies any, the vilest refuse of things, the dross of metals, the
dregs of liquors, the excrements of animals, the most worthless scraps
of meat, the basest offals, fit only for dogs. That I may gain Christ -
He that loses all things, not excepting himself, gains Christ, and is
gained by Christ. And still there is more; which even St. Paul speaks of
his having not yet gained.

[Philippians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 3:9</span></span>

And be found by God ingrafted in him, not having my own righteousness,
which is of the law - That merely outward righteousness prescribed by
the law, and performed by my own strength. But that inward righteousness
which is through faith - Which can flow from no other fountain. The
righteousness which is from God - From his almighty Spirit, not by my
own strength, but by faith alone. Here also the apostle is far from
speaking of justification only.

[Philippians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 3:10</span></span>

The knowledge of Christ, mentioned in [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md), is here more largely explained.
That I may know him - As my complete Saviour. And the power of his
resurrection - Raising me from the death of sin, into all the life of
love. And the fellowship of his sufferings - Being crucified with him.
And made conformable to his death - So as to be dead to all things here
below.

[Philippians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 3:11</span></span>

The resurrection of the dead - That is, the resurrection to glory.

[Philippians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 3:12</span></span>

Not that I have already attained - The prize. He here enters on a new
set of metaphors, taken from a race. But observe how, in the utmost
fervour, he retains his sobriety of spirit. Or am already perfected -
There is a difference between one that is perfect, and one that is
perfected. The one is fitted for the race, [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md); the other, ready to receive the
prize. But I pursue, if I may apprehend that - Perfect holiness,
preparatory to glory. For, in order to which I was apprehended by Christ
Jesus - Appearing to me in the way, [Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014.md). The speaking conditionally both
here and in the preceding verse, implies no uncertainty, but only the
difficulty of attaining.

[Philippians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 3:13</span></span>

I do not account myself to have apprehended this already; to be already
possessed of perfect holiness.

[Philippians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 3:14</span></span>

Forgetting the things that are behind - Even that part of the race which
is already run. And reaching forth unto - Literally, stretched out over
the things that are before - Pursuing with the whole bent and vigour of
my soul, perfect holiness and eternal glory. In Christ Jesus - The
author and finisher of every good thing.

[Philippians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 3:15</span></span>

Let us, as many as are perfect - Fit for the race, strong in faith; so
it means here. Be thus minded - Apply wholly to this one thing. And if
in anything ye - Who are not perfect, who are weak in faith. Be
otherwise minded - Pursuing other things. God, if ye desire it, shall
reveal even this unto you - Will convince you of it.

[Philippians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 3:16</span></span>

But let us take care not to lose the ground we have already gained. Let
us walk by the same rule we have done hitherto.

[Philippians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 3:17</span></span>

Mark them - For your imitation.

[Philippians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 3:18</span></span>

Weeping - As he wrote. Enemies of the cross of Christ - Such are all
cowardly, all shamefaced, all delicate Christians.

[Philippians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 3:19</span></span>

Whose end is destruction - This is placed in the front, that what
follows may be read with the greater horror. Whose god is their belly -
Whose supreme happiness lies in gratifying their sensual appetites. Who
mind - Relish, desire, seek, earthly things.

[Philippians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 3:20</span></span>

Our conversation - The Greek word is of a very extenslve meaning: our
citizenship, our thoughts, our affections, are already in heaven.

[Philippians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 3:21</span></span>

Who will transform our vile body - Into the most perfect state, and the
most beauteous form. It will then be purer than the unspotted firmament,
brighter than the lustre of the stars and, which exceeds all parallel,
which comprehends all perfection, like unto his glorious body - Like
that wonderfully glorious body which he wears in his heavenly kingdom,
and on his triumphant throne.
