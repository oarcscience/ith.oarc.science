### [Psalms Chapter 87](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 87:1</span></span>

Its foundation - The foundation of the temple of God.

[Psalms 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 87:2</span></span>

Zion - That is, Zion itself, or Jerusalem, which was built upon and near
mount Zion. He saith Zion rather than Jerusalem, to intimate that he
loved Jerusalem for Zion's sake, or for the temple, which he chose for
his peculiar dwelling place.

[Psalms 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 87:4</span></span>

Rahab - Egypt, so called, either from its pride or natural strength.
Babylon - Under these two and Philistia, the constant enemies of Israel,
he seems to understand all the enemies of the church of God, who shall
now be not only reconciled but united to them. Arabia - The nations on
every side of them, for Tyre was on the north, Arabia on the South;
those nearest to them, and those more remote from them.

[Psalms 87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 87:5</span></span>

Zion - Of Jerusalem, or the church of God. Said - It shall be
acknowledged. Man - Heb. Man and man, all sorts of men without
difference of nations. Establish - And this shall not be a transient,
but a lasting work; Zion shall continue in its strength and fertility
because the Almighty God is her founder and protector.

[Psalms 87:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 87:6</span></span>

When - When God, the maker and governor of this city shall take a survey
of all his citizens. It is an allusion to princes or governors of cities
that use to write and keep a register of all their people.

[Psalms 87:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 87:7</span></span>

Singers - There shall be great rejoicing and praising God, both with
vocal and instrumental musick, for this glorious work of the conversion
of the Gentiles. He describe's evangelical worship, by legal phrases and
customs, as the prophets frequently do. In thee - In Zion or the church.
These words may be here added as the burden of the song, which these
singers are supposed to have sung, in the name of all the people of God.
All our desires and delights are in thee, all the springs of mercy,
grace, and glory, flow to us only in and thro' thee.
