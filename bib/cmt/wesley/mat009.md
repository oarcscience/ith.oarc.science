### [Matthew Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

[Matthew 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 9:1</span></span>

His own city - Capernaum, [Mat 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013).
[Mar 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#018); [Luk
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#037).

[Matthew 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 9:2</span></span>

Seeing their faith - Both that of the paralytic, and of them that
brought him. Son - A title of tenderness and condescension. [Mar
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003); [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).

[Matthew 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 9:3</span></span>

This man blasphemeth - Attributing to himself a power (that of forgiving
sins) which belongs to God only.

[Matthew 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 9:5</span></span>

Which is easier - Do not both of them argue a Divine power? Therefore if
I can heal his disease, I can forgive his sins: especially as his
disease is the consequence of his sins. Therefore these must be taken
away, if that is.

[Matthew 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 9:6</span></span>

On earth - Even in my state of humiliation.

[Matthew 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 9:8</span></span>

So what was to the scribes an occasion of blaspheming, was to the people
an incitement to praise God.

[Matthew 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 9:9</span></span>

He saw a man named Matthew - Modestly so called by himself. The other
evangelists call him by his more honourable name, Levi. Sitting - In the
very height of his business, at the receipt of custom - The custom
house, or place where the customs were received. [Mar
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#014); [Luk
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027).

[Matthew 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 9:10</span></span>

As Jesus sat at table in the house - Of Matthew, who having invited many
of his old companions, made him a feast, [Mar
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015); and that a great one, though he
does not himself mention it. The publicans, or collectors of the taxes
which the Jews paid the Romans, were infamous for their illegal
exactions: Sinners - Open, notorious, sinners.

[Matthew 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 9:11</span></span>

The Pharisees said to his disciples, Why eateth your Master? - Thus they
commonly ask our Lord, Why do thy disciples this? And his disciples, Why
doth your Master?

[Matthew 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 9:13</span></span>

Go ye and learn - Ye that take upon you to teach others. I will have
mercy and not sacrifice - That is, I will have mercy rather than
sacrifice. I love acts of mercy better than sacrifice itself. [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006).

[Matthew 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 9:14</span></span>

Then - While he was at table. [Mar
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018); [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).

[Matthew 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 9:15</span></span>

The children of the bride chamber - The companions of the bridegroom.
Mourn - Mourning and fasting usually go together. As if he had said,
While I am with them, it is a festival time, a season of rejoicing, not
mourning. But after I am gone, all my disciples likewise shall be in
fastings often.

[Matthew 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 9:16</span></span>

This is one reason, - It is not a proper time for them to fast. Another
is, they are not ripe for it. New cloth - The words in the original
properly signify cloth that hath not passed through the fuller's hands,
and which is consequently much harsher than what has been washed and
worn; and therefore yielding less than that, will tear away the edges to
which it is sewed.

[Matthew 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 9:17</span></span>

New - Fermenting wine will soon burst those bottles, the leather of
which is almost worn out. The word properly means vessels made of goats'
skins, wherein they formerly put wine, (and do in some countries to this
day) to convey it from place to place. Put new wine into new bottles -
Give harsh doctrines to such as have strength to receive them.

[Matthew 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 9:18</span></span>

Just dead - He had left her at the point of death, [Mar
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#023). Probably a messenger had now
informed him she was dead. [Mar 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022);
[Luk 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#041).

[Matthew 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 9:20</span></span>

Coming behind - Out of bashfulness and humility.

[Matthew 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 9:22</span></span>

Take courage - Probably she was struck with fear, when he turned and
looked upon her, [Mar 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#033); [Luk
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047); lest she should have offended
him, by touching his garment privately; and the more so, because she was
unclean according to the law, [Lev
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#025).

[Matthew 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 9:23</span></span>

The minstrels - The musicians. The original word means flute players.
Musical instruments were used by the Jews as well as the heathens, in
their lamentations for the dead, to soothe the melancholy of surviving
friends, by soft and solemn notes. And there were persons who made it
their business to perform this, while others sung to their music. Flutes
were used especially on the death of children; louder instruments on the
death of grown persons.

[Matthew 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 9:24</span></span>

Withdraw - There is no need of you now; for the maid is not dead - Her
life is not at an end; but sleepeth - This is only a temporary
suspension of sense and motion, which should rather be termed sleep than
death.

[Matthew 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 9:25</span></span>

The maid arose - Christ raised three dead persons to life; this child,
the widow's son, and Lazarus: one newly departed, another on the bier,
the third smelling in the grave: to show us that no degree of death is
so desperate as to be past his help.

[Matthew 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 9:32</span></span>

[Luk 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014).

[Matthew 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 9:33</span></span>

Even in Israel - Where so many wonders have been seen.

[Matthew 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 9:36</span></span>

Because they were faint - In soul rather than in body. As sheep having
no shepherd - And yet they had many teachers; they had scribes in every
city. But they had none who cared for their souls, and none that were
able, if they had been willing, to have wrought any deliverance. They
had no pastors after God's own heart.

[Matthew 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 9:37</span></span>

The harvest truly is great - When Christ came into the world, it was
properly the time of harvest; till then it was the seed time only. But
the labourers are few - Those whom God sends; who are holy, and convert
sinners. Of others there are many. [Luk
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#002).

[Matthew 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 9:38</span></span>

The Lord of the harvest - Whose peculiar work and office it is, and who
alone is able to do it: that he would thrust forth - for it is an employ
not pleasing to flesh and blood; so full of reproach, labour, danger,
temptation of every kind, that nature may well be averse to it. Those
who never felt this, never yet knew what it is to be labourers in
Christ's harvest. He sends them forth, when he calls them by his Spirit,
furnishes them with grace and gifts for the work, and makes a way for
them to be employed therein.
