Insurrection - A crime which the Roman governors, and Pilate in

[Mark 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 15:9</span></span>

Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews - Which does this
wretched man discover most? Want of justice, or courage, or common
sense? The poor coward sacrifices justice to popular clamour, and
enrages those whom he seeks to appease, by so unseasonably repeating
that title, The king of the Jews, which he could not but know was so
highly offensive to them.

[Mark 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 15:16</span></span>

Praetorium - The inner hall, where the praetor, a Roman magistrate, used
to give judgment. But St. John calls the whole palace by this name. [Mat

purple is said not to have been very different from scarlet.

and treating him as an enemy, while he bare our sins.
