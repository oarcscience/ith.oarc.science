### [Psalms Chapter 68](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 68:4</span></span>

Jah - Is an abbreviation of the name Jehovah, which the Heathens
pronounced Jao. Before him - Before the ark where he is present, as
David is said to dance before the Lord, upon this occasion, [Sa2

Egypt.

Weary - Dry and thirsty, and parched with excessive heat, and ready to
faint for want of rain, [Psa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 68:10</span></span>

Thy congregation - The people of Israel. It - This land for the use of
thy people: which God did by designing it for them, and expelling the
old inhabitants; by furnishing it with all sorts of provisions, and
making it fruitful by his special blessing. Poor - Such thy really were,
when God undertook the conduct of them into Canaan.

[Psalms 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 68:11</span></span>

Gave - He put this triumphant song into their mouths.

[Psalms 68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 68:12</span></span>

Kings - The kings of Canaan, and other nations who came forth against
the Israelites, accompanied with great and numerous armies. The spoil -
There was enough, not only for those who took it, but also to be divided
to their wives and children, when they came home.

[Psalms 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 68:13</span></span>

Ye - Ye Israelites. Ye are - Tho' you have formerly been exposed to
great reproach and misery, yet God hath changed your condition. Gold -
Beautiful and glorious, like the feathers of a dove, which according to
the variety of its postures, and of the light shining upon it, look like
silver and gold.

[Psalms 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 68:14</span></span>

Therein - In Canaan, at the coming of the Israelites. The land was as
white as mount Salmon is with the snow.

[Psalms 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 68:15</span></span>

The hill - Zion, the seat of God's ark. High hill - Which is not to be
understood of external height, but of its spiritual height, or
exaltation, in regard of the glorious privileges of God's presence, and
worship.

[Psalms 68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 68:16</span></span>

Leap - Why do you triumph and look upon Zion with contempt? He speaks to
the hills by an usual figure. Will dwell - This hill, though despicable
in your eyes, is precious in God's, and chosen by him for his perpetual
residence.

[Psalms 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 68:17</span></span>

Chariots - The armies (whereof chariots were an eminent part in those
times) which attend upon God to do his pleasure. Twenty thousand - An
innumerable company, a certain number being put for an uncertain. Among
them - Here the psalmist seems to be transported by the prophetic
spirit, from the narration of those external successes, to the
prediction of the Messiah; and of the transcendent privileges and
blessings accruing to mankind thereby. As in Sinai - God is no less
gloriously, though less terribly present here, than he was in Sinai,
when the great God attended with thousands of his angels, solemnly
appeared to deliver the law. Yea, here is a greater privilege than Sinai
had, The Lord Jehovah descending from heaven into an human body, as
appears by his ascending thither again, which the next verse describes.

[Psalms 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 68:18</span></span>

Ascended - This has a manifest reference to Christ, and his ascension
into heaven, in whom alone it is literally accomplished, and to whom
therefore it is ascribed, [Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md).
Although the expressions are borrowed from the ancient custom of
princes, who, after some glorious achievements, used to go up into their
royal cities in triumphant chariots, being attended by their captive
enemies, and afterward to distribute gifts to their soldiers and
subjects, and sometimes to do some acts of clemency even to their rebels
and enemies. Captivity - Those whom thou hast taken captive; death and
sin, and the devil, and all the enemies of Christ, and of his people,
whom Christ led in triumph, having spoiled them, and making a shew of
them openly, [Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md). Received -
According to thy manhood thou hast received from God all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge, and all those gifts and graces of the Holy
Spirit, which are necessary either to the perfection of thy nature, or
to the good of thy church and people. Rebellious - Thy most stubborn and
rebellious enemies, whether Jews or Gentiles. Might dwell - That he who
as man is ascended into the highest heavens, might, as God, come down to
them, and dwell with them, not only in and by his ordinances in which he
is present, but also by his spirit dwelling in their hearts.

[Psalms 68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 68:20</span></span>

Issues - Escapes or deliverances.

[Psalms 68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 68:21</span></span>

Hairy - In ancient times many people used to wear long and shaggy hair,
that their looks might be more terrible to their enemies.

[Psalms 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 68:22</span></span>

Bring again - I will give my people as great deliverances as I formerly
did, when I saved them from Og, king of Bashan. The sea - From the
Egyptians at the Red Sea.

[Psalms 68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 68:23</span></span>

That, &c. - And as it was at the Red Sea, and at Bashan before, so yet
again thine enemies shall be slain in such numbers, that thou mayst wade
in their blood, and thy dogs lick it up in the field.

[Psalms 68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 68:24</span></span>

They - Men saw and observed it. Goings - The procession of the ark to
Zion, the solemnity whereof is particularly described in the following
verses. The sanctuary - The tabernacle prepared for it.

[Psalms 68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 68:26</span></span>

Fountain - All ye people of Israel.

[Psalms 68:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 68:27</span></span>

There is - Present in this solemn pomp of carrying the ark to Zion.
Little - Called little, because it was exceedingly diminished, and
almost extinguished under the Judges, [Jdg
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#035.md), [Jdg
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#003.md) &c. Ruler - The tribe which had
lately swayed the scepter, but now submitted to David. Company - The
people of that tribe who waited upon them. Zebulun, &c. - He mentions
these tribes, because they lived in the remotest parts of the land of
Canaan. And so by naming two of the nearest tribes, and two of the
farthest, he intimates that the other tribes also came upon this
occasion, as is manifest from [Sa2
6:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015.md).

[Psalms 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 68:28</span></span>

Thy God - Having spoken of Israel, he now directs his speech to them.
Commanded - Hath ordained or effectually procured. Thy strength - all
that strength and power which thou hast put forth at any time

[Psalms 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 68:29</span></span>

thy temple - The temple which Solomon shall build. Kings - Kings of the
Gentiles: which was done in part, in the times of Solomon and Hezekiah,
but more fully when the Lord was come into his temple.

[Psalms 68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 68:30</span></span>

Rebuke - Chastise those that will not bring presents to thee. The bulls
- The fierce and furious adversaries of God, and of his church; the
calves, are people or soldiers depending upon them. Delight - That
merely out of a love to mischief and spoil, make war upon others, and
upon us particularly.

[Psalms 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 68:31</span></span>

Ethiopia - He names these, as the ancient enemies of God, and of his
people; but by them he understands all other nations of the like
character. Unto God - Begging mercy of him. This prophecy, as also the
next verse, evidently belongs to the times of the Messiah.

[Psalms 68:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 68:33</span></span>

Heavens - The highest heavens; dwelling there in infinite glory, and
from thence looking down upon all the inhabitants of the earth, and
ruling them by his almighty power. Of old - From the beginning of the
world; whereas the ark was only some hundred years old. A voice - His
gospel, published by Christ and his apostles, assisted by the Holy
Spirit sent from heaven; which might well be called God's voice, and
that a mighty voice, because it produced such great and wonderful
effects.

[Psalms 68:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 68:34</span></span>

Ascribe - Acknowledge that he is able to do whatsoever he pleaseth.
Excellency - His excellent power and goodness. Is over - Dwells among
them. He is indeed the universal Lord, but in a special manner, he is
the God of Israel.

[Psalms 68:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 68:35</span></span>

Terrible - Deservedly to be feared.
