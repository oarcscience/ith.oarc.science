### [Psalms Chapter 144](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 144:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 144:2</span></span>

Subdued - Who hath disposed my peoples hearts to receive and obey me as
their king.

[Psalms 144:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 144:5</span></span>

Come - To help me. Smoke - As Sinai did at thy glorious appearance, [Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md). This is a figurative and
poetical description of God's coming to take vengeance upon his enemies.

[Psalms 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 144:7</span></span>

Strange children - Either of the Heathen nations: or of the rebellious
Israelites.

[Psalms 144:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 144:8</span></span>

Vanity - Vain brags and threatenings which shall come to nothing.
Falsehood - Deceiving themselves, by being unable to do what they
designed; and others, by not giving them that help which they promised.

[Psalms 144:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 144:12</span></span>

That - This mercy I beg not only for my own sake, but for the sake of
thy people, that they may enjoy those blessings which thou hast promised
them; and particularly, that our sons, who are the strength and hopes of
a nation, may be like plants, flourishing and growing in height and
strength, as plants do in their youth; for when they grow old, they
wither and decay. Cornerstone - Strong and beautiful.

[Psalms 144:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 144:14</span></span>

Breaking in - Of enemies invading the land, or assaulting our cities,
and making breaches in their walls. Going out - Of our people, either
out of the cities to fight with an invading enemy: or out of the land
into captivity.
