### [Joshua Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 9:2</span></span>

Together - They entered into a league to do this. Tho' they were many
kings of different nations, and doubtless of different interests, often
at variance with each other, yet they are all determined to unite
against Israel. O that Israel would learn this of Canaanites, to
sacrifice private interests to the public good, and to lay aside all
animosities among themselves, that they may cordially unite against the
common enemy.

[Joshua 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 9:3</span></span>

Gibeon - A great and royal city of the Hivites.

[Joshua 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 9:4</span></span>

Been ambassadors - Sent from a far country.

[Joshua 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 9:6</span></span>

The camp at Gilgal - The place of their head - quarters. Men of Israel -
To those who used to meet in council with Joshua, to whom it belonged to
make leagues, even the princes of the congregation. Now therefore -
Because we are not of this people, whom, as we are informed, you are
obliged utterly to destroy.

[Joshua 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 9:7</span></span>

The Hivites - That is, the Gibeonites who were Hivites, [Jos
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019.md). Among us - That is, in this
land, and so are of that people with whom we are forbidden to make any
league or covenant.

[Joshua 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 9:8</span></span>

Thy servants - We desire a league with you upon your own terms; we are
ready to accept of any conditions. From whence came ye - For this free
and general concession gave Joshua cause to suspect that they were
Canaanites.

[Joshua 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 9:9</span></span>

Name of the Lord - Being moved thereunto by the report of his great and
glorious nature and works; so they gave them hopes that they would
embrace their religion. In Egypt - They cunningly mention those things
only which were done some time ago, and say nothing of dividing Jordan,
or the destruction of Jericho and Ai, as if they lived so far off that
the fame of those things had not yet reached them.

[Joshua 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 9:13</span></span>

The bottles - Leathern bottles.

[Joshua 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 9:14</span></span>

The men - That is, the princes. Their victuals - That they might examine
the truth of what they said. The mouth of the Lord - As they ought to
have done upon all such weighty occasions. So they are accused of
rashness and neglect of their duty. For though it is probable, if God
had been consulted, he would have consented to the sparing of the
Gibeonites; yet it should have been done with more caution, and an
obligation upon them to embrace the true religion. In every business of
importance, we should stay to take God along with us, and by the word
and prayer consult him. Many a time our affairs miscarry, because we
asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. Did we acknowledge him in
all our ways, they would be more safe, easy and successful.

[Joshua 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 9:15</span></span>

To let them live - That is, they should not destroy them. That this
league was lawful and obliging, appears, Because Joshua and all the
princes, upon the review concluded it so to be, and spared them
accordingly. Because God punished the violation of it long after, [Sa2
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md). Because God is said to have
hardened the hearts of all other cities, not to seek peace with Israel,
that so he might utterly destroy them, [Jos
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019.md), which seems to imply that
their utter destruction did not necessarily come upon them by virtue of
any peremptory command of God, but by their own obstinate hardness,
whereby they refused to make peace with the Israelites.

[Joshua 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 9:16</span></span>

Three days - That is, at the last of them, or upon the third day, as it
is said, [Jos 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md).

[Joshua 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 9:17</span></span>

And Kirjath - jearim - Which cities were subject to Gibeon, the royal
city,[Jos 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 9:18</span></span>

Against the princes - Both from that proneness which is in people to
censure the actions of their rulers; and from their desire of the spoil
of these cities.

[Joshua 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 9:21</span></span>

Unto all the congregation - That is, Let them be public servants, and
employed in the meanest offices, (one kind being put for all the rest)
for the use of the congregation; to do this partly for the sacrifices
and services of the house of God, which otherwise the Israelites
themselves must have done; partly for the service of the camp or body of
the people; and sometimes, even to particular Israelites.

[Joshua 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 9:22</span></span>

Called for them - Probably not only the messengers, but the elders of
Gibeon were now present.

[Joshua 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 9:23</span></span>

Ye are cursed - You shall not escape the curse of God which by divine
sentence belongs to all the Canaanites; but only change the quality of
it, you shall feel that curse of bondage, which is proper to your race
by virtue of that ancient decree, [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md). Bond - men - The slavery, which
is upon you shall be entailed on your posterity. The house of my God -
This only service they mention here, because it was their durable
servitude, being first in the tabernacle, and then in the temple, whence
they were called Nethinim, [Ch1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#002.md);
[Ezr 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#043.md), whereas their servitude to
the whole congregation in a great measure ceased when the Israelites
were dispersed to their several habitations.

[Joshua 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 9:25</span></span>

In thine hand - That is, in thy power to use us as thou wilt. Unto thee
- We refer ourselves to thee and thy own piety, and probity, and
faithfulness to thy word and oath; if thou wilt destroy thy humble
suppliants, we submit. Let us in like manner submit to our Lord Jesus,
and refer ourselves to him; saying, We are in thy hand; do unto us as
seemeth right unto thee. Only save our souls: give us our lives for a
prey; and let us serve thee, just as thou wilt!

[Joshua 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 9:27</span></span>

The altar of the Lord - By which appears, that they were not only to do
this service in God's house, but upon all other occasions, as the
congregation needed their help.
