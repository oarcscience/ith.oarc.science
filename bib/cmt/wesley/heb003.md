### [Hebrews Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)

[Hebrews 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 3:1</span></span>

The heavenly calling - God calls from heaven, and to heaven, by the
gospel. Consider the Apostle - The messenger of God, who pleads the
cause of God with us. And High Priest - Who pleads our cause with God.
Both are contained in the one word Mediator. He compares Christ, as an
Apostle, with Moses; as a Priest, with Aaron. Both these offices, which
Moses and Aaron severally bore, he bears together, and far more
eminently. Of our profession - The religion we profess.

[Hebrews 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 3:2</span></span>

His house - The church of Israel, then the peculiar family of God. [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007).

[Hebrews 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 3:3</span></span>

He that hath builded it hath more glory than the house - Than the family
itself, or any member of it.

[Hebrews 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 3:4</span></span>

Now Christ, he that built not only this house, but all things, is God -
And so infinitely greater than Moses or any creature.

[Hebrews 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 3:5</span></span>

And Moses verily - Another proof of the pre - eminence of Christ above
Moses. Was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of
the things which were afterwards to be spoken - That is, which was a
full confirmation of the things which he afterward spake concerning
Christ.

[Hebrews 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 3:6</span></span>

But Christ was faithful as a Son; whose house we are, while we hold
fast, and shall be unto the end, if we hold fast our confidence in God,
and glorying in his promises; our faith and hope.

[Hebrews 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 3:7</span></span>

Wherefore - Seeing he is faithful, be not ye unfaithful. [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007), &c.

[Hebrews 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 3:8</span></span>

As in the provocation - When Israel provoked me by their strife and
murmurings. In the day of temptation - When at the same time they
tempted me, by distrusting my power and goodness. [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).

[Hebrews 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 3:9</span></span>

Where your fathers - That hard - hearted and stiff - necked generation.
So little cause had their descendants to glory in them. Tempted me -
Whether I could and would help them. Proved me - Put my patience to the
proof, even while they saw my glorious works both of judgment and mercy,
and that for forty years.

[Hebrews 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 3:10</span></span>

Wherefore - To speak after the manner of men. I was grieved -
Displeased, offended with that generation, and said, They always err in
their hearts - They are led astray by their stubborn will and vile
affections. And - For this reason, because wickedness has blinded their
understanding. They have not known my ways - By which I would have led
them like a flock. Into my rest - In the promised land.

[Hebrews 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 3:12</span></span>

Take heed, lest there be in any of you - As there was in them. An evil
heart of unbelief - Unbelief is the parent of all evil, and the very
essence of unbelief lies in departing from God, as the living God - The
fountain of all our life, holiness, happiness.

[Hebrews 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 3:13</span></span>

But, to prevent it, exhort one another, while it is called To - day -
This to - day will not last for ever. The day of life will end soon, and
perhaps the day of grace yet sooner.

[Hebrews 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 3:14</span></span>

For we are made partakers of Christ - And we shall still partake of him
and all his benefits, if we hold fast our faith unto the end. If - But
not else; and a supposition made by the Holy Ghost is equal to the,
strongest assertion. Both the sentiment and the manner of expression are
the same as [Heb 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006).

[Hebrews 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 3:16</span></span>

Were they not all that came out of Egypt - An awful consideration! The
whole elect people of God (a very few excepted) provoked God presently
after their great deliverance, continued to grieve his Spirit for forty
years, and perished in their sin!

[Hebrews 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 3:19</span></span>

So we see they could not enter in - Though afterward they desired it.
