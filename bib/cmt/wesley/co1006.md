### [1 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 6:1</span></span>

The unjust - The heathens. A Christian could expect no justice from
these. The saints - Who might easily decide these smaller differences in
a private and friendly manner.

[1 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 6:2</span></span>

Know ye not - This expression occurs six times in this single chapter,
and that with a peculiar force; for the Corinthians knew and gloried in
it, but they did not practise. That the saints - After having been
judged themselves. Shall judge the world - Shall be assessors with
Christ in the judgment wherein he shall condemn all the wicked, as well
angels as men, [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).

[1 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 6:4</span></span>

Them who are of no esteem in the church - That is, heathens, who, as
such, could be in no esteem with the Christians.

[1 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 6:5</span></span>

Is there not one among you, who are such admirers of wisdom, that is
wise enough to decide such causes?

[1 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 6:7</span></span>

Indeed there is a fault, that ye quarrel with each other at all, whether
ye go to law or no. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong - All men cannot
or will not receive this saying. Many aim only at this, "I will neither
do wrong, nor suffer it." These are honest heathens, but no Christians.

[1 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 6:8</span></span>

Nay, ye do wrong - Openly. And defraud - Privately. O how powerfully did
the mystery of iniquity already work!

[1 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 6:9</span></span>

Idolatry is here placed between fornication and adultery, because they
generally accompanied it. Nor the effeminate - Who live in an easy,
indolent way; taking up no cross, enduring no hardship. But how is this?
These good - natured, harmless people are ranked with idolaters and
sodomites! We may learn hence, that we are never secure from the
greatest sins, till we guard against those which are thought the least;
nor, indeed, till we think no sin is little, since every one is a step
toward hell.

[1 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 6:11</span></span>

And such were some of you: but ye are washed - From those gross
abominations; nay, and ye are inwardly sanctified; not before, but in
consequence of, your being justified in the name - That is, by the
merits, of the Lord Jesus, through which your sins are forgiven. And by
the Spirit of our God - By whom ye are thus washed and sanctified.

[1 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 6:12</span></span>

All things - Which are lawful for you. Are lawful for me, but all things
are not always expedient - Particularly when anything would offend my
weak brother; or when it would enslave my own soul. For though all
things are lawful for me, yet I will not be brought under the power of
any - So as to be uneasy when I abstain from it; for, if so, then I am
under the power of it.

[1 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 6:13</span></span>

As if he had said, I speak this chiefly with regard to meats; (and would
to God all Christians would consider it!) particularly with regard to
those offered to idols, and those forbidden in the Mosaic law. These, I
grant, are all indifferent, and have their use, though it is only for a
time: then meats, and the organs which receive them, will together
moulder into dust. But the case is quite otherwise with fornication.
This is not indifferent, but at all times evil. For the body is for the
Lord - Designed only for his service. And the Lord, in an important
sense, for the body - Being the Saviour of this, as well as of the soul;
in proof of which God hath already raised him from the dead.

[1 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 6:16</span></span>

[Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024).

[1 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 6:17</span></span>

But he that is joined to the Lord - By faith. Is one spirit with him -
And shall he make himself one flesh with an harlot?

[1 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 6:18</span></span>

Flee fornication - All unlawful commerce with women, with speed, with
abhorrence, with all your might. Every sin that a man commits against
his neighbour terminates upon an object out of himself, and does not so
immediately pollute his body, though it does his soul. But he that
committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body - Pollutes,
dishonours, and degrades it to a level with brute beasts.

[1 Corinthians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 6:19</span></span>

And even your body is not, strictly speaking, your own even this is the
temple of the Holy Ghost - Dedicated to him, and inhabited by him. What
the apostle calls elsewhere "the temple of God," [Co1
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016), and "the temple of the living
God," [Co2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016), he here styles the
temple of the Holy Ghost; plainly showing that the Holy Ghost is the
living God.

[1 Corinthians 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 6:20</span></span>

Glorify God with your body, and your spirit - Yield your bodies and all
their members, as well as your souls and all their faculties, as
instruments of righteousness to God. Devote and employ all ye have, and
all ye are, entirely, unreservedly, and for ever, to his glory.
