### [Jeremiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 34:5</span></span>

Ah Lord - The Jews in their chronology, give us the form of the
lamentation thus. Alas! Zedekiah is dead, who drank the dregs of all
ages: that is, who was punished for the sins of all former ages.

[Jeremiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 34:17</span></span>

Behold - You shall perish by the sword, famine and pestilence, and those
of you who escape them, shall be slaves, in many nations.

[Jeremiah 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 34:18</span></span>

Cut the calf - It seems these Jews in their making of the solemn
covenant with God about releasing their servants used this rite; they
caused a calf, or heifer to be cut in pieces, and the parts to be laid
in the temple, right over - against one another; then they recited this
covenant, and passed between the parts of the heifer so cut; silently
agreeing that God should cut them in pieces like that beast if they did
not make their words good.

[Jeremiah 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 34:22</span></span>

Behold - I will put into their hearts to return.
