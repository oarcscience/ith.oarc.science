### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 8:6</span></span>

These - These following, [Ch1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007.md),
because he here speaks of them who were removed. He describes the sons
of Benjamin by the places of their habitation, without an exact account
of their parents; because their genealogies were broken by that almost
total extirpation of this tribe, Jdg. 20:29-48.

[1 Chronicles 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 8:28</span></span>

Heads of the fathers, &c. - Particular notice is taken of these, that
others, at their return from captivity, might be induced to settle there
too, which it seems few were willing to do, because it was the post of
danger. Many great and mighty nations were then upon earth, and many
illustrious men in them, whose names are buried in perpetual oblivion,
while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God, are here carefully
preserved in everlasting remembrance: a figure of God's writing the
names of his spiritual Israel, in the Lamb's book of life.

[1 Chronicles 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 8:40</span></span>

Archers - Heb. that tread the bow; for the bows of steel, which these
used, required great strength to bend them; which therefore they did by
treading the bow with their feet, and pulling the string with both their
hands.
