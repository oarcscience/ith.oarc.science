### [Judges Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#001)

[Judges 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 14:1</span></span>

Went - After he was come to mature age. Timnath - A place not far from
the sea.

[Judges 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 14:2</span></span>

To wife - Herein he is an example to all children, conformable to the
fifth commandment. Children ought not to marry, nor to move toward it
without the advice and consent of their parents. They that do, as Bishop
Hall speaks, unchild themselves. Parents have a property in their
children, as parts of themselves. In marriage this property is
transferred. It is therefore not only unkind and ungrateful, but
palpably unjust, to alienate this property, without their concurrence.
Who so thus robbeth his father or mother, stealing himself from them who
is nearer and dearer to them than their goods, and yet saith, It is no
transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer, .

[Judges 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 14:3</span></span>

Philistines - With whom the Israelites were forbidden to marry. For
although the Philistines were not Canaanites in their original, yet they
were so in their concurrence with them in wickedness, and therefore were
liable to the same judgments with them. Get her - This action of
Samson's, though against common rules, seems to be warranted, by the
direction of God, (mentioned in the following words) which was known to
Samson, but not to his parents. Pleaseth me - Not so much for her
beauty, as for the design mentioned in the next verse.

[Judges 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 14:5</span></span>

Father and mother - Who accompanied him, either because they were now
acquainted with his design; or, to order the circumstances of that
action which they saw he was set upon.

[Judges 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 14:6</span></span>

Came mightily - Increased his courage and bodily strength. A kid - As
soon and as safely. Told not, &c. - Lest by their means it should be
publickly known; for he wisely considered, that it was not yet a fit
time to awaken the jealousies and fears of the Philistines concerning
him, as this would have done.

[Judges 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 14:8</span></span>

After a time - Heb. after days; that is, either after some days: or,
rather, after a year, as that word often signifies; when the flesh of
the lion, (which by its strong smell is offensive to bees) was wholly
consumed, and nothing was left but the bones. Bees - Settling themselves
there, as they have sometimes done in a man's skull, or in a sepulchre.

[Judges 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 14:9</span></span>

Came to, &c. - From whom he had turned aside for a season, [Jdg
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008).

[Judges 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 14:11</span></span>

Saw him - Or, observed him, his stature, and strength, and countenance,
and carriage, which were extraordinary. Brought - Partly in compliance
with the custom of having bride - men; though they were not so numerous;
but principally by way of caution, and as a guard put upon him under a
pretence of respect and affection.

[Judges 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 14:12</span></span>

Seven days - For so long marriage - feasts lasted. Sheets - Fine linen -
clothes, which were used for many purposes in those parts. Changes -
Suits of apparel.

[Judges 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 14:15</span></span>

Seventh day - They had doubtless spoken to her before this time, but
with some remissness, supposing that they should find it out; but now
their time being nigh slipped, they put her under a necessity of
searching it out. To take that we have - That is, to strip us of our
garments.

[Judges 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 14:17</span></span>

The seven days - That is, on the residue of the seven days; namely,
after the third day.

[Judges 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 14:18</span></span>

If ye had not &c. - If you had not employed my wife to find it out, as
men plough up the ground with an heifer, thereby discovering its hidden
parts; he calls her heifer, because she was joined with him in the same
yoke.

[Judges 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 14:19</span></span>

The spirit came - Though he had constant strength and courage; yet that
was exceedingly increased upon special occasions, by the extraordinary
influences of God's spirit. To Ashkelon - Either to the territory; or to
the city itself, where he had both strength and courage enough to
attempt what follows; and upon the doing hereof they were doubtless
struck with such terror, that every one sought only to preserve himself,
and none durst pursue him. His anger was kindled - For the treachery of
his wife and companions. He went - Without his wife. It were well for
us, if the unkindnesses we meet with from the world, and our
disappointments therein has this good effect on us, to oblige us to
return by faith and prayer, to our heavenly father's house.

[Judges 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 14:20</span></span>

Was given - By her father. Whom he had used - That is, to the chief of
the bride - men, to whom he had shewed most respect and kindness.
