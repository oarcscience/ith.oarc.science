### [Joshua Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 1:1</span></span>

After the death of Moses - Either immediately after it, or when the days
of mourning for Moses were expired. Joshua was appointed and declared
Moses's successor in the government before this time; and here he
receives confirmation from God therein. The servant of the Lord - This
title is given to Moses here and [Jos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002.md), as also [Deu
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005.md), and is repeated not without
cause, to reflect honour upon him, to give authority to his laws and
writings, in publishing whereof he acted as God's servant, in his name:
and that the Israelites might not think of Moses above what was meet,
remembering that he was not the Lord himself, but only the Lord's
servant; and therefore not to be too pertinaciously followed in all his
institutions when the Lord himself should come and abolish part of the
Mosaical dispensation; it being but reasonable that he who was only a
servant in God's house, should give place to him who was the son, and
heir, and Lord of it. The Lord spake - Either in a dream or vision, or
by Urim, [Num 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#021.md). Moses's minister
- Who had waited upon Moses in his great employments, and thereby been
privy to his manner of government, and so prepared for it.

[Joshua 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 1:2</span></span>

Now therefore arise - Let not the withering of the most useful hands be
the weakening of ours. When God has work to do, he will either find or
make instruments fit to carry it on. Moses the servant is dead; but God
the master is not: he lives forever. This Jordan - Which is now near
thee, which is the only obstacle in thy way to Canaan. Which I give -
That is, am now about to give thee actual possession of it, as I
formerly gave a right to it by promise.

[Joshua 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 1:3</span></span>

Every place - That is, within the following bounds.

[Joshua 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 1:4</span></span>

This Lebanon - Emphatically, as being the most eminent mountain in
Syria, and the northern border of the land: or this which is within thy
view. Hittites - Of the Canaanites, who elsewhere are all called
Amorites; ([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md) and here
Hittites, the Hittites being the most considerable and formidable of
all. The greater - The midland sea, great in itself, and especially
compared with those lesser collections of waters, which the Jews called
seas. "But the Israelites never possessed all this land." I answer: That
was from their own sloth and cowardice, and disobedience to God, and
breach of those conditions upon which this promise was suspended: Though
their possessions extended not to Euphrates, yet their dominion did, and
all those lands were tributary to them in David's and Solomon's time.

[Joshua 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 1:5</span></span>

With Moses - To assist him against all his enemies, and in all the
difficulties of governing this stiff - necked people, which Joshua might
justly fear no less than the Canaanites. Forsake thee - I will not leave
thee destitute either of inward support, or of outward assistance.

[Joshua 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 1:6</span></span>

Be strong and of a good courage - Joshua, though a person of great
courage and resolution, whereof he had given sufficient proof, yet needs
these exhortations, partly because his work was great, and difficult,
and long, and in a great measure new; partly because he had a very mean
opinion of himself, especially if compared with Moses; and remembering
how perverse and ungovernable that people were, even under Moses, he
might very well suspect the burden of ruling them would be too heavy for
his shoulders.

[Joshua 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 1:7</span></span>

Commanded thee - Remember, that though thou art the commander of my
people, yet thou art my subject, and obliged to observe all my commands.
To the right hand or to the left - That is, in any kind, or upon any
pretence; which plainly shews, that God's assistance promised to him and
the Israelites, was conditional, and might justly be withdrawn upon
their breach of the conditions. Whithersoever thou goest - That is,
whatsoever thou doest. Mens actions are often compared to ways, or steps
by which they come to the end they aim at.

[Joshua 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 1:8</span></span>

Out of thy mouth - That is, thou shalt constantly read it, and upon
occasion discourse of it, and the sentence which shall come out of thy
mouth, shall in all things be given according to this rule. Day and
night - That is, diligently study, and upon all occasions consider what
is God's will and thy duty. The greatness of thy place and employments
shall not hinder thee from this work, because this is the only rule of
all thy private actions, and publick administrations.

[Joshua 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 1:9</span></span>

I commanded thee - I whom thou art obliged to obey: I who can carry thee
through every thing I put thee upon: I of whose faithfulness and
almighty power thou hast had large experience?

[Joshua 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 1:10</span></span>

The officers of the people - These who commanded under Joshua, in their
respective tribes and families, attended him for orders, which they were
to transmit to the people.

[Joshua 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 1:11</span></span>

Prepare you victuals - For although Manna was given them to supply their
want of ordinary provisions in the wilderness; yet they were allowed,
when they had opportunity, to purchase other provisions, and did so,
[Deu 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#006.md), [Deu
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#028.md). And now having been some time in
the land of the Amorites, and together with Manna used themselves to
other food, which that country plentifully supplied them with; they are
warned to furnish themselves therewith for their approaching march.
Three days - These words, though placed here, seem not to have been
delivered by Joshua 'till after the return of the spies; such
transpositions being frequent in scripture. And hence it comes, that
these three days mentioned here below, after the history of the spies,
are again repeated [Jos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 1:13</span></span>

Commanded you - His charge to you, and your promise to him. Rest - That
is, a place of rest, as that word signifies.

[Joshua 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 1:14</span></span>

Before their brethren - In the front of all of them; which was but
reasonable; because they had the advantage of their brethren, having
actually received their portion, which their brethren had only in hope,
because they were freed from those impediments which the rest were
exposed to, their wives, and children, and estates being safely lodged;
and to prevent their withdrawing themselves from the present service,
which they otherwise would have had temptation to do, because of the
nearness of their habitations. Armed - For by this time they were well
furnished with arms, which they had either from the Egyptians,
Amalekites, or Amorites, from whom they had taken them; or by purchase
from those people by whose borders they passed. Men of valour - All such
were obliged to go over if occasion required it, but Joshua took only
some of them, because they were sufficient for his purpose, and because
some were fit to be left, both to secure their own wives, children, and
possessions, and to prevent their enemies on that side from giving them
disturbance in their enterprise upon Canaan.

[Joshua 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 1:16</span></span>

And they answered - Not the two tribes and an half only, but the
officers of all the people, in their name, concurring with the divine
appointment, by which Joshua was set over them. Thus must we swear
allegiance to our Lord Jesus, as the captain of our salvation.

[Joshua 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 1:17</span></span>

Unto thee - The same obedience which we owed, to Moses, we promise unto
thee. With Moses - This is not a limitation of their obedience, as if
they would not obey him any longer than he was prosperous, but an
additional prayer for him. As we have hereby promised thee our
obedience, so our prayer shall be, that God would bless and prosper
thee, as he did Moses.
