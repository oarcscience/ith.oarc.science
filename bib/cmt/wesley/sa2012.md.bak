### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 12:1</span></span>

The Lord sent - When the ordinary means did not awaken David to
repentance, God takes an extraordinary course. Thus the merciful God
pities and prevents him who had so horribly forsaken God. He said - He
prudently ushers in his reproof with a parable, after the manner of the
eastern nations, that so he might surprize David, and cause him unawares
to give sentence against himself.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 12:2</span></span>

Many flocks - Noting David's many wives and concubines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 12:3</span></span>

Bought - As men then used to buy their wives: or, had procured.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 12:5</span></span>

Is worthy to die - This seems to be more than the fact deserved, or than
he had commission to inflict for it, [Exo
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md). But it is observable, that David
now when he was most indulgent to himself, and to his own sin, was most
severe and even unjust to others; as appears by this passage, and the
following relation, [Sa2 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md), which
was done in the time of David's impenitent continuance in his sin.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 12:7</span></span>

Thus saith the Lord God - Nathan now speaks, not as a petitioner for a
poor man, but as an ambassador from the great God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 12:9</span></span>

To be thy wife - To marry her whom he had defiled, and whose husband he
had slain, was an affront upon the ordinance of marriage, making that
not only to palliate, but in a manner to consecrate such villainies. In
all this he despised the word of the Lord; (so it is in the Hebrew.) Not
only his commandment in general, but the particular word of promise,
which God had before sent him by Nathan, that he would build him an
house: which sacred promise if he had had a due value for, he would not
have polluted his house with lust and blood.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 12:10</span></span>

Never depart - During the residue of thy life.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 12:11</span></span>

Own house - From thy own children and family. Thine eyes - Openly, so
that thou shalt know it as certainly as if thou didst see it, and yet
not be able to hinder it. And give them - I shall by my providence, give
him power over them. Neighbor - To one who is very near thee. But God
expresseth this darkly, that the accomplishment of it might not be
hindered.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 12:13</span></span>

I have sinned - How serious this confession was, we may see, Psa.
51:1-19. Put away thy sin - That is, so far as concerns thy own life.
Not die - As by thy own sentence, [Sa2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005.md), thou dost deserve, and may
expect to be done by my immediate stroke.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 12:16</span></span>

Besought - Supposing the threatening might be conditional, and so the
execution of it prevented by prayer. Went - Into his closet.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 12:17</span></span>

Elders - The chief officers of his kingdom and household. He would not -
This excessive mourning did not proceed simply from the fear of the loss
of the child; but from a deep sense of his sin, and the divine
displeasure manifested herein.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 12:18</span></span>

Seventh day - From the beginning of the distemper.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 12:20</span></span>

And came - That is, to the tabernacle, to confess his sin before the
Lord, to own his justice in this stroke, to deprecate his just
displeasure, to acknowledge God's rich mercy, in sparing his own life;
and to offer such sacrifices as were required in such cases.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 12:23</span></span>

I fast - Seeing fasting and prayer cannot now prevail with God for his
life. I shall go to him - Into the state of the dead in which he is, and
into heaven, where I doubt not I shall find him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 12:24</span></span>

His wife - Who was now much dejected, both for her former sin, and for
the loss of the child. Loved him - That is, the Lord declared to David,
that he loved his son, notwithstanding the just cause David had given to
God to alienate his affections from him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa2 12:25</span></span>

Jedidiah - That is, beloved of the Lord. Because - Either, because of
the Lord's love to him, or because the Lord commanded him to do so.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 12:26</span></span>

Royal city - That is, that part of the city where was the king's palace;
though now it seems he was retired to a strong fort.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 12:27</span></span>

Of waters - Rabbah was so called because it was encompassed with water.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 12:28</span></span>

Take it - For having taken one part of the city, he concluded the
remaining part of it could not long stand out. Lest - Lest I have the
honour of taking it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa2 12:30</span></span>

The weight - Or rather, the price whereof, &c. For the same words both
in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, are used, to signify either weight, or
price. And the addition of precious stones, which are never valued by
the weight of gold, makes this signification most probable. Moreover,
the weight might seem too great either for the king of Ammon, or for
David to wear it upon his head.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa2 12:31</span></span>

The people - The words are indefinite, and therefore not necessarily to
be understood of all the people; but of the men of war, and especially
of those who had been the chief actors of that villainous action against
David's ambassadors, and of the dreadful war ensuing upon it; for which,
they deserved severe punishments. Altho' indeed there seems to have been
too much rigour used; especially, because these deaths were inflicted
not only upon those counsellors, who were the only authors of that vile
usage of the ambassadors; but upon some number of the people. And
therefore it is probable, David exercised this cruelty whilst his heart
was hardened, and impenitent; and when he was bereaved of that good
spirit of God, which would have taught him more mercy. Saws - He sawed
them to death of which punishment, we have examples both in scripture,
and in other authors. Brick - kiln - Or, made them to pass through the
furnace of Malchen: that is, of Moloch; punishing them with their own
sin, and with the same kind of punishment which they had inflicted upon
their own children.
