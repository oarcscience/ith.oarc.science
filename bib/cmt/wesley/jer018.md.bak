### [Jeremiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 18:6</span></span>

Cannot I do - That God hath an absolute sovereign power to do what he
pleases with the work of his hands: but he acts as a just judge,
rendering to every man according to his works.

[Jeremiah 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 18:14</span></span>

Of Lebanon - Lebanon had rocks, and also fruitful valleys; snow fell
upon these rocks, and upon a thaw ran down into the lower places. Reason
teaches men not to forsake a greater good for a less, tho' that greater
good was but a poor creature comfort, not to be compared with God.

[Jeremiah 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 18:15</span></span>

Vanity - Idols. Ancient paths - The ways wherein Noah, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and all the ancient patriarchs walked. To walk - In a way not
cast up, not fit for God's people to walk in.

[Jeremiah 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 18:16</span></span>

Desolate - Not that this was the end they aimed at, but it was the end
these courses would certainly issue in.

[Jeremiah 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 18:17</span></span>

East wind - The east wind was in those parts the fiercest wind. As the
east - wind scatters the chaff, so saith God, I will scatter them. In
their calamity - And when they shall be in great calamity, I will turn
my back upon them, I will not regard their prayers.

[Jeremiah 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 18:18</span></span>

For - We have the church on our side; the regular priests and the
prophets, they know God's mind as well as he. Let us smite him with the
tongue - Expose him, representing him to be what the people hate.

[Jeremiah 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 18:21</span></span>

Therefore - But is it lawful for God's servants to pray for evil against
their enemies? It is not lawful for Christians. It is doubtless our
duty, to pray for the conversion, forgiveness, and eternal salvation of
our worst enemies.
