### [Isaiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 26:1</span></span>

In that day - When God shall do such glorious works, as are described in
the foregoing chapter. Sung - In the church of God. A city - Jerusalem,
or the church, which is often compared to a city. For walls - God's
immediate and saving protection shall be to his church instead of walls.

[Isaiah 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 26:2</span></span>

The gates - Of the city, mentioned [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md). The nation - The whole body of
righteous men, whether Jews or Gentiles. For he seems to speak here, as
he apparently did in the foregoing chapter, of the times of the gospel.
Keepeth truth - Which is sincere in the true religion.

[Isaiah 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 26:4</span></span>

For ever - In all times and conditions.

[Isaiah 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 26:5</span></span>

On high - He speaks not so much of height of place, as of dignity and
power, in which sense also he mentions the lofty city in the next
clause. Lofty city - Which may be understood either of proud Babylon, or
of all the strong and stately cities of God's enemies.

[Isaiah 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 26:6</span></span>

The needy - God will bring it under the feet of his poor, and weak, and
despised people.

[Isaiah 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 26:7</span></span>

Thou - O God, who art upright in all thy ways, and therefore a lover of
uprightness, and of all upright men, dost weigh (examine) the path of
the just, the course of his actions, and, which is implied, dost approve
of them, and therefore direct them to an happy issue.

[Isaiah 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 26:9</span></span>

In the night - When others are sleeping, my thoughts and desires are
working towards God. Early - Betimes in the morning. For - And good
reason it is that we should thus desire and seek thee in the way of thy
judgments, because this is the very design of thy judgments, that men
should thereby be awakened to learn and return to their duty; and this
is a common effect, that those who have been careless in prosperity, are
made wiser and better by afflictions.

[Isaiah 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 26:10</span></span>

Will not learn - This is the carriage of thy people; but the course of
wicked men is directly contrary in all conditions: for if thou dost
spare them, they will not accept of that gracious invitation to
repentance. In the land - Even in God's church, and among his people,
where righteousness is taught and practised. Will not behold - Tho' God
gives such plain discoveries of his majesty and glory, not only in his
word, but also in works, and especially in this glorious work of his
patience and mercy to wicked men, yet they will not acknowledge it.

[Isaiah 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 26:11</span></span>

Will not see - And they are guilty of the same obstinate blindness when
thou dost smite and punish them, which is commonly signified by lifting
up the hand. They shall see - They shall know that by sad experience,
which they would not learn by easier ways. These - Such fire or wrath as
thou usest to pour forth upon thine implacable enemies.

[Isaiah 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 26:12</span></span>

Our works - All the good works done by us, are the effects of thy grace.

[Isaiah 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 26:13</span></span>

Other lords - Others besides thee, and besides those governors who have
been set up by thee, even foreign and heathen lords. By thee - By thy
favour and help. Will we - Celebrate thy praise.

[Isaiah 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 26:14</span></span>

to molest us.

[Isaiah 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 26:15</span></span>

The nation - This nation seems to be the people of Israel. Removed -
Thou hast removed thy people out of their own land, and suffered them to
be carried captive to the ends of the earth.

[Isaiah 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 26:16</span></span>

They - Thy people. Visited - Come into thy presence, with their prayers
and supplications.

[Isaiah 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 26:17</span></span>

Like - Such was our anguish and danger.

[Isaiah 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 26:18</span></span>

We - We have had the torment of a woman in child - bearing, but not the
comfort of a living child, for we have brought forth nothing but wind;
all our labours and hopes were unsuccessful. The world - The Assyrians,
or our other enemies.

[Isaiah 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 26:19</span></span>

Thy - The prophet here turns his speech to God's people, and gives them
a cordial in their distress. Thy dead men are not like those, [Isa
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md), for they shall not live; but
thine shall live. You shall be delivered from all your fears and
dangers. My dead body - As I myself, who am one of these dead men, shall
live again; you shall be delivered together with me. Awake - Out of your
sleep, even the sleep of death, you that are dead and buried in the
dust. Thy dew - The favour and blessing of God upon thee. The dew -
Which makes them grow and flourish.

[Isaiah 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 26:20</span></span>

Shut thy doors - Withdraw thyself from the world, and pour out thy
prayers to God in thy closet. Indignation - The dreadful effects of
God's anger, mentioned in the following verse.

[Isaiah 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 26:21</span></span>

Cometh - Cometh down from heaven. To punish - All the enemies of God,
and of his people. Her slain - The innocent blood which hath been
spilled upon the earth shall be brought to light, and severely revenged
upon the murderers.
