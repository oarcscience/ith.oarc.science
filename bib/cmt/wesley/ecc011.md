### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

The waters - Freely and liberally bestow it upon the waters; upon those
poor creatures, on whom it may seem to be as utterly lost, as the seed
which a man casts into the sea or river. Find it - It shall certainly be
restored to thee, either by God or men. This is added to prevent an
objection, and to quicken us to the duty enjoyned. After - The return
may be slow, but it is sure, and will be so much the more plentiful.

[Ecclesiastes 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 11:2</span></span>

Give - A part of thy estate or provisions. He alludes to the ancient
custom, whereby the master of the feast distributed several parts to
each guest, and withal sent portions to the poor. To eight - To as many
as thou art able. For - Great calamities may come whereby thou mayest be
brought to poverty, and so disabled from doing good.

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

The clouds - Learn, O man, the practice of liberality from the very
lifeless creatures, from the clouds; which when they are filled with
water, do not hoard it up, but plentifully pour it forth for the
refreshment both of the fruitful field and the barren wilderness.
Therefore, let us just not bring forth the fruits of righteousness,
because death will shortly cut us down, and we shall then be determined
to unchangeable happiness or misery, according as our works have been.

[Ecclesiastes 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 11:4</span></span>

He - He who neglects the necessary works of sowing and reaping, because
the weather is not exactly suitable to his desires will lose his
harvest. Whereby he intimates, that men will never do good here, which
is expressed by sowing, and consequently not receive good hereafter,
which is called reaping, if they be discouraged from it by every doubt
and difficulty.

[Ecclesiastes 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 11:5</span></span>

The spirit - Of the soul of man, how it comes into the child in the
womb; or how it is united with the body; or how and whether it goes out
of the body. The works - What God is doing and will do with thee or
others; the counsels and methods of God's providence. Therefore use the
present opportunity.

[Ecclesiastes 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 11:6</span></span>

In the morning - Early and late, in all seasons and occasions; do it
speedily and continually, be not weary of it. Sow - Do all good works.
With - hold not - From working or giving.

[Ecclesiastes 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 11:7</span></span>

Truly - It cannot be denied that life is in itself desirable.

[Ecclesiastes 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 11:8</span></span>

Rejoice - Enjoy all the comforts, and escape all the embitterments of
human life, all his days. Darkness - Of death, or of the state of the
dead. Many - Far more than the days of this short life. All - All things
which befall any man belonging only to this life, are but vain, because
they are short and transitory.

[Ecclesiastes 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 11:9</span></span>

Rejoice - Indulge thy humour, and take thy fill of delights. And walk -
Whatsoever thine eye or heart lusteth after, deny it not to them. But
know - But in the midst of thy jollity consider thy reckoning.

[Ecclesiastes 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 11:10</span></span>

Sorrow - Sensual and disorderly lusts, which he elegantly calls sorrow,
to intimate, that although such practices at present gratify mens
senses, yet they will shortly bring them to intolerable sorrows. Evil -
All evil desires, tho' now they seem good to thee. Vanity - Most vain.
The time of youth is vanishing and transitory, and old age and death
will speedily come, against which every wise man will take care to lay
in solid provisions and comforts.
