### [Acts Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

[Acts 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 20:1</span></span>

After the tumult was ceased - So Demetrius gained nothing. Paul remained
there till all was quiet.

[Acts 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 20:2</span></span>

He came into Greece - That part of it which lay between Macedonia and
Achaia.

[Acts 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 20:3</span></span>

An ambush being laid for him - In his way to the ship.

[Acts 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 20:4</span></span>

To Asia - There some of them left him. But Trophimus went with him to
Jerusalem, [Act 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029). Aristarchus,
even to Rome, [Act 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002).

[Acts 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 20:6</span></span>

We set sail - St. Luke was now with St. Paul again, as we learn from his
manner of expressing himself.

[Acts 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 20:7</span></span>

To break bread - That is, to celebrate the Lord's Supper; continued his
discourse - Through uncommon fervour of spirit.

[Acts 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 20:8</span></span>

There were many lamps in the room where they were assembled - To prevent
any possible scandal.

[Acts 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 20:9</span></span>

In the window - Doubtless kept open, to prevent heat, both from the
lamps and the number of people.

[Acts 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 20:10</span></span>

Paul fell or him - It is observable, our Lord never used this gesture.
But Elijah and Elisha did as well as Paul. His life is in him - He is
alive again.

[Acts 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 20:11</span></span>

So departed - Without taking any rest at all.

[Acts 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 20:12</span></span>

And they brought the young man alive - But alas! How many of those who
have allowed themselves to sleep under sermons, or as it were to dream
awake, have slept the sleep of eternal death, and fallen to rise no
more!

[Acts 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 20:13</span></span>

Being himself to go on foot - That he might enjoy the company of his
Christian brethren a little longer, although he had passed the night
without sleep, and though Assos was of difficult and dangerous access by
land.

[Acts 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 20:14</span></span>

Mitylene - Was a city and part of the isle of Lesbos, about seven miles
distant from the Asiatic coast. \`16. For Paul had determined to sail by
Ephesus - Which lay on the other side of the bay. He hasted to be at
Jerusalem on the day of pentecost - Because then was the greatest
concourse of people.

[Acts 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 20:17</span></span>

Sending to Ephesus, he called the elders of the Church - These are
called bishops in [Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028),
(rendered overseers in our translation.) Perhaps elders and bishops were
then the same; or no otherwise different than are the rector of a parish
and his curates.

[Acts 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 20:18</span></span>

Ye know - Happy is he who can thus appeal to the conscience of his
hearers.

[Acts 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 20:19</span></span>

Serving - See the picture of a faithful servant! The Lord - Whose the
church is, with all humility, and with tears, and trials - These are the
concomicants of it. The service itself is described more particularly in
the following verse. This humility he recommends to the Ephesians
themselves, [Eph 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002). His tears are
mentioned again, [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031), as also
[Co2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004); [Phi
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018). These passages laid together
supply us with the genuine character of St. Paul. Holy tears, from those
who seldom weep on account of natural occurrences, are no mean specimen
of the efficacy and proof of the truth of Christianity. Yet joy is well
consistent therewith, [Act 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024). The
same person may be sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.

[Acts 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 20:20</span></span>

I have preached - Publicly; and taught - From house to house. Else he
had not been pure from their blood. For even an apostle could not
discharge his duty by public preaching only. How much less can an
ordinary pastor!

[Acts 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 20:21</span></span>

Repentance toward God - The very first motion of the soul toward God is
a kind of repentance.

[Acts 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 20:22</span></span>

Bound by the Spirit - Strongly impelled by him.

[Acts 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 20:23</span></span>

Save that - Only this I know in general; the Holy Ghost witnesseth - By
other persons. Such was God's good pleasure to reveal these things to
him, not immediately, but by the ministry of others.

[Acts 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 20:24</span></span>

Nor do I count my life precious - It adds great force to this and all
the other passages of Scripture, in which the apostles express their
contempt of the world, that they were not uttered by persons like Seneca
and Antoninus, who talked elegantly of despising the world in the full
affluence of all its enjoyments; but by men who daily underwent the
greatest calamities, and exposed their lives in proof of their
assertions.

[Acts 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 20:25</span></span>

Ye shall see my face no more - He wisely inserts this, that what follows
might make the deeper impression.

[Acts 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 20:27</span></span>

For I have not shunned - Otherwise if any had perished, their blood
would have been on his head.

[Acts 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 20:28</span></span>

Take heed therefore - I now devolve my care upon you; first to
yourselves; then to the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you
overseers - For no man, or number of men upon earth, can constitute an
overseer, bishop, or any other Christian minister. To do this is the
peculiar work of the Holy Ghost: to feed the Church of God - That is,
the believing, loving, holy children of God; which he hath purchased -
How precious is it then in his sight! with his own blood - For it is the
blood of the only begotten Son of God, [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007).

[Acts 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 20:29</span></span>

Grievous wolves - From without, namely, false apostles. They had, not
yet broke in on the Church at Ephesus.

[Acts 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 20:30</span></span>

Yea, from among yourselves men will arise - Such were the Nicolaitans,
of whom Christ complains, [Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006); to
draw away disciples - From the purity of the Gospel and the unity of the
body.

[Acts 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 20:31</span></span>

I ceased not to warn every one night and day - This was watching indeed!
Who copies after this example?

[Acts 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 20:32</span></span>

The word of his grace - It is the grand channel of it, to believers as
well as unbelievers. Who is able to build you up - To confirm and
increase your faith, love, holiness. God can thus build us up, without
any instrument. But he does build us up by them. O beware of dreaming
that you have less need of human teachers after you know Christ than
before! And to give you an inheritance - Of eternal glory, among them
that are sanctified - And so made meet for it. A large number of these
Paul doubtless knew, and remembered before God.

[Acts 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 20:33</span></span>

I have coveted - Here the apostle begins the other branch of his
farewell discourse, like old Samuel, [Sa1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003), taking his leave of the children
of Israel.

[Acts 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 20:34</span></span>

These hands - Callous, as you see, with labour. Who is he that envies
such a bishop or archbishop as this?

[Acts 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 20:35</span></span>

I have showed you - Bishops, by my example, all things - And this among
the rest; that thus labouring - So far as the labours of your office
allow you time; ye ought to help the weak - Those who are disabled by
sickness, or any bodily infirmity, from maintaining themselves by their
own labour. And to remember - Effectually, so as to follow it; the word
which he himself said - Without doubt his disciples remembered many of
his words which are not recorded. It is happier to give - To imitate
God, and have him, as it were, indebted to us.

[Acts 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 20:37</span></span>

They all wept - Of old, men, yea, the best and bravest of men, were
easily melted into tears; a thousand instances of which might be
produced from profane as well as sacred writers. But now,
notwithstanding the effeminacy which almost universally prevails, we
leave those tears to women and children.

[Acts 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 20:38</span></span>

Sorrowing most for that word which he spake, that they should see his
face no more - What sorrow will be in the great day, when God shall
speak that word to all who are found on the left hand, that they shall
see his face no more!
