------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001)

[Psalms 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 39:1</span></span>

I said - I fully resolved. Take heed - To order all my actions right,
and particularly to govern my tongue.

[Psalms 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 39:2</span></span>

Dumb - Two words put together, expressing the same thing, to aggravate
or increase it. I held - I forbear to speak, what I justly might, lest I
should break forth into some indecent expressions. Stirred - My silence
did not assuage my grief, but increase it.

[Psalms 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 39:4</span></span>

My end - Make me sensible of the shortness and uncertainly of life, and
the near approach of death.

[Psalms 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 39:5</span></span>

Before thee - If compared with thee, and with thy everlasting duration.

[Psalms 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 39:6</span></span>

Vain shew - Heb. in a shadow or image; in an imaginary rather than a
real life: in the pursuit of vain imaginations, in which there is
nothing solid or satisfactory: man in and his life, and all his
happiness in this world, are rather appearances and dreams, than truths
and realities. Disquieted - Heb. They make a noise, bustling, or tumult,
with unwearied industry seeking for riches, and troubling and vexing
both themselves and others in the pursuit of them.

[Psalms 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 39:7</span></span>

Mow Lord - Seeing this life and all its enjoyments are so vain and
short. My hope - I will seek for happiness no where but in God.

[Psalms 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 39:10</span></span>

Remove - Take off the judgment which thou hast inflicted upon me. I am -
Help me before I am utterly lost.

[Psalms 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 39:11</span></span>

Beauty - His comeliness and all his excellencies or felicities. Moth -
As a moth consumeth a garment, to which God compares himself and his
judgments, secretly and insensibly consuming a people, [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008).

[Psalms 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 39:12</span></span>

A stranger - I am only in my journey or passage to my real home, which
is in the other world.

[Psalms 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 39:13</span></span>

No more - Among the living, or in this world.
