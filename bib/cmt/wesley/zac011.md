### [Zechariah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001)

[Zechariah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 11:1</span></span>

Open thy doors - That destruction of the Jewish church and nation, is
here foretold in dark and figurative expressions, which our Lord, when
the time was at hand, prophesied of very plainly. Lebanon - Lebanon, a
great mountain boundary between Judea and its neighbours on the north,
is here commanded to open its gates, its fortifications raised to secure
the passages, which lead into Judea. That the fire - Fire kindled by the
enemy in the houses and buildings in Judea, and in Lebanon itself. The
cedars - Palaces built with cedars.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 11:2</span></span>

Fir - tree - Houses and towns built with firs. The cedar - Much less
shall ye escape. Ye Oaks - Used in that country for building palaces,
cities, towns, and fortresses. The forest - Jerusalem, compared to a
forest, in regard of the many and tall houses in it. In short, all are
called to cry, for the miseries that will come upon all. Come down - Is
laid desolate.

[Zechariah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 11:3</span></span>

the banks of Jordan, where the young lions were wont to range.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 11:4</span></span>

My God - God the father speaks to Christ. Of the slaughter - Appointed
to the slaughter. The Jews, during four hundred and fifty years, were a
flock of slaughter to the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and afterwards the
Romans.

[Zechariah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 11:5</span></span>

Whose possessors - Governors. Not guilty - Think they do no ill. That
sell them - For slaves. For l am rich - Profanely give God thanks, that
they thrive by cruelty and oppression.

[Zechariah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 11:6</span></span>

I will deliver - To rob, imprison, banish, or kill each other. Of his
king - The Roman Caesar, whom the Jews had chosen to be so. The land -
Their king and his armies shall destroy the land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 11:7</span></span>

Bands - The beauty of grace and glory, the bands of love and peace.

[Zechariah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 11:9</span></span>

Then - After that time of his patient feeding the flock, and cutting off
the unfaithful shepherds. Cut off - By the sword or famine. The flesh -
Either live to be besieged, 'till hunger makes the living eat the dead,
or by seditions and bloody intestine quarrels, destroy each other.

[Zechariah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 11:10</span></span>

Even beauty - Which was the beauty and glory of them, the covenant of
God, with all the blessings of it. That I might break - Declare it null.
Christ calls it his covenant, for he was the mediator of it.

[Zechariah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 11:11</span></span>

Broken - The covenant was disannulled. That waited - Believed in him,
and obeyed him. Knew - Saw, and owned God in all this.

[Zechariah 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 11:12</span></span>

And I said - Upon parting, Christ seems after the manner of men, to mind
them of his claims for them, and desire them to reckon with him. If ye
think good - He puts it to them, whether they thought he deserved ought
at their hands? So they - The rulers of the Jews, the high priest, chief
priests, and pharisees. Weighed - Which was the manner of paying money
in those days. Thirty pieces - Which amounts to thirty - seven shillings
and six - pence, the value of the life of a slave, [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032). This was fulfilled when they
paid Judas Iscariot so much to betray Christ.

[Zechariah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 11:13</span></span>

The Lord - God the Father. Cast it - As being so little, it would hardly
purchase any thing but what was the cheapest among them. A goodly price
- God upbraids the shepherds of his people, who prized the great
Shepherd no higher. Cast them to the potter - Or rather, cast them into
the house of the Lord for the potter; all which the Jewish rulers acted
over.

[Zechariah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 11:14</span></span>

Then - So soon as I saw what value they put upon me. I cut asunder -
Christ did it really, the prophet did it in the type. Break - Declare it
broken. The brother - hood - That friendship which had been among them.
Judah - The two tribes, and the remnant of the ten tribes.

[Zechariah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 11:15</span></span>

Take unto thee - O Zechariah, personate a shepherd quite different from
him thou hast represented.

[Zechariah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 11:16</span></span>

Who shall not visit - Who seeks not out those that are lost. The young
one - Which are aptest to perish through weakness. Nor heal - But leaves
it to die of its wounds. That stand still - Not able to go forward. Will
eat - Feast on the fattest of the flock. Tear their claws - Tear off
their skin unto the very nails; in brief, a sluggish, negligent,
covetous, riotous, oppressive, and cruel government, is shadowed out by
a foolish shepherd.

[Zechariah 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 11:17</span></span>

The idol shepherd - To them that are but the images of shepherds. That
leaveth - Casts off the care of the flock. The sword - Of the enemy,
shall break his strength and be - fool his counsels. Dried up - They
that have gifts which qualify them to do good, if they do it not, they
will be taken away. They that should have been workmen, but were
slothful, and would do nothing, will justly have their arm dried up. And
they that should have been watchmen, but were drowsy, will justly have
their eye blinded.
