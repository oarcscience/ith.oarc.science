### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 5:2</span></span>

Shalt feed - That is, rule them, and take care of them, as a shepherd
doth of his sheep, [Psa 78:70-71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070). This
expression, he useth to admonish David, that he was not made a king to
advance his own glory, but for the good of his people; whom he ought to
rule with all tenderness, and to watch over with all diligence.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 5:3</span></span>

A league - Whereby David obliged himself to rule them according to God's
laws; and the people promised obedience to him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 5:6</span></span>

Cannot come - They confided in the strength of their fortifications,
which they thought so impregnable, that the blind and the lame were
sufficient to defend them, against the most powerful assailant. And
probably they set a parcel of blind and lame people, invalids or maimed
soldiers, to make their appearance on the wall, in contempt of David and
his men.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 5:8</span></span>

To the gutter - That is, whosoever scaleth the fort, or getteth up to
the top of it, where the gutter was. That are hated - The Jebusites, and
the lame, and the blind, Who had probably themselves insulted him, and
blasphemed God. He shall be - These words are fitly supplied out of [Ch1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006), where they are expressed. They
said &c. - That is, whence it became a proverb, or a common saying, used
by David, and others, the blind and the lame Jebusites, were set to keep
the house, that is, the fort of Zion; and to keep others from coming
into it; but now they are shut out of it, and none of them, either of
the Jebusites, or of blind and lame persons, shall be admitted to come
into it again. Which David might ordain, to keep up the memory of this
great exploit, and of the insolent carriage of the Jebusites.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 5:9</span></span>

Millo - Which seems to have been the town - hall or, state - house, near
the wall of the city of Zion.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 5:12</span></span>

King over Israel - That he might be a blessing to them, and they might
be happy under his administration.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 5:13</span></span>

David took, &c. - This may well be reckoned amongst David's
miscarriages, the multiplication of wives being expresly forbidden to
the king, [Deu 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017). It seems to have
been his policy, that hereby he might enlarge his family, and strengthen
his interest by alliances with so many considerable families. But all
these did not preserve him from coveting his neighbour's wife. Rather
they inclined him to it: for men who have once broke the fence, will
wander carelesly.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 5:17</span></span>

The hold - To some fortified place to which his people might
conveniently resort from all places, and where he might intrench his
army, which lay towards the Philistines.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 5:20</span></span>

Baal - perazim - Whither the Philistines were come from the valley of
Rephraim, [Ch1 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011). Baal - perazim,
signifies the master of the breaches: So he ascribes all to God. As
waters - As floods or rivers of waters, which break the banks, and
overflow a land, and overturn all that stands in their way.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 5:21</span></span>

Images - When the ark fell into the hand of the Philistines, it consumed
them: but when these images fell into the hands of Israel, they could
not save themselves from being consumed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 5:22</span></span>

And spread themselves - The expression intimates, that they were very
numerous, and made a very formidable appearance. So we read, [Rev
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009), of the church's enemies going up
on the breadth of the earth. But the wider they spread themselves, the
fairer mark they are for God's arrows.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 5:23</span></span>

Go up - Directly against them, as the following words explain it. Behind
- Where they least expect thee; God's purposes and promises do not
exclude men's endeavours.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 5:24</span></span>

The sound - A noise as it were of persons walking upon the tops of them,
which I shall cause; and by this sign, both thou shalt he assured that I
am coming to help thee; and the Philistines shall be affrighted, and not
perceive the noise of thy army, until thou art upon them. Bestir - Fall
upon them.
