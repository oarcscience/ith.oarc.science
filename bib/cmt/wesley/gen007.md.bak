### [Genesis Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 7:1</span></span>

Here is a gracious invitation of Noah and his family into a place of
safety, now the flood of waters was coming. For thee have I seen
righteous before me in this generation - Those are righteous indeed that
are righteous before God; that have not only the form of godliness by
which they appear righteous before men, who may easily be imposed upon;
but the power of it, by which they approve themselves to God, who
searcheth the heart.

[Genesis 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 7:2</span></span>

Here are necessary orders given concerning the brute creatures that they
were to be preserved alive with Noah in the ark. He must carefully
preserve every species, that no tribe, no, not the least considerable,
might entirely perish out of the creation. Observe in this: God's care
for man. Doth God take care for oxen? [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md), or was it not rather for man's
sake that this care was taken? Even the unclean beasts were preserved
alive in the ark, that were least valuable. For God's tender mercies are
over all his works, and not only over those that are of most use. Yet
more of the clean were preserved than of the unclean.

Because the clean were most for the service of man; and therefore in
favour to him, more of them were preserved and are still propagated.
Thanks be to God there are not herds of lions as there are of oxen, nor
flocks of tigers as there are of sheep. Because the clean were for
sacrifice to God; and therefore, in honour to him, more of them were
preserved, three couple for breed, and the odd seventh for sacrifice,
[Gen 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md).

[Genesis 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 7:4</span></span>

Yet seven days and I will cause it to rain - It shall be seven days yet
before I do it, After the 120 years were expired, God grants them a
reprieve of seven days longer, both to shew how slow he is to anger, and
to give them some farther space for repentance. But all in vain; these
seven days were trifled away after all the rest, they continued secure
until the day that the flood came. While Noah told them of the judgment
at a distance, they were tempted to put off their repentance: but now he
is ordered to tell them that it is at the door; that they have but one
week more to turn them in, to see if that will now at last awaken them
to consider the things that belong to their peace. But it is common for
those that have been careless for their souls during the years of their
health, when they have looked upon death at a distance, to be as
careless during the days, the seven days of their sickness, when they
see it approaching, their hearts being hardened by the deceitfulness of
sin.

[Genesis 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 7:7</span></span>

And Noah went in with his sons, and his wife, and his sons wives - And
the brute creatures readily went in with him. The same hand that at
first brought them to Adam to be named, now brought them to Noah to be
preserved.

[Genesis 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 7:11</span></span>

The six hundredth year of Noah's life, was 1656 years from the creation.
In the second month, the seventeenth day of the month - Which is
reckoned to be about the beginning of November; so that Noah had had a
harvest just before, from which to victual his ark. The same day the
fountains of the great deep were broken up - There needed no new
creation of waters; God has laid up the deep in store - houses, [Psa
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007.md), and now he broke up those
stores. God had, in the creation, set bars and doors to the waters of
the sea, that they might not return to cover the earth, [Psa
104:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#009.md); [Job
38:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#009.md), and now he only removed these
ancient mounds and fences, and the waters of the sea returned to cover
the earth, as they had done at first, [Gen
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009.md). And the windows of heaven were
opened - And the waters which were above the firmament were poured out
upon the world; those treasures which God has reserved against the time
of trouble, the day of battle and war, [Job
38:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md). The rain, which ordinarily
descends in drops, then came down in streams. We read, [Job
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008.md). That God binds up the waters in
his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them; but now the bond
was loosed, the cloud was rent, and such rains descended as were never
known before or since.

[Genesis 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 7:12</span></span>

It rained without intermission or abatement, forty days and forty nights
- And that upon the whole earth at once.

[Genesis 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 7:14</span></span>

And every beast after his kind - According to the phrase used in the
history of the creation, [Gen 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#021.md),
[Gen 1:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024.md), to intimate, that just
as many species as were created at first were saved now, and no more.

[Genesis 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 7:20</span></span>

The mountains were covered - Therefore there were mountains before the
flood.

[Genesis 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 7:21</span></span>

All flesh died, all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all
that was on the dry land, every living substance - And why so? Man only
had done wickedly, and justly is God's hand against him, but these sheep
what have they done? I answer, 1. We are sure God did them no wrong. He
is the sovereign Lord of all life, for he is the sole fountain and
author of it. He that made them as he pleased, might unmake them when he
pleased, and who shall say unto him, What dost thou? 2. God did
admirably serve the purposes of his own glory by their destruction, as
well as by their creation. Herein his holiness and justice were greatly
magnified: by this it appears that he hates sin, and is highly
displeased with sinners, when even the inferior creatures, because they
are the servants of man, and part of his possession, and because they
have been abused to be the servants of sin, are destroyed with him. It
was likewise an instance of God's wisdom. As the creatures were made for
man when he was made, so they were multiplied for him when he was
multiplied; and therefore, now mankind was reduced to so small a number,
it was fit that the beasts should proportionable be reduced, otherwise
they would have had the dominion, and would have replenished the earth,
and the remnant of mankind that was left would have been overpowered by
them.
