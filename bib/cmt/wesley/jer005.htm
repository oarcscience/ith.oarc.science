<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001">Jeremiah 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">jer 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Run - God gives leave to all the earth to look into the state of Jerusalem, by which he vindicates himself in the face of the whole world from all severity towards his people, whatever he brings upon them. In the broad places - Even there, where men meet from all quarters. A man - It seems worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, for God condescends to pardon Jerusalem, if there be but one righteous man found in it; there he came no lower than ten. A man might walk the streets of Jerusalem long enough before he could meet with any one truly religious. Executeth - Among the magistracy. Seeketh - Among the commonalty, that deal faithfully and uprightly. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002">Jeremiah 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Though - Though when they swear, they use the form of an oath, and say, the Lord liveth, or by the living God: yet it is neither in truth nor righteousness.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>O Lord - Dost not thou approve truth and faithfulness. Grieved - They have not repented. Consumed - God had not only lightly chastised them, but wasted them by several enemies, yet they have profited nothing by it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004">Jeremiah 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>Poor - The vulgar, that understand but little, of less conscience than the better sort. Judgment - The methods or ways of his providence. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005">Jeremiah 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>But - These are more refractory than the other; no law of God is able to hold them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006">Jeremiah 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>A lion - Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army are here pointed at under the metaphor of beasts of prey of three kinds; compared to a lion, which denotes his great power, courage, and pride. A wolf - For their greediness and unsatiableness. A leopard - The Chaldean army is compared to a leopard, not for its speed only, but for its vigilancy and subtilty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007">Jeremiah 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>They then - Such is the natural effect of unsanctified prosperity.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013">Jeremiah 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>Became wind - A proverbial expression, all the prophet's threats shall come to nothing. The word - The prophet's words are not from God. Thus - It shall fall upon their own heads that have thus threatened us. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014">Jeremiah 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">jer 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>It - The Chaldean army, shall consume and eat them up like fire. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jeremiah 5:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 5:15</A></FONT></span></p>Israel - By these are meant Judah; for Israel were in captivity before: called the house of Israel, not only because they descended from Jacob, but because they were the chief of that stock. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018">Jeremiah 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">jer 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>Nevertheless - I have not done with you yet. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#020">Jeremiah 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">jer 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>Judah - By Judah and Jacob we are to understand the two tribes only.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">jer 5:21</A></FONT></span></p>And hear not - They are wilfully blind, and obstinately deaf, will neither see, nor hear the word, will, or works of God, of which he giveth two instances in the two following verses.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">jer 5:24</A></FONT></span></p>The former rain - The former to prepare the ground for sowing, and the latter to prepare the corn for ripening. Reserveth - He gives seasonable harvests according to his appointment. God would let them know what a foolish, as well as wicked thing it is to set themselves against that God, that keeps the whole order of nature at his own disposal, which he can order as he sees men behave towards him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026">Jeremiah 5:26</A></p>

Such an one was that conspiracy of more than forty men against Paul, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#013">Act 23:13-15</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027">Jeremiah 5:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">jer 5:27</A></FONT></span></p>Their houses - They fill their houses with the goods of those they deceive, and over - reach. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028">Jeremiah 5:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">jer 5:28</A></FONT></span></p>Overpass - They go beyond the Heathens themselves in wickedness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030">Jeremiah 5:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">jer 5:30</A></FONT></span></p>The land - Heb. This land: aggravating the greatness of the wonder, that such a thing should be in such a land.
