### [Leviticus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 27:2</span></span>

A singular vow - Or, an eminent, or hard vow, not concerning things,
which was customary, but concerning persons, which he devoted to the
Lord, which was unusual and difficult: yet there want not instances of
persons who devoted either themselves or their children, and that either
more strictly, as the Nazarites, and the Levites, [Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md), and for these there was no
redemption admitted, but they were in person to perform the service to
which they were devoted: or more largely, as some who were not Levites,
might yet through zeal to God, or to obtain God's help, which they
wanted or desired, devote themselves or their children to the service of
God and of the sanctuary, tho' not in such a way as the Levites, which
was forbidden, yet in some kind of subserviency to them. And because
there might be too great a number of persons thus dedicated, which might
be burdensome to the sanctuary, an exchange is allowed, and the priests
are directed to receive a tax for their redemption. By thy estimation -
Thine, O man that vowest, as appears from [Lev
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008.md), where his estimation is opposed
to the priest's valuation. Nor was there any fear of his partiality in
his own cause, for the price is particularly limited. But where the
price is undetermined, there, to avoid that inconvenience, the priest is
to value it, as [Lev 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008.md), [Lev
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#012.md).

[Leviticus 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 27:3</span></span>

Unto sixty years - Which is the best time for strength and service, and
therefore prized at the highest rate.

[Leviticus 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 27:4</span></span>

Thirty shekels - Less than the man's price, because she is inferior to
him both in strength and serviceableness.

[Leviticus 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 27:5</span></span>

Five years old - At which age they might be vowed by their parents, as
appears from 1Sa. 1:11-28, tho' not by themselves; and the children were
obliged by their parents vow, which is not strange considering the
parents right to dispose of their children so far as is not contrary to
the mind of God.

[Leviticus 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 27:8</span></span>

Than thy estimation - If he be not able to pay the price which thou,
according to the rules here given, requirest of him.

[Leviticus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 27:9</span></span>

Whereof men bring an offering - That is, a clean beast. Giveth - Voweth
to give: Shall be holy - Consecrated to God, either to be sacrificed, or
to be given to the priest, according to the manner of the vow, and the
intention of him that voweth.

[Leviticus 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 27:10</span></span>

He shall not alter it, nor change it - Two words expressing the same
thing more emphatically, that is, he shall in no wise change it, neither
for one of the same, nor of another kind: partly because God would
preserve the reverence of consecrated things, and therefore would not
have them alienated, and partly to prevent abuses of them who on this
pretence might exchange it for the worse. It and the exchange - That is,
both the thing first vowed, and the thing offered or given in exchange.
This was inflicted upon him as a just penalty for his levity in such
weighty matters.

[Leviticus 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 27:11</span></span>

Unclean - Either for the kind, or for the quality of it; if it were such
an one as might not be offered.

[Leviticus 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 27:14</span></span>

Sanctify his house - By a vow, for of that way and manner of
sanctification he speaks in this whole chapter.

[Leviticus 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 27:15</span></span>

The fifth part - Which he might the better do, because the priests did
usually put a moderate rate upon it.

[Leviticus 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 27:16</span></span>

Of his possession - That is, which is his by inheritance, because
particular direction is given about purchased lands, [Lev
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#022.md). And he saith, part of it, for
it was unlawful to vow away all his possessions, because thereby he
disabled himself from the performance of divers duties, and made himself
burdensome to his brethren. According to the seed - That is, according
to the quantity and quality of the land, which is known by the quantity
of seed which it can receive and return. Fifty - shekels - Not to be
paid yearly, 'till the year of jubilee, but once for all, as is most
probable, Because here is no mention of any yearly payment, but only of
one payment. Because it is probable that lands were moderately valued,
that men might be rather encouraged to make such vows, than deterred by
excessive impositions. But if this were yearly rent, it was an excessive
rate, and much more than the land ordinarily yielded. For an omer is but
the tenth part of an ephah, about a pottle of our measure, which
quantity of seed would not extend very far, and in some lands would
yield but an inconsiderable crop, especially in barley, which was
cheaper than wheat and which for that reason, among others, may be
mentioned rather than wheat.

[Leviticus 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 27:17</span></span>

From the year of jubilee - That is, immediately after the year of
jubilee is past. According to thy estimation - Now mentioned, of fifty
shekels for an omer of barley seed. It shall stand - That is, that price
shall be paid without diminution.

[Leviticus 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 27:18</span></span>

After the jubilee - That is, some considerable time after. The
defalcation from the full price of fifty shekels shall be more or less
as the years are more or fewer.

[Leviticus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 27:20</span></span>

If he will not redeem it - When the priest shall set a price upon it,
and offer it to him in the first place to redeem it: or, rather and, for
this seems to be added by way of accumulation, if he, that is, the
priest, of whom he might have redeemed it, upon his refusal, offers it
to sale, and have sold the field to another man - He shall for ever lose
the benefit of redemption.

[Leviticus 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 27:21</span></span>

When it goeth out - That is, out of the possession of the other man to
whom the priest sold it. The possession shall be the priests - For their
maintenance. Nor is this repugnant to that law, that the priests should
have no inheritance in the land, [Num
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md), for that is only spoken of, the
tribe of Levi in general, in reference to the first division of the
land, wherein the Levites were not to have a distinct part of land, as
other tribes had; but this doth not hinder, but some particular lands
might be vowed and given to the priests, either for their own benefit,
or for the service of the sanctuary.

[Leviticus 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 27:22</span></span>

His possession - His patrimony or inheritance.

[Leviticus 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 27:23</span></span>

Thy estimation - That is, the price which thou, O Moses, by my direction
hast set in such cases. To the jubilee - As much as it is worth, for
that space of time between the making of the vow and the year of
jubilee: for he had no right to it for any longer time, as the next
verse tells us. As an holy thing - As that which is to be consecrated to
God instead of the land redeemed by it.

[Leviticus 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 27:25</span></span>

The shekel - About 2s. 6d.

[Leviticus 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 27:26</span></span>

No man shall sanctify it - By vow; because it is not his own, but the
Lord's already, and therefore to vow such a thing to God is a tacit
derogation from, and an usurpation of the Lord's right, and a mocking of
God by pretending to give what we cannot withhold from him. Or ox or
sheep - Under these two eminent kinds he comprehends all other beasts
which might be sacrificed to God, the firstlings whereof could not be
redeemed but were to be sacrificed; whereas the firstlings of men were
to be redeemed, and therefore were capable of being vowed, as we see,
[Sa1 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md).

[Leviticus 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 27:27</span></span>

An unclean beast - That is, if it be the first - born of an unclean
beast, as appears from [Lev 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#026.md),
which could not be vowed, because it was a first - born, nor offered,
because it was unclean, and therefore is here commanded to be redeemed
or sold. It shall be sold - And the price thereof was given to the
priests, or brought into the Lord's treasury.

[Leviticus 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 27:28</span></span>

No devoted thing - That is, nothing which is absolutely devoted to God
with a curse upon themselves or others, if they disposed not of it
according to their vow; as the Hebrew word implies. Most holy - That is,
only to be touched or employed by the priests, and by no other persons;
no not by their own families, for that was the state of the most holy
things.

[Leviticus 27:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 27:29</span></span>

Devoted of men - Not by men, as some would elude It; but of men, for it
is manifest both from this and the foregoing verses, that men are here
not the persons devoting, but devoted to destruction, either by God's
sentence, as idolaters, [Exo 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#020.md);
[Deu 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#015.md), the Canaanites, [Deu
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#017.md), the Amalekites, [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019.md), and [Sa1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md), [Sa1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026.md), Benhaded, [Kg1
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042.md), or by men, in pursuance of such
a sentence of God, as [Num 21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002.md),
[Num 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#017.md), or for any crime of an
high nature, as [Jdg 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#005.md); [Jos
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#015.md). But this is not to be generally
understood, as some have taken it, as if a Jew might by virtue of this
Text, devote his child or his servant to the Lord, and thereby oblige
himself to put them to death. For this is expressly limited to all that
a man hath, or which is his, that is, which he hath a power over. But
the Jews had no power over the lives of their children or servants, but
were directly forbidden to take them away, by that great command, thou
shalt do no murder. And seeing he that killed his servant casually by a
blow with a rod was surely to be punished, as is said, [Exo
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#020.md), it could not be lawful wilfully
to take away his life upon pretence of any such vow as this. But for the
Canaanites, Amalekites, &c. God the undoubted Lord of all men's lives,
gave to the Israelites a power over their persons and lives, and a
command to put them to death. And this verse may have a special respect
to them or such as them.

[Leviticus 27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 27:30</span></span>

The tithe - There are divers sorts of tithes, but this seems to be
understood only of the ordinary and yearly tithes belonging to the
Levites, as the very expression intimates, and the addition of the fifth
part in case of redemption thereof implies.

[Leviticus 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 27:32</span></span>

Under the rod - Either, The tither's rod, it being the manner of the
Jews in tithing to cause all their cattle to pass through some gate or
narrow passage, where the tenth was marked by a person appointed for
that purpose and reserved for the priest. Or, the shepherd's rod, under
which the herds and flocks passed, and by which they were governed and
numbered. See [Jer 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013.md); [Eze
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#037.md).

[Leviticus 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 27:34</span></span>

These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the
children of Israel in mount Sinai - This has reference to the whole
book. Many of these commandments are moral: others ceremonial and
peculiar to the Jewish economy: Which yet are instructive to us, who
have a key to the mysteries that are contained in them. Upon the whole,
we have cause to bless God, that we are not come to mount Sinai, that we
are not under the dark shadows of the law, but enjoy the clear light of
the gospel. The doctrine of our reconciliation to God by a Mediator, is
not clouded with the smoke of burning sacrifices, but cleared by the
knowledge of Christ, and him crucified. And we may praise him, that we
are not under the yoke of the law, but under the sweet and easy
instructions of the gospel, which pronounces those the true worshippers,
that worship the Father in spirit and in truth, by Christ only, who is
our priest, temple, altar, sacrifice, purification and all.
