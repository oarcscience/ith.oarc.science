### [2 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 9:1</span></span>

To write to you - Largely.

[2 Corinthians 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 9:2</span></span>

I boast to them of Macedonia - With whom he then was.

[2 Corinthians 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 9:3</span></span>

I have sent the above mentioned brethren before me.

[2 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 9:5</span></span>

Spoken of before - By me, to the Macedonians. Not as a matter of
covetousness - As wrung by importunity from covetous persons.

[2 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 9:6</span></span>

He that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly; he that soweth
bountifully shall reap bountifully - A general rule. God will proportion
the reward to the work, and the temper whence it proceeds.

[2 Corinthians 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 9:7</span></span>

Of necessity - Because he cannot tell how to refuse.

[2 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 9:8</span></span>

How remarkable are these words! Each is loaded with matter and increases
all the way it goes. All grace - Every kind of blessing. That ye may
abound to every good work - God gives us everything, that we may do good
therewith, and so receive more blessings. All things in this life, even
rewards, are, to the faithful, seeds in order to a future harvest. [Pro
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009)

[2 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 9:9</span></span>

He hath scattered abroad - (A generous word.) With a full hand, without
any anxious thought which way each grain falls. His righteousness - His
beneficence, with the blessed effects of it. Remaineth for ever -
Unexhausted, God still renewing his store. [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009)

[2 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 9:10</span></span>

And he who supplieth seed - Opportunity and ability to help others. And
bread - All things needful for your own souls and bodies. Will
continually supply you with that seed, yea, multiply it to you more and
more. And increase the fruits of your righteousness - The happy effects
of your love to God and man. [Isa
55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010)

[2 Corinthians 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 9:11</span></span>

Which worketh by us thanksgiving to God - Both from us who distribute,
and them who receive, your bounty.

[2 Corinthians 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 9:13</span></span>

Your avowed subjection - Openly testified by your actions. To all men -
Who stand in need of it.

[2 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 9:15</span></span>

His unspeakable gift - His outward and inward blessings, the number and
excellence of which cannot he uttered.
