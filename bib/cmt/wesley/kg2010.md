<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 10:7</span></span>

Sent them - Jehu justly required this, because the sovereign lord of all

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 10:25</span></span>

City - To some buildings belonging to this house of Baal, which may be
here called the city; because they were very numerous and capacious. For
as there were divers chambers and rooms built without the temple,
belonging to it, for the use of the priests, and Levites. So it may
probably be conceived, That this famous temple of Baal had many such
buildings; in some of which, the priests of Baal, or of the groves,
(whereof there were great numbers belonging to the king's court, [Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019),.md) peradventure might dwell; and
others of them might be for divers uses belonging to the house, and
service of Baal.

superficial: otherwise it would not have given way to his policy.
