### [Jeremiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 15:1</span></span>

Cast them out - I am not able to abide the sight of them, therefore let
them go forth.

[Jeremiah 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 15:4</span></span>

Manasseh - Manasseh is here named as the son of Hezekiah for his shame,
because of his degeneracy from so good a parent; it is expressly said,
[Kg2 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026), that not withstanding
Josiah's reformation, yet the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his
wrath, kindled against Judah, for the provocations of Manasseh.

[Jeremiah 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 15:6</span></span>

I am weary - I am resolved to bear no longer.

[Jeremiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 15:7</span></span>

A fan - Not a purging fan by affliction, to separate their chaff and
dross from them, but a scattering fan. In the gates - This is added in
pursuit of the metaphor of fanning, men usually chusing barn - doors to
fan at, that they may have the advantage of the wind.

[Jeremiah 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 15:8</span></span>

Their widows - The prophet still speaks of things to come as if present.
In Jehoiakim's time we read of no such plenty of widows; they were
multiplied when the city was besieged and taken in Zedekiah's time, to a
great number, hyperbolically compared to the sands of the sea. The
mother - Jerusalem was the mother of the Jewish people, against whom,
Nebuchadnezzar the spoiler, at noon - day, was sent.

[Jeremiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 15:9</span></span>

Seven - Seven signifies many: the prophet complains, that the country of
Judah, that had been very numerous in people, now grew feeble. While -
In the midst of her prosperity. Confounded - A part of them were
confounded by the judgments of God which came upon them before their
captivity.

[Jeremiah 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 15:10</span></span>

I have not - I have done them no wrong, yet they speak of me all manner
of evil.

[Jeremiah 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 15:11</span></span>

Thy remnant - The latter words of the verse expound the former; for by
remnant is meant the remnant of days that Jeremiah had to live.

[Jeremiah 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 15:12</span></span>

The northern iron - As the northern iron and steel is the hardest, and
no iron could break that, so God having edged and hardened their
enemies, the Chaldeans, all opposition to them would signify nothing.

[Jeremiah 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 15:13</span></span>

The substance - All thy precious things shall be spoiled, there shall be
no price taken for the redemption of them.

[Jeremiah 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 15:15</span></span>

Thou knowest - My sincerity, or my sufferings. Visit me - With thy love.

[Jeremiah 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 15:16</span></span>

Thy words - The words which from time to time thou didst reveal to me,
were by me greedily digested. I am called - I became a prophet by thy
authority, therefore, do thou own and defend me.

[Jeremiah 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 15:17</span></span>

I sat not - God had all along filled his mouth with such dreadful
messages, that his whole prophetical life had been to him a time of
mourning and solitude, a time when he sat alone, mourning and weeping in
secret for the wrath of God revealed to him against his people.

[Jeremiah 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 15:18</span></span>

Why - Jeremiah, though a great prophet, was (as Elijah) a man subject to
like passions with other men.

[Jeremiah 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 15:19</span></span>

If thou - These are God's words to the prophet, rebuking his distrust in
God, and promising him, that if he did return from his distrust in God's
providence, he would restore him to the former favour he had with him,
and he should be his prophet to reveal his mind to the people; and that
if he would separate the precious truths of God from the vile conceits
of men, then God would continue him as his prophet, to speak in his name
to the people. But - He charges the prophet to keep his ground, and not
to go over to wicked men.

[Jeremiah 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 15:21</span></span>

The wicked - The wicked Jews. The terrible - And the power of the
terrible Chaldeans.
