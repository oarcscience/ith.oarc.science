### [2 Corinthians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 6:1</span></span>

We then not only beseech, but as fellow - labourers with you, who are
working out your own salvation, do also exhort you, not to receive the
grace of God - Which we have been now describing. In vain - We receive
it by faith; and not in vain, if we add to this, persevering holiness.

[2 Corinthians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 6:2</span></span>

For he saith - The sense is, As of old there was a particular time
wherein God was pleased to pour out his peculiar blessing, so there is
now. And this is the particular time: this is a time of peculiar
blessing. [Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008).

[2 Corinthians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 6:3</span></span>

Giving, as far as in us lies, no offence, that the ministry be not
blamed on our account.

[2 Corinthians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 6:4</span></span>

But approving ourselves as the ministers of God - Such as his ministers
ought to be. In much patience - Shown, In afflictions, necessities,
distresses - All which are general terms. In stripes, imprisonments,
tumults - Which are particular sorts of affliction, necessity, distress
In labours, watchings, fastings - Voluntarily endured. All these are
expressed in the plural number, to denote a variety of them. In
afflictions, several ways to escape may appear, though none without
difficulty in necessities, one only, and that a difficult one; in
distresses, none at all appears.

[2 Corinthians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 6:5</span></span>

In tumults - The Greek word implies such attacks as a man cannot stand
against, but which bear him hither and thither by violence.

[2 Corinthians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 6:6</span></span>

By prudence - Spiritual divine; not what the world terms so. Worldly
prudence is the practical use of worldly wisdom: divine prudence is the
due exercise of grace, making spiritual understanding go as far as
possible. By love unfeigned - The chief fruit of the Spirit.

[2 Corinthians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 6:7</span></span>

By the convincing and converting power of God - Accompanying his word;
and also attesting it by divers miracles. By the armour of righteousness
on the right hand and the left - That is, on all sides; the panoply or
whole armour of God.

[2 Corinthians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 6:8</span></span>

By honour and dishonour - When we are present. By evil report and good
report - When we are absent. Who could bear honour and good report, were
it not balanced by dishonour? As deceivers - Artful, designing men. So
the world represents all true ministers of Christ. Yet true - Upright,
sincere, in the sight of God.

[2 Corinthians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 6:9</span></span>

As unknown - For the world knoweth us not, as it knew him not. Yet well
known - To God, and to those who are the seals of our ministry. As
dying, yet behold - Suddenly, unexpectedly, God interposes, and we live.

[2 Corinthians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 6:10</span></span>

As sorrowing - For our own manifold imperfections, and for the sins and
sufferings of our brethren. Yet always rejoicing - In present peace,
love, power, and a sure hope of future glory. As having nothing, yet
possessing all things - For all things are ours, if we are Christ's.
What a magnificence of thought is this!

[2 Corinthians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 6:11</span></span>

From the praise of the Christian ministry, which he began [Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014), he now draws his affectionate
exhortation. O ye Corinthians - He seldom uses this appellation. But it
has here a peculiar force. Our mouth is opened toward you - With
uncommon freedom, because our heart is enlarged - In tenderness.

[2 Corinthians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 6:12</span></span>

Ye are not straitened in us - Our heart is wide enough to receive you
all. But ye are straitened in your own bowels - Your hearts are shut up,
and so not capable of the blessings ye might enjoy.

[2 Corinthians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 6:13</span></span>

Now for a recompence of the same - Of my parental tenderness. I speak as
to my children - I ask nothing hard or grievous. Be ye also enlarged -
Open your hearts, first to God, and then to us, so [Co2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005), that God may "dwell in you," [Co2
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016); [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001); and that ye may "receive us,"
[Co2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002).

[2 Corinthians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 6:14</span></span>

Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers - Christians with Jews or
heathens. The apostle particularly speaks of marriage. But the reasons
he urges equally hold against any needless intimacy with them. Of the
five questions that follow, the three former contain the argument; the
two latter, the conclusion.

[2 Corinthians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 6:15</span></span>

What concord hath Christ - Whom ye serve. With Belial - To whom they
belong.

[2 Corinthians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 6:16</span></span>

What agreement hath the temple of God with idols - If God would not
endure idols in any part of the land wherein he dwelt, how much less,
under his own roof! He does not say, with the temple of idols, for idols
do not dwell in their worshippers. As God hath said - To his ancient
church, and in them to all the Israel of God. I will dwell in them, and
walk in them - The former signifying his perpetual presence; the latter,
his operation. And I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
people - The sum of the whole gospel covenant. [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011), &c.

[2 Corinthians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 6:17</span></span>

Touch not the unclean person - Keep at the utmost distance from him. And
I will receive you - Into my house and family. [Isa
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011); [Zep
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019).

[2 Corinthians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 6:18</span></span>

And ye shall be to me for sons and for daughters, saith the Lord
Almighty - The promise made to Solomon, [Ch1
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#006), is here applied to all
believers; as the promise made particularly to Joshua is applied to
them, [Heb 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005). Who can express the
worth, who can conceive the dignity, of this divine adoption? Yet it
belongs to all who believe the gospel, who have faith in Christ. They
have access to the Almighty; such free and welcome access, as a beloved
child to an indulgent father. To him they may fly for aid in every
difficulty, and from him obtain a supply in all their wants. [Isa
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006).
