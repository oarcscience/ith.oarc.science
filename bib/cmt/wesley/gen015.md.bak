### [Genesis Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 15:1</span></span>

After these things - After that act of generous charity which Abram had
done, in rescuing his neighbours, God made him this gracious visit.
After that victory which he had obtained over four kings; lest Abram
should be too much elevated with that, God comes to tell him he had
better things in store for him. The word of the Lord came unto Abram -
That is, God manifested himself to Abram, in a vision - Which supposeth
Abram awake, and some sensible token of the presence of the divine
glory, saying, Fear not Abram - Abram might fear lest the four kings he
had routed, should rally and fall upon him. No, saith God, fear not:
fear not their revenge, nor thy neighbour's envy; I will take care of
thee. I am thy shield - Or, emphatically, I am a shield to thee, present
with thee, actually defending thee. The consideration of this, that God
himself is, a shield to his people, to secure them from all destructive
evils, a shield ready to them, and a shield round about them, should
silence all perplexing fears. And thy exceeding great reward - Not only
thy rewarder, but thy reward. God himself is the felicity of holy souls;
He is the portion of their inheritance, and their cup.

[Genesis 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 15:3</span></span>

Behold to me thou hast given no seed - Not only no son, but no seed. If
he had had a daughter, from her the promised Messias might have come,
who was to be the Seed of the Woman; but he had neither son nor
daughter.

[Genesis 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 15:5</span></span>

And he brought him forth - It seems, early in the morning, and said,
look now toward heaven, and tell the stars: so shall thy seed be - So
innumerable, for so the stars seem to a common eye. Abram feared he
should have no child at all, but God tells him his descendents should be
so many as not to be numbered. So illustrious, as the stars of heaven
for splendour; for to them pertained the glory, [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md). Abram's seed according to the
flesh were like the dust of the earth, [Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md), but his spiritual seed are like
the stars of heaven.

[Genesis 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 15:6</span></span>

And he believed in the Lord - That is, believed the truth of that
promise which God had now made him, resting upon the power, and
faithfulness of him that made it: see how the apostle magnifies this
faith of Abram, and makes it a standing example, [Rom
4:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md). He was not weak in faith; he
staggered not at the promise: he was strong in faith; he was fully
persuaded. The Lord work such a faith in every one of us. And he counted
it to him for righteousness - That is, upon the score of this he was
accepted of God, and, by faith he obtained witness that he was
righteous, [Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md). This is urged in
the New Testament to prove, that we are justified by faith without the
works of the law, [Rom 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md); [Gal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md), for Abram was so justified, while
he was yet uncircumcised. If Abram, that was so rich in good works, was
not justified by them, but by his faith, much less can we. This faith,
which was imputed to Abram for righteousness, had newly struggled with
unbelief, [Gen 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md), and coming off,
conqueror, it was thus crowned, thus honoured.

[Genesis 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 15:7</span></span>

I am the lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees - Out of the
fire of the Chaldees, so some: that is, from their idolatries; for the
Chaldeans worshipped the fire. Or, from their persecutions. The Jewish
writers have a tradition, that Abram was cast into a fiery furnace for
refusing to worship idols, and was miraculously delivered. It is rather
a place of that name. Thence God brought him by an effectual call,
brought him by a gracious violence; snatched him as a brand out of the
burning. Observe how God speaks of it as that which he gloried in. I am
the Lord that brought thee out - He glories in it as an act both of
power and grace. To give thee this land to inherit it - Not only to
possess it, but to possess it as an inheritance, which is the surest
title. The providence of God hath secret, but gracious designs in all
its various dispensations: we cannot conceive the projects of
providence, 'till the event shews what it was driving at.

[Genesis 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 15:8</span></span>

Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? - This did not proceed
from distrust of God's power or promise, but he desired this, For the
strengthening of his own faith. He believed, [Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md), but here he prays, Lord help me
against my unbelief, Now, he believed, but he desired a sign, to be
treasured up against an hour of temptation. For the ratifying of the
promise to his posterity, that they also might believe it.

[Genesis 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 15:9</span></span>

Take me an heifer - Perhaps Abram expected some sign from heaven, but
God gives him a sign upon a sacrifice. Those that would receive the
assurances of God's favour, must attend instituted ordinances, and
expect to meet with God in them. Observe, God appointed that each of the
beasts used for his service should be three years old, because then they
were at their full growth and strength. God must be served with the best
we have. We do not read that God gave Abram particular directions how to
manage these, knowing that he was well versed in the custom of
sacrifices. Abram took as God appointed him, though as yet he knew not
how these things should become a sign to him. He divided the beasts in
the midst, according to the ceremony used in continuing covenants, [Jer
34:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md), where it is said, they cut
the calf in twain, and passed between the parts. Abram, having prepared
according to God's appointment, set himself to expect what sign God
would give him by these.

[Genesis 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 15:12</span></span>

And when the sun was going down - About the time of the evening
oblation. Early in the morning, while the stars were yet to be seen, God
had given him orders concerning the sacrifices, [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md), and we may suppose it was at
least his morning's work to prepare them, and set them in order; which
when he had done, he abode by them praying and waiting 'till towards
evening. A deep sleep fell upon Abram - Not a common sleep through
weariness or carelessness, but a divine extasy, that being wholly taken
off from things sensible, he might be wholly taken up with the
contemplation of things spiritual. The doors of the body were locked up,
that the soul might be private and retired, and might act the more
freely. And lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him - This was
designed to strike an awe upon the spirit of Abram, and to possess him
with a holy reverence. Holy fear prepares the soul for holy joy; God
humbles first, and then lifts up.

[Genesis 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 15:13</span></span>

Thy seed shall be strangers - So they were in Canaan first, [Psa
105:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md), and afterwards in Egypt:
before they were lords of their own land, they were strangers in a
strange land. The inconveniences of an unsettled state make a happy
settlement the more welcome. Thus the heirs of heaven are first
strangers on earth. And them they shall serve - So they did the
Egyptians, [Exo 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013.md). See how that
which was the doom of the Canaanites, [Gen
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#025.md), proves the distress of Abram's
seed: they are made to serve; but with this difference, the Canaanites
serve under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing. And they shall
afflict them - See [Exo 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md). Those
that are blessed and beloved of God are often afflicted by wicked men.
This persecution began with mocking, when Ishmael the son of an
Egyptian, persecuted Isaac, [Gen 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md),
and it came at last to murder, the basest of murders, that of their new
born children; so that more or less it continued 400 years.

[Genesis 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 15:14</span></span>

That nation whom they shall serve, even the Egyptians, will I judge -
This points at the plagues of Egypt, by which God not only constrained
the Egyptians to release Israel, but punished them for all the hardships
they had put upon them. The punishing of persecutors is the judging of
them; it is a righteous thing with God, and a particular act of justice,
to recompense tribulation to those that trouble his people. 3. The
deliverance of Abram's seed out of Egypt. And afterwards shall they come
out with great substance - Either after they have been afflicted 400
years, or, after the Egyptians are judged and plagued.

[Genesis 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 15:15</span></span>

Thou shalt go to thy fathers - At death we go to our fathers, to all our
fathers that are gone before us to the state of the dead, to our godly
fathers that are gone before us to the state of the blessed. The former
helps to take off the terror of death, the latter puts comfort into it.
Thou shalt be buried in a good old age - Perhaps mention is made of his
burial here, where the land of Canaan is promised him, because a burying
- place was the first possession he had in it. Old age is a blessing, if
it be a good old age: theirs may be called a good old age, That are old
and healthful, not loaded with such distempers as make them weary of
life: That are old and holy, whose hoary head is found in the way of
righteousness, old and useful, old and exemplary for godliness, that is
indeed a good old age.

[Genesis 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 15:16</span></span>

They shall come hither again - Hither to the land of Canaan, wherein
thou now art. The reason why they must not have the land of promise in
possession till the fourth generation, is because the iniquity of the
Amorites was not yet full. The righteous God has determined, that they
shall not be cut off till they are arrived to such a pitch of
wickedness; and therefore till it come to that, the seed of Abram must
be kept out of possession.

[Genesis 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 15:17</span></span>

When the sun was gone down the sign was given - The smoaking furnace
signified the affliction of his seed in Egypt: they were there in the
furnace of affliction, and labouring in the very fire. They were there
in the smoke, their eyes darkened that they could not see to the end of
their troubles. 2. The burning lamp speaks comfort in this affliction;
and this God shewed Abram at the same time with the smoaking furnace.
The lamp notes direction in the smoke; God's word was their lamp, a
light shining in a dark place. Perhaps too this burning lamp prefigured
the pillar of a cloud and fire which led them out of Egypt. 3. The
passing of these between the pieces was the confirming of the covenant
God now made with him. It is probable this furnace and lamp, which
passed between the pieces, burned and consumed them, and so compleated
the sacrifice, and testified God's acceptance of it, as of Gideon's,
[Jdg 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#021.md), Manoah's, [Jdg
13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#019.md), and Solomon's, [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md). So it intimates, That God's
covenants with man are made by sacrifice, [Psa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#005.md), by Christ, the great sacrifice.
God's acceptance of our spiritual sacrifices is a token for good, and an
earnest of farther favours.

[Genesis 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 15:18</span></span>

In that same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy
seed have I given this land - He had said before, To thy seed will I
give this land, but here he saith, I have given it; that is, I have
given the promise, the charter is sealed and delivered, and cannot be
disanulled. The possession is as sure in due time, as if it were now
actually delivered to them. In David's time and Solomon's their
jurisdiction extended to the utmost of these limits, [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026.md). And it was their own fault that
they were not sooner and longer in possession of all these territories.
They forfeited their right by their sins, and by their own sloth and
cowardice kept themselves out of possession. The present occupants are
named, because their number and strength and long prescription, should
be no hindrance to the accomplishment of this promise in its season; and
to magnify God's love to Abram and his seed, in giving to that one
nation the possession of many nations.
