### [Leviticus Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 16:2</span></span>

At all times - Not whensoever he pleaseth, but only when I shall appoint
him, namely, to take down the parts and furniture of it upon every
removal, and to minister unto me once in the year. Lest he die - For his
irreverence and presumption. In the cloud - In a bright and glorious
cloud, over the mercy - seat, as a token when I would have him come.

[Leviticus 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 16:3</span></span>

With a young bullock - That is, with the blood of it; the body of it was
to be offered upon the altar of burnt - offerings. A sin - offering -
For his own and family's sins; for a goat was offered for the sins of
the people.

[Leviticus 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 16:4</span></span>

The linen coat - It is observable, the high - priest did not now use his
peculiar and glorious robes, but only his linen garments, which were
common to him with the ordinary priests. The reason whereof was, because
this was not a day of feasting and rejoicing, but of mourning and
humiliation, at which times people were to lay aside their ornaments.
These are holy - Because appropriated to an holy and religious use.

[Leviticus 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 16:8</span></span>

For the Lord - For the Lord's use by way of sacrifice. Both this and the
other goat typified Christ; this in his death and passion for us; that
in his resurrection for our deliverance.

[Leviticus 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 16:11</span></span>

The bullock - Mentioned in general, [Lev
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006.md). The ceremonies whereof are here
particularly described. This was a different bullock or heifer from that
[Num 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md), [Num
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#005.md), [Num
19:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009.md), [Num
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017.md), as appears by comparing the
places.

[Leviticus 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 16:12</span></span>

Within the veil - That is, into the holy of holies, [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 16:13</span></span>

Upon the fire - Which was in the censer, [Lev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012.md).

[Leviticus 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 16:14</span></span>

Upon the mercy - seat - To teach us, that God is merciful to sinners
only through and for the blood of Christ. With his face east - ward, or
upon the eastern part, towards the people, who were in the court which
lay east - ward from the holy of holies, which was the most western part
of the tabernacle. This signified that the high - priest in this act
represented the people, and that God accepted it on their behalf. Before
the mercy - seat - On the ground.

[Leviticus 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 16:15</span></span>

Then shall he kill the goat - He went out of the holy of holies, and
killed it, and then returned thither again with its blood. And whereas
the high - priest is said to be allowed to enter into that place but
once in a year, that is to be understood, but one day in a year, though
there was occasion of going in and coming out more than once upon that
day.

[Leviticus 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 16:16</span></span>

Because of the uncleannesses of Israel - For though the people did not
enter into that place, yet their sins entered thither, and would hinder
the effects of the high - priest's mediation on their behalf if God was
not reconciled to them. In the midst of their uncleanness - ln the midst
of a sinful people, who defile not themselves only, but also God's
sanctuary. And God hereby shewed them, how much their hearts needed to
be purified, when even the tabernacle, only by standing in the midst of
them, needed this expiation.

[Leviticus 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 16:17</span></span>

In the tabernacle - ln the holy place, where the priests and Levites
were at other times. This was commanded for the greater reverence to the
Divine Majesty then in a more special manner appearing, and that none of
them might cast an eye into the holy of holies, as the high - priest
went in or came out.

[Leviticus 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 16:18</span></span>

The altar before the Lord - That is, the altar of incense, where the
blood of sacrifices was to be put, particularly the blood of the sin -
offerings offered upon this day of atonement, and which is most properly
said to be before the Lord, that is, before the place where God in a
special manner dwelt. His going out relates to the holy of holies, into
which he was said to go in, [Lev
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#017.md).

[Leviticus 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 16:19</span></span>

Seven times - To signify its perfect cleansing, (seven being a number of
perfection) and our perfect reconciliation by the blood of Christ.

[Leviticus 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 16:21</span></span>

All the iniquities - He mentions iniquities, transgressions, and sins,
to note sins of all sorts, and that a free and full confession was to be
made, and that the smallest sins needed, and the greatest sins were not
excluded from, the benefit of Christ's death here represented. On the
head - Charging all their sins and the punishment due to them upon the
goat, which tho' only a ceremony, yet being done according to God's
appointment and manifestly pointing at Christ upon whom their iniquities
and punishments were laid, [Isa
53:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md), it was available for this end.
And hence the Heathens took their custom of selecting one beast or man,
upon whom they laid all their imprecations and curses, and whom they
killed as an expiatory sacrifice for their sins, and to prevent their
ruin. A fit man - Heb. a man of time, that is, of years and discretion,
who may be trusted with this work. Into the wilderness - Which signified
the removal of their sins far away both from the people, and out of
God's sight. And here the goat being neglected by all men, and exposed
to many hazards from wild beasts, which were numerous there, might
farther signify Christ's being forsaken both by God and by men, even by
his own disciples, and the many dangers and sufferings he underwent. The
Jews write, that this goat was carried to the mountain called Azazel,
whence the goat is so called, [Lev
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#010.md), and that there he was cast down
headlong.

[Leviticus 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 16:24</span></span>

He shall put on his linen garments - Not his ordinary priestly linen
garments, for he was to leave them in the tabernacle, [Lev
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#023.md), but the high - priestly
garments, called his garments properly, and by way of distinction. And
this change of his garments was not without cause. For the common
priestly garments were more proper for him in the former part of his
ministration, both because he was to appear before the Lord in the most
holy place to humble himself and make atonement for his own and for the
people's sins, and therefore his meanest attire was most fit, and
because he was to lay his hands upon that goat on which all their sins
were put, by which touch both he and his garments would be in some sort
defiled, and therefore as he washed himself, so we may presume his linen
garments were laid by for the washing, as the clothes of him who carried
away the scape - goat were washed, [Lev
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#026.md). And the high - priestly
garments were most proper for the latter part of his work, which was of
another nature.

[Leviticus 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 16:29</span></span>

The seventh month - Answering part to our September and part to our
October; when they had gathered in all their fruits, and were most at
leisure for God's service: This time God chose for this and other
feasts, herein graciously condescending to men's necessities and
conveniences. This feast began in the evening of the ninth day, and
continued till the evening of the tenth. Your souls - Yourselves, both
your bodies, by abstinence from food and other delights, and your minds
by grief for former sins, which though bitter, yet is voluntary in all
true penitents, who are therefore here said to afflict themselves, or to
be active in the work.

[Leviticus 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 16:31</span></span>

A sabbath - Observed as a sabbath - day from all servile works, and
diligent attendance upon God's worship.

[Leviticus 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lev 16:32</span></span>

He - The high - priest, who was to anoint his successor.

[Leviticus 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 16:34</span></span>

This shall be an everlasting statute - By which were typified the two
great gospel privileges; remission of sins, and access to God, both
which we owe to the mediation of the Lord Jesus.
