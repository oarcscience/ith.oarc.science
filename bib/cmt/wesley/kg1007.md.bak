### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 7:1</span></span>

House - The royal palace for himself, and for his successors. Thirteen
years - Almost double the time to that in which the temple was built;
because neither were the materials so far provided and prepared for
this, as they were for the temple: nor did either he or his people use
the same diligence in this, as in the other work; to which they were
quickened by God's express command.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 7:2</span></span>

Of the forest of Lebanon - An house so called, because it was built in
the forest of Lebanon, for a summer - seat, whither Solomon, having so
many chariots and horses, might at any time retire with ease. The length
- Of the principal mansion; to which doubtless other buildings were
adjoining. Pillars - Upon which the house was built, and between which
there were four stately walks. Beams - Which were laid for the floor of
the second story.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 7:3</span></span>

Fifteen - So in this second story were only three rows of pillars, which
was sufficient for the ornament of the second and for the support of the
third story.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 7:4</span></span>

Against light - One directly opposite to the other, as is usual in well
- contrived buildings. In ranks - One exactly under another.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 7:5</span></span>

Windows - He speaks, of smaller windows or lights, which were over the
several doors.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 7:6</span></span>

A porch - Supported by divers pillars, for the more magnificent entrance
into the house; upon which also it is thought there were other rooms
built, as in the house. The porch - Now mentioned which is said to be
before them; before the pillars on which the house of Lebanon stood.
Pillars - Or, and pillars; That is, fewer and lesser pillars for the
support of the lesser porch. Beam - Which was laid upon these pillars,
as the others were [Kg1 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 7:7</span></span>

A porch - Another porch or distinct room without the house. The other -
The whole floor; or, from floor to floor, from the lower floor on the
ground, to the upper floor which covered it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 7:8</span></span>

Another court - That is, between the porch and the house, called
therefore the middle court, [Kg2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004.md).
Like this - Not for form or quantity, but for the materials and
workmanship, the rooms being covered with cedar, and furnished with like
ornaments.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 7:9</span></span>

These - Buildings described here and in the former chapter. The measures
- Hewed in such measure and proportion as exact workmen use to hew
ordinary stones. Within, &c. - Both on the inside of the buildings which
were covered with cedar, and on the outside also. To the coping - From
the bottom to the top of the building. And so on - Not only on the
outside of the front of the house, which being most visible, men are
more careful to adorn; but also of the other side of the house, which
looked towards the great court belonging to the king's house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 7:11</span></span>

Above - That is, in the upper part; for this is opposed to the
foundation. Stones and cedars - Intermixed the one, and the other.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 7:12</span></span>

The court - Namely, of Solomon's dwelling - house mentioned, [Kg1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 7:14</span></span>

In brass - And Of gold, and stone, and purple, and blue, [Ch2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014.md). But only his skill in brass is
here mentioned, because he speaks only of the brasen things which he
made.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 7:16</span></span>

Five cubits - The word chapiter is taken either more largely for the
whole, so it is five cubits; Or, more strictly, either for the pommels,
as they are called, [Ch2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012.md), or for
the cornice or crown, and so it was but three cubits, to which the
pomegranates being added make it four cubits, as it is below, [Kg1
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019.md), and the other work upon it took
up one cubit more, which in all made five cubits.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 7:17</span></span>

The chapiters - Which those nets and wreathes encompass, either
covering, and as it were receiving and holding the pomegranates, or
being mixed with them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 7:18</span></span>

Two rows - Either of pomegranates, by comparing this with [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020.md), or of some other curious work.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 7:19</span></span>

Lilly work - Made like the leaves of lillies. In the porch - Or, as in
the porch; such work as there was in the porch of the temple, in which
these pillars were set, [Kg1 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021.md),
that so the work of the tops of these pillars might agree with that in
the top of the porch.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 7:20</span></span>

The belly - So he calls the middle part of the chapiter, which jetted
farthest out. Two hundred - They are said to be ninety and six on a side
of a pillar; in one row and in all an hundred, [Jer
52:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023.md), four great pomegranates between
the several checker - works being added to the first ninety six. And it
must needs be granted, that there were as many on the other side of the
pillar, or in the other row, which makes them two hundred upon a pillar,
as is here said, and four hundred upon both pillars, as they are
numbered, [Ch2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#013.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 7:21</span></span>

Jachin - Jachin signifies he; That is, God shall establish, his temple,
and church, and people: and Boaz signifies, in it, or rather, in him (to
answer the he in the former name) is strength. So these pillars being
eminently strong and stable, were types of that strength which was in
God, and would be put forth by God for the defending and establishing of
his temple and people, if they were careful to keep the conditions
required by God on their parts.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 7:23</span></span>

A Sea - He melted the brass, and cast it into the form of a great
vessel, for its vastness called a sea, which name is given by the
Hebrews to all great collections of waters. The use of it was for the
priests to wash their hands and feet, or other things as occasion
required, with the water which they drew out of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 7:24</span></span>

Knops - Carved or molten figures: for this word signifies figures or
pictures of all sorts. Ten, &c. - So there were three hundred in all.
Cast - Together with the sea; not carved. Two rows - It seems doubtful
whether the second row had ten in each cubit, and so there were three
hundred more; or, whether the ten were distributed into five in each
row.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 7:25</span></span>

Oxen - Of solid brass, which was necessary to bear so great a weight.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 7:26</span></span>

Baths - Which amounts to five hundred barrels, each bath containing
about eight gallons; the bath being a measure of the same bigness with
an ephah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 7:27</span></span>

Bases - Upon which stood the ten lavers mentioned below, [Kg1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038.md), in which they washed the parts
of the sacrifices.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 7:28</span></span>

Borders - Broad brims, possibly for the more secure holding of the
lavers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 7:29</span></span>

Base above - So he calls the upper - most part of the base: for though
it was above, yet it was a base to the laver, which stood upon it.
Additions - Either as bases for the feet of the said lions and oxen: or,
only as farther ornaments.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 7:30</span></span>

Wheels - Whereby the bases and lavers might be removed from place to
place as need required. Under - setters - Heb. shoulders; fitly so
called, because they supported the lavers, that they should not fall
from their bases, when the bases were removed together with the lavers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 7:31</span></span>

The mouth - So he calls that part in the top of the base which was left
hollow, that the foot of the laver might be let into it. The chapiter -
Within the little base, which he calls the chapiter, because it rose up
from, and stood above the great base. Above - Above the chapiter; for
the mouth went up, and grew wider like a funnel. A cubit - In height,
[Kg1 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#035.md), whereof half a cubit was
above the chapiter or little base, and the other half below it. A cubit
and half - In compass. Four square - So the innermost part, called the
mouth, was round, but the outward part was square, as when a circle is
made within a quadrangle.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 7:33</span></span>

Molten - And cast together with the bases.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 7:34</span></span>

Of the base - Not only of the same matter, but of the same piece, being
cast with it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 7:36</span></span>

The proportion - Or, empty place, that is, according to the bigness of
the spaces which were left empty for them, implying that they were
smaller than those above mentioned.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 7:39</span></span>

Right side - In the south side, not within the house, but in the priests
court, where they washed either their hands or feet, or the parts of the
sacrifices. Left side - On the north side. The south - In the south -
east part, where the offerings were prepared.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">kg1 7:45</span></span>

The pots - To boil those parts of the sacrifices which the priests, &c.
were to eat.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 7:48</span></span>

Vessels - Such as Moses had made only these were larger, and richer, and
more. Table of gold - Under which, are comprehended both all the
utensils belonging to it, and the other ten tables which he made
together with it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">kg1 7:49</span></span>

Candlesticks - Which were ten, according to the number of the tables,
whereas Moses made but one: whereby might be signified the progress of
the light of sacred truth, which was now grown clearer than it was in
Moses's time, and should shine brighter and brighter until the perfect
day of gospel light. Pure gold - Of massy and fine gold. The oracle - In
the holy place. Flowers - Wrought upon the candlesticks, as it had
formerly been.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 7:51</span></span>

Silver and gold - So much of it as was left. And vessels - Those which
David had dedicated, and with them the altar of Moses, and some other of
the old utensils which were now laid aside, far better being put in the
room of them.
