### [2 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 2:1</span></span>

But there were false prophets also - As well as true. Among the people -
Of Israel. Those that spake even the truth, when God had not sent them;
and also those that were truly sent of him, and yet corrupted or
softened their message, were false prophets. As there shall be false -
As well as true. Teachers among you, who will privately briny in - Into
the church. Destructive heresies - They first, by denying the Lord,
introduced destructive heresies, that is, divisions; or they occasioned
first these divisions, and then were given up to a reprobate mind, even
to deny the Lord that bought them. Either the heresies are the effect of
denying the Lord, or the denying the Lord was the consequence of the
heresies. Even denying - Both by their doctrine and their works. The
Lord that bought them - With his own blood. Yet these very men perish
everlastingly. Therefore Christ bought even them that perish.

[2 Peter 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe2 2:2</span></span>

The way of truth will be evil spoken of - By those who blend all false
and true Christians together.

[2 Peter 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 2:3</span></span>

They will make merchandise of you - Only use you to gain by you, as
merchants do their wares. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth
not - Was long ago determined, and will be executed speedily. All
sinners are adjudged to destruction; and God's punishing some proves he
will punish the rest.

[2 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 2:4</span></span>

Cast them down to hell - The bottomless pit, a place of unknown misery.
Delivered them - Like condemned criminals to safe custody, as if bound
with the strongest chains in a dungeon of darkness, to be reserved unto
the judgment of the great day. Though still those chains do not hinder
their often walking up and down seeking whom they may devour.

[2 Peter 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 2:5</span></span>

And spared not the old, the antediluvian, world, but he preserved Noah
the eighth person - that is, Noah and seven others, a preacher as well
as practiser, of righteousness. Bringing a flood on the world of the
ungodly - Whose numbers stood them in no stead.

[2 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 2:9</span></span>

It plainly appears, from these instances, that the Lord knoweth, hath
both wisdom and power and will, to deliver the godly out of all
temptations, and to punish the ungodly.

[2 Peter 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 2:10</span></span>

Chiefly them that walk after the flesh - Corrupt nature; particularly in
the lust of uncleanness. And despise government - The authority of their
governors. Dignities - Persons in authority.

[2 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 2:11</span></span>

Whereas angels - When they appear before the Lord, [Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md), [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md), to give an account of what they
have seen and done on the earth.

[2 Peter 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 2:12</span></span>

Savage as brute beasts - Several of which in the present disordered
state of the world, seem born to be taken and destroyed.

[2 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 2:13</span></span>

They count it pleasure to riot in the day time - They glory in doing it
in the face of the sun. They are spots in themselves, blemishes to any
church. Sporting themselves with their own deceivings - Making a jest of
those whom they deceive and even jesting while they are deceiving their
own souls.

[2 Peter 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 2:15</span></span>

The way of Balaam the son of Bosor - So the Chaldeans pronounced what
the Jews termed Beor; namely, the way of covetousness. Who loved -
Earnestly desired, though he did not dare to take, the reward of
unrighteousness - The money which Balak would have given him for cursing
Israel.

[2 Peter 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 2:16</span></span>

The beast - Though naturally dumb.

[2 Peter 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 2:17</span></span>

Fountains and clouds promise water: so do these promise, but do not
perform.

[2 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe2 2:18</span></span>

They ensnare in the desires of the flesh - Allowing them to gratify some
unholy desire. Those who were before entirely escaped from the spirit,
custom, and company of them that live in error - In sin.

[2 Peter 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe2 2:19</span></span>

While they promise them liberty - From needless restraints and scruples;
from the bondage of the law. Themselves are slaves of corruption - Even
sin, the vilest of all bondage.

[2 Peter 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 2:20</span></span>

For if after they - Who are thus ensnared. Have escaped the pollutions
of the world - The sins which pollute all who know not God. Through the
knowledge of Christ - That is, through faith in him, [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md). They are again entangled therein,
and overcome, their last state is worse than the first - More
inexcusable, and causing a greater damnation.

[2 Peter 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe2 2:21</span></span>

The commandment - The whole law of God, once not only delivered to their
ears, but written in their hearts.

[2 Peter 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe2 2:22</span></span>

The dog, the sow - Such are all men in the sight of God before they
receive his grace, and after they have made shipwreck of the faith. [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011.md).
