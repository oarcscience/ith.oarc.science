### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 31:2</span></span>

Jonathan - David's dear friend; God so ordering it for the farther
exercise of David's faith and patience; and that David might depend upon
God alone for his crown, and receive it solely from him, and not from
Jonathan; who doubtless, had he lived, would have speedily settled the
crown upon David's head. There was also a special providence of God, in
taking away Jonathan, (who of all Saul's sons, seems to have been the
fairest for the crown) for preventing divisions, which might have
happened amongst the people concerning the successor: David's way to the
crown being by this means made the more clear. Abinadab - Called also
Ishui, [Sa1 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049). Ishbosheth was not
here, being possibly at home for the management of affairs there.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 31:8</span></span>

Saul and his three sons - "The scripture, as Mr. Henry well observes,
makes no mention of the souls of Saul and his sons, what became of them
after they were dead: secret things belong not to us."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 31:9</span></span>

Cut off his head - As the Israelites did by Goliath, and fastened it in
the temple of Dagon, [Ch1 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010). Idols
- To give them the glory of this victory. And by this respect shewn to
their pretended deities, how do they shame those, who give not the
honour of their achievements to the living God?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 31:12</span></span>

Took the body, &c. - This they did, not only out of a concern, for the
honour of Israel, and the crown of Israel, but out of gratitude to Saul,
for his zeal and forwardness to rescue them from the Ammonites.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 31:13</span></span>

Fasted - To testify their sorrow for the loss of Saul, and of the people
of God; and to intreat God's favour to prevent the utter extinction of
his people. But you must not understand this word of fasting strictly,
as if they eat nothing for seven whole days; but in a more large sense,
as it is used both in sacred and profane writers; that they did eat but
little, and that but mean food, and drank only water for that time. This
book began with the birth of Samuel, and ends with the death of Saul:
The comparing these together will teach us to prefer the honour that
comes from God, before all the honours of the world.
