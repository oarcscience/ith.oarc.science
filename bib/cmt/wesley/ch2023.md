### [2 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 23:5</span></span>

Foundation - At the east gate, so called because it stood lower than the
rest of the doors at the foot of the steps, by which they went up from
the king's house to the temple.

[2 Chronicles 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 23:11</span></span>

His sons - And Zechariah among the rest, whom afterwards he ungratefully
slew, [Ch2 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021).

[2 Chronicles 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 23:13</span></span>

Rejoiced - To see a rod sprung out of the stem of Jesse! To see what
they despaired of ever seeing, a king of the house of David.

[2 Chronicles 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 23:16</span></span>

Him - The Lord, as is expressed, [Kg2
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#017).

[2 Chronicles 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 23:18</span></span>

Appointed - Or, as it is in the Hebrew, put the offices of the house of
the Lord into the hand, that is, he restored the priests and Levites to
the exercise of their office.

[2 Chronicles 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 23:21</span></span>

Rejoiced, &c. - The generality of the people rejoiced, the rest were
quiet and made no opposition. When the Son of David is enthroned in the
soul, all therein is quiet, and springs of joy are opened.
