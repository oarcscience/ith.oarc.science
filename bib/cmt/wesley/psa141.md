### [Psalms Chapter 141](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#001)

[Psalms 141:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 141:4</span></span>

Incline not - Suffer it not to be inclined. Heart - Keep me not only
from wicked speeches, but from all evil motions of my heart. Dainties -
The pleasures or advantages which they gain by their wickedness.

[Psalms 141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 141:5</span></span>

Smite - By reproofs. Break - Not hurt, but heal and greatly refresh me.
Calamities - In the calamities of those righteous persons who reproved
him. When they came into such calamities as those wherein he was
involved he would pity them and pray for them.

[Psalms 141:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 141:6</span></span>

Judges - The chief of mine enemies. Overthrown - Or, cast down headlong
by thine exemplary vengeance. Hear - Hearken unto my counsels and offers
which now they despise.

Our bones - Our case is almost as hopeless as of those who are dead, and
whose bones are scattered in several places.
