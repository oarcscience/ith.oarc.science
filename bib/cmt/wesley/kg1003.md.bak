### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 3:1</span></span>

Pharaoh - As being a powerful neighbour, whose daughter doubtless was
first instructed in, and proselyted to the Jewish religion. It seems,
this was designed by God to be a type of Christ, calling his church to
himself, and to the true religion, not only out of the Jews, but even
out of the Gentile world. City of David - Into David's palace there. The
wall - Which though in some sort built by David, yet Solomon is here
said to build, either because he made it higher, and stronger, in which
sense Nebuchadnezzar is said to have built Babylon, [Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030.md), or because he built another wall
besides the former, for after this time Jerusalem was encompassed with
more walls than one.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 3:2</span></span>

Only - This particle is used here, and [Kg1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md), as an exception to Solomon's
integrity and as a blemish to his government, That he himself both
permitted and practised this which was expressly forbidden, [Lev
17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003.md); [Deu
12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md). High places - Which were
groves, or other convenient places upon hills, in which the patriarchs
used to offer up their sacrifices to God; and from them this custom was
derived both to the Gentiles and the Jews: and in them the Gentiles
sacrificed to idols, the Hebrews to the true God. Because, &c. - Which
reason was not sufficient, for there was a tabernacle, to which they
were as much confined as to the temple, [Exo
40:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034.md), &c.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 3:3</span></span>

Yet - Although he miscarried in the matter of high places, yet in the
general, his heart was right with God. Statutes - According to the
statutes or commands of God, which are here called the statutes of
David; not only because they were diligently practised by David, but
also because the observation of them was so earnestly pressed upon
Solomon, and fortified with David's authority and command.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 3:6</span></span>

Truth - In the true worship of God, in the profession, belief, practice
and defence of the true religion. So truth here contains all duties to
God, as righteousness doth his duties to men, and uprightness the right
manner of performing both sorts of duties. With thee - That is, in thy
judgment, to whom he often appealed as the witness of his integrity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 3:7</span></span>

Child - So he was in years: not above twenty years old; and withal
(which he principally intends) he was raw and unexperienced, as a child,
in state affairs. Go out, &c. - To govern my people, and manage affairs.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 3:8</span></span>

In the midst - Is set over them to rule and guide them. A metaphor from
the overseer of divers workmen, who usually is in the midst of them,
that he may the better observe how each of them discharges his office.
Chosen - Thy peculiar people, whom thou takest special care of, and
therefore wilt expect a more punctual account of my government of them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 3:9</span></span>

An understanding heart - Whereby I may both clearly discern, and
faithfully perform all the parts of my duty: for both these are spoken
of in scripture, as the effects of a good understanding; and he that
lives in the neglect of his duties, or the practice of wickedness, is
called a fool, and one void of understanding. Discern - Namely in causes
and controversies among my people; that I may not through mistake, or
prejudice, or passion, give wrong sentences, and call evil good, or good
evil. Absalom, that was a fool, wished himself a judge: Solomon, that
was a wise man, trembles at the undertaking. The more knowing and
considerate men are, the more jealous they are of themselves.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 3:13</span></span>

All thy days - Whereby he signifies that these gifts of God were not
transient, as they were in Saul, but such as should abide with him
whilst he lived.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 3:14</span></span>

And if - This caution God gives him, lest his wisdom should make him
proud, careless, or presumptuous.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 3:15</span></span>

A dream - Not a vain dream, wherewith men are commonly deluded; but a
divine dream, assuring him of the thing: which he knew, by a divine
impression after he was awakened: and by the vast alteration which he
presently found within himself in point of wisdom and knowledge. The ark
- Which was there in the city of David, [Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md), before which he presented
himself in a way of holy adoration. Burnt offerings - Chiefly for the
expiation of his and his peoples sin, through the blood of Christ,
manifestly signified in these sacrifices. Peace offerings - Solemnly to
praise God for all his mercies, and especially for giving him quiet
possession of the kingdom, and for his glorious appearance to him in the
dream, and for the promise therein made to him, and the actual
accomplishment of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 3:16</span></span>

Harlots - Or, victuallers: for the Hebrew words signifies both. Yet that
they are unmarried persons, seems probable, both because there is no
mention of any husbands, whose office it was, if there were any such, to
contest for their wives; and because they lived a solitary life in one
house.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 3:19</span></span>

Overlaid it - And so smothered it: which she justly conjectures, because
there were evidences of that kind of death, but no appearance of any
other cause thereof.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 3:25</span></span>

Said - Though with a design far above the reach of the two women, or of
the people present, who probably with horror expected the execution of
it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 3:27</span></span>

She is the mother - As is evident from her natural affection to the
child, which she had rather have given away from her, than destroyed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 3:28</span></span>

Wisdom of God - Divine wisdom with which God had inspired him for the
government of his people.
