### [Acts Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md)

[Acts 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 8:1</span></span>

At that time there was great persecution against the Church - Their
adversaries having tasted blood, were the more eager. And they were all
dispersed - Not all the Church: if so, who would have remained for the
apostles to teach, or Saul to persecute? But all the teachers except the
apostles, who, though in the most danger, stayed with the flock.

[Acts 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 8:2</span></span>

Devout men - Who feared God more than persecution. And yet were they not
of little faith? Else they would not have made so great lamentation.

[Acts 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 8:3</span></span>

Saul made havoc of the Church - Like some furious beast of prey. So the
Greek word properly signifies. Men and women - Regarding neither age nor
sex.

[Acts 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 8:4</span></span>

Therefore they that were dispersed went every where - These very words
are reassumed, after as it were a long parenthesis, [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md) and the thread of the story
continued.

[Acts 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 8:5</span></span>

Stephen - Being taken away, Philip, his next colleague, (not the
apostle,) rises in his place.

[Acts 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 8:9</span></span>

A certain man - using magic - So there was such a thing as witchcraft
once! In Asia at least, if not in Europe or America.

[Acts 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 8:12</span></span>

But when they believed - What Philip preached, then they saw and felt
the real power of God, and submitted thereto.

[Acts 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 8:13</span></span>

And Simon believed - That is, was convinced of the truth.

[Acts 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 8:14</span></span>

And the apostles hearing that Samaria - The inhabitants of that country,
had received the word of God - By faith, sent Peter and John - He that
sends must be either superior, or at least equal, to him that is sent.
It follows that the college of the apostles was equal if not superior to
Peter.

[Acts 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 8:15</span></span>

The Holy Ghost - In his miraculous gifts? Or his sanctifying graces?
Probably in both.

[Acts 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 8:18</span></span>

Simon offered them money - And hence the procuring any ministerial
function, or ecclesiastical benefice by money, is termed Simony.

[Acts 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 8:21</span></span>

Thou hast neither part - By purchase, nor lot - Given gratis, in this
matter - This gift of God. For thy heart is not right before God -
Probably St. Peter discerned this long before he had declared it;
although it does not appear that God gave to any of the apostles a
universal power of discerning the hearts of all they conversed with; any
more than a universal power of healing all the sick they came near. This
we are sure St. Paul had not; though he was not inferior to the chief of
the apostles. Otherwise he would not have suffered the illness of
Epaphroditus to have brought him so near to death, [Phi
2:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md); nor have left so useful a
fellow labourer as Trophimus sick at Miletus, [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md).

[Acts 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 8:22</span></span>

Repent - if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee -
Without all doubt if he had repented, he would have been forgiven. The
doubt was, whether he would repent. Thou art in the gall of bitterness -
In the highest degree of wickedness, which is bitterness, that is,
misery to the soul; and in the bond of iniquity - Fast bound therewith.

[Acts 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 8:26</span></span>

The way which is desert - There were two ways from Jerusalem to Gaza,
one desert, the other through a more populous country.

[Acts 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 8:27</span></span>

An eunuch - Chief officers were anciently called eunuchs, though not
always literally such; because such used to be chief ministers in the
eastern courts. Candace, queen of the Ethiopians - So all the queens of
Ethiopia were called.

[Acts 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 8:28</span></span>

Sitting in his chariot, he read the Prophet Isaiah - God meeteth those
that remember him in his ways. It is good to read, hear, seek
information even in a journey. Why should we not redeem all our time?

[Acts 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 8:30</span></span>

And Philip running to him, said, Understandest thou what thou readest? -
He did not begin about the weather, news, or the like. In speaking for
God, we may frequently come to the point at once, without
circumlocution.

[Acts 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 8:31</span></span>

He desired Philip to come up and sit with him - Such was his modesty,
and thirst after instruction.

[Acts 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 8:32</span></span>

The portion of Scripture - By reading that very chapter, Isaiah 53, many
Jews, yea, and atheists, have been converted. Some of them history
records. God knoweth them all. [Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md)

[Acts 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 8:33</span></span>

In his humiliation his judgment was taken away - That is, when he was a
man, he had no justice shown him. To take away a person's judgment, is a
proverbial phrase for oppressing him. And who shall declare, or count
his generation - That is, who can number his seed, [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); which he hath purchased by
laying down his life?

[Acts 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 8:36</span></span>

And as they went on the way they came to a certain water - Thus, even
the circumstances of the journey were under the direction of God. The
kingdom of God suits itself to external circumstances, without any
violence, as air yields to all bodies, and yet pervades all. What
hindereth me to be baptized? - Probably he had been circumcised:
otherwise Cornelius would not have been the first fruits of the
Gentiles.

[Acts 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 8:38</span></span>

And they both went down - Out of the chariot. It does not follow that he
was baptized by immersion. The text neither affirms nor intimates any
thing concerning it.

[Acts 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 8:39</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip - Carried him away with a
miraculous swiftness, without any action or labour of his own. This had
befallen several of the prophets.

[Acts 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 8:40</span></span>

But Philip was found at Azotus - Probably none saw him, from his leaving
the eunuch, till he was there.
