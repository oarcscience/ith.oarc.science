### [Amos Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

[Amos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 4:1</span></span>

Kine of Bashan - So Amos compares the mighty, wanton, and oppressive
rulers of Israel, to those full - fed, strong, and wanton beasts which
in the herds did push at, hurt, and disturb the weaker cattle.

[Amos 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 4:2</span></span>

By his holiness - By himself as he is the holy God. The days - Of
famine, desolation and captivity. He - God by the Assyrian army will
take you, as fish are taken with the hook. Your posterity - The children
of these oppressors.

[Amos 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 4:3</span></span>

Ye - Kine of Bashan. Go out - Ye shall endeavour to make your escape.
The breaches - Which the besieging enemy make in your walls, when
Samaria is besieged. Before her - Taking the readiest way. The things -
All the riches and ornaments of your palaces.

[Amos 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 4:4</span></span>

Come to Beth - el - A strong irony, giving them over as incorrigible. At
Gilgal - Gilgal was a place where much idolatry was acted. Every morning
- In the same irony God reproves their sins tho' they imitated the
instituted worship at Jerusalem. Three years - God had [Deu
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md), commanded every third year that
all the tithe of that year should be brought, and laid up in a publick
store - house.

[Amos 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 4:5</span></span>

With leaven - As all the rest of your will - worship, so this also is
against the express law, [Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011.md).
However, do so at your peril, try whether it will end in good. Proclaim
- Publickly persuaded your people to voluntary sacrifices.

[Amos 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 4:6</span></span>

An I - The Lord who gave many blessings to win you to repentance, hath
also tried what might be done by judgments. Cleanness of teeth - This is
a description of famine.

[Amos 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 4:7</span></span>

When - At a season when your country most needed it. Upon one city -
That you might see my hand in it, I gave rain to one city, and withheld
it from the next; nay one part of the same field was watered and
flourished: another part, dry and withered.

[Amos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 4:8</span></span>

Not satisfied - Either that had not enough for them, or durst not part
with it.

[Amos 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 4:9</span></span>

Increased - When they were most fruitful. Devoured - Eat up all, as is
the manner of them.

[Amos 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 4:10</span></span>

Your horses - The riders being killed. The stink - So great slaughter
hath been made in your camp that there were not sufficient to bury the
slain.

[Amos 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 4:11</span></span>

Overthrew - By grievous and desolating judgments. As a fire - brand -
Such of you as escaped were yet as fire - brands in the midst of the
fire, 'till infinite mercy saved a remnant.

[Amos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 4:12</span></span>

Therefore - In a more terrible manner will I now proceed against thee.

[Amos 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 4:13</span></span>

Declareth - Knows the thoughts of all men. The God of hosts - Whose
sovereign power all creatures obey, and acts for or against us as he
willeth. Let us humble ourselves before this God, and give all diligence
to make him our God. For happy are the people whose God he is, and who
have all this power engaged for them.
