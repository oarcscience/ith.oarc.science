### [Leviticus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 6:2</span></span>

If a soul sin - This sin, though directly committed against man, is
emphatically said to be done against the Lord, not only in general, for
so every sin against man is also against the Lord, but in a special
sense, because this was a violation of human society, whereof God is the
author, and president, and defender: and because it was a secret sin, of
which God alone was the witness and judge: and because God's name was
abused in it by perjury. To keep - In trust. Or in fellowship - Heb. Or
in putting of the hand: that is, commerce or fellowship in trading,
which is very usual when one man puts any thing into another's hand, not
to keep it, but to improve it for the common benefit of them both, in
which cases of partnership it is easy for one to deceive the other, and
therefore provision is made against it. And this is called a putting of
the hand, because such agreements used to be confirmed by giving or
joining their hands together. By violence - Secretly; for he seems to
speak here of such sins as could not be proved by witness. Or hath
deceived - Got any thing from him by calumny, or fraud, or
circumvention; so the word signifies.

[Leviticus 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 6:3</span></span>

Swear falsely - His oath being required, seeing there was no other way
of discovery left.

[Leviticus 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 6:4</span></span>

Is guilty - This guilt being manifested by his voluntary confession upon
remorse, whereby he reapeth this benefit, that he only restores the
principal with the addition of a fifth part; whereas if he were
convicted of his fault, he was to pay double, [Exo
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#009.md).

[Leviticus 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 6:5</span></span>

In the day - It must not be delayed, but restitution to man must
accompany repentance towards God. Wherever wrong has been done,
restitution must be made, and till it is made to the utmost of our power
we cannot look for forgiveness; for the keeping of what is unjustly got,
avows the taking: And both together make but one continued act of
unrighteousness.

[Leviticus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 6:9</span></span>

And the Lord spake - Hitherto he hath prescribed the sacrifices
themselves; now he comes to the manner of them. The burnt - offering -
The daily one, which [Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038.md), [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003.md), as the following words shew.
This was to be so managed and laid on piece after piece, that the fire
might be constantly maintained by it. The morning burnt - offerings were
to be kept burning all the day from morning to night also; but he
mentions not that, because there was such a constant succession of
sacrifices in the day - time that there needed no law for feeding and
keeping in the fire then; the only danger was for the night, when other
sacrifices were not offered, but only the evening burnt - offering,
which if it had been consumed quickly, as the morning burnt - offering
was, there had been danger of the going out of that fire, which they
were commanded diligently and constantly to keep in.

[Leviticus 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 6:10</span></span>

The ashes which the fire hath consumed - That is, the wood consumed into
ashes.

[Leviticus 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 6:11</span></span>

Other garments - Because this was no sacred, but a common work. A clean
place - Where no dung or filth was laid. The priest himself was to do
all this. God's servants must think nothing below them but sin.

[Leviticus 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 6:12</span></span>

It shall not be put out - The fire coming down from heaven, was to be
perpetually preserved, and not suffered to go out, partly that there
might be no occasion or temptation to offer strange fire; and partly to
teach them whence they were to expect the acceptance of all their
sacrifices, even from the divine mercy, signified by the fire that came
down from heaven which was an usual token of God's favourable
acceptance. Every morning - Though the evening also be doubtless
intended, yet the morning is only mentioned, because then the altar was
cleansed, and the ashes taken away, and a new fire made. Thereon - Upon
the burnt - offering, which thereby would be sooner consumed, that the
way might be made for other sacrifices.

[Leviticus 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 6:13</span></span>

Thus should we keep the fire of holy love ever burning in our hearts.

[Leviticus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 6:14</span></span>

Of the meal - offering - Of that which was offered alone, and that by
any of the people, not by the priest, for then it must have been all
burnt. This law before delivered, is here repeated for the sake of some
additions made to it.

[Leviticus 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 6:16</span></span>

His sons - The males only might eat these, because they were most holy
things; whereas the daughters of Aaron might eat other holy things. In
the court - In some special room appointed for that purpose. The reason
why this was to be eaten only by holy persons, and that in an holy
place, is given [Lev 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#017.md), because it
is most holy.

[Leviticus 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 6:17</span></span>

It - That part which remains to the priest; for the part offered to God
seems not to have been baked at all.

[Leviticus 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 6:18</span></span>

Every one - That is, none should touch, or eat them, but consecrated
persons, priests, or their sons.

[Leviticus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 6:20</span></span>

When he is anointed - For high - priest for he only of all the priests
was to be anointed in future ages. This law of his consecration was
delivered before, and is here repeated because of some additions made to
it. Perpetual - Whensoever any of them shall be so anointed. At night -
Or, in the evening; the one to be annexed to the morning - sacrifice,
the other to the evening - sacrifice, over and besides that meal -
offering which every day was to be added to the daily morning and
evening sacrifices.

[Leviticus 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 6:21</span></span>

Thou - Who art so anointed and consecrated.

[Leviticus 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 6:23</span></span>

It shall not be eaten - No part of it shall be eaten by the priest, as
it was when the offering was for the people. The reason of the
difference is, partly because when he offered it for the people, he was
to have some recompence for his pains; partly to signify the
imperfection of the Levitical priest, who could not bear their own
iniquity; for the priest's eating part of the people's sacrifices did
signify his typical bearing of the people's iniquity; and partly to
teach the priests and ministers of God, that it is their duty to serve
God with singleness of heart, and to be content with God's honour though
they have no present advantage by it.

[Leviticus 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 6:26</span></span>

For sin - For the sins of the rulers, or of the people, or any of them,
but not for the sins of the priests; for then its blood was brought into
the tabernacle, and therefore it might not be eaten.

[Leviticus 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 6:27</span></span>

Upon any garment - Upon the priest's garment; for it was he only that
sprinkled it, and in so doing he might easily sprinkle his garments. In
the holy place - Partly out of reverence to the blood of sacrifices,
which hereby was kept from a profane or common touch; and partly that
such garments might be decent, and fit for sacred administrations.

[Leviticus 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 6:28</span></span>

Broken - Because being full of pores, the liquor in which it was sodden
might easily sink into it, whereby it was ceremonially holy, and
therefore was broken, lest afterwards it should be abused to common
uses. Rinsed - And not broken, as being of considerable value, which
therefore God would not have unnecessarily wasted. And this being of a
more solid substance than an earthen vessel, was not so apt to drink in
the moisture.
