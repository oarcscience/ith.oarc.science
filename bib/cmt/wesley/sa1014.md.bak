### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 14:2</span></span>

Tarried - In the outworks of the city where he had entrenched himself to
observe the motion of the Philistines. In - Or, towards Migron, which
was near Gibeah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 14:3</span></span>

Ahiah - The same who is called Abimelech, [Sa1
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md), [Sa1
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#011.md), [Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020.md), the high - priest, who was here
to attend upon the ark which was brought thither, [Sa1
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018.md). Ephod - The high - priest's
ephod, wherein the Urim and Thummim was.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 14:4</span></span>

Passages - Two passages, both which Jonathan must cross, to go to the
Philistines, between which the following rocks lay, but the words may be
rendered, in the middle of the passage, the plural number being put for
the singular. Rock - Which is not to be understood, as if in this
passage one rock was on the right hand, and the other on the left; for
so he might have gone between both: and there was no need of climbing up
to them. But the meaning is, that the tooth (or prominency) of one rock,
(as it is in the Hebrew) was on the side; that is northward, looking
towards Michmash (the garrison of the Philistines) and the tooth of the
other rock was on the other side; that is, southward, looking towards
Gibeah, (where Saul's camp lay): and Jonathan was forced to climb over
these two rocks, because the common ways from one town to the other were
obstructed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 14:6</span></span>

Uncircumcised - So he calls them, to strengthen his faith by this
consideration, that his enemies were enemies to God; whereas he was
circumcised, and therefore in covenant with God, who was both able, and
engaged to assist his people. It way be - He speaks doubtfully: for tho'
he felt himself stirred up by God to this exploit, and was assured that
God would deliver his people; yet he was not certain that he would do it
at this time, and in this way. Work - Great and wonderful things.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 14:10</span></span>

A sign - Jonathan not being assured of the success of this exploit,
desires a sign; and by the instinct of God's Spirit, pitches upon this.
Divers such motions and extraordinary impulses there were among great
and good men in ancient times. Observe; God has the governing of the
hearts and tongues of all men, even of those that know him not, and
serves his own purposes by them, tho' they mean not so, neither does
their hearts think so.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 14:12</span></span>

Come up, &c. - A speech of contempt and derision. The Lord - He piously
and modestly ascribes the success which he now foresees, to God only.
And he does not say, into our hand, but into the hand of Israel; for he
fought not his own glory, but the public good. His faith being thus
strengthened, nothing can stand against him: he climbs the rock upon all
four, though he had nothing to cover him, none to second him, but his
servant, nor any probability of any thing but death before him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 14:13</span></span>

They fell - For being endowed with extraordinary strength and courage,
and having with incredible boldness killed the first they met with, it
is not strange if the Philistines were both astonished and intimidated;
God also struck them with a panic; and withal, infatuated their minds,
and possibly, put an evil spirit among them, which in this universal
confusion made them conceive that there was treachery among themselves,
and therefore caused them to sheathe their swords in one anothers
bowels.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 14:15</span></span>

Field - That is, in the whole host which was in the field. All - That
is, among all the rest of their forces, as well as those in the garrison
at Michmash, as the spoilers, mentioned [Sa1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md), the report of this prodigy, and
with it the terror of God speedily passing from one to another.
Trembling - The Hebrew is, a trembling of God, signifying not only a
very great trembling, but such as was supernatural, and came immediately
from the hand of God. He that made the heart knows how to make it
tremble. To complete their confusion, even the earth quaked; it shook
under them, and made them fear it was just going to swallow them up.
Those who will not fear the eternal God, he can make afraid of a shadow.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 14:19</span></span>

Withdraw - Trouble not thyself to enquire; for I now plainly discern the
matter.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 14:21</span></span>

Which went - Either by constraint, as servants; or in policy, to gain
their favour and protection.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 14:23</span></span>

The battle - That is, the warriors who were engaged in the battle, and
were pursuing the Philistines. Yet it is said, the Lord saved Israel
that day: he did it by them: for without him they could do nothing.
Salvation is of the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 14:24</span></span>

Distressed - With hunger, and weakness, and faintness, and all by reason
of the following oath. Avenged - As Saul's intention was good, so the
matter of the obligation was not simply unlawful, if it had not been so
rigorous in excluding all food, and in obliging the people to it under
pain of an accursed death, which was a punishment far exceeding the
fault.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 14:26</span></span>

Honey - Bees often make their hives in the trunks of trees, or clefts of
rocks, or holes of the earth; and this in divers countries, but
eminently in Canaan.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 14:27</span></span>

Enlightened - He was refreshed, and recovered his lost spirits. This
cleared his sight, which was grown dim by hunger and faintness.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 14:28</span></span>

People - They that came with Saul, whose forces were now united with
Jonathan's.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 14:32</span></span>

Slew - At evening, when the time prefixed by Saul was expired. With
blood - Not having patience to tarry 'till the blood was perfectly gone
out of them, as they should have done. So they who made conscience of
the king's commandment for fear of the curse, make no scruple of
transgressing God's command.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 14:33</span></span>

Transgressed - He sees their fault, but not his own, in giving the
occasion of it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">sa1 14:36</span></span>

Draw near - To the ark, in order to enquire of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa1 14:39</span></span>

Answered - None of those who saw Jonathan eating, informed against him;
because they were satisfied that his ignorance excused him; and from
their great love to Jonathan, whom they would not expose to death for so
small an offence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 14:41</span></span>

Perfect lot - Or, declare the perfect, or guiltless person. That is, O
Lord, so guide the lot, that it may discover who is guilty in his
matter, and who innocent. Escaped - They were pronounced guiltless.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 14:42</span></span>

Jonathan - God so ordered the lot; not that he approved Saul's
execration, [Sa1 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md), or his oath
that the transgressor should die, [Sa1
14:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#039.md), nor that he would expose
Jonathan to death; but that Saul's folly might be chastised, when he saw
what danger it had brought upon his eldest and excellent son; and that
Jonathan's innocency might be cleared.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">sa1 14:44</span></span>

For thou, &c - We have no proof, that Saul did not act in this whole
affair from a real fear of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">sa1 14:45</span></span>

With God - In concurrence with God, he hath wrought this salvation. God
is so far from being offended with Jonathan, that he hath graciously
owned him in the great service of this day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 14:47</span></span>

Took the kingdom - That is, resumed the administration of it, after he
had in a manner lost it by the Philistines, who had almost turned him
out of it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 14:49</span></span>

Ishui - Called also Abinadab. [Sa1
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#002.md). Ishbosheth, Saul's other son is
here omitted, because he intended to mention only those of his sons who
went with him into the battles here mentioned, and who were afterwards
slain with him.
