[Psalms 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 147:4</span></span>

Calleth them - He exactly knows them as we do those whom we can call by
name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 147:9</span></span>

Ravens - Which he mentions because they were most contemptible,
especially to the Jews, to whom they were unclean: and because they are
not only neglected by men, but also forsaken by their dams as soon as
ever they can fly, and so are wholly left to the care of Divine
providence.

[Psalms 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 147:10</span></span>

Delighteth not - As if he needed either the one or the other for the
accomplishment of his designs.

[Psalms 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 147:13</span></span>

Thy gates - Thy strength consists not in thy walls, and gates, and bars,
but in his protection.

[Psalms 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 147:14</span></span>

Borders - In all thy land, even to its utmost borders.

[Psalms 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015)

Commandment - Which is sufficient without any instruments to execute
whatsoever pleaseth him. Swiftly - The thing is done without delay.

[Psalms 147:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 147:16</span></span>

Like wool - Not only in colour and shape, and softness, but also in use,
keeping the fruits of the earth warm. Ashes - In colour and smallness of
parts, as also in its burning quality.

[Psalms 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 147:17</span></span>
