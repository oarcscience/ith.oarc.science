### [Isaiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 20:1</span></span>

Sargon - Sennacherib, who, before he came to Jerusalem, came up against
and took all the walled cities of Judah, of which Ashdod might be
reckoned one, as being in the tribe of Judah.

[Isaiah 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 20:2</span></span>

Sackcloth - Which he wore in token of his grief for the calamities that
were already come upon Israel, and were coming upon Judah. Naked - Not
wholly naked, but without his upper garment, as slaves and prisoners
used to do, whose posture he was to represent. Bare - foot - After the
manner of mourners and captives.

[Isaiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 20:3</span></span>

Three years - Not constantly, but when he went abroad among the people,
to whom this was appointed for a sign. A sign - When this judgment
should come, namely, three years after this prophecy.

[Isaiah 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 20:4</span></span>

Uncovered - Having their garments cut off by the middle.

[Isaiah 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 20:5</span></span>

They - All that shall trust to them. But under this general expression
the Israelites, seem to be principally intended.

[Isaiah 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 20:6</span></span>

Of the country - Of this land, in which the prophet was, and to whose
inhabitants, these words were uttered. Such - So vain is our hope placed
upon such a people as are unable to deliver themselves.
