<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011">Daniel 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">dan 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>The prince - Not only against the high - priest, but against God himself. Was cast down - He took away the use of the temple as to the holy service and sacrifices.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013">Daniel 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">dan 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>One saint - That is, one holy angel.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014">Daniel 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">dan 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>He - That angel.

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#015">Daniel 8:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">dan 8:15</A></FONT></span></p>The meaning - A more clear discovery of those things. The appearance of a man - Probably Gabriel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016">Daniel 8:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">dan 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>A man's voice - Of him before mentioned, namely, Christ.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">dan 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>He came near - That he might speak more familiarly to him, yet Daniel could not bear the glory of it. How much less can we bear the glory of God, and how graciously hath the Lord dealt with us, to teach us by men, and not by angels? O son of man - He calls him son of man, to make him mind his frailty, and not to be lifted up with this great condescension of heaven. At the time - In God's appointed time, in the latter day, but not now in thy life - time. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#018">Daniel 8:18</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#019">Daniel 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">dan 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>The indignation - God will raise up Antiochus to execute his wrath against the Jews for their sins, yet there shall be an end of that indignation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023">Daniel 8:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">dan 8:23</A></FONT></span></p>In the latter time - When they were come to the height, and beginning to decline. When the transgressors - When the Jews were grown to an excess of wickedness, then God suffered Antiochus to persecute them. Dark sentences - Full of subtilty: such all histories declare Antiochus to be. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024">Daniel 8:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">dan 8:24</A></FONT></span></p>Not by his own power - Not by any heroick deeds, but by making use of the Jewish factions, through the divine commission to punish a backsliding nation; and by means of Eumenes and Attalus, by whose help he got up to this height. Shall destroy - He shall by force, craft, and cruelty, destroy many of God's people. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#025">Daniel 8:25</A></p>

Against the prince of princes - He fought against God, affronting God's laws, profaning God's worship, and temple, and setting up the image and worship of Jupiter there. Without hand - By a disease whereof he died, 1 Macc. 6:8. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026">Daniel 8:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">dan 8:26</A></FONT></span></p>Shut thou up - Lay it up in thy heart. For many days - Three hundred years after this; long after Daniel's days. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#027">Daniel 8:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">dan 8:27</A></FONT></span></p>Was sick - Being overwhelmed by a sense of the calamity that should befall the people of God. Did the king's business - Having recovered strength, he minded his place, duty and trust, and concealed the whole, that they might not see it by his countenance.
