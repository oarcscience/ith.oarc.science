A bed - The Persians had their coffins, in which with balms and spices,
the dead were kept, in the midst of places provided for them; in such is
the king of Elam here placed with his slaughtered captains about him.
All the honour he can now pretend to, is to be buried in the chief
sepulchre.

[Ezekiel 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md)

captains, to have their weapons, and their armour carried before the
hearse. Laid their swords - In their graves, as if they could sleep the

the seed of Abraham. But that shall stand them in no stead: they shall
lie with the uncircumcised.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 32:32</span></span>

My terror - These tyrants were a terror to the world by their cruelty;
and God hath made them a terror by his just punishments; and so, saith
God, will I do with Pharaoh. Come and see the calamitous state of human
life! See what a dying world this is! The strong die, the mighty die;
Pharaoh and all his multitude! But here is likewise an allusion to the
final and everlasting death of impenitent sinners. Those that are
uncircumcised in heart, are slain by the sword of Divine Justice. Their
iniquity is upon them, and they bear their shame for ever.
