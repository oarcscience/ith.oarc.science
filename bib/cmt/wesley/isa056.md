### [Isaiah Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001)

[Isaiah 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 56:1</span></span>

My salvation - That eminent salvation by the Messiah, and in which,
without this you shall have no share. Is near - So the scripture often
speaks of things which are at a great distance, as if they were present
or at hand, [Hab 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003); [Jam
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008); [Rev
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#020). My righteousness - The same
thing which he called salvation.

[Isaiah 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 56:2</span></span>

The man - Every man not only Jews but Gentiles, as it is explained in
the following verses. The sabbath - The sabbath seems to be put here, as
sacrifice is elsewhere, for the whole worship of God.

[Isaiah 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 56:3</span></span>

The stranger - The stranger, the Gentile, who by birth is a stranger to
God, that hath turned from dumb idols to the living God. The eunuch -
Who is here joined with the stranger, because he was forbidden to enter
into the congregation of the Lord, [Deu
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001). Under these two instances he
understands all those, who either by birth, or by any ceremonial
pollution, were excluded from church privileges, and so he throws open
the door to all true believers. A dry tree - A fruitless tree, accursed
by God with the curse of barrenness.

[Isaiah 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 56:4</span></span>

Take hold - That stedfastly keep the conditions of my covenant.

[Isaiah 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 56:5</span></span>

In mine house - In my temple. Better - A far greater blessing and honour
than that of having posterity, even my favour, and my spirit, and
eternal felicity.

[Isaiah 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 56:7</span></span>

Mountain - To my house, which stood upon mount Zion. Joyful - By
accepting their services, and comforting their hearts with the sense of
my love. Accepted - They shall have as free access to mine house and
altar, as the Jews themselves, and their services shall be as acceptable
to me. Evangelical worship is here described under such expressions as
agreed to the worship of God which then was in use.

[Isaiah 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 56:8</span></span>

The Lord - Who will gather to himself, and bring into their own land,
those that are cast out of their own land. Yet - I will make a far more
comprehensive gathering of the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 56:9</span></span>

Come - This is a prediction of Israel's destruction by their cruel
enemies. The prophet having largely discoursed concerning the Messiah,
and his kingdom, and having encouraged the Gentiles with God's gracious
promises made to them, now proceeds to terrify the unbelieving Jews, and
to shew that as the Gentiles would believe, and be saved, so they would
reject their Messiah, and be destroyed.

[Isaiah 56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 56:10</span></span>

His - Israel's. Watchmen - Priests and teachers; he mentions only the
teachers, because ignorance was most shameful in them, but hereby he
supposes the gross ignorance of the people. Bark - They are also
slothful and negligent in instructing the people, and do not faithfully
reprove them for their sins.

[Isaiah 56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 56:11</span></span>

They look - They regard neither God's glory, nor the peoples good, but
only the satisfaction of their own base desires. Quarter - In their
several stations.

[Isaiah 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 56:12</span></span>

Say they - Unto their brethren, fellow - priests, or other jolly
companions. Fill ourselves - We will drink not only to delight, but even
to drunkenness, as the word signifies, which shews their dreadful
security and contempt of God, and their abandoning of all care of their
own or peoples souls.
