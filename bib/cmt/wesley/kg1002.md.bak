### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 2:2</span></span>

I go the way, &c. - Even the sons and heirs of heaven, must go the way
of all the earth, of all who dwell thereon. But they walk with pleasure
in this way, thro' the valley of the shadow of death. Prophets, yea
kings must go this way to brighter light and honour than prophecy or
sovereignty. Be strong - For, to govern his people according to the law
of God, requires great fortitude, or strength of mind. And a man - In
manly wisdom, and courage, and constancy, though thou art but young in
years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 2:3</span></span>

The law - Which the prince was enjoined to transcribe and read, [Deu
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011.md), that be might govern his own
and his peoples actions by it. Mayest profit - Or, behave thyself
prudently. Hereby he intimates, that religion is the truest reason of
state, and that all true wisdom and good success depend upon piety.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 2:4</span></span>

Confirm his word - Fulfil his promise, the condition upon which it was
suspended, being performed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

To me - That is, against me; in what he did against Abner and Amasa:
whose death was a great injury to David, as it was a breach of his laws
and peace; a contempt of his person and government; a pernicious example
to his subjects, and a great scandal to him, as if Joab had been only
David's instrument, to affect what he secretly designed. And shed - He
slew them as if they had been in the state of war, when there was not
only a cessation of arms, but also a treaty of peace. Put the blood -
This is added to note his impenitency, that although by his perfidious
manner of killing them when he pretended to embrace them, he stained his
own garments with their blood, yet he was not ashamed of it, but gloried
in it, and marched boldly along with the army, with the same girdle and
shoes which were sprinkled with their blood.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 2:6</span></span>

Do therefore - That is, what in reason and justice thou seest fit. For
tho' I was forced to forbear him, yet I never forgave him; punish him
according to his demerits.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 2:7</span></span>

For so - With such kindness.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 2:8</span></span>

I will not, &c. - The words are, The king said unto Shimei, thou shalt
not die: and the king sware unto him, [Sa2
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#023.md). The oath, we see, was absolute.
It was not, I will not put thee to death now. or, I will not put thee to
death with the sword. But who can reconcile his charge to Solomon with
this oath? Surely, considering the time of that charge, this next to the
matter of Uriah, is the greatest blemish in all David's life.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 2:25</span></span>

Benaiah - For the execution of justice was not then committed to obscure
persons, as now it is; but to persons of great honour and authority. It
is far from clear, that Solomon did right herein, or that Adonijah had
any ill design in asking Abishag.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 2:26</span></span>

Because, &c. - Thus Solomon shews respect to his sacred function. He
mixes mercy with justice, and requites Abiathar's former kindness to
David; hereby teaching princes, that they should not write injuries in
marble, and benefits in sand, as they have been so often observed to do.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 2:27</span></span>

Which he spake - Concerning the translation of the priesthood from the
house of Eli, and of Ithamar, to that of Eleazar: which being threatened
eighty years ago, is now executed. So divine vengeance, though sometimes
it be slow, is always sure.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 2:30</span></span>

He said, Nay, &c. - For he supposed, either, that Solomon would not
defile that place with his blood, but would spare him for his respect to
it, as he had done Adonijah: or, he had a superstitious conceit, that
his dying there might give his guilty and miserable soul some advantage.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 2:31</span></span>

Do, &c. - Kill him, though he be there; take him from that place, and
then kill him: for, [Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014.md), doth
not command the ruler to kill the murderer there, but to remove him
thence, to take him from the altar, that he may die.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 2:34</span></span>

Wilderness - Places which have but few houses and inhabitants, are often
so called in scripture. He was buried privately, like a criminal, not
pompously, like a general.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 2:36</span></span>

Go not forth - This Solomon ordered, both for his own security; and as a
penalty for his former wickedness.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 2:37</span></span>

Kidron - A brook nigh Jerusalem, which he particularly names, because
that was the way to Bahurim, his former habitation: but this is not all,
for the restraint was general, that he should not go forth thence any
whither. Thy blood - The blame and guilt of thy blood shall lie upon
thyself only.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg1 2:38</span></span>

Is good - Thy sentence is more merciful than I expected, or deserved.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 2:39</span></span>

Achish - A king, but subject and tributary, to Solomon. Permitted to
enjoy the title and honour of a king, but not the full power; whence it
was, that Achish could not keep these servants though they had fled to
him for protection; but suffered Shimei to take them away from his royal
city.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg1 2:40</span></span>

To seek his servants - By seeking his servants, says Bp. Hall, he lost
himself. These earthly things either are, or should be our servants. How
commonly do we see men run out of the bounds set by God's laws, to hunt
after them, till their souls incur a fearful judgment.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 2:44</span></span>

Thine heart - For which thine own conscience accuseth thee, and there is
no need of other witnesses. The Lord - God hath punished thee for thy
former wickedness, by suffering thee to expose thyself to thy deserved
death.
