### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001)

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

Came to Joel - Probably in the latter end of Jeroboam the second's reign
over Israel and in the days of Uzziah, over Judah.

[Joel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 1:2</span></span>

Old men - The oldest among you, who can remember things done many years
ago.

[Joel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 1:4</span></span>

Palmer - worm - Four sorts of insects, are here mentioned, which
succeeded each other, and devoured all that might be a support to the
Jews, whence ensued a grievous famine.

[Joel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 1:5</span></span>

Is cut off - Suddenly cut off even when you are ready to drink it, and
totally cut off by these devouring vermin.

[Joel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 1:6</span></span>

A nation - An innumerable multitude of locusts and caterpillars, called
a nation here, as Solomon calls the conies and the ant, [Pro
30:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025), and perhaps a prognostick of
a very numerous and mighty nation, that ere long will invade Judah.
Strong - Mighty in power, and undaunted in courage, if you refer it to
the Assyrian or Babylonians; if to those vermin, they are, though each
weak by itself, yet in those multitudes, strong and irresistible. A
great lion - Such waste as lions make, these the locusts do, and the
Assyrians will make.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

The husband of her youth - Espoused to her, but snatched away by an
untimely death.

[Joel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 1:9</span></span>

The drink - offering - By the destruction of the vines, all wine (out of
which they ought to offer the drink - offering) failed.

[Joel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 1:10</span></span>

The corn - The wheat and barley, is eaten up in its greenness. Dried up
- The drought was so great, that the vines were withered, and all their
hopes of new wine cut off. The oil - The olive - trees. Languisheth -
This is a plain account of the reason why the priests were called to
mourn, and why the meal - offering and drink - offering were cut off.

[Joel 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joe 1:11</span></span>

Be ye ashamed - This is a just cause why you should lament and enquire
why God is so displeased with you.

[Joel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 1:14</span></span>

confess your sins, and sue out your pardon. Into the house - The courts
of the temple, where the people were wont to pray.

[Joel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015)

troubles which God will heap upon them. Shall it come - Unless fasting,
prayers and amendment prevent.

Laid desolate - Run to ruin because the owners discouraged with the
barrenness of the seasons, would not repair them.

[Joel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 1:19</span></span>

The fire - The immoderate heats. The wilderness - The world, only means
places not ploughed, and less inhabited than others.

[Joel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020)
