### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001)

[Numbers 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 23:1</span></span>

Build seven altars - To the true God, otherwise he would not have
mentioned it to God, as an argument why he should grant his requests, as
he doth, [Num 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004). And though Balak
was averse from God and his worship, yet he would be easily overruled by
Balaam, who doubtless told him that it was in vain to make an address to
any other than the God of Israel, who alone was able either to bless or
curse them as he pleased. Seven - This being the solemn and usual number
in sacrifices.

[Numbers 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 23:3</span></span>

Stand by thy burnt - offering - As in God's presence, as one that offers
thyself as well as thy sacrifices to obtain his favour. I will go - To
some solitary and convenient place, where I may prevail with God to
appear to me. Sheweth me - Reveals to me, either by word or sign. An
high place - Or, into the plain, as that word properly signifies.

[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 23:7</span></span>

His parable - That is, his oracular and prophetical speech; which he
calls a parable, because of the weightiness of the matter, and the
liveliness of the expressions which is usual in parables. Jacob - The
posterity of Jacob.

[Numbers 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 23:9</span></span>

The rocks - Upon which I now stand. I see him - I see the people,
according to thy desire, [Num 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041),
but cannot improve that sight to the end for which thou didst design it,
to curse them. The people shall dwell alone - This people are of a
distinct kind from others, God's peculiar people, separated from all
other nations, as in religion and laws, so also in divine protection;
and therefore enchantments cannot have that power against them which
they have against other persons and people.

[Numbers 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 23:10</span></span>

The dust - The numberless people of Jacob or Israel, who according to
God's promise, are now become as the dust of the earth. Of the righteous
- Of this righteous and holy people. The sense is, they are not only
happy above other nations in this life, and therefore in vain should I
curse them, but they have this peculiar privilege, that they are happy
after death: their happiness begins where the happiness of other people
ends; and therefore I heartily wish that my soul may have its portion
with theirs when I die. Was not God now again striving with him, not
only for the sake of Israel, but of his own soul?

[Numbers 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 23:12</span></span>

Must I not - Ought I not? Is it not my duty? Canst thou blame me for it?

[Numbers 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 23:13</span></span>

Thou shalt not see them all - Perhaps he thought the sight of all them
might discourage him, or as it did before, raise his fancy to an
admiration of the multitude and felicity of the people.

[Numbers 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 23:15</span></span>

While I meet the Lord - To consult him, and to receive an answer from
him.

[Numbers 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 23:18</span></span>

Rise up - This word implies the diligent attention required; rouse up
thyself and carefully mind what I say.

[Numbers 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 23:19</span></span>

That he should lie - Break his promises made to his people for their
preservation and benediction. Repent - Change his counsels or purposes;
unless he see iniquity in Jacob.

[Numbers 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 23:21</span></span>

Iniquity - Not such as in the Canaanites: Such as he will punish with a
curse, with utter destruction. The Lord is with him - He hath a favour
for this people, and will defend and save them. The shout of a king -
That is, such joyful and triumphant shouts as those wherewith a people
congratulate the approach and presence of their King: when he appears
among them upon some solemn occasion, or when he returns from battle
with victory. This expression implies God's being their King and ruler,
and their abundant security and confidence in him.

[Numbers 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 23:22</span></span>

Out of Egypt - Namely, by a strong hand, and in spite of all their
enemies, and therefore it is in vain to seek or hope to overcome them.
He - Israel, whom God brought out of Egypt, such change of numbers being
very common in the Hebrew language. The sense is, Israel is not now what
he was in Egypt, a poor, weak, dispirited, unarmed people, but high and
strong and invincible. An unicorn - The word may mean either a
rhinoceros, or a strong and fierce kind of wild goat. But such a
creature as an unicorn, as commonly painted, has no existence in nature.

[Numbers 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 23:23</span></span>

Against Jacob - Nor against any that truly believe in Christ. What hath
God wrought - How wonderful and glorious are those works which God is
now about to do for Israel! These things will be a matter of discourse
and admiration to all ages.

[Numbers 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 23:24</span></span>

As a great Lion - As a lion rouseth up himself to fight, or to go out to
the prey, so shall Israel stir up themselves to warlike attempts against
their enemies. He shall not lie down - Not rest or cease from fighting
and pursuing.

[Numbers 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 23:28</span></span>

Peor - An high place called Beth - peor, [Deu
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029). That is, the house or temple of
Peor, because there they worshipped Baal - peor.
