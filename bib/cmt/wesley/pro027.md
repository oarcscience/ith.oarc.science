<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 27:1</span></span>

Boast not - Of any good thing which thou purposeth to do, or hopest to
receive tomorrow, or hereafter. Knowest not - What may happen in the
space of one day. The day is said to bring forth, what God by his
almighty power either causes or suffers to be brought forth or done in
it.

without end.

[Proverbs 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 27:5</span></span>

Open - When it is needful, in which case, though it put a man to some
shame yet it doth him good. Better - More desirable and beneficial.
Secret love - Which does not shew itself by friendly actions, and
particularly by free and faithful reproof.

[Proverbs 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 27:6</span></span>

Wounds - The sharpest reproofs. Kisses - All the outward profession of
friendship.

[Proverbs 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 27:8</span></span>

Wandereth - That flies from place to place, whereby she is exposed to
all the arts of fowlers, and to birds of prey. So - So is he who through
vanity or lightness changes his abode, or his calling.

[Proverbs 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 27:10</span></span>

Neither go - For comfort and relief, so as to forsake thy friend for

neighbour. Near - In affection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 27:11</span></span>

Reproacheth - For being the father of a wicked son.

[Proverbs 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 27:14</span></span>

Blesseth - That praises him to his face. A loud voice - That both he,
and others, may be sure to take notice of it. Rising early - To shew his
great forwardness. A curse - His friend will value this kind of blessing
no more than a curse.

[Proverbs 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 27:16</span></span>

Hideth - Attempts to smother her passion. Right - hand - Which being the
great instrument of action, by its much stirring, diffuses the savour of
it.

[Proverbs 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 27:17</span></span>

Iron - Iron tools are made sharp and fit for use, by rubbing them
against the file, or some other iron. The countenance - The company or
conversation of his friend.

[Proverbs 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#018.md)

[Proverbs 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 27:19</span></span>

So - So one man resembles another in the corruption of his nature.

[Proverbs 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 27:20</span></span>

Hell - The grave devours all the bodies which are put into it, and is
always ready to receive and devour more. The eyes - The desires, which
discover themselves by the eyes.

[Proverbs 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 27:21</span></span>

To his praise - Or, according to his praise. So a man is tried by
praise.

[Proverbs 27:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 27:23</span></span>

Flock - Flocks and herds are here put for all possessions, because
anciently they were the chief part of a man's riches.

[Proverbs 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 27:24</span></span>

For - What thou dost now possess, will not last always. If a man had the
wealth of a kingdom, without care and diligence it would be brought to
nothing.

[Proverbs 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 27:25</span></span>

The hay - Another encouragement to diligence; God invites thee to it by
the plentiful provisions wherewith he has enriched the earth for thy
sake. The mountains - Even the most barren parts afford thee their help.

[Proverbs 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 27:26</span></span>

The price - By the sale whereof thou mayest either pay the rent of the
field which thou hirest, or purchase fields or lands. Goats might better
be spared and sold than sheep, which brought a more constant profit to
the owner.

[Proverbs 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 27:27</span></span>

used a plain and simple diet.
