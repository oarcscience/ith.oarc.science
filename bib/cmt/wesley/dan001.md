### [Daniel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 1:2</span></span>

With part of the vessels - In this expedition Nebuchadnezzar carried
away some captives, among whom were Daniel and his friends. His god -
Baal, or Bell, and Nebo, which words they put into the names of their
kings and favourites.

[Daniel 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 1:3</span></span>

Of the eunuchs - These were chief among the king's servants; and they
are called eunuchs, because many of them were such. And of the princes -
Here was fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had foretold, [Isa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md).

[Daniel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 1:4</span></span>

The learning and the tongue - The Chaldeans were skilled above any other
nation, in natural philosophy. Their tongue differed from the Hebrew in
dialect and in pronunciation, which they learned that they might be the
more acceptable to the king, and court.

[Daniel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 1:5</span></span>

The king's meat - Such as he had at his own table.

[Daniel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 1:6</span></span>

And Azariah - Probably all of the royal lineage of Judah.

[Daniel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 1:7</span></span>

Gave names - That is, other names, relating to the idol - gods.
Belteshazzar - So Daniel had the name of Belteshazzar, from the great
Babylonian idol Baal or Bell. This was by the king's command, and herein
he put forth an act: of his sovereignty.

[Daniel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 1:8</span></span>

But Daniel purposed - There may be several weighty reasons assigned why
Daniel did this. Because many of those meats provided for the king's
table, were forbidden by the Jewish law. Daniel knew these delicates
would too much gratify the flesh. He did not dare to eat and drink
things consecrated to idols. He was sensible, how unsuitable delicate
fare would be to the afflicted state of God's people. Therefore he was
herein a rare pattern of avoiding all the occasions of evil.

[Daniel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 1:15</span></span>

Fairer and fatter - The blessing of God upon homely fare, affords often
more health and strength, than more costly fare to them that eat the
fat, and drink the sweet.

[Daniel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 1:19</span></span>

Before - Both in the presence chamber, and in the council chamber, to
try their proficiency; this shews the king's ability and judgment, how
else could he discern their fitness, and their excellency above others.

[Daniel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 1:20</span></span>

The king enquired - This is a farther confirmation of the king's noble
endowments, and of his great care whom he chose to be in offices of
trust, namely persons excellently qualified to serve him in the great
affairs of the kingdom. And thus did God pour contempt upon the pride of
the Chaldeans, and put honour on the low estate of his people.

[Daniel 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 1:21</span></span>

Continued - in the court of Babylon until Cyrus, and then he was in the
Persian court, and he lived in honour and high employment all that time,
yea, after Cyrus began to reign. For [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md), he had visions and revelations
in the third year of Cyrus.
