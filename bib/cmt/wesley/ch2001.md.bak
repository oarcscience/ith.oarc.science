To reign, &c. - Give me the spirit of my father David, that Israel may
not suffer by the change. The eminency of those that went before us, and
the obligation that lies upon us, to keep and carry on the good work
they were engaged in, should quicken our prayers for wisdom and grace,
that we may do the work of God in our day, as faithful as they did in
theirs.

Neither &c. - Those that make this world their end, come short of the
other, and frequently of this too. But those who make the other world
their end, shall not only obtain that, but shalt have as much as is
convenient of this world in their way.
