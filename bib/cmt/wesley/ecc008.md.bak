### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 8:1</span></span>

Who is wise - There are few wise men in this world. Who knoweth - How
few understand the reasons of things and can rightly expound the word
and works of God. Wisdom - Makes a man venerable, chearful, mild, and
amiable. The face is put for the mind, because the mind discovers itself
in the countenance. Boldness - The roughness or fierceness. Changed -
Into gentleness and humility.

[Ecclesiastes 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 8:2</span></span>

The oath - Because of that oath which thou hast taken to keep all God's
laws, whereof this of obedience to superiors is one.

[Ecclesiastes 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 8:3</span></span>

To go - In discontent, withdrawing thyself from the king's service or
obedience. Stand not - if thou hast offended him, persist not in it. For
- His power is uncontrollable.

[Ecclesiastes 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 8:5</span></span>

The commandment - Solomon passes to a new subject. Shall feel - Shall be
delivered from those mischiefs which befal the disobedient. Discerneth -
Both when, and in what manner he must keep the commands of God.

[Ecclesiastes 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 8:6</span></span>

Because - There is a fit way and season for the accomplishment of every
business, which is known to God, but for the most part hidden from man.
Therefore - Because there are few who have wisdom to discern this, most
men expose themselves to manifold miseries.

[Ecclesiastes 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 8:7</span></span>

For - Men are generally ignorant of future events, and therefore their
minds are disquieted.

[Ecclesiastes 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 8:8</span></span>

To retain - To keep it in the body. This is added as another evidence of
man's misery. No discharge - In that fatal conflict between life and
death, when a man is struggling with death, though to no purpose, for
death will be always conqueror. Neither - And although wicked men, who
most fear death, use all possible means, to free themselves from it, yet
they shall not escape it. The most subtle wickedness cannot outwit
death, nor the most daring wickedness out - brave it.

[Ecclesiastes 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 8:9</span></span>

To his hurt - There are some kings, who use their power tyrannically,
whereby they not only oppress their people, but hurt themselves,
bringing the vengeance of God upon their own heads.

[Ecclesiastes 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 8:10</span></span>

And so - In like manner. The wicked - Wicked princes or rulers. Buried -
With state and pomp. Who - Had administered publick justice, which is
frequently signified by the phrase of coming in and going out before the
people. The holy - The throne or tribunal seems to be so called here, to
aggravate their wickedness, who being advanced by God into so high and
sacred a place, betrayed so great a trust. Where - They lived in great
splendor, and were buried with great magnificence. This - That men
should so earnestly thirst after glory, which is so soon extinct.

[Ecclesiastes 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 8:11</span></span>

Therefore - God's forbearance makes them presumptuous and secure.

[Ecclesiastes 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 8:13</span></span>

A shadow - His life, though it may seem long, yet in truth is but a
shadow, which will quickly vanish and disappear.

[Ecclesiastes 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 8:14</span></span>

Done - Either by wicked potentates, who do commonly advance unworthy
men, and oppress persons of greatest virtue and merit: or, by God's
providence, who sees it fit for many weighty reasons so to manage the
affairs of the present world. To whom - Who meet with such usage as the
worst of men deserve. It happeneth - Who, instead of those punishments
which they deserve, receive those rewards which are due to virtuous men.

[Ecclesiastes 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 8:15</span></span>

To be merry - This he speaks of sensual delights.

[Ecclesiastes 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 8:16</span></span>

To see - To observe mens various designs and employments, and their
unwearied labours about worldly things. For there is - Having now
mentioned the business which is done, or which man doth, upon earth, he
further adds, as an evidence of man's eagerness in pursuing his
business, for even by day and by night he (the busy man) seeth not sleep
with his eyes. He grudges himself necessary refreshments, and disquiets
himself with endless cares and labours.

[Ecclesiastes 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 8:17</span></span>

I beheld - I considered the counsels and ways of God, and the various
methods of his providence, and the reasons of them. Find out - No man,
though ever so wise, is able fully and perfectly to understand these
things. And therefore it is best for man not to perplex himself with
endless enquiries, but quietly to submit to God's will and providence,
and to live in the fear of God, and the comfortable enjoyment of his
blessing.
