### [2 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 21:2</span></span>

Azariah - Two sons called by the same name, though doubtless
distinguished by some additional title: which is not mentioned here,
because it did not concern succeeding ages to know it. Of Israel - So he
is called either, Because he was so by right: or Because he was king not
only of Judah and Benjamin, but of a great number of Israelites, who had
come and settled in his kingdom.

[2 Chronicles 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 21:4</span></span>

Strengthened himself - He hardened his heart, as that word sometimes
signifies. Princes - The chief of those Israelites, who out of love to
God and the true religion, had forsaken their estates in the kingdom of
Israel, and were now incorporated with the kingdom of Judah: because he
thought these would be most zealous for that religion which he was
resolved to oppose.

[2 Chronicles 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 21:10</span></span>

Libnah - Libnah seems to have set up for a free state. And the reason is
here given, both why God permitted it, and why they did it, because
Jehoram was become an idolater. While he adhered to God, they adhered to
him; but when he cast God off, they cast him off. Whether this would
justify them in their revolt or no, it justified God's providence which
suffered it.

[2 Chronicles 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 21:11</span></span>

High places - Not to the Lord, but to Baals or false gods. And caused -
Not only by his counsel and example, but by force, by threats, and
penalties.

[2 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 21:12</span></span>

From Elijah - By this it appears, that Jehoram came to the throne before
Elijah's translation. It is true, we find Elisha attending Jehoshaphat;
but that might be, while Elijah was yet on earth: for we read of
Jehoram's coming to the crown, before we read of Elijah's translation,
[Kg1 22:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#050.md). We may suppose, the time
of his departure was at hand, so that he could not go in person to
Jehoram. But he left this writing, probably with Elisha, to be sent the
first opportunity. The message is sent in the name of the Lord God of
David his father, upbraiding him with his relation to David, as that
which was no more his honour, but an aggravation of his degeneracy.

[2 Chronicles 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 21:15</span></span>

People - Because the generality of them sinned, in complying with his
wicked and idolatrous commands. Wives - Whose lives shall go for the
lives of thy brethren, [Ch2 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004.md).

[2 Chronicles 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 21:16</span></span>

Philistines - A people fully subdued and dispirited: but God now raises
their spirits and courage to do his work. Ethiopians - A people in
Arabia, so called, either for their likeness in complexion to the
Ethiopians, or because the one of these people were a colony of the
other.

[2 Chronicles 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 21:17</span></span>

His wives - Whom also they slew, [Ch2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md), except Ahaziah and Athaliah; who
possibly were hidden in some secret place. Left him - Blood for blood.
He had slain all his brethren; they slay all his sons, but one. And he
had not escaped, had be not been of the house of David; which must not
be extirpated, like that of Ahab: because a blessing was in it; no less
a blessing than that of the Messiah.

[2 Chronicles 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 21:20</span></span>

Desired - This is an emphatical expression, because it is usual with men
to desire the deaths of some persons, whom afterward they lament, and
heartily wish they were alive again. But for this ungodly and unhappy
prince, his people did not only in his life time wish his death, but
afterwards did not repent of those desires.
