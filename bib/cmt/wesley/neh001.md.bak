### [Nehemiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

The words - Or rather, the acts, as the word often signifies. Chisleu -
Which is the ninth month, containing part of November, and part of
December. Year - Of Artaxerxes. Shushan - The royal city of Persia.

[Nehemiah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 1:3</span></span>

The province - In Judea, now a province under the Persian monarchs. The
wall, &c. - The walls and gates continue as Nebuchadnezzar left them;
the Jews not being in a condition to rebuild them, nor having commission
from the kings of Persia to do so.

[Nehemiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 1:4</span></span>

The God of heaven - Who seeth in secret; secret; having no opportunity
of doing it openly.

[Nehemiah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 1:6</span></span>

Which I pray, &c. - He refers to all the prayers, which he had for some
time been putting up.

[Nehemiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">neh 1:11</span></span>

To fear thy name - Those who truly desire to fear his name, shall be
graciously accepted of God. This man - The king: who is but a man and
therefore his heart is wholly at thy disposal. Favour with men is then
comfortable, when we see it springing from the mercy of God. Cup -
bearer - Whereby I had opportunity to speak to him, and some favour with
him.
