### [Jonah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001)

[Jonah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 4:1</span></span>

It - The divine forbearance sparing Nineveh.

[Jonah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 4:2</span></span>

Was not this - Did I not think of this? That thy pardon would contradict
my preaching.

[Jonah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 4:3</span></span>

Than to live - Disgraced and upbraided by hardened sinners, who will
brand me for a liar.

[Jonah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 4:5</span></span>

A booth - Some small and mean shed, probably of green boughs. 'Till he
might see - It seems the forty days were not fully expired.

[Jonah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 4:6</span></span>

Prepared - Commanded that in the place where Jonah's booth stood, this
spreading plant should spring up to be a shade when the gathered boughs
were withered. To deliver - To give some ease to his mind.

[Jonah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 4:7</span></span>

Prepared - By the same power which caused the gourd suddenly to spring,
and spread itself. It smote - Which early next morning, bit the root, so
that the whole gourd withered.

[Jonah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 4:8</span></span>

A east wind - A dry, scorching, blasting wind. Fainted - Overcome by the
heat. Better to die - But Jonah must be wiser, and humbler, and more
merciful too, e'er he die. Before God hath done with him, he will teach
him to value his own life more, and to be more tender of the life of
others.

[Jonah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 4:9</span></span>

I do well to be angry - If in the violence of this passion I should die
(as some have) yet were I not to blame. What a speech! Verily the law
made nothing perfect!

[Jonah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 4:10</span></span>

Laboured - Thou didst not set it. Grow - Nor didst thou water or give
growth to it.

[Jonah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 4:11</span></span>

I - The God of infinite compassions and goodness. That great city -
Wouldest thou have me less merciful to such a goodly city, than thou art
to a weed? Who cannot discern - Here are more than six - score innocents
who are infants. Much cattle - Beside men, women and children who are in
Nineveh, there are many other of my creatures that are not sinful, and
my tender mercies are and shall be over all my works. If thou wouldest
be their butcher, yet I will be their God. Go Jonah, rest thyself
content and be thankful: that goodness, which spared Nineveh, hath
spared thee in this thy inexcusable frowardness. I will be to repenting
Nineveh what I am to thee, a God gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
and of great kindness, and I will turn from the evil which thou and they
deserve.
