### [Psalms Chapter 78](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001)

[Psalms 78:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 78:1</span></span>

My law - The doctrine which I am about to deliver.

[Psalms 78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 78:2</span></span>

Parable - Weighty sentences. Dark sayings - Not that the words are hard
to be understood, but the things, God's transcendent goodness, their
unparallel'd ingratitude; and their stupid ignorance and insensibleness,
under such excellent teachings of God's word and works, are prodigious
and hard to be believed. Of old - Of things done in ancient times.

[Psalms 78:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 78:5</span></span>

Established - This is justly put in first place, as the chief of all his
mercies. A testimony - His law, called a testimony, because it is a
witness between God and men, declaring the duties which God expects from
man, and the blessings which man may expect from God.

[Psalms 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 78:9</span></span>

Ephraim - That Ephraim is here put for all Israel seems evident from the
following verses, wherein the sins, upon which this overthrow is
charged, are manifestly the sins of all the children of Israel, and they
who are here called Ephraim are called Jacob and Israel, [Psa
78:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#021), and this passage may refer to
that dreadful overthrow related, [Sa1
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010), which is particularly named,
because as the ark, so the flight was in that tribe. And the psalmist
having related this amazing providence, falls into a large discourse of
the causes of it, namely, the manifold sins of that and the former
generations, which having prosecuted from hence to [Psa
78:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060), he there returns to this
history, and relates the sad consequence of that disaster, the captivity
of the ark, and God's forsaking of Shiloh and Ephraim, and removing
thence to the tribe of Judah and mount Zion. Bows - These are put for
all arms.
