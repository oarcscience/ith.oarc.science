### [Matthew Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)

[Matthew 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 10:1</span></span>

His twelve disciples - Hence it appears that he had already chosen out
of his disciples, those whom he afterward termed apostles. The number
seems to have relation to the twelve patriarchs, and the twelve tribes
of Israel. [Mar 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014); [Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007); [Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013); [Luk
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001).

[Matthew 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 10:2</span></span>

The first, Simon - The first who was called to a constant attendance on
Christ; although Andrew had seen him before Simon. [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013).

[Matthew 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 10:3</span></span>

Lebbeus - Commonly called Judas, the brother of James.

[Matthew 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 10:4</span></span>

Iscariot - So called from Iscarioth, (the place of his birth,) a town of
the tribe of Ephraim, near the city of Samaria.

[Matthew 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 10:5</span></span>

These twelve Jesus sent forth - Herein exercising his supreme authority,
as God over all. None but God can give men authority to preach his word.
Go not - Their commission was thus confined now, because the calling of
the Gentiles was deferred till after the more plentiful effusion of the
Holy Ghost on the day of pentecost. Enter not - Not to preach; but they
might to buy what they wanted, [Joh
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009).

[Matthew 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 10:8</span></span>

Cast out devils - It is a great relief to the spirits of an infidel,
sinking under a dread, that possibly the Gospel may be true, to find it
observed by a learned brother, that the diseases therein ascribed to the
operation of the devil have the very same symptoms with the natural
diseases of lunacy, epilepsy, or convulsions; whence he readily and very
willingly concludes, that the devil had no hand in them. But it were
well to stop and consider a little. Suppose God should suffer an evil
spirit to usurp the same power over a man's body, as the man himself has
naturally; and suppose him actually to exercise that power; could we
conclude the devil had no hand therein, because his body was bent in the
very same manner wherein the man himself might have bent it naturally?
And suppose God gives an evil spirit a greater power, to effect
immediately the organ of the nerves in the brain, by irritating them to
produce violent motions, or so relaxing them that they can produce
little or no motion; still the symptoms will be those of over tense
nerves, as in madness, epilepsies, convulsions; or of relaxed nerves, as
in paralytic cases. But could we conclude thence that the devil had no
hand in them? Will any man affirm that God cannot or will not, on any
occasion whatever, give such a power to an evil spirit? Or that effects,
the like of which may be produced by natural causes, cannot possibly be
produced by preternatural? If this be possible, then he who affirms it
was so, in any particular case, cannot be justly charged with falsehood,
merely for affirming the reality of a possible thing. Yet in this manner
are the evangelists treated by those unhappy men, who above all things
dread the truth of the Gospel, because, if it is true, they are of all
men the most miserable. Freely ye have received - All things; in
particular the power of working miracles; freely give - Exert that power
wherever you come. [Mar 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007); [Luk
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#002).

[Matthew 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 10:9</span></span>

Provide not - The stress seems to lie on this word: they might use what
they had ready; but they might not stay a moment to provide any thing
more, neither take any thought about it. Nor indeed were they to take
any thing with them, more than was strictly necessary. Lest it should
retard them. Because they were to learn hereby to trust to God in all
future exigencies.

[Matthew 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 10:10</span></span>

Neither scrip - That is, a wallet, or bag to hold provisions: Nor yet a
staff - We read, [Mar 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008), Take
nothing, save a staff only. He that had one might take it; they that had
none, might not provide any. For the workman is worthy of his
maintenance - The word includes all that is mentioned in [Mat
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009); all that they were forbidden
to provide for themselves, so far as it was needful for them. [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007).

[Matthew 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 10:11</span></span>

Inquire who is worthy - That you should abide with him: who is disposed
to receive the Gospel. There abide - In that house, till ye leave the
town. [Mar 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#010); [Luk
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#004).

[Matthew 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 10:12</span></span>

Salute it - In the usual Jewish form, "Peace (that is, all blessings) be
to this house."

[Matthew 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 10:13</span></span>

If the house be worthy - of it, God shall give them the peace you wish
them. If not, he shall give you what they refuse. The same will be the
case, when we pray for them that are not worthy.

[Matthew 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 10:14</span></span>

Shake off the dust from your feet - The Jews thought the land of Israel
so peculiarly holy, that when they came home from any heathen country,
they stopped at the borders and shook or wiped off the dust of it from
their feet, that the holy land might not be polluted with it. Therefore
the action here enjoined was a lively intimation, that those Jews who
had rejected the Gospel were holy no longer, but were on a level with
heathens and idolaters.

[Matthew 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 10:16</span></span>

[Luk 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003).

[Matthew 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 10:17</span></span>

But think not that all your innocence and all your wisdom will screen
you from persecution. They will scourge you in their synagogues - In
these the Jews held their courts of judicature, about both civil and
ecclesiastical affairs. [Mat 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009).

[Matthew 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 10:19</span></span>

Take no thought - Neither at this time, on any sudden call, need we be
careful how or what to answer. [Luk
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011).

[Matthew 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 10:21</span></span>

[Luk 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#016).

[Matthew 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 10:22</span></span>

Of all men - That know not God. [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013).

[Matthew 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 10:23</span></span>

Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel - Make what haste ye
will; till the Son of man be come - To destroy their temple and nation.

[Matthew 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 10:24</span></span>

[Luk 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030); [Joh
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020).

[Matthew 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 10:25</span></span>

How much more - This cannot refer to the quantity of reproach and
persecution: (for in this the servant cannot be above his lord:) but
only to the certainty of it. [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024).

[Matthew 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 10:26</span></span>

Therefore fear them not - For ye have only the same usage with your
Lord. There is nothing covered - So that however they may slander you
now, your innocence will at length appear. [Mar
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#022); [Luk
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017); [Luk
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002).

[Matthew 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 10:27</span></span>

Even what I now tell you secretly is not to be kept secret long, but
declared publicly. Therefore, What ye hear in the ear, publish on the
house - top - Two customs of the Jews seem to be alluded to here. Their
doctors used to whisper in the ear of their disciples what they were to
pronounce aloud to others. And as their houses were low and flat roofed,
they sometimes preached to the people from thence. [Luk
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#003).

[Matthew 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 10:28</span></span>

And be not afraid - of any thing which ye may suffer for proclaiming it.
Be afraid of him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell - It
is remarkable, that our Lord commands those who love God, still to fear
him, even on this account, under this notion.

[Matthew 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 10:29</span></span>

The particular providence of God is another reason for your not fearing
man. For this extends to the very smallest things. And if he has such
care over the most inconsiderable creatures, how much more will he take
care of you, (provided you confess him before men, before powerful
enemies of the truth,) and that not only in this life, but in the other
also? [Luk 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#007).

[Matthew 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 10:32</span></span>

Whosoever shall confess me - Publicly acknowledge me for the promised
Messiah. But this confession implies the receiving his whole doctrine,
[Mar 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038), and obeying all his
commandments. [Luk 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026).

[Matthew 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 10:33</span></span>

Whosoever shall deny me before men - To which ye will be strongly
tempted. For Think not that I am come - That is, think not that
universal peace will be the immediate consequence of my coming. Just the
contrary. Both public and private divisions will follow, wheresoever my
Gospel comes with power. Ye - this is not the design, though it be the
event of his coming, through the opposition of devils and men. [Luk
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051).

[Matthew 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 10:36</span></span>

And the foes of a man - That loves and follows me. [Mic
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006).

[Matthew 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 10:37</span></span>

He that loveth father or mother more than me - He that is not ready to
give up all these, when they stand in competition with his duty.

[Matthew 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 10:38</span></span>

He that taketh not his cross - That is, whatever pain or inconvenience
cannot be avoided, but by doing some evil, or omitting some good. [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024); [Luk
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#027).

[Matthew 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 10:39</span></span>

He that findeth his life shall lose it - He that saves his life by
denying me, shall lose it eternally; and he that loseth his life by
confessing me, shall save it eternally. And as you shall be thus
rewarded, so in proportion shall they who entertain you for my sake.
[Mat 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#025); [Joh
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#025).

[Matthew 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 10:40</span></span>

[Mat 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#005); [Luk
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016); [Joh
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#020).

[Matthew 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 10:41</span></span>

He that entertaineth a prophet - That is, a preacher of the Gospel: In
the name of a prophet - That is, because he is such, shall share in his
reward.

[Matthew 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 10:42</span></span>

One of these little ones - The very least Christian. [Mar
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#041).
