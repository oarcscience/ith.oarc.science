### [Isaiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 23:1</span></span>

Of Tyre - The prophecy of the heavy calamity and destruction of Tyre.
Tyre was, according to this prophecy, destroyed; first by
Nebuchadnezzar, and afterwards by Alexander the great. And tho' this
prophecy seemed directly to respect the former destruction, yet it seems
to have some reference to the latter also; only it is intimated, that
after seventy years, Tyre should recover some former power and glory,
before her second and final destruction. Howl - To which howling and
lamenting is ascribed by a known figure. No house - So effectually
wasted, that there is not an house left in it, nor any merchants or
others that go into it, for traffick. Chittim - He mentions the land of
Chittim, because this was an eminent place for shipping and trading, and
therefore doubtless had great dealings with Tyre. It may here be put for
all other countries which traded with her. It is not necessary to
determine what Chittim is; it is sufficient to know, that it was a
seafaring place in the Midland Sea.

[Isaiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 23:2</span></span>

Be still - Heb. be silent, boast no more of thy wealth and power. The
isle - Of Tyre, which was an island, 'till Alexander joined it to the
continent. The title of islands is often given by the Hebrews to places
bordering upon the sea. That pass - That are a sea - faring people.
Replenished - With manners, and commodities.

[Isaiah 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 23:4</span></span>

Zidon - Zidon was a great city near Tyre, strongly united to her by
commerce and league, and called by some the mother of Tyre, which they
say, was built and first inhabited by a colony of the Sidonians. The sea
- That part of the sea in which Tyre was, and from which ships and men
were sent into all countries. The strength - Tyre might be called the
strength of the sea, because it defendeth that part of the sea from
piracies and injuries. I travel not - I, who was so fruitful, that I
sent forth colonies into other countries (of which Carthage was one), am
now barren and desolate.

[Isaiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 23:5</span></span>

Waters - By the sea, which is very fitly called the great waters,
understand, cometh, or is brought to her. The seed - The corn of Egypt,
wherewith Egypt abounded. Sihor is the same as the Nile. The harvest -
The plentiful harvest of corn which comes from the inundation of the
Nile; emphatically called the river. The revenue - Is as plentifully
enjoyed by her, as if it grew in her own territories. A mart - A place
to which all nations resort for traffick.

[Isaiah 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 23:7</span></span>

Antiquity - Being built before Joshua's time, [Jos
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md). Her feet - Whereas before, like
a delicate lady, she would not set her foot to the ground, but used to
be carried in stately chariots. To sojourn - To seek for new
habitations.

[Isaiah 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 23:8</span></span>

Who - This is the word of God, and not of man. The crowning city - Which
was a royal city, and carried away the crown from all other cities.
Princes - Equal to princes for wealth, and power, and reputation.

[Isaiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 23:9</span></span>

The Lord - This is the Lord's own doing. To stain - God's design is by
this example to abase the pride of all the potentates of the earth.

[Isaiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 23:10</span></span>

Pass through - Tarry no longer in thy own territories, but flee through
them, into other countries, for safety and relief. As a river - Swiftly,
lest you be prevented. Tarshish - O Tyre, which might well be called
daughter of Tarshish, that is, of the sea, as that word is used, [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001.md), and elsewhere, because it was an
island, and therefore as it were, born of the sea, and nourished and
brought up by it.

[Isaiah 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 23:11</span></span>

He - The Lord. Shook - Heb. he made the kingdoms to tremble; the
neighbouring and confederate kingdoms, who might justly quake at her
fall, for the dreadfulness and unexpectedness of the thing; and because
Tyre was a bulwark, and a refuge to them. A commandment - Hath put this
design into the hearts of her enemies, and given them courage to
attempt, and strength to execute it.

[Isaiah 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 23:12</span></span>

Virgin - So he calls her, because she had hitherto never borne the yoke
of a conquering enemy. Zidon - Tyre may be called the daughter of Zidon,
because she was first built and possessed by a colony of the Zidonians.
No rest - Thither thine enemies shall pursue thee, and there shall they
overtake the.

[Isaiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 23:13</span></span>

Behold - Thou Tyrians, cast your eyes upon the Chaldeans or Babylonians;
who tho' now flourishing, grow far more glorious and potent, even the
glory of kingdoms, yet shall certainly be brought to utter ruin. This
people - The Chaldeans at first were not a people, not formed into any
commonwealth or kingdom, 'till Nimrod, the head and founder of the
Assyrian monarchy, built Babel, [Gen
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009.md), now the head of the Chaldean
monarchy; which he built for those people, who then lived in tents, and
were dispersed here and there in waste places. He - The Lord. To ruin -
Will infallibly bring that great empire to ruin. He speaks of a future
thing as if it were already past.

[Isaiah 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 23:14</span></span>

Your strength - The city of Tyre, where you found safety and wealth.

[Isaiah 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 23:15</span></span>

Forgotten - Neglected and forsaken. Seventy years - During the time of
the Jewish captivity in Babylon. Tyre was taken by Nebuchadnezzar, [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md); [Eze
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md), a little after the taking of
Jerusalem and was restored by the favour of the Persian monarchs after
the return of the Jews. One king - One royal race of Nebuchadnezzar,
including his son, and his son's son, in whom his family and kingdom
were to expire. Sing - She shall by degrees return to her former
traffick, whereby she shall easily entice the merchants of the world to
trade with her, as harlots use to entice men by lascivious songs.

[Isaiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 23:16</span></span>

Go about - As harlots use to do. Thou harlot - So he calls Tyre, because
she enticed the merchants to deal with her by various artifices, and
even by dishonest practices, and because of the great and general
uncleanness which was committed in it.

[Isaiah 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 23:17</span></span>

Visit - In mercy. Her hire - The Hebrew word properly signifies, the
hire of an harlot. Fornication - Shall trade promiscuously with people
of all nations, as harlots entertain all comers.

[Isaiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 23:18</span></span>

Holiness - This is a prophecy concerning the conversion of the Tyrians
to the true religion. Laid up - Either out of covetousness, or for their
pride and luxury, as they formerly did; but now they shall freely lay it
out upon pious and charitable uses. Shall be - For the support and
encouragement of the ministers of holy things, who shall teach the good
knowledge of the Lord. Although this does not exclude, but rather imply
their liberality in contributing to the necessities of all Christians.
