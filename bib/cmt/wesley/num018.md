### [Numbers Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)

[Numbers 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 18:1</span></span>

Shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary - Shall suffer the punishment
of all the usurpations, or pollutions of the sanctuary, or the holy
things, by the Levites, or any of the people, because you have power
from me to keep them all within their bounds. Thus the people are in
good measure secured against their fears. Also they are informed that
Aaron's high dignity was attended with great burdens, having not only
his own, but the people's sins to answer for; and therefore they had no
such reason to envy him, if the benefits and dangers were equally
considered. The iniquity of your priesthood - That is, Of all the errors
committed by yourselves, or by you permitted in others in things,
belonging to your priesthood.

[Numbers 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 18:2</span></span>

Unto thee - About sacrifices and offerings and other things, according
to the rules I have prescribed them. The Levites are said to minister to
Aaron here, to the church, [Num 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009),
and to God, [Deu 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#008). They shall not
contend with thee for superiority, as they have done, but shall be
subordinate to thee. Thy sons with thee - Or, both to thee, and to thy
sons with thee: Which translation may seem to be favoured by the
following words, before the tabernacle, which was the proper place where
the Levites ministered. Besides, both the foregoing words, and the two
following verses, entirely speak of the ministry of the Levites, and the
ministry of the priests is distinctly spoken of, [Num
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005).

[Numbers 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 18:3</span></span>

They charge - That is, that which thou shalt command them and commit
unto them.

[Numbers 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 18:5</span></span>

The sanctuary - Of the holy, and of the most holy place.

[Numbers 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 18:6</span></span>

To you they are given as a gift - We are to value it as a great gift of
the divine bounty, to have those joined to us, that will be helpful and
serviceable to us, in the service of God.

[Numbers 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 18:7</span></span>

The altar - Of burnt - offering. Within the veil - This phrase here
comprehends both the holy and the most holy place. As a gift which I
have freely conferred upon you, and upon you alone; and therefore let no
man henceforth dare either to charge you with arrogance in appropriating
this to yourselves, or to invade your office.

[Numbers 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 18:8</span></span>

I have given them - Not only the charge, but the use of them for thyself
and family. By reason of the anointing - That is, because thou art
priest, and art to devote thyself wholly to my service.

[Numbers 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 18:9</span></span>

Most holy - Such as were to be eaten only by the priests, and that in
the sanctuary. Reserved - That is, such sacrifices or parts of
sacrifices as were not burnt in the fire. Render unto me - By way of
compensation for a trespass committed against me, in which case a ram
was to be offered, which was a most holy thing, and may be particularly
designed here.

[Numbers 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 18:10</span></span>

In the most holy place - In the court of the priests, where there were
places for this use, which is called the most holy place, not simply and
absolutely, but in respect of the thing he speaks of because this was
the most holy of all the places appointed for eating holy things,
whereof some might be eaten in any clean place in the camp, or in their
own house.

[Numbers 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 18:13</span></span>

Whatsoever is first ripe - Not only the first - fruits of the oil and
wine, and wheat now mentioned, but all other first - fruits of all other
grains, and all fruit trees. Clean - And none else, because these were
first offered to God, and by consequence given to priests; but for those
which were immediately given to the priests, the clean and unclean might
eat of them.

[Numbers 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 18:14</span></span>

Devoted - Dedicated to God by vow or otherwise, provided it be such a
thing as might be eaten: for the vessels or treasures of gold and silver
which were dedicated by Joshua, David, or others, were not the priests,
but appropriated to the uses of the temple.

[Numbers 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 18:15</span></span>

Of men - Which were offered to God in his temple, and to his service and
disposal.

[Numbers 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 18:16</span></span>

Those that are to be redeemed - Namely, of men only, not of unclean
beasts, as is manifest from the time and price of redemption here
mentioned, both which agree to men; the time, [Num
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#016), the price, [Num
3:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#046), but neither agree to unclean
beasts, which were to be redeemed with a sheep, [Exo
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013), and that after it was eight
days old.

[Numbers 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 18:17</span></span>

Holy - Namely, in a peculiar manner, consecrated to an holy use, even to
be sacrificed to God. [Deu 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019).

[Numbers 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 18:18</span></span>

The flesh - All the flesh of them, and not only some parts, as in other
sacrifices.

[Numbers 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 18:19</span></span>

A covenant of salt - A durable and perpetual covenant; so called here
and [Ch2 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005), either, because salt is
a sign of incorruption, as being of singular use to preserve things from
corruption: or, because it is ratified on their part by salt, which is
therefore called the salt of the covenant, for which the priests were
obliged to take care, that it should never be lacking from any meat -
offering, [Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013). And this
privilege conferred upon the priests is called a covenant because it is
given them conditionally, upon condition of their service, and care
about the worship of God.

[Numbers 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 18:20</span></span>

In their land - In the land of the children of Israel. You shall not
have a distinct portion of land, as the other tribes shall. The reason
of this law, was, partly because God would have them wholly devoted to
his service, and therefore free from worldly incumbrances; partly,
because God had abundantly provided for them otherwise, by tithes and
first - fruits and oblations; and partly that by this means being
dispersed among the several tribes, they might have the better
opportunity for teaching and watching over the people. I am thy part - I
have appointed thee a liberal maintenance out of my oblations.

[Numbers 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 18:21</span></span>

The tenth - For the tithes were all given to the Levites, and out of
their tithes the tenth was given to the priests.

[Numbers 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 18:22</span></span>

Nigh - So nigh as to do any proper act to the priests or Levites.

[Numbers 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 18:23</span></span>

Their iniquity - The punishment due not only for their own, but also for
the people's miscarriage, if it be committed through their connivance or
negligence. And this was the reason why the priests withstood King
Uzziah, when he would have burnt incense to the Lord.

[Numbers 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 18:24</span></span>

An heave - offering - An acknowledgment that they have all their land
and the fruits of it from God's bounty. Note the word heave - offering,
which is for the most part understood of a particular kind of offerings
heaved or lifted up to the Lord, is here used for any offering.

[Numbers 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 18:26</span></span>

Ye shall offer up an heave - offering - They who are employed in
assisting the devotions of others, must be sure to pay their own as an
heave - offering. Prayers and praises, or rather the heart lifted up in
them, are now our heave - offerings.

[Numbers 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 18:27</span></span>

As though it were the corn - It shall be accepted of you as much as if
you offered it out of your own lands and labours.

[Numbers 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 18:28</span></span>

To Aaron - And to his children, who were all to have their share herein.

[Numbers 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 18:29</span></span>

Your gifts - Not only out of your tithes, but out of the other gifts
which you receive from the people, and out of those fields which shall
belong to your cities. Offer - To the priest. As many gifts, so many
heave - offerings; you shall reserve a part out of each of them for the
priest. The hallowed part - the tenth part, which was the part or
proportion that God hallowed or sanctified to himself as his proper
portion.

[Numbers 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 18:31</span></span>

Every place - In every clean place, and not in the holy place only.

[Numbers 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 18:32</span></span>

Neither shall ye pollute the holy things - As you will do, if you abuse
their holy offerings, by reserving that entirely to yourselves, which
they offer to God to be disposed as he hath appointed, namely, part to
you, and part to the priests.
