### [Nehemiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 2:1</span></span>

Nisan - Four months after he had heard those sad tidings. The reason of
this long delay might be either that his turn of attending upon the king
did not come 'till that time: or that 'till then he wanted a fit
opportunity to move it to him.

[Nehemiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 2:2</span></span>

Sad - His fasting joined with inward grief had made a sensible change in
his countenance. Afraid - It was an unusual and ungrateful thing to come
into the king of Persia's presence with any token of sorrow. And he
feared a disappointment, because his request was great and invidious,
and odious to most of the Persian courtiers.

[Nehemiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 2:3</span></span>

Why should, &c. - All the grievances of the church, but especially its
desolations, ought to be matter of grief to all good people, to all that
have a concern for God's honour, and are of a public spirit.

[Nehemiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 2:4</span></span>

Let, &c. - My sadness comes not from any disaffection to the king, for
whom my hearty prayers are that he may live for ever; but from another
cause. Sepulchres - Which by all nations are esteemed sacred and
inviolable. He saith not a word of the temple as he spake before a
Heathen king who cared for none of these things. I prayed - To direct my
thoughts and words, and to incline the king's heart to grant my request.

[Nehemiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 2:6</span></span>

The queen - Which is here noted, as an unusual thing; for commonly the
kings of Persia dined alone, and perhaps because the queen expressed
some kindness to him, and promoted his request. How long - This question
shewed the king's affection to him, and that he was not willing to want
his attendance longer than was necessary. A time - He built the walls in
fifty two days, [Neh 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#015.md), and
probably not long after returned to the king, by whom he was sent a
second time with a more ample commission.

[Nehemiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 2:8</span></span>

King's forest - Of the forest of Lebanon, famous for choice trees.
Palace - Of the king's palace, which was adjoining to the house of God.
Enter - That I shall build to dwell in while I am there.

[Nehemiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 2:10</span></span>

Horonite - So called either, from the place of his birth or rule, which
is supposed to be Horonaim, an eminent city of Moab. The servant - So
called probably from the condition from which he was advanced to his
present power and dignity: which also may be mentioned as one reason why
he now carried himself so insolently, it being usual for persons
suddenly raised from a low state, so to demean themselves.

[Nehemiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 2:12</span></span>

Night - Concealing both his intentions as long as he could, knowing that
the life of his business lay in secrecy and expedition. Beast - To
prevent noise.

[Nehemiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 2:13</span></span>

I went - The footmen who accompanied him directing and leading him in
the way. His design was to go round the city, to observe the compass and
condition of the walls and gates, that he might make sufficient
provisions for the work.

[Nehemiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 2:14</span></span>

No place - The way being obstructed with heaps of rubbish.

[Nehemiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 2:16</span></span>

That did - Or, were to do, whom he intended to employ in it.

[Nehemiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 2:18</span></span>

Rise up - Let us do it with vigour, and diligence, and resolution, as
those that are determined to go through with it. Their hands - Their own
and one anothers.

[Nehemiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">neh 2:20</span></span>

No portion - You have no authority over us, nor interest in our church
and state, but are aliens from the common - wealth of Israel. Memorial -
No testimony, or monument, either of your relation to us by birth or
religion, or of your kindness to us, or to this place.
