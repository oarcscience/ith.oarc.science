### [Psalms Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 32:2</span></span>

Imputeth - Whom God doth not charge with the guilt of his sins, but
graciously pardons and accepts him in Christ. No guile - Who freely
confesses all his sins, and turns from sin to God with all his heart.

[Psalms 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 32:3</span></span>

Silence - From a full and open confession of my sins. Old - My spirit
failed, and the strength of my body decayed. Roaring - Because of the
continual horrors of my conscience, and sense of God's wrath.

[Psalms 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 32:4</span></span>

Hand - Thy afflicting hand. My moisture - Was dried up.

[Psalms 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 32:5</span></span>

The iniquity - The guilt of my sin.

[Psalms 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 32:6</span></span>

For this - Upon the encouragement of my example. Found - In an
acceptable and seasonable time, while God continues to offer grace and
mercy. Waters - In the time of great calamities. Not come - So as to
overwhelm him.

[Psalms 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 32:8</span></span>

I will - This and the next verse seems to be the words of God, whom
David brings in as returning this answer to his prayers. Mine eye - So
Christ did St. Peter, when he turned and looked upon him.

[Psalms 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 32:9</span></span>

Will not - Unless they be forced to it by a bit or bridle. And so all
the ancient translators understand it.

[Psalms 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 32:10</span></span>

Sorrows - This is an argument to enforce the foregoing admonition.
