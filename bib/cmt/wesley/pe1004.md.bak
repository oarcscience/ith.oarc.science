### [1 Peter Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 4:1</span></span>

Arm yourselves with the same mind - Which will be armour of proof
against all your enemies. For he that hath suffered in the flesh - That
hath so suffered as to he thereby made inwardly and truly conformable to
the sufferings of Christ. Hath ceased from sin - Is delivered from it.

[1 Peter 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 4:2</span></span>

That ye may no longer live in the flesh - Even in this mortal body. To
the desires of men - Either your own or those of others. These are
various; but the will of God is one.

[1 Peter 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 4:3</span></span>

Revellings, banquetings - Have these words any meaning now? They had,
seventeen hundred years ago. Then the former meant, meetings to eat;
meetings, the direct end of which was, to please the taste: the latter,
meetings to drink: both of which Christians then ranked with abominable
idolatries.

[1 Peter 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 4:4</span></span>

The same - As ye did once. Speaking evil of you - As proud, singular,
silly, wicked and the like.

[1 Peter 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 4:5</span></span>

Who shall give account - Of this, as well as all their other ways. To
him who is ready - So faith represents him now.

[1 Peter 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 4:6</span></span>

For to this end was the gospel preached - Ever since it was given to
Adam. To them that are now dead - In their several generations. That
they might be judged - That though they were judged. In the flesh
according to the manner of men - With rash, unrighteous judgment. They
might live according to the will and word of God, in the Spirit; the
soul renewed after his image.

[1 Peter 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 4:7</span></span>

But the end of all things - And so of their wrongs, and your sufferings.
Is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer - Temperance
helps watchfulness, and both of them help prayer. Watch, that ye may
pray; and pray, that ye may watch.

[1 Peter 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 4:8</span></span>

Love covereth a multitude of sins - Yea, "love covereth all things." He
that loves another, covers his faults, how many soever they be. He turns
away his own eyes from them; and, as far as is possible, hides them from
others. And he continually prays that all the sinner's iniquities may be
forgiven and his sins covered. Meantime the God of love measures to him
with the same measure into his bosom.

[1 Peter 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 4:9</span></span>

One to another - Ye that are of different towns or countries. Without
murmuring - With all cheerfulness. [Pro
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md).

[1 Peter 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 4:10</span></span>

As every one hath received a gift - Spiritual or temporal, ordinary or
extraordinary, although the latter seems primarily intended. So minister
it one to another - Employ it for the common good. As good stewards of
the manifold grace of God - The talents wherewith his free love has
intrusted you.

[1 Peter 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 4:11</span></span>

If any man speak, let him - In his whole conversation, public and
private. Speak as the oracles of God - Let all his words be according to
this pattern, both as to matter and manner, more especially in public.
By this mark we may always know who are, so far, the true or false
prophets. The oracles of God teach that men should repent, believe,
obey. He that treats of faith and leaves out repentance, or does not
enjoin practical holiness to believers, does not speak as the oracles of
God: he does not preach Christ, let him think as highly of himself as he
will. If any man minister - Serve his brother in love, whether in
spintuals or temporals. Let him minister as of the ability which God
giveth - That is, humbly and diligently, ascribing all his power to God,
and using it with his might. Whose is the glory - of his wisdom, which
teaches us to speak. And the might - Which enables us to act.

[1 Peter 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 4:12</span></span>

Wonder not at the burning which is among you - This is the literal
meaning of the expression. It seems to include both martyrdom itself,
which so frequently was by fire, and all the other sufferings joined
with, or previous to, it; which is permitted by the wisdom of God for
your trial. Be not surprised at this.

[1 Peter 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 4:13</span></span>

But as ye partake of the sufferings of Christ - [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md), while ye suffer for his sake,
rejoice in hope of more abundant glory. For the measure of glory answers
the measure of suffering; and much more abundantly.

[1 Peter 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 4:14</span></span>

If ye are reproached for Christ - Reproaches and cruel mockings were
always one part of their sufferings. The Spirit of glory and of God
resteth upon you - The same Spirit which was upon Christ, [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md). He is here termed, the Spirit of
glory, conquering all reproach and shame, and the Spirit of God, whose
Son, Jesus Christ is. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part
he is glorified - That is, while they are blaspheming Christ, you
glorify him in the midst of your sufferings, [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md).

[1 Peter 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 4:15</span></span>

Let none of you deservedly suffer, as an evildoer - In any kind.

[1 Peter 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 4:16</span></span>

Let him glorify God - Who giveth him the honour so to suffer, and so
great a reward for suffering.

[1 Peter 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 4:17</span></span>

The time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God - God first
visits his church, and that both in justice and mercy. What shall the
end be of them that obey not the gospel - How terribly will he visit
them! The judgments which are milder at the beginning, grow more and
more severe. But good men, having already sustained their part, are only
spectators of the miseries of the wicked.

[1 Peter 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 4:18</span></span>

If the righteous scarcely be saved - Escape with the utmost difficulty.
Where shall the ungodly - The man who knows not God. And the open sinner
appear - In that day of vengeance. The salvation here primarily spoken
of is of a temporal nature. But we may apply the words to eternal
things, and then they are still more awful. [Pro
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#031.md).

[1 Peter 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 4:19</span></span>

Let them that suffer according to the will of God - Both for a good
cause, and in a right spirit. Commit to him their souls - (Whatever
becomes of the body) as a sacred depositum. In well doing - Be this your
care, to do and suffer well: He will take care of the rest. As unto a
faithful Creator - In whose truth, love, and power, ye may safely trust.
