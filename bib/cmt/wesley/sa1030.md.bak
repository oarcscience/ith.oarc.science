### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 30:1</span></span>

The south - Namely, the southern part of Judah, and the adjacent parts.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 30:4</span></span>

Wept - It is no disparagement to the boldest, bravest spirits, to lament
the calamities of friends or relations.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 30:6</span></span>

Stoning him - As the author of their miseries, by coming to Ziklag at
first, by provoking the Amalekites to this cruelty, and by his
forwardness in marching away with Achish, and leaving their wives and
children unguarded. Encouraged himself - That is, in this that the all -
wise, and all - powerful Lord, was his God by covenant and special
promise, and fatherly affection, as he had shewed himself to be in the
whole course of his providence towards him. It is the duty of all good
men, whatever happens, to encourage themselves in the Lord their God,
assuring themselves, that he both can and will bring light out of
darkness.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 30:7</span></span>

The ephod - And put it upon thyself, that thou mayst enquire of God
according to his ordinance, David was sensible of his former error in
neglecting to ask counsel of God by the ephod, when he came to Achish,
and when he went out with Achish to the Battle; and his necessity now
brings him to his duty, and his duty meets with success.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 30:8</span></span>

He answered - Before, God answered more slowly and gradually, [Sa1
23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011.md), but now he answers speedily,
and fully at once, because the business required haste. So gracious is
our God, that he considers even the degree of our necessities, and
accommodates himself to them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 30:10</span></span>

Four hundred - A small number for such an attempt: but David was strong
in faith, giving God the glory of his power and faithfulness.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 30:12</span></span>

Three days and nights - One whole day and part of two others, as appears
from the next verse, where he saith, three days ago I fell sick, but in
the Hebrew it is, this is the third day since I fell sick.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 30:13</span></span>

Egypt - God by his providence so ordering it, that he was not one of
that cursed race of the Amalekites, who were to be utterly destroyed,
but an Egyptian, who might be spared. Left me - In this place and
condition: which was barbarous inhumanity: for he ought, and easily
might have carried him away with the prey which they had taken. But he
paid dear for this cruelty, for this was the occasion of the ruin of him
and all their company. And God by his secret providence ordered the
matter thus for that very end. So that there is no fighting against God,
who can make the smallest accidents serviceable to the production of the
greatest effects.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 30:14</span></span>

Cherethites - That is, the Philistines. Caleb - This is added by way of
explication: that part of the south of Judah which belongs to Caleb's
posterity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 30:15</span></span>

Will bring thee - For his master had told him whither they intended to
go, that he might come after them, as soon as he could.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 30:16</span></span>

Upon all the earth - Secure and careless, because they were now come
almost to the borders of their own country, and the Philistines and
Israelites both were otherwise engaged, and David, as they believed,
with them. So they had no visible cause of danger; and yet then they
were nearest to destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 30:17</span></span>

Twilight - The word signifies both the morning and evening twilight. But
the latter seems here intended, partly because their eating, and
drinking, and dancing, was more proper work for the evening, than the
morning; and partly, because the evening was more convenient for David,
that the fewness of his forces might not be discovered by the day -
light. It is probable, that when he came near them, he reposed himself,
and his army, in some secret place, whereof there were many parts, for a
convenient season; and then marched on so as to come to them at the
evening time.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 30:20</span></span>

Other cattle - Before those that belonged to Ziklag. David's spoil - The
soldiers, who lately were so incensed against David, that they spake of
stoning him: now upon this success magnify him, and triumphantly
celebrate his praise; and say concerning this spoil, David purchased it
by his valour and conduct, and he may dispose of it as he pleaseth.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 30:21</span></span>

Saluted them - He spoke kindly to them, and did not blame them because
they went no further with them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 30:23</span></span>

My brethren - He useth his authority to over - rule them; but manageth
it with all sweetness, tho' they were such wicked and unreasonable men,
calling them brethren; not only as of the same nation and religion with
him, but as his fellow - soldiers. What God hath freely imparted to us,
we should not unkindly and injuriously withhold from our brethren.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 30:24</span></span>

Part alike - A prudent and equitable constitution, and therefore
practiced by the Romans, as Polybius and others note. The reason of it
is manifest; because they were exposed to hazards, as well as their
brethren: and were a reserve to whom they might retreat in case of a
defeat; and they were now in actual service, and in the station in which
their general had placed them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 30:26</span></span>

Elders of Judah - Partly in gratitude for their former favours to him:
and partly, in policy, to engage their affections to him.
