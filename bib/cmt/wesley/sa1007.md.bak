### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

Fetch up - That is, by the priests appointed to that work. Hill - This
place they chose, both because it was a strong place, where it would be
the most safe; and an high place, and therefore visible at some
distance, which was convenient for them, who were at that time to direct
their prayers and faces towards the ark. And for the same reason David
afterwards placed it in the hill of Sion. Sanctified Eleazar - Not that
they made him either Levite or Priest; for in Israel persons were not
made but born such; but they devoted, or set him apart wholly to attend
upon this work. His son - Him they chose rather than his father, because
he was younger and stronger, and probably freed from domestic cares,
which might divert him from, or disturb him in this work. To keep the
ark - To keep the place where it was, clean, and to guard it that none
might touch it, but such as God allowed to do so.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 7:2</span></span>

Kirjath - jearim - Where it continued, and was not carried to Shiloh its
former place, either because that place was destroyed by the Philistines
when the ark was taken, or because God would hereby punish the
wickedness of the people of Israel, by keeping it in a private place
near the Philistines, whether the generality of the people durst not
come. Twenty years - He saith not, that this twenty years was all the
time of the ark's abode there, for it continued there from Eli's time
'till David's reign, [Sa2 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md), which
was forty years: but that it was so long there before the Israelites
were sensible of their sin and misery. Lamented - That is, they followed
after God with lamentations for his departure, and prayers for his
return.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 7:3</span></span>

Spake - To all the rulers and people too, as he had occasion in his
circuit, described below, mixing exhortation to repentance, with his
judicial administrations. If - If you do indeed what you profess, if you
are resolved to go on in that which you seem to have begun. With all
your heart - Sincerely and in good earnest. Put - Out of your houses,
where some of you keep them; and out of your hearts, where they still
have an interest in many of you. Ashtaroth - And especially, Ashtaroth,
whom they, together with the neighbouring nations, did more eminently
worship. Prepare your hearts - By purging them from all sin, and
particularly from all inclinations to other gods.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 7:6</span></span>

Poured it out - As an external sign, whereby they testified, both their
own filthiness and need of washing by the grace and Spirit of God, and
blood of the covenant, and their sincere desire to pour out their hearts
before the Lord, in true repentance, and to cleanse themselves from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit. Before the Lord - That is, in the public
assembly, where God is in a special manner present. Judged - That is,
governed them, reformed all abuses against God or man, took care that
the laws of God should be observed, and wilful transgressions punished.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 7:7</span></span>

Went up - With an army, suspecting the effects of their general
convention, and intending to nip them in the bud. Afraid - Being a
company of unarmed persons, and unfit for battle. When sinners begin to
repent and reform, they must expect Satan will muster all his forces
against them, and set his instruments at work to the uttermost, to
oppose and discourage them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 7:8</span></span>

Cease not, &c. - We are afraid to look God in the face, because of our
great wickedness: do thou therefore intercede for us, as Moses did for
his generation. They had reason to expect this, because he had promised
to pray for them, had promised them deliverance from the Philistines,
and they had been observant of him, in all that he had spoken to them
from the Lord. Thus they who receive Christ as their lawgiver and judge,
need not doubt of their interest in his intercession. O what a comfort
is it to all believers, that he never ceaseth, but always appears in the
presence of God for us.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 7:9</span></span>

Cried - And he cried unto the Lord. He made intercession with the
sacrifice. So Christ intercedes in virtue of his satisfaction. And in
all our prayers we must have an eye to his great oblation, depending on
him for audience and acceptance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 7:12</span></span>

A stone - A rude unpolished stone, which was not prohibited by that law,
[Lev 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md), there being no danger of
worshipping such a stone, and this being set up only as a monument of
the victory. Eben - ezer - That is, the stone of help. And this victory
was gained in the very same place where the Israelites received their
former fatal loss. Helped us - He hath begun to help us, though not
compleatly to deliver us. By which wary expression, he exciteth both
their thankfulness for their mercy received, and their holy fear and
care to please and serve the Lord, that he might help and deliver them
effectually.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 7:13</span></span>

Came no more - That is, with a great host, but only with straggling
parties, or garrisons. All the days, &c. - All the days of Samuel that
is, while Samuel was their sole judge, or ruler; for in Saul's time they
did come.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 7:14</span></span>

Peace - An agreement for the cessation of all acts of hostility.
Amorites - That is, the Canaanites, often called Amorites, because these
were formerly the most valiant of all those nations, and the first
Enemies which the Israelites met with, when they went to take possession
of their land. They made this peace with the Canaanites, that they might
he more at leisure to oppose the Philistines, now their most potent
enemies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 7:15</span></span>

Samuel judged - For though Saul was king in Samuel's last days, yet
Samuel did not cease to be a judge, being so made by God's extraordinary
call, which Saul could not destroy; and therefore Samuel did sometimes,
upon great occasions, tho' not ordinarily, exercise the office of judge
after the beginning of Saul's reign; and the years of the rule of Saul
and Samuel are joined together, [Act
13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#020.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 7:16</span></span>

In all places - He went to those several places, in compliance with the
people, whose convenience he was willing to purchase with his own
trouble, as an itinerant judge and preacher; and by his presence in
several parts, he could the better observe, and rectify all sorts of
miscarriages.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 7:17</span></span>

Built an altar - That by joining sacrifices with his prayers, he might
the better obtain direction and assistance from God upon all
emergencies. And this was done by prophetical inspiration, as appears by
God's acceptance of the sacrifices offered upon it. Indeed Shiloh being
now laid waste, and no other place yet appointed for them to bring their
offerings to, the law which obliged them to one place, was for the
present suspended. Therefore, as the patriarchs did, he built an altar
where he lived: and that not only for the use of his own family, but for
the good of the country who resorted to it.
