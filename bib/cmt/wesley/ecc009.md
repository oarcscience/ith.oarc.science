[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

Their works - All events which befal them are governed by his
providence, and therefore although we cannot fully understand the
reasons of all, yet we may be assured they are done righteously. No man
- No man can judge by their present outward condition, whether God loves
or hates them; for whom he loves he chastens, and permits those whom he
hates to prosper in the world.

[Ecclesiastes 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 9:2</span></span>

All things - The good and evil things of the world equally happen to
good and bad men.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 9:3</span></span>

An evil - A great trouble to a good man. Is full - Of wickedness.
Madness - They go on madly and desperately in evil courses. They go -
After all, they die in the same manner as the best men do.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

Joined - That continues with living men. Hope - He hath not only some
comfort for the present, but also hopes of further happiness in this
world. Better - Much happier as to the comforts of this world.

[Ecclesiastes 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 9:5</span></span>

Die - Whereby they are taught to improve life. Any thing - Of the
actions and events of this world. Reward - The fruit of their labours in
this world, are utterly lost as to them. Forgotten - Even in those
places where they had lived in great power and glory.

[Ecclesiastes 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 9:6</span></span>

Also - They neither love, nor hate, nor envy any thing in this world,
but are unconcerned in what is done under the sun.

[Ecclesiastes 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 9:7</span></span>

Go - Make this use of what I have said. Eat - Chearfully and thankfully
enjoy thy comforts. Accepteth - Allows thee a comfortable enjoyment of
his blessings.

[Ecclesiastes 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 9:8</span></span>

White - The eastern people of the best sort, used white garments,
especially in times of rejoicing. Ointment - Which upon joyful occasions
was poured upon mens heads.

[Ecclesiastes 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 9:9</span></span>

Vanity - Of this vain and frail life.

[Ecclesiastes 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 9:10</span></span>

Whatsoever - Whatever thou hast opportunity and ability to do, do it
with unwearied diligence, and vigour and expedition. For - Thou canst
neither design nor act any thing there tending to thy own comfort or
advantage.

[Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 9:11</span></span>

But time - There are times or seasons, casual to men, but known by God,
in which alone he will give men success.

[Ecclesiastes 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 9:12</span></span>

His time - The time of his death, or other distress which God is
bringing upon him. Are taken - While they are sporting and feeding
themselves. When - When they are most careless and secure.

[Ecclesiastes 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 9:13</span></span>

This wisdom - I have observed this among many other instances of wisdom.
Which he adds for the commendation of wisdom, notwithstanding its
insufficiency for man's happiness without God's blessing.

[Ecclesiastes 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 9:15</span></span>

Yet - He was soon neglected and his great service forgotten.

[Ecclesiastes 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 9:17</span></span>

Of wise men - Though poor. In quiet - Uttered with a modest and low
voice. The cry - The clamorous discourses of a rich and potent, but
foolish man.
