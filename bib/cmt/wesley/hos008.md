### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

Set the trumpet - The Lord here commands the prophet to publish, as by
sound of trumpet, that which God will bring upon apostate Israel. He -
The king of Assyria. As an eagle - Swift, hungry, surmounting all
difficulties. House of the Lord - The family of Israel, the Israelites
church.

[Hosea 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 8:2</span></span>

Shall cry - But not sincerely.

[Hosea 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 8:4</span></span>

They - Israel. Kings - Shallum, Menahem, Pekah, and Hosea. Not by me -
Not by my direction. Knew it not - Did not approve of it.

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

Thy calf - The chief idol set up in Samaria. Cast thee off - Hath
provoked God to cast thee off. Against them - Idols, and idol
worshippers. How long - How long will it be, ere they repent and reform?

[Hosea 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 8:6</span></span>

From Israel - By their invention. It - Both the idol and the worshippers
of it.

[Hosea 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 8:7</span></span>

Sown the wind - A proverbial speech to denote lost labour. Whirlwind - A
tempest, which destroyeth all that is in its way; an emblem of the wrath
of God. No stalk - All your dependance on idols, and foreign assistance,
will be as seed that bear neither stalk nor bud. No meal - Or suppose it
produced stalk and bud, yet the bud shall be blasted, and never yield
meal.

[Hosea 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 8:9</span></span>

Gone up - Israel is like a wild ass. A wild ass - Stubborn, wild,
untamed. Alone - Solitary, where is no path or tract; so they were in
their captivity.

[Hosea 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 8:10</span></span>

Gather them - I will assemble them together, that they may be taken and
destroyed together. A little - For a while before their final captivity.
The burden - The tribute laid on them by the king.

[Hosea 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 8:11</span></span>

Altars - Those which they shall find in Assyria. To sin - Shall be the
occasion of his greater guilt and punishment.

[Hosea 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 8:12</span></span>

Written - By Moses first, by other prophets afterwards. But they were
counted - Israel looks on them, as nothing to them.

[Hosea 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 8:13</span></span>

They shall return - Many shall fly from the Assyrian into Egypt.

[Hosea 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 8:14</span></span>

Temples - Idol temples. Devour the palaces - This was fulfilled when all
the cities of Judah and Israel were laid in ashes by the king of
Assyria.
