### [Esther Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#001.md)

[Esther 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 9:2</span></span>

No man - Their enemies, though they did take up arms against them, yet
were easily conquered and destroyed by them.

[Esther 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 9:6</span></span>

Shushan - In the city so called. Slew - Whom they knew to be such as
would watch all opportunities to destroy them; which also they might
possibly now attempt to do.

[Esther 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 9:10</span></span>

But, &c. - Because they would leave it to their children, that it might
appear what they did was not done out of malice, or covetousness, but
out of mere necessity, and by that great law of self - preservation.

[Esther 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 9:12</span></span>

What - In which doubtless many more were slain. So that I have fully
granted thy petition. And yet, if thou hast any thing farther to ask, I
am ready to grant it.

[Esther 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 9:13</span></span>

Let it, &c. - To kill their implacable enemies. For it is not improbable
that the greatest and worst of them had hidden themselves for that day;
after which, the commission granted to the Jews being expired, they
confidently returned to their homes. Hanged - They were slain before;
now let their bodies be hanged on their father's gallows, for their
greater infamy, and the terror of all others who shall presume to abuse
the king in like manner, or to persuade him to execute such cruelties
upon his subjects.

[Esther 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">est 9:26</span></span>

Pur - This Persian word signifies a lot, because Haman had by lot
determined this time to be the time of the Jews destruction.

[Esther 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">est 9:27</span></span>

As joined - Gentile Proselytes; who were obliged to submit to other of
the Jewish laws, and therefore to this also; the rather because they
enjoyed the benefit of this day's deliverance; without which the Jewish
nation and religion had been in a great measure, if not wholly, extinct.
According - According to that writing which was drawn up by Mordecai,
and afterwards confirmed by the consent of the Jews.

[Esther 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">est 9:29</span></span>

Wrote - The former letter, [Est 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#020.md),
did only recommend but this enjoins the observation of this solemnity:
because this was not only Mordecai's act, but the act of all the Jews,
binding themselves and posterity.

[Esther 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">est 9:30</span></span>

Peace - With peace, friendship and kindness to his brethren, and truth,
sincerity.

[Esther 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">est 9:31</span></span>

Cry - For those great calamities which were decreed to all the Jews, and
for the removing of which, not only Esther, and the Jews in Shushan, but
all other Jews in all places, did doubtless fly to God by fasting, and
strong cries.

[Esther 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">est 9:32</span></span>

Either - Who had received authority from the king. The book - In the
records which the Jews kept of their most memorable passages.
