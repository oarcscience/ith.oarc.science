<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001">1 Thessalonians 2:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">th1 2:1</A></FONT></span></p>What was proposed, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005">Th1 1:5-6</A>, is now more largely treated of: concerning Paul and his fellowlabourers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001">Th1 2:1-12</A>; concerning the Thessalonians, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013">Th1 2:13-16</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002">1 Thessalonians 2:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">th1 2:2</A></FONT></span></p>We had suffered - In several places. We are bold - Notwithstanding. With much contention - Notwithstanding both inward and outward conflicts of all kinds. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003">1 Thessalonians 2:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">th1 2:3</A></FONT></span></p>For our exhortation - That is, our preaching. A part is put for the whole. Is not, at any time, of deceit - We preach not a lie, but the truth of God. Nor of uncleanness - With any unholy or selfish view. This expression is not always appropriated to lust, although it is sometimes emphatically applied thereto. Nor in guile - But with great plainness of speech. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005">1 Thessalonians 2:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">th1 2:5</A></FONT></span></p>Flattering words - This ye know. Nor a cloak of covetousness - Of this God is witness. He calls men to witness an open fact; God, the secret intentions of the heart. In a point of a mixed nature, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010">Th1 2:10</A>, he appeals both to God and man. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006">1 Thessalonians 2:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">th1 2:6</A></FONT></span></p>Nor from others - Who would have honoured us more, if we had been burdensome - That is, taken state upon ourselves. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007">1 Thessalonians 2:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">th1 2:7</A></FONT></span></p>But we were gentle - Mild, tender. In the midst of you - Like a hen surrounded with her young. Even as a nurse cherisheth her own children - The offspring of her own womb. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008">1 Thessalonians 2:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">th1 2:8</A></FONT></span></p>To impart our own souls - To lay down our lives for your sake. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010">1 Thessalonians 2:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">th1 2:10</A></FONT></span></p>Holily - In the things of God. Justly - With regard to men. Unblamable - In respect of ourselves. Among you that believe - Who were the constant observers of our behaviour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011">1 Thessalonians 2:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">th1 2:11</A></FONT></span></p>By exhorting, we are moved to do a thing willingly; by comforting, to do it joyfully; by charging, to do it carefully. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012">1 Thessalonians 2:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">th1 2:12</A></FONT></span></p>To his kingdom here, and glory hereafter. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014">1 Thessalonians 2:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">th1 2:14</A></FONT></span></p>Ye suffered the same things - The same fruit, the same afflictions, and the same experience, at all times, and in all places, are an excellent criterion of evangelical truth. As they from the Jews - Their countrymen. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015">1 Thessalonians 2:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">th1 2:15</A></FONT></span></p>Us - Apostles and preachers of the gospel. They please not God - Nor are they even careful to please him, notwithstanding their fair professions. And are contrary to all men - Are common enemies of mankind; not only by their continual seditions and insurrections, and by their utter contempt of all other nations; but in particular, by their endeavouring to hinder their hearing or receiving the gospel. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016">1 Thessalonians 2:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">th1 2:16</A></FONT></span></p>To fill up - The measure of their sins always, as they have ever done. But the vengeance of God is come upon them - Hath overtaken them unawares, whilst they were seeking to destroy others, and will speedily complete their destruction. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017">1 Thessalonians 2:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">th1 2:17</A></FONT></span></p>In this verse we have a remarkable instance, not so much of the transient affections of holy grief, desire, or joy, as of that abiding tenderness, that loving temper, which is so apparent in all St. Paul's writings, towards those he styles his children in the faith. This is the more carefully to be observed, because the passions occasionally exercising themselves, and flowing like a torrent, in the apostle, are observable to every reader; whereas it requires a nicer attention to discern those calm standing tempers, that fixed posture of his soul, from whence the others only flow out, and which more peculiarly distinguish his character. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018">1 Thessalonians 2:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">th1 2:18</A></FONT></span></p>Satan - By those persecuting Jews, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013">Act 17:13</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019">1 Thessalonians 2:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">th1 2:19</A></FONT></span></p>Ye also - As well as our other children.
