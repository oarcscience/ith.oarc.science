### [Jeremiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 22:6</span></span>

Gilead - Gilead was a country fertile for pastures; upon which account
the Reubenites and Gadites, being men whose estate lay in cattle, begged
it of Moses for their portion. Lebanon also was a very pleasant place:
they were both in the lot of Gad and Manasseh. Perhaps God compares the
king of Judah's house to these places, in regard of the height and
nobleness of the structure, or for the pleasantness and delightfulness
of it.

[Jeremiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 22:10</span></span>

Weep not - For Josiah your dead prince. Josiah is happy, you need not
trouble yourselves for him; but weep for Jehoahaz, who is to go into
captivity.

[Jeremiah 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 22:11</span></span>

Shallum - Most think that this Shallum was Jehoahaz. Went forth - He was
carried away from Jerusalem presently after he was set up, imprisoned at
Riblah, and died in Egypt.

[Jeremiah 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 22:16</span></span>

Was not this - They only truly know God who obey him; men vainly pretend
to piety who are defective in justice and charity.

[Jeremiah 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 22:19</span></span>

Of an ass - None attending him to his grave, none mourning for him.

[Jeremiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 22:20</span></span>

Lebanon - Jerusalem was the place to which this speech is directed: the
inhabitants of which the prophet calls to go up to Lebanon. Both Lebanon
and Bashan were hills that looked towards Assyria, from whence the Jews
looked for help. Abarim - Abarim is the name of a mountain, as well as
Lebanon and Bashan. Go and cry for help from all places, but it will be
in vain; for the Egyptians and Assyrians to whom thou wert wont to fly,
are themselves in the power of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 22:22</span></span>

Pastors - Thy rulers and governors, they shall be blasted by my
judgments, as plants are blasted by winds. Thy lovers - And those that
have been thy friends, Syria and Egypt.

[Jeremiah 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 22:23</span></span>

Lebanon - Jerusalem is called an inhabitant of Lebanon, because their
houses were built of wood cut down out of the forest of Lebanon. Cedars
- Their houses were built of the Cedars of Lebanon. How gracious - What
favour wilt thou find when my judgments come upon thee, as the pains of
a woman in travail come upon her.

[Jeremiah 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 22:24</span></span>

Coniah - By Coniah he means Jehoiakim, whose name was Jeconiah, [Ch1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#013), (for all Josiah's sons had two
names, and so had his grandchild Jeconiah) here in contempt called
Coniah. The signet - Tho' he were as dear as a signet, which every man
keeps safe.

[Jeremiah 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 22:28</span></span>

Is this - The prophet speaks this in the person of God, affirming that
this prince, who was the idol of the people, was now become like a
broken idol. A vessel - So cracked, or so tainted, that they can make no
use of it.

[Jeremiah 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 22:30</span></span>

Childless - He is said to be childless, either because all his children
died before their father; or because he had no child that sat upon the
throne, or ever had any ruler's place in Judah.
