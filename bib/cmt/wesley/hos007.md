### [Hosea Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001)

[Hosea 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 7:1</span></span>

Of Ephraim - Of Ephraim the chief tribe of this revolting kingdom.

[Hosea 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 7:2</span></span>

Own doings - The guilt and punishment of the works they have done; their
own doings, not their fathers, as the incorrigible are ready to
complain. Beset them - As an enemy invests a town on every side. Before
my face - All their ways were under mine eye.

[Hosea 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 7:3</span></span>

They - The courtiers in particular make it their work to invent pleasing
wickedness, and to acquaint the king with it. With their lies - With
false accusations against the innocent.

[Hosea 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 7:4</span></span>

As an oven - This vice is grown raging hot among them, as the fire in an
oven, when the baker having called up those that make the bread, to
prepare all things ready, doth by continued supply of fuel, heat the
oven, 'till the heat need be raised no higher.

[Hosea 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 7:5</span></span>

In the day of our king - Probably the anniversary of his birth or
coronation. Stretched out his hand - In these drunken feasts it seems
the king forgat himself, and stretched out his hand, with those who
deride religion, and with confusion to the professors of it.

[Hosea 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 7:6</span></span>

They - Those luxurious and drinking princes. Like an oven - Hot with
ambition, revenge, or covetousness. Lie in wait - Against the life or
estate of some of their subjects. As the baker, having kindled a fire in
his oven, goes to bed and sleeps all night, and in the morning finds his
oven well heated and ready for his purpose; so these when they have laid
some wicked plot, tho' they may seem to sleep for a while, yet the fire
is glowing within, and flames out as soon as ever there is opportunity
for it.

[Hosea 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 7:7</span></span>

Devoured - As a fire destroys, so have these conspirators, destroyed
their rulers. Their kings - All that have been since Jeroboam the
second's reign, to the delivery of this prophecy, namely, Zechariah,
Shallum, Pekahiah, Pekah, fell by the conspiracy of such hot princes.
That telleth - Not one of all these either feared, trusted, or
worshipped God.

[Hosea 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 7:8</span></span>

Ephraim - The kingdom of Israel. Mixed himself - With the Heathens by
leagues and commerce and by imitation of their manners. Not turned -
Burnt on one side, and dough on the other, and so good for nothing on
either: always in one extreme or the other.

[Hosea 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 7:9</span></span>

Knoweth it not - He is not aware of the loss he hath sustained. Gray
hairs - Of old age and declining strength are upon their kingdom.

[Hosea 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 7:11</span></span>

Like a silly dove - Ephraim is now become like the dove in weakness and
fear, as well as in imprudence and liableness to be deceived. Without
heart - Without either discretion or courage. To Assyria - Instead of
going to God, who alone can help.

[Hosea 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 7:12</span></span>

Go - To seek aid of Egypt or Assyria. Bring them down - Though they
attempt to fly, yet as fowls in the net they shall certainly fall. Hath
heard - From the prophets whom I have sent unto them.

[Hosea 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 7:13</span></span>

Spoken lies - They belied his corrections as if not deserved; they
belied the good done, as if too little, or not done by God, but by their
idol.

[Hosea 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 7:14</span></span>

They assembled - In the houses of their idols.

[Hosea 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 7:15</span></span>

Bound - As a surgeon binds up a weak member, or a broken one; so did God
for Ephraim, when the Syrians and other enemies had broken their arms.
Imagine mischief - They devise mischief against my prophets, and let
loose the reins to all impieties.

[Hosea 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 7:16</span></span>

Not to the most high - What shew soever of repentance was among them,
yet they never throughly repented. A deceitful bow - Tho' they seemed
bent for, and aiming at the mark, yet like a weak bow they carried not
the arrow home, and like a false bow they never carried it strait toward
the mark. The rage of their tongue - Against God, his prophets and
providence. Their derision - They shall be upbraided with this.
