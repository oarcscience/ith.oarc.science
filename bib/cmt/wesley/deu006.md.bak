### [Deuteronomy Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 6:5</span></span>

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart - And is this
only an external commandment? Can any then say, that the Sinai -
covenant was merely external? With all thy heart - With an entire love.
He is One; therefore our hearts must be united in his love. And the
whole stream of our affections must run toward Him. O that this love of
God may be shed abroad in our hearts.

[Deuteronomy 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 6:7</span></span>

Teach them diligently - Heb. whet, or sharpen them, so as they may
pierce deep into their hearts. This metaphor signifies the manner of
instructing them, that it is to be done diligently, earnestly,
frequently, discreetly.

[Deuteronomy 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 6:8</span></span>

Thou shalt bind them - Thou shalt give all diligence, and use all means
to keep them in thy remembrance, as men often bind something upon their
hands, or put it before their eyes to prevent forgetfulness of a thing
which they much desire to remember.

[Deuteronomy 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 6:13</span></span>

Shalt swear by his name - When thou hast a call and just cause to swear,
not by idols, or any creatures.

[Deuteronomy 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 6:15</span></span>

Among you - Heb. In the midst of you, to see and observe all your ways
and your turnings aside to other Gods.

[Deuteronomy 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 6:16</span></span>

Ye shall not tempt - Not provoke him, as the following instance
explains. Sinners, especially presumptuous sinners, are said to tempt
God, that is, to make a trial of God, whether he be, so wise as to see
their sins, so just and true and powerful as to take vengeance on them,
concerning which they are very apt to doubt because of the present
impunity and prosperity of many such persons.

[Deuteronomy 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 6:17</span></span>

Ye diligently keep - Negligence will ruin us: but we cannot be saved
without diligence.

[Deuteronomy 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 6:25</span></span>

It shall be our righteousness - Heb. Righteousness shall be to us. We
shall be owned and pronounced by God to be righteous and holy persons,
if we sincerely obey him, otherwise we shall be declared to be
unrighteous and ungodly. Or, mercy shall be to us, or with us. For as
the Hebrew word rendered righteousness is very often put for mercy, (as
[Psa 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md), [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010.md), [Psa
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014.md); [Pro
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002.md), [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004.md); [Dan
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016).md) so this sense seems best to
agree both with the scripture use of this phrase, (in which
righteousness, seldom or never, but grace or mercy frequently, is said
to be to us or with us) and with the foregoing verse and argument God,
saith he, [Deu 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#024.md), commanded these
things for our good, that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day.
And, saith he in this verse, this is not all; for as he hath done us
good, so he will go on to do us more and more good, and God's mercy
shall be to us, or with us, in the remainder of our lives, and for ever,
if we observe these commandments.
