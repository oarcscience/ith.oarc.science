### [Ezra Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 9:3</span></span>

I rent - Both mine inner and my upper garment.

[Ezra 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ezr 9:4</span></span>

Evening sacrifice - When the people used to assemble together. All good
people ought to own those that appear and act for God against vice and
profaneness. Every one that fears God, ought to stand by them, and do
what he can to strengthen their hands.

[Ezra 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ezr 9:5</span></span>

Heaviness - From that mournful posture, and put myself into the posture
of a petitioner. He did this at the time of the evening sacrifice,
because then devout people used to come into the courts of the temple,
that hearing his confession, they likewise might be made sensible of the
sins of the people. And he had an eye to that great propitiation, of
which that sacrifice was a peculiar type.

[Ezra 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 9:6</span></span>

Our - He includes himself in the number of the transgressors, because he
himself was guilty of many sins; and because the princes and priests,
and so many of the people having done this, the guilt was now become
national.

[Ezra 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ezr 9:7</span></span>

Have we been - We are not purged from the guilt of our fathers sins, but
we are still feeling the sad effects of them; yea, and are repeating the
same sins.

[Ezra 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ezr 9:8</span></span>

A little space - It is but a little while since God hath delivered us,
and yet we are already returned to our sin. A remnant - The far greatest
part of the Israelitish nation were yet in captivity. A nail - Some kind
of settlement; whereas before we were tossed and removed from place to
place as our masters pleased. It is a metaphor from tents, which are
fastened by cords and nails, or pins. Holy place - In Jerusalem, called
the holy city, [Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md), [Neh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#018.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), which is peculiarly mentioned,
because of the temple, which was the nail that fastened their tents and
gave them some hopes of continuing in their land. To lighten - That he
might revive and comfort our hearts. For as darkness is often put for a
state of sorrow and affliction, so light is put for joy and comfort. In
bondage - For we are not quite delivered, being even here in subjection
to our former lords.

[Ezra 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ezr 9:9</span></span>

A wall - The favour of the kings of Persia whose edicts were their
security against all those enemies wherewith they were encompassed: and
the gracious providence of God, which had planted them in their own
land, and watched over them from time to time.

[Ezra 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 9:11</span></span>

It is unclean - This land is as corrupt as any of the rest of the
heathen nations.

[Ezra 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 9:12</span></span>

Strong - Although you may fancy making leagues and marriages with them,
as the only way to establish you, yet I assure you, it will weaken and
ruin you, and the contrary course will make you strong.

[Ezra 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 9:15</span></span>

We are - We are here in thy presence, and so are all our sins; we are
arraigning ourselves before thy tribunal, acknowledging thee to be just,
if thou destroy us. Before thee - In judgment, as that word is often
used, we must needs fall and perish at thy presence.
