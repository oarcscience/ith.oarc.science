------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Judges Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#001.md)

[Judges 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 9:2</span></span>

Reign - He supposed they would take that government which their father
refused; and that the multitude of his sons would occasion divisions,
and confusions, which they might avoid by chusing him king; and so they
might enjoy the monarchy which they had long desired. Your bone and
flesh - Your kinsman, of the same tribe and city with you; which will be
no small honour and advantage to you.

[Judges 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 9:3</span></span>

Brethren - That is, kinsmen. He is our brother - They were easily
persuaded to believe what served their own interest.

[Judges 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 9:4</span></span>

Pieces of silver - Not shekels, which were too small a sum for this
purpose; but far larger pieces, the exact worth whereof it is not
possible for us now to know. The house of Baal - berith - Out of his
sacred treasury; having since Gideon's death built this temple (which he
would never have suffered whilst he lived) and endowed it with
considerable revenues. Light persons - Unsettled, idle and necessitous
persons, the proper instruments of tyranny and cruelty.

[Judges 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 9:5</span></span>

His brethren - The only persons who were likely to hinder him in
establishing his tyranny. Threescore and ten - Wanting one, who is here
expressed. Jotham was left - Whereby he would signify, that this was an
act of justice, in cutting them all off in an orderly manner, for some
supposed crime, probably, as designing sedition and rebellion.

[Judges 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 9:6</span></span>

House of Millo - Some eminent and potent family living in Shechem, or
near it. King - Over all Israel, [Jdg
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#022.md), which was a strange presumption
for the inhabitants of one city; but they had many advantages for it; as
the eager, and general, and constant inclination of the Israelites to
kingly government; Abimelech's being the son of Gideon, to whom, and to
his sons, they offered the kingdom. And though the father could, and did
refuse it for himself; yet they might imagine, that he could not give
away his sons' right, conveyed to them by the Israelites, in their
offer; the universal defection of the Israelites from God to Baal, whose
great patron and champion Abimelech pretended to be; the power and
prevalency of the tribe of Ephraim, in which Shechem was, whose proud
and imperious spirit, would make them readily close with a king of their
own brethren; and Abimelech's getting the start of all others, having
the crown actually put upon his head, and an army already raised to
maintain his tyranny. Of the pillar - Or, by the oak of the pillar, by
the oak, where Joshua erected a pillar as a witness of the covenant
renewed between God and Israel, [Jos
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#026.md). This place they chose, to
signify that they still owned God, and their covenant with him; and did
not worship Baal in opposition to God, but in conjunction with him, or
in subordination to him.

[Judges 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 9:7</span></span>

Mount Gerizim - Which lay near Shechem. The valley between Gerizim and
Ebal, was a famous place, employed for the solemn reading of the law,
and its blessings and curses: and it is probable it was still used, even
by the superstitious and idolatrous Israelites for such occasions, who
delighted to use the same places which their ancestors had used. Cried -
So that they who stood in the valley might hear him, though not suddenly
come at him to take him. Men of Shechem - Who were here met together
upon a solemn occasion, as Josephus notes, Abimelech being absent. That
God may hearken - When you cry unto him for mercy; so he conjures and
persuades them to give him patient audience.

[Judges 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 9:8</span></span>

The trees, &c. - A parabolical discourse, usual among the ancients,
especially in the eastern parts. To anoint - To make a king, which was
done among the Israelites, and some others, with the ceremony of
anointing. Olive - tree - By which he understands Gideon.

[Judges 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 9:9</span></span>

Honour God - In whose worship oil was used for divers things; as, about
the lamps, and offerings, and for anointing sacred persons and things.
And man - For oil was used in the constitution of kings, and priests,
and prophets, and for a present to great persons, and to anoint the head
and face. Promoted - Heb. to move hither and thither, to wander to and
fro, to exchange my sweet tranquility, for incessant cares and travels.

[Judges 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 9:10</span></span>

Fig - tree - Gideon refused this honour, both for himself, and for his
sons; and the sons of Gideon, whom Abimelech had slain, upon pretence of
their affecting the kingdom, were as far from such thoughts as their
father.

[Judges 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 9:13</span></span>

Cheareth God - Wherewith God is well pleased, because it was offered to
God.

[Judges 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 9:14</span></span>

Bramble - Or, thorn, fitly representing Abimelech, the son of a
concubine, and a person of small use, and great cruelty.

[Judges 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 9:15</span></span>

If in truth - If you deal truly and justly in making me king. Then trust
- Then you may expect protection under my government. Devour the cedars
- In stead of protection, you shall receive destruction by me;
especially you cedars, that is, nobles, such as the house of Millo, who
have been most forward in this work.

[Judges 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 9:18</span></span>

Ye have slain - Abimelech's fact is justly charged upon them, as done by
their consent, approbation and assistance. Maidservant - His concubine,
whom he so calls by way of reproach. Over Shechem - By which limitation
of their power, and his kingdom, he reflects contempt upon him, and
chargeth them with presumption, that having only power over their own
city, they durst impose a king upon all Israel.

[Judges 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 9:20</span></span>

Devour Abimelech - This is not so much a prediction as an imprecation,
which, being grounded upon just cause, had its effect, as others in like
case had.

[Judges 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 9:21</span></span>

And fled - Which he might easily do, having the advantage of the hill,
and because the people were not forward to pursue a man whom they knew
to have such just cause to speak, and so little power to do them hurt.
To Beer - A place remote from Shechem, and out of Abimelech's reach.

[Judges 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 9:22</span></span>

Over Israel - For though the men of Shechem were the first authors of
Abimelech's advancement, the rest of the people easily consented to that
form of government which they so much desired.

[Judges 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 9:23</span></span>

God sent - God gave the devil commission to work upon their minds.

[Judges 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 9:24</span></span>

The cruelty - That is, the punishment of the cruelty.

[Judges 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 9:25</span></span>

For him - To seize his person. Robbed all - Such as favoured or served
Abimelech; for to such only their commission reached, though it may be,
they went beyond their bounds, and robbed all passengers promiscuously.

[Judges 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 9:26</span></span>

Gaal - It is not known who he was; but it is evident, he was a man very
considerable for wealth, and strength and interest; and ill - pleased
with Abimelech's power. Went to Shechem - By his presence and council to
animate and assist them against Abimelech.

[Judges 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 9:27</span></span>

Went out - Which, 'till his coming they durst not do, for fear of
Abimelech. Made merry - Both from the custom of rejoicing, and singing
songs in vintage time, and for the hopes of their redemption from
Abimelech's tyranny. Their goals - Baal - berith, [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md), either to beg his help against
Abimelech, or to give him thanks for the hopes of recovering their
liberty. Eat and drink - To the honour of their idols, and out of the
oblations made to them, as they used to do to the honour of Jehovah, and
out of his sacrifices. Cursed - Either by reviling him after their
manner, or, rather in a more solemn and religious manner, cursing him by
their god, as Goliath did David.

[Judges 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 9:28</span></span>

Who is Abimelech - What is he but a base - born person, a cruel tyrant,
and one every way unworthy to govern you? Who is Shechem - That is,
Abimelech, named in the foregoing words, and described in those which
follow. He is called Shechem for the Shechemite. The sense is, who is
this Shechemite? For so he was by the mother's side, born of a woman of
your city, and she but his concubine and servant; why should you submit
to one so basely descended? Of Jerubbaal - Of Gideon, a person famous
only by his fierceness against that Baal which you justly honour and
reverence, whose altar he overthrew, and whose worship he endeavoured to
abolish. And Zebul - And you are so mean spirited, that you do not only
submit to him, but suffer his very servants to bear rule over you; and
particularly, this ignoble and hateful Zebul. Serve, &c. - If you love
bondage, call in the old master and lord of the place; chuse not an
upstart, as Abimelech is; but rather take one of the old flock, one
descended from Hamor, [Gen 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#002.md), who
did not carry himself like a tyrant, as Abimelech did; but like a father
of his city. This he might speak sincerely, as being himself a Canaanite
and Shechemite, and possibly came from one of those little ones whom
Simeon and Levi spared when they slew all the grown males, [Gen
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#029.md). And it may be that he was one
of the royal blood, a descendent of Hamor, who hereby sought to
insinuate himself into the government, as it follows, [Jdg
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#029.md). Would to God that this people
were under my hand; which he might judge the people more likely to chuse
both because they were now united with the Canaanites in religion; and
because their present distress might oblige them to put themselves under
him, a valiant and expert commander.

[Judges 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 9:29</span></span>

My hand - That is, under my command; I wish you would unanimously submit
to me, as your captain and governor; for he found them divided; and some
of them hearkening after Abimelech, whom they had lately rejected,
according to the levity of the popular humour. I would remove - As you
have driven him out of your city, I would drive him out of your country.
He said - He sent this message or challenge to him. Increase thine army
- I desire not to surprise thee at any disadvantage; strengthen thyself
as much as thou canst, and come out into the open field, that thou and I
may decide it by our arms.

[Judges 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 9:35</span></span>

And stood - To put his army in order, and to conduct them against
Abimelech, whom he supposed to be at a great distance.

[Judges 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 9:36</span></span>

To Zebul - Who concealed the anger which he had conceived, [Jdg
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#030.md), and pretended compliance with
him in this expedition, that he might draw him forth into the field
where Abimelech might have the opportunity of fighting with him, and
overthrowing him. The shadow - For in the morning, as this was, and in
the evening, the shadows are longest, and move quickest.

[Judges 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jdg 9:38</span></span>

Where is now, &c. - Now shew thyself a man, and fight valiantly for
thyself and people.

[Judges 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jdg 9:40</span></span>

He fled - Being surprised by the unexpected coming of Abimelech, and
probably not fully prepared for the encounter.

[Judges 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jdg 9:41</span></span>

Dwelt at Arumah - He did not prosecute his victory, but retreated to
Arumah, to see whether the Shechemites would not of themselves return to
his government, or else, that being hereby grown secure, he might have
the greater advantage against them. Thrust out - It seems the same
night. Probably the multitude, which is generally light and unstable,
were now enraged against Gaal, suspecting him of cowardice or ill -
conduct. Zebul's interest was not so considerable with them, that he
could prevail with them either to kill Gaal and his brethren, or to
yield themselves to Abimelech; and therefore he still complies with the
people, and waits for a fairer opportunity.

[Judges 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">jdg 9:42</span></span>

Went out - to their usual employments about their land.

[Judges 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">jdg 9:43</span></span>

Three companies - Whereof he kept one with himself, [Jdg
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#044.md), and put the rest under other
commanders.

[Judges 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jdg 9:44</span></span>

Entering of the gate - To prevent their retreat into the city, and give
the other two companies opportunity to cut them off.

[Judges 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jdg 9:45</span></span>

With salt - In token of his desire of their utter and irrecoverable
destruction.

[Judges 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">jdg 9:46</span></span>

The tower - A strong place belonging to the city of Shechem, made for
its defence without the city. Berith - Or, Baal - berith, [Jdg
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md). Hither they fled out of the town
belonging to it, fearing the same event with Shechem; and here they
thought to be secure; partly by the strength of the place, partly by the
religion of it, thinking that either their god would protect them there,
or that Abimelech would spare them out of pity to that god.

[Judges 9:48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jdg 9:48</span></span>

Zalmon - A place so called from its shadiness.

[Judges 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jdg 9:50</span></span>

Thebez - Another town near to Shechem; and, as it seems, within its
territory.

[Judges 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jdg 9:51</span></span>

And all - All that were not slain in the taking of the town. Top of the
tower - Which was flat and plain, after their manner of building.

[Judges 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">jdg 9:53</span></span>

Mill - stone - Such great stones no doubt they carried up with them,
whereby they might defend themselves, or offend those who assaulted
them. Here the justice of God is remarkable in suiting the punishment to
his sin. He slew his brethren upon a stone, [Jdg
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#005.md), and he loseth his own life by a
stone.

[Judges 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">jdg 9:54</span></span>

A women - Which was esteemed a matter of disgrace.

[Judges 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">jdg 9:56</span></span>

Wickedness - In rooting out, as far as he could, the name and memory of
his father.

[Judges 9:57](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">jdg 9:57</span></span>

Render upon their heads - Thus God preserved the honour of his
government, and gave warning to all ages, to expect blood for blood.
