### [Isaiah Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 61:1</span></span>

Upon me - Though the prophet may speak of himself, yet it is principally
to be understood of Christ. Anointed - Set me apart, both capacitating
him with gifts, and commissioning him with authority; and yet more, as
it is applied to Christ, a power to make all effectual, from whence he
hath also the name of Messiah among the Hebrews, and of Christ among the
Greeks; nay, Christ alone among the prophets hath obtained this name,
[Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md). The prophet describes
first, who Christ is, and then what are his offices. Liberty - This
appertains to Christ's kingly office, whereby he proclaims liberty from
the dominion of sin, and from the fear of hell.

[Isaiah 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 61:2</span></span>

Vengeance - It being necessary, that where God will deliver his people,
he should take vengeance on their enemies; principally on the enemies of
his church, and the spiritual ones chiefly, Satan, sin, and death.

[Isaiah 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 61:3</span></span>

Ashes - By ashes understand whatever is proper for days of mourning, as
by beauty whatever may become times of rejoicing. Oil of joy - He calls
it oil of joy in allusion to those anointings they were wont to use in
times of joy, gladness for heaviness; and it is called a garment in
allusion to their festival ornaments, for they had garments appropriated
to their conditions, some suitable to times of rejoicing, and some to
times of mourning. Called - That they may be so. Trees - That they shall
be firm, solid, and well rooted, being by faith engrafted into Christ,
and bringing forth fruit suitable to the soil wherein they are planted.

[Isaiah 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 61:5</span></span>

Strangers - Gentiles, such as are not of the natural race of the Jews,
but Gentile converts. Or, such as shall have no more than an outward
profession. Stand - Ready to be at thy service. Flocks - The churches
with the word of God. Plow - men - Shall manage the whole work of God's
spiritual husbandry.

[Isaiah 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 61:6</span></span>

The priests - The whole body of them shall now be as near to God as the
priests were formerly, and shall be a royal priesthood. This is most
certainly true of all the faithful under the gospel.

[Isaiah 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 61:7</span></span>

Double - Honour. Portion - Of honour, that God will give them.

[Isaiah 61:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 61:8</span></span>

Love judgment - I will do them right, for I love justice in myself, and
in them that practise it. Robbery - All things gotten by injustice,
though it be for sacrifice. Direct - I will lead them so, that they
shall do all things in sincerity. Everlasting covenant - Though you have
broken covenant with me, yet I will renew my ancient covenant made with
your fathers, confirmed with the blood of Christ, and it shall be
everlasting, never to be abrogated.

[Isaiah 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 61:9</span></span>

Shall be - That is, eminently a promise of the increase of the church;
such shall be their prosperity, and multiplying, that they shall be
known abroad by their great increase; or else, the meaning is, the
church shall have a seed of the Gentiles, whereas the church has been
confined to one corner of the world, now it shall remain in one nation
alone no more, but shall fill all the nations of the earth. Hath blessed
- There shall be such visible characters of God's love to them, and of
God's grace in them.

[Isaiah 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 61:10</span></span>

I will - This is spoken in the person of the church. Garments, &c. -
With salvation as with a garment, and with righteousness as with a robe.

[Isaiah 61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 61:11</span></span>

Righteousness - His great work of salvation shall break out and appear.
Praise - As the natural product, and fruit of it.
