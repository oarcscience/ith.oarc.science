### [Zechariah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)

[Zechariah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 3:1</span></span>

And he - The Lord represented to me in a vision. Standing - Ministering
in his office. The angel - Christ.

[Zechariah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 3:2</span></span>

The Lord - Christ, as a mediator, rather chuses to rebuke him in his
father's name, than in his own. Is not this - Joshua.

[Zechariah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 3:3</span></span>

With filthy garments - The emblem of a poor or sinful state. The angel -
Christ.

[Zechariah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 3:4</span></span>

And he - Christ. Unto those - Ministerial angels. I have caused - What
angels could not take away, Christ did; he removed the filth of sin, the
guilt and stain of it. With change of raiment - Clean and rich, the
emblem of holiness.

[Zechariah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 3:5</span></span>

I said - Zechariah takes the boldness to desire that for Joshua, which
might add to his authority, and he asks the thing of Christ. A fair
mitre - The proper ornament for the head of the high - priest. With
garments - All the garments which appertained to the high priest. The
angel - Christ.

[Zechariah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 3:6</span></span>

Protested - Solemnly declared.

[Zechariah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 3:7</span></span>

My charge - The special charge and office of the high - priest. Judge -
Be ruler in the temple, and in the things that pertain to the worship of
God there. Keep - Not as a servant, but as the chief, on whom others
wait, and at last thou shalt have place among my angels.

[Zechariah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 3:8</span></span>

Thy fellows - Thy associates in the priestly office. That sit - As
assessors in a council. Wondered at - The unbelieving Jews wonder at
them; at their labour and expense in attempting to build such a house.
Bring forth - God the Father will bring forth a much more wonderful
work. The Branch - The Messiah.

[Zechariah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 3:9</span></span>

Behold - Behold (pointing to a particular stone) that stone which I have
laid in the sight of Joshua. Upon one stone - On that stone are seven
eyes, probably so placed, that they may look many ways; so it was a more
exact emblem of Christ, and of his perfect knowledge and wisdom. I have
removed - I have pardoned the iniquity of this land at once. The temple,
founded on such a corner - stone, guarded and watched over by all -
seeing Providence, is the blessing and honour of that people, whose sins
are all forgiven.

[Zechariah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 3:10</span></span>

In that day - Of removing the sins of my people. Shall ye call - Ye
shall invite one another to refresh yourselves with the sweet fruit of
the vine and fig - tree. When iniquity is taken away, we receive
precious benefits from our justification, more precious than the fruits
of the vine or fig - tree. And we repose ourselves in sweet
tranquillity, being quiet from the fear of evil.
