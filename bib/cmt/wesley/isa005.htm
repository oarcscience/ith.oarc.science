<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001">Isaiah 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">isa 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Now - I will record it to he a witness for God, and against you, as Moses did his song, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019">Deu 31:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001">Deu 32:1</A>. To - To the Lord of the vineyard. Of my beloved - Not devised by me, but inspired by God. Vineyard - His church. Hill - Hills being places most commodious for vines. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002">Isaiah 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>He gathered - He removed all hindrances, and gave them all the means of fruitfulness. A tower - For the residence of the keepers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006">Isaiah 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>Nor digged - Vine - dressers use to dig up and open the earth about the roots of the vines. The meaning is, I will remove my ministers, who used great care and diligence to make you fruitful. Thorns - I will give you up to your own lusts. No rain - I will deprive you of all my blessings. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007">Isaiah 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>Pleasant - In whom God formerly delighted. A cry - From the oppressed, crying to men for help, and to God for vengeance. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008">Isaiah 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>Alone - That they alone may be the lords and owners, and all others only their tenants and servants. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009">Isaiah 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>In mine ears - I heard God speak what I am about to utter. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010">Isaiah 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>One bath - Of wine. The bath contained about eight gallons. Thus an acre did not yield one gallon. An ephah - Which was of the same quantity with the bath, only the bath was the measure of liquid things, the ephah of dry things; and a ephah was the tenth part of an homer. So instead of the increase which that fruitful land commonly yielded, they should loose nine parts of their seed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012">Isaiah 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">isa 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>The harp - They give up themselves wholly to luxury. The work - What God hath lately done, and is yet doing, and about to do among them; his grievous judgments, partly inflicted, and partly threatened, which required another course of life.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>No knowledge - No serious consideration of God's works, and of their own duty and danger. Honourable men - Who thought themselves quite out of the reach of famine. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014">Isaiah 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>And he - That spends all his days in mirth and jollity. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015">Isaiah 5:15</A></p>

Waste places - The lands left by their owners. Fat ones - Of the rich and great men. Strangers - The poor Israelites, who were left to be vine - dressers and husbandmen, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012">Kg2 25:12</A>, who are called strangers, because they were so, in reference to that hand, not being the proper owners of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018">Isaiah 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">isa 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>That draw - That are not only drawn to sin by the allurements of the world; but are active and illustrious in drawing sin to themselves.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">isa 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>To them - That take away the difference between good and evil; that justify wicked men and things, and condemn piety, or righteous persons. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022">Isaiah 5:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">isa 5:22</A></FONT></span></p>To mingle - To drink: the antecedent being put for the consequent: for they mingled it in order to drinking.

From far - To the Chaldeans; for even Babylon is called a far country, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003">Isa 39:3</A>. And he saith nations, because the Chaldean army was made up of several nations. Will hiss - Or, will whistle unto, or for them: will gather them together by his word. as shepherds gather their sheep. He intimates how easily and speedily God can do this work. From the ends - Which is not to be understood strictly, but with a latitude, from very remote places. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027">Isaiah 5:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">isa 5:27</A></FONT></span></p>Nor sleep - They shall all be watchful and diligent to take all opportunities of executing my judgments. Nor latchet - I will take all impediments out of their way. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028">Isaiah 5:28</A></p>
