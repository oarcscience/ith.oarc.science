### [Zechariah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001)

[Zechariah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 4:2</span></span>

With a bowl - Or basin. His seven lamps - The temple candlestick had
just so many. And seven pipes - So each of the lamps had a pipe reaching
from it to the bowl. On the top - These lamps were so set, as to stand
somewhat higher than the body of the candlestick.

[Zechariah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 4:3</span></span>

Two olive - trees by it - All which is an emblem of the church, made of
pure gold; to be a light in the world; to shine as lamps that
continually burn, maintained with pure oil, distilled from the olive -
trees, not pressed out by man, but continually, abundantly, and freely
flowing from God.

[Zechariah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 4:6</span></span>

This word - Is particularly designed to him, and in an emblem prefigures
what a church it is, how precious, how full of light, how maintained by
God himself. Power - Courage and valour.

[Zechariah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 4:7</span></span>

O great mountain - All opposers put together. Become a plain - Thou
shalt sink into nothing. The head stone - Shall assist at the laying of
the finishing stone, as he assisted when the foundation stone was laid.
Grace, grace - Wishing all prosperity, and a long continuance of it, to
the temple and those that are to worship God therein. As the free favour
of God began, and finished, may the same ever dwell in it and replenish
it.

[Zechariah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 4:9</span></span>

Thou - Zerubbabel and all the Jews.

[Zechariah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 4:10</span></span>

For who hath despised - In the work of God, the day of small things is
not to be despised. God often chuses weak instruments, to bring about
mighty things: and tho' the beginnings be small, he can make the latter
end greatly to increase. For - Tho' they undervalued the meanness of the
second temple, yet when finished, they shall rejoice in it. The plummet
- The perpendicular with which Zerubbabel shall try the finished work.
With those seven - In subordination to the Divine Providence expressed
by the seven eyes, which were on that stone. And those that have the
plummet in their hand, must look up to these eyes of the Lord, must have
a constant regard to the Divine Providence, and as in dependence upon
its conduct, and submission to its disposals.

[Zechariah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 4:12</span></span>

I answered - l went on to discourse. Unto him - The angel. What be these
- Two principal branches, one in each tree, fuller of berries, and
hanging over the golden pipes. Through the pipes - These were fastened
to the bowl, on each side one, with a hole through the sides of the
bowl, to let the oil that distilled from those olive - branches run into
the bowl. Out of themselves - An emblem of supernatural grace; these
branches filled from the true olive - tree, ever empty themselves, and
are ever full; so are the gospel - ordinances.

[Zechariah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 4:14</span></span>

The two anointed ones - Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Son was to be
sent by the Father, and so was the Holy Ghost. And they stand by him,
ready to go.
