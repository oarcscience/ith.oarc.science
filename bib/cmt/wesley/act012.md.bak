### [Acts Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md)

[Acts 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 12:1</span></span>

About that time - So wisely did God mix rest and persecution in due time
and measure succeeding each other. Herod - Agrippa; the latter was his
Roman, the former his Syrian name. He was the grandson of Herod the
Great, nephew to Herod Antipas, who beheaded John the Baptist; brother
to Herodias, and father to that Agrippa before whom St. Paul afterward
made his defence. Caligula made him king of the tetrarchy of his uncle
Philip, to which he afterward added the territories of Antipas. Claudius
made him also king of Judea, and added thereto the dominions of
Lysanias.

[Acts 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 12:2</span></span>

James the brother of John - So one of the brothers went to God the
first, the other the last of the apostles.

[Acts 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 12:3</span></span>

Then were the days of unleavened bread - At which the Jews came together
from all parts.

[Acts 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 12:5</span></span>

Continual prayer was made for him - Yet when their prayer was answered,
they could scarce believe it, [Act
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#015.md). But why had they not prayed for
St. James also? Because he was put to death as soon as apprehended.

[Acts 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 12:6</span></span>

Peter was sleeping - Easy and void of fear; between two soldiers -
Sufficiently secured to human appearance.

[Acts 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 12:7</span></span>

His chains - With which his right arm was bound to one of the soldiers,
and his left arm to the other.

[Acts 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 12:8</span></span>

Gird thyself - Probably he had put off his girdle, sandals, and upper
garment, before he lay down to sleep.

[Acts 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 12:10</span></span>

The first and second ward - At each of which doubtless was a guard of
soldiers. The gate opened of its own accord - Without either Peter or
the angel touching it. And they went on through one street - That Peter
might know which way to go. And the angel departed from him - Being
himself sufficient for what remained to be done.

[Acts 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 12:11</span></span>

Now I know of a truth - That this is not a vision, [Act
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#009.md).

[Acts 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 12:12</span></span>

And having considered - What was best to be done. Many were gathered
together - At midnight.

[Acts 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 12:13</span></span>

The gate - At some distance from the house; to hearken - If any knocked.

[Acts 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 12:14</span></span>

[Acts 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 12:15</span></span>

They said, Thou art mad - As we say, Sure you are not in your senses to
talk so. It is his angel - It was a common opinion among the Jews, that
every man had his particular guardian angel, who frequently assumed both
his shape and voice. But this is a point on which the Scriptures are
silent.

[Acts 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 12:17</span></span>

Beckoning to them - Many of whom being amazed, were talking together.
And he said, Show these things to James - The brother or kinsman of our
Lord, and author of the epistle which bears his name. He appears to have
been a person of considerable weight and importance, probably the chief
overseer of that province, and of the Church in Jerusalem in particular.
He went into another place - Where he might be better concealed till the
storm was over.

[Acts 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 12:19</span></span>

Herod commanded them to be put to death - And thus the wicked suffered
in the room of the righteous. And going down from Judea - With shame,
for not having brought forth Peter, according to his promise.

[Acts 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 12:20</span></span>

Having gained Blastus - To their side, they sued for, and obtained peace
- Reconciliation with Herod. And so the Christians of those parts were,
by the providence of God, delivered from scarcity. Their country was
nourished - Was provided with, corn, by the king's country - Thus Hiram
also, king of Tyre, desired of Solomon food or corn for his household,
[Kg1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009.md).

[Acts 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 12:21</span></span>

And on a set day - Which was solemnized yearly, in honour of Claudius
Cesar; Herod, arrayed in royal apparel - In a garment so wrought with
silver, that the rays of the rising sun striking upon, and being
reflected from it, dazzled the eyes of the beholders. The people
shouted, It is the voice of a god - Such profane flattery they
frequently paid to princes. But the commonness of a wicked custom rather
increases than lessens the guilt of it.

[Acts 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 12:23</span></span>

And immediately - God does not delay to vindicate his injured honour; an
angel of the Lord smote him - Of this other historians say nothing: so
wide a difference there is between Divine and human history! An angel of
the Lord brought out Peter; an angel smote Herod. Men did not see the
instruments in either case. These were only known to the people of God.
Because he gave not glory to God - He willingly received it to himself,
and by this sacrilege filled up the measure of his iniquities. So then
vengeance tarried not. And he was eaten by worms, or vermin - How
changed! And on the fifth day expired in exquisite torture. Such was the
event! The persecutor perished, and the Gospel grew and multiplied.

[Acts 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 12:25</span></span>

Saul returned - To Antioch; taking John, surnamed Mark - The son of
Mary, (at whose house the disciples met, to pray for Peter,) who was
sister to Barnabas.
