### [Luke Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 7:1</span></span>

[Mat 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005.md).

[Luke 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 7:3</span></span>

Hearing of Jesus - Of his miracles, and of his arrival at Capernaum.

[Luke 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 7:18</span></span>

[Mat 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md).

[Luke 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 7:22</span></span>

To the poor the Gospel is preached - Which is the greatest mercy, and
the greatest miracle of all.

[Luke 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 7:24</span></span>

When the messengers were departed - He did not speak the following
things in the hearing of John's disciples, lest he should seem to
flatter John, or to compliment him into an adherence to his former
testimony. To avoid all suspicion of this kind, he deferred his
commendation of him, till the messengers were gone; and then delivered
it to the people, to prevent all imaginations, as if John were wavering
in his judgment, and had sent the two disciples for his own, rather than
their satisfaction.

[Luke 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 7:27</span></span>

[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md).

[Luke 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 7:28</span></span>

There is not a greater prophet than John - A greater teacher. But he
that is least in the kingdom of God - The least teacher whom I send
forth.

[Luke 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 7:29</span></span>

And all the people - Our Lord continues his discourse: justified God -
Owned his wisdom and mercy in thus calling them to repentance, and
preparing them for Him that was to come.

[Luke 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 7:30</span></span>

But the Pharisees and scribes - The good, learned, honourable men: made
void the counsel, the gracious design, of God toward them - They
disappointed all these methods of his love, and would receive no benefit
from them.

[Luke 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 7:32</span></span>

They are like children sitting in the market place - So froward and
perverse, that no contrivance can be found to please them. It is plain
our Lord means, that they were like the children complained of, not like
those that made the complaint.

[Luke 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 7:34</span></span>

But wisdom is justified by all her children - The children of wisdom are
those who are truly wise unto salvation. The wisdom of God in all these
dispensations, these various methods of calling sinners to repentance,
is owned and heartily approved by all these.

[Luke 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 7:36</span></span>

And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him - Let the candour
with which our Lord accepted this invitation, and his gentleness and
prudence at this ensnaring entertainment, teach us to mingle the wisdom
of the serpent, with the innocence and sweetness of the dove. Let us
neither absolutely refuse all favours, nor resent all neglects, from
those whose friendship is at best very doubtful, and their intimacy by
no means safe.

[Luke 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 7:37</span></span>

A woman - Not the same with Mary of Bethany, who anointed him six days
before his last passover.

[Luke 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 7:40</span></span>

And Jesus said, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee - So tender and
courteous am address does our Lord use even to a proud, censorious
Pharisee!

[Luke 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 7:43</span></span>

Which of them will love him most? - Neither of them will love him at
all, before he has forgiven them. An insolvent debtor, till he is
forgiven, does not love, but fly his creditor.

[Luke 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 7:44</span></span>

Thou gavest me no water - It was customary with the Jews to show respect
and kindness to their welcome guests, by saluting them with a kiss, by
washing their feet, and anointing their heads with oil, or some fine
ointment.

[Luke 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 7:47</span></span>

Those many sins of hers are forgiven; therefore she loveth much - The
fruit of her having had much forgiven. It should carefully be observed
here, that her love is mentioned as the effect and evidence, not the
cause of her pardon. She knew that much had been forgiven her, and
therefore she loved much.

[Luke 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 7:50</span></span>

Thy faith hath saved thee - Not thy love. Love is salvation.
