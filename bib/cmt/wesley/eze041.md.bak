The breadth - These walls in their thickness took up as much space as
the whole breadth of Moses's tabernacle, [Exo
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#016.md), [Exo
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 41:3</span></span>

Went he - From the porch thro' the body of the temple, to the partition
between the body of the temple and the holy of holies. Measured - Either
the thickness of that partition wall, or of the pilasters, which stood
one on the one side, and the other on the other side of the door. Of the
door - Or entrance out of the temple into the oracle. And the door -
This door was six cubits broad, and an upright bar or post on which the
leaves met, and which was of one cubit's breadth, make out seven cubits.

[Ezekiel 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 41:4</span></span>

Thereof - Of the holy of holies, which was an exact square. Before -
Parallel with the breadth of the temple.

[Ezekiel 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 41:5</span></span>

After - Having left the holy of holies, now he is come to take the
measures of the outer wall. The house - The temple. Six cubits - Three
yards thick was this wall from the ground to the first story of the side
- chambers. Side - chamber - Of the lowest floor; for there were three
stories of these, and they differed in their breadth, as the wall of the
temple, on which they rested, abated of its thickness; for the middle
chambers were broader than the lowest by a cubit, and the highest as
much broader than the middle. Round about - On the north, south, and
west parts, on each side of every one of these three gates.

[Ezekiel 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md)

They might - That the beams of the chambers might have good and firm
resting - hold. Had not hold - The ends of the beams were not thrust
into the main body of the wall of the temple.

[Ezekiel 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 41:7</span></span>

An enlarging - Of the side chambers, so much of breadth added to the
chamber, as was taken from the thickness of the wall; that is, two
cubits in the uppermost, and one cubit in the middle - most, more than
in the lowest chambers. A winding about - Winding stairs, which enlarged
as the rooms did, and these run up between each two chambers from the
bottom to the top; so there were two doors at the head of each pair of
stairs, one door opening into one chamber, and the other into the
opposite chamber. For the winding about - These stairs, as they rose in
height, enlarged themselves too. Round about - On all sides of the house
where these chambers were. The breadth - Of each chamber. Increased -
Grew broader by one cubit in every upper chamber. From five in the
lowest to six in the middle, and to seven in the highest chamber.

[Ezekiel 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 41:8</span></span>

The foundations - The lowest chamber had properly a foundation laid on
the earth, but the floor of the middle, and highest story must be
accounted here a foundation; so from the ground to the ceiling of the
first room, was six great cubits; from the first to the second, six
great cubits; and from the third floor to the roof of the chamber, a
like number; to which add we one cubit for thickness of each of the
three floors, you have twenty - one cubits for height, ten yards and a
half high.
