### [1 Corinthians Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 10:1</span></span>

Now - That ye may not become reprobates, consider how highly favoured
your fathers were, who were God's elect and peculiar people, and
nevertheless were rejected by him. They were all under the cloud - That
eminent token of God's gracious presence, which screened them from the
heat of the sun by day, and gave them light by night. And all passed
through the sea - God opening a way through the midst of the waters.
[Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021), [Exo
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022)

[1 Corinthians 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 10:2</span></span>

And were all, as it were, baptized unto Moses - initiated into the
religion which he taught them. In the cloud and in the sea - Perhaps
sprinkled here and there with drops of water from the sea or the cloud,
by which baptism might be the more evidently signified.

[1 Corinthians 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 10:3</span></span>

And all ate the same manna, termed spiritual meat, as it was typical, Of
Christ and his spiritual benefits: Of the sacred bread which we eat at
his table. [Exo 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#015).

[1 Corinthians 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 10:4</span></span>

And all drank the same spiritual drink - Typical of Christ, and of that
cup which we drink. For they drank out of the spiritual or mysterious
rock, the wonderful streams of which followed them in their several
journeyings, for many years, through the wilderness. And that rock was a
manifest type of Christ - The Rock of Eternity, from whom his people
derive those streams of blessings which follow them through all this
wilderness. [Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006).

[1 Corinthians 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 10:5</span></span>

Yet - Although they had so many tokens of the divine presence. They were
overthrown - With the most terrible marks of his displeasure.

[1 Corinthians 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 10:6</span></span>

Now these things were our examples - Showing what we are to expect if,
enjoying the like benefits, we commit the like sins. The benefits are
set down in the same order as by Moses in Exodus; the sins and
punishments in a different order; evil desire first, as being the
foundation of all; next, idolatry, [Co1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007), [Co1
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014); then fornication, which usually
accompanied it, [Co1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008); the
tempting and murmuring against God, in the following verses. As they
desired - Flesh, in contempt of manna. [Num
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004)

[1 Corinthians 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 10:7</span></span>

Neither be ye idolaters - And so, "neither murmur ye," [Co1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010). The other cautions are given in
the first person; but these in the second. And with what exquisite
propriety does he vary the person! It would have been improper to say,
Neither let us be idolaters; for he was himself in no danger of
idolatry; nor probably of murmuring against Christ, or the divine
providence. To play - That is, to dance, in honour of their idol. [Exo
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006).

[1 Corinthians 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 10:8</span></span>

And fell in one day three and twenty thousand - Beside the princes who
were afterwards hanged, and those whom the judges slew so that there
died in all four and twenty thousand. [Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001), [Num
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009).

[1 Corinthians 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 10:9</span></span>

Neither let us tempt Christ - By our unbelief. St. Paul enumerates five
benefits, [Co1 10:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001); of which the
fourth and fifth were closely connected together; and five sins, the
fourth and fifth of which were likewise closely connected. In speaking
of the fifth benefit, he expressly mentions Christ; and in speaking of
the fourth sin, he shows it was committed against Christ. As some of
them tempted him - This sin of the people was peculiarly against Christ;
for when they had so long drank of that rock, yet they murmured for want
of water. [Num 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004), &c

[1 Corinthians 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 10:10</span></span>

The destroyer - The destroying angel. [Num
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#001), [Num
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#036)

[1 Corinthians 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 10:11</span></span>

On whom the ends of the ages are come - The expression has great force.
All things meet together, and come to a crisis, under the last, the
gospel, dispensation; both benefits and dangers, punishments and
rewards. It remains, that Christ come as an avenger and judge. And even
these ends include various periods, succeeding each other.

[1 Corinthians 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 10:12</span></span>

The common translation runs, Let him that thinketh he standeth; but the
word translated thinketh, most certainly strengthens, rather than
weakens, the sense.

[1 Corinthians 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 10:13</span></span>

Common to man - Or, as the Greek word imports, proportioned to human
strength. God is faithful - In giving the help which he hath promised.
And he will with the temptation - Provide for your deliverance.

[1 Corinthians 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 10:14</span></span>

Flee from idolatry - And from all approaches to it.

[1 Corinthians 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 10:16</span></span>

The cup which we bless - By setting it apart to a sacred use, and
solemnly invoking the blessing of God upon it. Is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ - The means of our partaking of those invaluable
benefits, which are the purchase of the blood of Christ. The communion
of the body of Christ - The means of our partaking of those benefits
which were purchased by the body of Christ - offered for us.

[1 Corinthians 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 10:17</span></span>

For it is this communion which makes us all one. We being many are yet,
as it were, but different parts of one and the same broken bread, which
we receive to unite us in one body.

[1 Corinthians 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 10:18</span></span>

Consider Israel after the flesh - Christians are the spiritual "Israel
of God." Are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar -
Is not this an act of communion with that God to whom they are offered?
And is not the case the same with those who eat of the sacrifices which
have been offered to idols?

[1 Corinthians 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 10:19</span></span>

What say I then - Do I in saying this allow that an idol is anything
divine? I aver, on the contrary, that what the heathens sacrifice, they
sacrifice to devils. Such in reality are the gods of the heathens; and
with such only can you hold communion in those sacrifices.

[1 Corinthians 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 10:21</span></span>

Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils - You cannot
have communion with both.

[1 Corinthians 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 10:22</span></span>

Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy - By thus caressing his rivals? Are
we stronger than he - Are we able to resist, or to bear his wrath?

[1 Corinthians 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 10:23</span></span>

Supposing this were lawful in itself, yet it is not expedient, it is not
edifying to my neighbour.

[1 Corinthians 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 10:24</span></span>

His own only, but another's welfare also.

[1 Corinthians 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 10:25</span></span>

The apostle now applies this principle to the point in question. Asking
no questions - Whether it has been sacrificed or not.

[1 Corinthians 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 10:26</span></span>

For God, who is the Creator, Proprietor, and Disposer of the earth and
all that is therein, hath given the produce of it to the children of
men, to be used without scruple. [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 10:28</span></span>

For his sake that showed thee, and for conscience' sake - That is, for
the sake of his weak conscience, lest it should be wounded.

[1 Corinthians 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 10:29</span></span>

Conscience I say, not thy own - I speak of his conscience, not thine.
For why is my liberty judged by another's conscience - Another's
conscience is not the standard of mine, nor is another's persuasion the
measure of my liberty.

[1 Corinthians 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 10:30</span></span>

If I by grace am a partaker - If I thankfully use the common blessings
of God.

[1 Corinthians 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 10:31</span></span>

Therefore - To close the present point with a general rule, applicable
not only in this, but in all cases, Whatsoever ye do - In all things
whatsoever, whether of a religious or civil nature, in all the common,
as well as sacred, actions of life, keep the glory of God in view, and
steadily pursue in all this one end of your being, the planting or
advancing the vital knowledge and love of God, first in your own soul,
then in all mankind.

[1 Corinthians 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 10:32</span></span>

Give no offence - If, and as far as, it is possible.

[1 Corinthians 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 10:33</span></span>

Even as I, as much as lieth in me, please all men.
