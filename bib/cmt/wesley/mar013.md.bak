<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 13:19</span></span>

In those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of
the creation - May it not be doubted, whether this be yet fully
accomplished? Is not much of this affliction still to come?

[Mark 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 13:20</span></span>

The elect - The Christians: whom he hath chosen - That is, hath taken
out of, or separated from, the world, through sanctification of the
Spirit and belief of the truth. He hath shortened - That is, will surely
shorten.

after that tribulation - Above described.

21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md).

[Mark 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 13:29</span></span>

He is nigh - The Son of man.

[Mark 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 13:30</span></span>

All these things - Relating to the temple and the city.

[Mark 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 13:32</span></span>

Of that day - The day of judgment is often in the Scriptures
emphatically called that day. Neither the Son - Not as man: as man he
was no more omniscient than omnipresent. But as God he knows all the
circumstances of it.

[Mark 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 13:34</span></span>

The Son of man is as a man taking a far journey - Being about to leave
this world and go to the Father, he appoints the services that are to be
performed by all his servants, in their several stations. This seems
chiefly to respect ministers at the day of judgment: but it may be
applied to all men, and to the time of death. [Mat
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md); [Luk
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012.md).
