### [Deuteronomy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 3:8</span></span>

On this side Jordan - So it was when Moses wrote this book; but
afterward when Israel passed over Jordan it was called the land beyond
Jordan.

[Deuteronomy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 3:9</span></span>

Sirion - Elsewhere called Mount Gilead, and Lebanon, and here Shenir,
and Sirion, which several names are given to this one mountain partly by
several people, and partly in regard of several tops and parts of it.

[Deuteronomy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 3:10</span></span>

All Gilead - Gilead is sometimes taken for all the Israelites
possessions beyond Jordan, and so it comprehends Bashan; but here for
that part of it which lies in and near mount Gilead, and so it is
distinguished from Bashan and Argob.

[Deuteronomy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 3:11</span></span>

In Rabbath - Where it might now be, either because the Ammonites in some
former battle with Og, had taken it as a spoil: or because after Og's
death, the Ammonites desired to have this monument of his greatness, and
the Israelites permitted them to carry it away to their chief city. Nine
cubits - So his bed was four yards and an half long, and two yards
broad.

[Deuteronomy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 3:14</span></span>

Unto this day - This must be put among those passages which were not
written by Moses, but added by those holy men, who digested the books of
Moses into this order, and inserted some few passages to accommodate
things to their own time and people.

[Deuteronomy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 3:15</span></span>

Gilead - That is, the half part of Gilead. To Machir - That is, unto the
children of Machir, son of Manasseh, for Machir was now dead.

[Deuteronomy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 3:16</span></span>

Half the valley - Or rather to the middle of the river: for the word
rendered half signifies commonly middle, and the same Hebrew word means
both a valley and a brook or river. And this sense is agreeable to the
truth, that their land extended from Gilead unto Arnon, and, to speak
exactly, to the middle of that river; for as that river was the border
between them and others, so one half of it belonged to them, as the
other half did to others, [Jos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#002.md).
The same thing is expressed in the same words in the Hebrew which are
here, though our translators render the self - same words there, from
the middle of the river, which here they render, half of the valley.
There the bounds of Sihon's kingdom, which was the same portion here
mentioned as given to Reuben and Gad, are thus described, from Aroer,
which is upon the bank of the river of Arnon, and from the middle of the
river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the
border of the children of Ammon.

[Deuteronomy 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 3:17</span></span>

The plain - The low country towards Jordan. The sea of the plain - That
is, that salt sea, which before that dreadful conflagration was a goodly
plain.

[Deuteronomy 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 3:18</span></span>

You - Namely, the Reubenites and Gadites. All that are meet - In such
number as your our brethren shall judge necessary. They were in all
above an hundred thousand. Forty thousand of them went over Jordan
before their brethren.

[Deuteronomy 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 3:23</span></span>

I besought the Lord - We should allow no desire in our hearts, which we
cannot in faith offer unto God by prayer.

[Deuteronomy 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 3:24</span></span>

Thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness - Lord, perfect what
thou hast begun. The more we see of God's glory in his works, the more
we desire to see. And the more we are affected with what we have seen of
God, the better we are prepared for farther discoveries.

[Deuteronomy 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 3:25</span></span>

Let me go over - For he supposed God's threatening might be conditional
and reversible, as many others were. That goodly mountain - Which the
Jews not improbably understood of that mountain on which the temple was
to be built. This he seems to call that mountain, emphatically and
eminently, that which was much in Moses's thoughts, though not in his
eye.

[Deuteronomy 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 3:28</span></span>

He shall go over - It was not Moses, but Joshua or Jesus that was to
give the people rest, [Heb 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008.md). 'Tis a
comfort to those who love mankind, when they are dying and going off, to
see God's work likely to be carried on by other hands, when they are
silent in the dust.
