### [Mark Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

[Mark 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 14:1</span></span>

[Mat 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001); [Luk
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001).

[Mark 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 14:3</span></span>

[Mat 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006).

[Mark 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 14:4</span></span>

Some had indignation - Being incited thereto by Judas: and said -
Probably to the women.

[Mark 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 14:10</span></span>

Judas went to the chief priests - Immediately after this reproof, having
anger now added to his covetousness. [Mat
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014); [Luk
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003).

[Mark 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 14:12</span></span>

[Mat 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017); [Luk
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007).

[Mark 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 14:13</span></span>

Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man - It was highly
seasonable for our Lord to give them this additional proof both of his
knowing all things, and of his influence over the minds of men.

[Mark 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 14:15</span></span>

Furnished - The word properly means, spread with carpets.

[Mark 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 14:17</span></span>

[Mat 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020); [Luk
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#014).

[Mark 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 14:24</span></span>

This is my blood of the New Testament - That is, this I appoint to be a
perpetual sign and memorial of my blood, as shed for establishing the
new covenant, that all who shall believe in me may receive all its
gracious promises.

[Mark 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 14:25</span></span>

I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till I drink it new in
the kingdom of God - That is, I shall drink no more before I die: the
next wine I drink will not be earthly, but heavenly.

[Mark 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 14:26</span></span>

[Mat 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030); [Luk
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039); [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001).

[Mark 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 14:27</span></span>

This night - The Jews in reckoning their days began with the evening,
according to the Mosaic computation, which called the evening and the
morning the first day, [Gen 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005). And
so that which after sunset is here called this night is, [Mar
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030), called to - day. The expression
there is peculiarly significant. Verily I say to thee, that thou
thyself, confident as thou art, to - day, even within four and twenty
hours; yea, this night, or ever the sun be risen, nay, before the cock
crow twice, before three in the morning, wilt deny me thrice. Our Lord
doubtless spoke so determinately, as knowing a cock would crow once
before the usual time of cock crowing. By [Mar
13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035), it appears, that the third
watch of the night, ending at three in the morning, was commonly styled
the cock crowing. [Zac 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).

[Mark 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 14:32</span></span>

[Mat 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036).

[Mark 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 14:33</span></span>

Sore amazed - The original word imports the most shocking amazement,
mingled with grief: and that word in the next verse which we render
sorrowful intimates, that he was surrounded with sorrow on every side,
breaking in upon him with such violence, as was ready to separate his
soul from his body.

[Mark 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 14:36</span></span>

Abba, Father - St. Mark seems to add the word Father, by way of
explication.

[Mark 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 14:37</span></span>

Saith to Peter - The zealous, the confident Peter.

[Mark 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 14:43</span></span>

[Mat 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047); [Luk
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047); [Joh
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002).

[Mark 14:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 14:44</span></span>

Whomsoever I shall kiss - Probably our Lord, in great condescension, had
used (according to the Jewish custom) to permit his disciples to do
this, after they had been some time absent.

[Mark 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mar 14:47</span></span>

[Mat 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051); [Luk
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#049); [Joh
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010).

[Mark 14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mar 14:51</span></span>

A young man - It does not appear, that he was one of Christ's disciples.
Probably hearing an unusual noise, he started up out of his bed, not far
from the garden, and ran out with only the sheet about him, to see what
was the matter. And the young men laid hold on him - Who was only
suspected to be Christ's disciple: but could not touch them who really
were so.

[Mark 14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 14:53</span></span>

[Mat 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057); [Luk
22:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054); [Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012).

[Mark 14:55](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mar 14:55</span></span>

All the council sought for witness and found none - What an amazing
proof of the overruling providence of God, considering both their
authority, and the rewards they could offer, that no two consistent
witnesses could be procured, to charge him with any gross crime. [Mat
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059).

[Mark 14:56](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">mar 14:56</span></span>

Their evidences were not sufficient - The Greek words literally rendered
are, Were not equal: not equal to the charge of a capital crime: it is
the same word in [Mar 14:59](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#059).

[Mark 14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">mar 14:58</span></span>

We heard him say - It is observable, that the words which they thus
misrepresented, were spoken by Christ at least three years before, [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019). Their going back so far to find
matter for the charge, was a glorious, though silent attestation of the
unexceptionable manner wherein he had behaved, through the whole course
of his public ministry.

[Mark 14:61](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#061)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">mar 14:61</span></span>

[Mat 26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063); [Luk
22:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067).

[Mark 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mar 14:66</span></span>

[Mat 26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069); [Luk
22:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#056); [Joh
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025).

[Mark 14:72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#072)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mar 14:72</span></span>

And he covered his head - Which was a usual custom with mourners, and
was fitly expressive both of grief and shame.
