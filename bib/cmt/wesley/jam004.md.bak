### [James Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

[James 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 4:1</span></span>

From whence come wars and fightings - Quarrels and wars among you, quite
opposite to this peace? Is it not from your pleasures - Your desires of
earthly pleasures. Which war - Against your souls. In your members -
Here is the first seat of the war. Hence proceeds the war of man with
man, king with king, nation with nation.

[James 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 4:2</span></span>

Ye kill - In your heart, for "he that hateth his brother is a murderer."
Ye fight and war - That is, furiously strive and contend. Ye ask not -
And no marvel; for a man full of evil desire, of envy or hatred, cannot
pray.

[James 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 4:3</span></span>

But if ye do ask, ye receive not, because ye ask amiss - That is, from a
wrong motive.

[James 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 4:4</span></span>

Ye adulterers and adulteresses - Who have broken your faith with God,
your rightful spouse. Know ye not that the friendship or love of the
world - The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of
life, or courting the favour of worldly men, is enmity against God?
Whosoever desireth to be a friend of the world - Whosoever seeks either
the happiness or favour of it, does thereby constitute himself an enemy
of God; and can he expect to obtain anything of him?

[James 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 4:5</span></span>

Do you think that the scripture saith in vain - Without good ground. St.
James seems to refer to many, not any one particular scripture. The
spirit of love that dwelleth in all believers lusteth against envy -
[Gal 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md); is directly opposite to all
those unloving tempers which necessarily flow from the friendship of the
world.

[James 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 4:6</span></span>

But he giveth greater grace - To all who shun those tempers. Therefore
it - The scripture. Saith, God resisteth the proud - And pride is the
great root of all unkind affections. [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)

[James 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 4:7</span></span>

Therefore by humbly submitting yourselves to God, resist the devil - The
father of pride and envy.

[James 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 4:8</span></span>

Then draw nigh to God in prayer, and he will draw nigh unto you, will
hear you; which that nothing may hinder, cleanse your hands - Cease from
doing evil. And purify your hearts - From all spiritual adultery. Be no
more double minded, vainly endeavouring to serve both God and mammon.

[James 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 4:9</span></span>

Be afflicted - For your past unfaithfulness to God.

[James 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 4:11</span></span>

Speak not evil one of another - This is a grand hinderance of peace. O
who is sufficiently aware of it! He that speaketh evil of another does
in effect speak evil of the law, which so strongly prohibits it. Thou
art not a doer of the law, but a judge - Of it; thou settest thyself
above, and as it were condemnest, it.

[James 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 4:12</span></span>

There is one lawgiver that is able - To execute the sentence he
denounces. But who art thou - A poor, weak, dying worm.

[James 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 4:13</span></span>

Come now, ye that say - As peremptorily as if your life were in your own
hands.

[James 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 4:15</span></span>

Instead of your saying - That is, whereas ye ought to say.

[James 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 4:17</span></span>

Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not - That knows
what is right, and does not practise it. To him it is sin - This
knowledge does not prevent, but increase, his condemnation.
