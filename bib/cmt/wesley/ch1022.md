### [1 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 22:1</span></span>

Said - Thro' the instinct and direction of God's spirit, by which as he
is said to have had the pattern of the house, porch, altar, &c. [Ch1
28:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#011), [Ch1
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#019), so doubtless he was instructed
as to the place where the house should be built. This - This is the
place appointed by God for the building of his temple and altar.

[1 Chronicles 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 22:5</span></span>

Prepared, &c. - And good reason, because it was intended for the honour
of the great God, and was to be a type of Christ, in whom all fulness
dwells, and in whom are hid all treasures.

[1 Chronicles 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 22:8</span></span>

Shed blood - Not that wars are simply unlawful, but to teach us that the
church (whereof the temple was an illustrious type) should be built by
Christ, the prince of peace, [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006),
and that it should be gathered and built up, not by might or power but
by God's spirit, [Zac 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006), and by the
preaching the Gospel of peace. David therefore was less fit for that
service, than one who had not been called to such bloody work. Likewise
by setting him aside for this reason, God shewed how precious human life
is to him.

[1 Chronicles 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 22:14</span></span>

Trouble - This he alleges as a reason why he could do no more, because
of the many wars, whereby much of his treasures were exhausted. Talents
- A talent of Gold in the first constitution was three thousand shekels,
as may be gathered from [Exo 38:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#024),
and so this amounts to a vast sum, yet not impossible for David to get,
considering how many and great conquests he made, and what vast spoils
and presents he got; and that he endeavoured by all honourable ways to
get as much as he could, out of zeal for God's house. And whereas some
object, that this quantity of gold and silver was sufficient, tho' the
whole fabrick of the temple had consisted of massy gold and silver, it
is to be considered, that all this treasure was not spent upon the
materials of the temple, but a great part of it upon the workmen, who
were nigh two hundred thousand, whereof a great number were officers,
and what was not employed in the building of the temple, was laid up in
the sacred treasures.

[1 Chronicles 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 22:16</span></span>

Be doing - When thou shalt come to the throne. The sense of God's
presence must not slacken our endeavours; because he is with us, we must
rise and be doing. Then he will be with us even to the end. Work out
your salvation, and God will work in you.
