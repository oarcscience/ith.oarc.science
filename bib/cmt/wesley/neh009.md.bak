### [Nehemiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 9:1</span></span>

Now - The next day, but one after the feast of tabernacles, which begun
on the fourteenth day, and ended on the twenty second, for their
consciences having been fully awakened and their hearts filled with
grief for their sins, which they were not allowed to express in that
time of publick joy; now they resume their former thoughts, and
recalling their sins to mind, set apart a day for solemn fasting and
humiliation.

[Nehemiah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 9:2</span></span>

Separated - From all unnecessary society with the Heathens, and
particularly from those strange women whom some of them had married. For
though Ezra had done this formerly, yet, it seems, there were some
criminals, without his knowledge, or, these were some new delinquents,
that since that time had fallen into the same error, and shewed the
truth of their repentance by forsaking their beloved sins, and dearest
relations.

[Nehemiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 9:3</span></span>

Book of the law - As they did before, giving them the sense of what they
read. Fourth part - For three hours; there were twelve hours in their
day, probably they began after the morning sacrifice, and continued
their work till the evening sacrifice. The work of a fast - day is good
work. We should endeavour to make a day's work, a good day's work of it.

[Nehemiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 9:4</span></span>

Stairs - Upon such stairs, or pulpits, as the Levites used to stand
upon, when they taught the people. But they stood upon several pulpits,
each of them teaching that part of the congregation which was allotted
him, or praying, or blessing God with them. Loud voice - Thereby
testifying their deep sense of their sins and miseries, and their
servant, and importunate desire of God's mercy.

[Nehemiah 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 9:13</span></span>

Good statutes - The moral and judicial precepts were all founded on
natural equity. And even the ceremonial were tokens of God's goodness,
being types of gospel - grace.

[Nehemiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 9:17</span></span>

Made - Designed, and resolved to do so, [Num
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#004.md), and therefore they are said to
do so, as Abraham is said to have offered up Isaac, [Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md), because he intended to do it.

[Nehemiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 9:22</span></span>

Divide - The Heathen nations, whom God in a great measure destroyed, and
the remainders of them he dispersed into corners; that whereas before
the Israelites came, they had large habitations, now they were cooped
up, some in one town, and some in another, in the several corners of
their land, while the Israelites dwelt in a large place, and had the
possession of their whole land, some few and small parcels excepted.

[Nehemiah 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">neh 9:32</span></span>

Mercy - He adds mercy, because the covenant in itself was not a
sufficient ground of hope, because they had so basely broken it. God was
discharged from keeping it, and therefore they fly to God's free and
rich mercy for relief.

[Nehemiah 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">neh 9:33</span></span>

Thou art just. &c. - It becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of
providence, be they ever so sharp, or ever so long continued, still to
justify God, and to own we are punished less than our iniquities
deserve.

[Nehemiah 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">neh 9:37</span></span>

Yieldeth much, &c. - We plow, and sow, and labour, and thou givest thy
blessing to our endeavours; and yet in a great measure this is not for
ourselves, as formerly it was, but for our kings, to whom we pay heavy
tributes. Dominion - Pressing or forcing both us and our beasts to go
and to do what they please.

[Nehemiah 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">neh 9:38</span></span>

Sure covenant, &c. - It was sealed and left upon record, that it might
be a witness against them, if they dealt deceitfully.
