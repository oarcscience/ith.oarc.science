### [Matthew Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001)

[Matthew 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 11:1</span></span>

In their cities - The other cities of Israel.

[Matthew 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 11:2</span></span>

He sent two of his disciples - Not because he doubted himself; but to
confirm their faith. [Luk 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#018).

[Matthew 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 11:3</span></span>

He that is to come - The Messiah.

[Matthew 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 11:4</span></span>

Go and tell John the things that ye hear and see - Which are a stronger
proof of my being the Messiah, than any bare assertion can be.

[Matthew 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 11:5</span></span>

The poor have the Gospel preached to them - The greatest mercy of all.
[Isa 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018); [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005).

[Matthew 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 11:6</span></span>

Happy is he who shall not be offended at me - Notwithstanding all these
proofs that I am the Messiah.

[Matthew 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 11:7</span></span>

As they departed, he said concerning John - Of whom probably he would
not have said so much when they were present. A reed shaken by the wind?
- No; nothing could ever shake John in the testimony he gave to the
truth. The expression is proverbial.

[Matthew 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 11:8</span></span>

A man clothed in soft, delicate raiment - An effeminate courtier,
accustomed to fawning and flattery? You may expect to find persons of
such a character in palaces; not in a wilderness.

[Matthew 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 11:9</span></span>

More than a prophet - For the prophets only pointed me out afar off; but
John was my immediate forerunner.

[Matthew 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 11:10</span></span>

[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).

[Matthew 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 11:11</span></span>

But he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he -
Which an ancient author explains thus: - "One perfect in the law, as
John was, is inferior to one who is baptized into the death of Christ.
For this is the kingdom of heaven, even to be buried with Christ, and to
be raised up together with him. John was greater than all who had been
then born of women, but he was cut off before the kingdom of heaven was
given." \[He seems to mean, that righteousness, peace, and joy, which
constitute the present inward kingdom of heaven.\] "He was blameless as
to that righteousness which is by the law; but he fell short of those
who are perfected by the spirit of life which is in Christ. Whosoever,
therefore, is least in the kingdom of heaven, by Christian regeneration,
is greater than any who has attained only the righteousness of the law,
because the law maketh nothing perfect." It may farther mean, the least
true Christian believer has a more perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ, of
his redemption and kingdom, than John the Baptist had, who died before
the full manifestation of the Gospel.

[Matthew 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 11:12</span></span>

And from the days of John - That is, from the time that John had
fulfilled his ministry, men rush into my kingdom with a violence like
that of those who are taking a city by storm.

[Matthew 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 11:13</span></span>

For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John - For all that is
written in the law and the prophets only foretold as distant what is now
fulfilled. In John the old dispensation expired, and the new began. [Luk
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016).

[Matthew 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 11:14</span></span>

[Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005).

[Matthew 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 11:15</span></span>

He that hath ears to hear, let him hear - A kind of proverbial
expression; requiring the deepest attention to what is spoken.

[Matthew 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 11:16</span></span>

This generation - That is, the men of this age. They are like those
froward children of whom their fellows complain, that they will be
pleased no way.

[Matthew 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 11:18</span></span>

John came neither eating nor drinking - In a rigorous austere way, like
Elijah. And they say, He hath a devil - Is melancholy, from the
influence of an evil spirit.

[Matthew 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 11:19</span></span>

The Son of man came eating and drinking - Conversing in a free, familiar
way. Wisdom is justified by her children - That is, my wisdom herein is
acknowledged by those who are truly wise.

[Matthew 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 11:20</span></span>

Then began he to upbraid the cities - It is observable he had never
upbraided them before. Indeed at first they received him with all
gladness, Capernaum in particular.

[Matthew 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 11:21</span></span>

Wo to thee, Chorazin - That is, miserable art thou. For these are not
curses or imprecations, as has been commonly supposed; but a solemn,
compassionate declaration of the misery they were bringing on
themselves. Chorazin and Bethsaida were cities of Galilee, standing by
the lake Gennesareth. Tyre and Sidon were cities of Phenicia, lying on
the sea shore. The inhabitants of them were heathens. [Luk
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#013).

[Matthew 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 11:22</span></span>

Moreover I say unto you - Beside the general denunciation of wo to those
stubborn unbelievers, the degree of their misery will be greater than
even that of Tyre and Sidon, yea, of Sodom.

[Matthew 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 11:23</span></span>

Thou Capernaum, who hast been exalted to heaven - That is, highly
honoured by my presence and miracles.

[Matthew 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 11:24</span></span>

Moreover I say unto you - Beside the general denunciation of wo to those
stubborn unbelievers, the degree of their misery will be greater than
even that of Tyre and Sidon, yea, of Sodom.

[Matthew 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 11:25</span></span>

Jesus answering - This word does not always imply, that something had
been spoken, to which an answer is now made. It often means no more than
the speaking in reference to some action or circumstance preceding. The
following words Christ speaks in reference to the case of the cities
above mentioned: I thank thee - That is, I acknowledge and joyfully
adore the justice and mercy of thy dispensations: Because thou hast hid
- That is, because thou hast suffered these things to be hid from men,
who are in other respects wise and prudent, while thou hast discovered
them to those of the weakest understanding, to them who are only wise to
Godward. [Luk 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021).

[Matthew 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 11:27</span></span>

All things are delivered to me - Our Lord, here addressing himself to
his disciples, shows why men, wise in other things, do not know this:
namely, because none can know it by natural reason: none but those to
whom he revealeth it.

[Matthew 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 11:28</span></span>

Come to me - Here he shows to whom he is pleased to reveal these things
to the weary and heavy laden; ye that labour - After rest in God: and
are heavy laden - With the guilt and power of sin: and I will give you
rest - I alone (for none else can) will freely give you (what ye cannot
purchase) rest from the guilt of sin by justification, and from the
power of sin by sanctification.

[Matthew 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 11:29</span></span>

Take my yoke upon you - Believe in me: receive me as your prophet,
priest, and king. For I am meek and lowly in heart - Meek toward all
men, lowly toward God: and ye shall find rest - Whoever therefore does
not find rest of soul, is not meek and lowly. The fault is not in the
yoke of Christ: but in thee, who hast not taken it upon thee. Nor is it
possible for any one to be discontented, but through want of meekness or
lowliness.

[Matthew 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 11:30</span></span>

For my yoke is easy - Or rather gracious, sweet, benign, delightful: and
my burden - Contrary to those of men, is ease, liberty, and honour.
