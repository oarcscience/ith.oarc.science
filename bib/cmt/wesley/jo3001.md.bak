### [3 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

[3 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo3 1:1</span></span>

Caius was probably that Caius of Corinth whom St. Paul mentions, [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md). If so, either he was removed
from Achaia into Asia, or St. John sent this letter to Corinth.

[3 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo3 1:3</span></span>

For - I know thou usest all thy talents to his glory. The truth that is
in thee - The true faith and love.

[3 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo3 1:4</span></span>

I have no greater joy than this - Such is the spirit of every true
Christian pastor. To hear that my children walk in the truth - Caius
probably was converted by St. Paul. Therefore when St. John speaks of
him. with other believers, as his children, it may be considered as the
tender style of paternal love, whoever were the instruments of their
conversion. And his using this appellation, when writing under the
character of the elder, has its peculiar beauty.

[3 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo3 1:5</span></span>

Faithfully - Uprightly and sincerely.

[3 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo3 1:6</span></span>

Who have testified of thy love before the church - The congregation with
whom I now reside. Whom if thou send forward on their journey - Supplied
with what is needful. Thou shalt do well - How tenderly does the apostle
enjoin this!

[3 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo3 1:7</span></span>

They went forth - To preach the gospel.

[3 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo3 1:8</span></span>

To receive - With all kindness. The truth - Which they preach.

[3 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo3 1:9</span></span>

I wrote to the church - Probably that to which they came. But Diotrephes
- Perhaps the pastor of it. Who loveth to have the preeminence among
them - To govern all things according to his own will. Receiveth us not
- Neither them nor me. So did the mystery of iniquity already work!

[3 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo3 1:10</span></span>

He prateth against us - Both them and me, thereby endeavouring to excuse
himself.

[3 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo3 1:11</span></span>

Follow not that which is evil - In Diotrephes. But that which is good -
In Demetrius. He hath not seen God - Is a stranger to him.

[3 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo3 1:12</span></span>

And from the truth itself - That is, what they testify is the very
truth. Yea, we also bear testimony - I and they that are with me.

[3 John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo3 1:14</span></span>

Salute the friends by name - That is, in the same manner as if I had
named them one by one. The word friend does not often occur in the New
Testament, being swallowed up in the more endearing one of brother.
