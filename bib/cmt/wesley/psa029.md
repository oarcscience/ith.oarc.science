### [Psalms Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 29:1</span></span>

Ye - Ye potentates and rulers of the earth. Glory - By an humble and
thankful acknowledgment of it.

[Psalms 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 29:2</span></span>

Give, &c. - The honour which he deserves: own him as the Almighty, and
the only true God. Holiness - Or, in his holy and beautiful house.

[Psalms 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 29:3</span></span>

The waters - Above in the clouds, which are called waters, [Gen
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#007.md); [Psa
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md). The Divine power displays
itself in those high places, which are far above the reach of all
earthly potentates. Many - Upon the clouds, in which there are vast
treasures of water, and upon which God is said to sit or ride, [Psa
18:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md), [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md).

[Psalms 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 29:5</span></span>

Lebanon - A place famous for strong and lofty cedars.

[Psalms 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 29:6</span></span>

Them - The cedars; which being broken by the thunder, the parts of them
are suddenly and violently hurled hither and thither. Sirion - An high
mountain beyond Jordan joining to Lebanon. Lebanon and Sirion are said
to skip or leap, both here, and [Psa
114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md), by a poetical hyperbole.

[Psalms 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 29:7</span></span>

The flames - The lightnings.

[Psalms 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 29:8</span></span>

Kadesh - An eminent wilderness, vast and terrible, and well known to the
Israelites, and wherein possibly they had seen, and observed some such
effects of thunder.

[Psalms 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 29:9</span></span>

To calve - Through the terror it causes, which hastens the birth. He
names the hinds, because they bring forth their young with difficulty,
[Job 39:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#001.md). Discovereth - Heb. maketh
bare, of its trees, which it breaks or strips of their leaves. Glory -
Having shewed the terrible effects of God's power in other places, he
now shews the blessed privilege of God's people, that are praising God
in his temple, when the rest of the world are trembling under the tokens
of his displeasure.

[Psalms 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 29:10</span></span>

The flood - The most violent waters, which sometimes fall from the
clouds upon the earth. These are fitly mentioned, as being many times
the companions of great thunders. And this may be alleged as another
reason, why God's people praised him in his temple, because as he sends
terrible tempests and thunders, so he also restrains and over - rules
them. Sitteth - He doth sit, and will sit as king for ever, sending such
tempests when it pleaseth him.
