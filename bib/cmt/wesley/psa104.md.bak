<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 104:2</span></span>

Who laid - Heb. he hath established the earth upon its own basis,
whereby it stands as fast and unmoveable, as if it were built upon the
strongest foundations. Forever - As long as the world continues. God has
fixt so strange a place for the earth, that being an heavy body, one
would think it should fall every moment. And yet which way so ever we
would imagine it to stir, it must, contrary to the nature of such a
body, fall upwards, and so can have no possible ruin, but by tumbling
into heaven.

upwards, and became springs in the mountains, the greatest part went

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 104:16</span></span>

Trees - Which come up, and thrive not by man's industry, but merely by
the care of God's providence.

[Psalms 104:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 104:19</span></span>

For seasons - To distinguish the times, the seasons of divers natural
events, as of the ebbing and flowing of waters, and other seasons for
sacred and civil affairs, which were commonly regulated by the moon.

Spirit - That quickening power of God, by which he produces life in the
creatures from time to time. For he speaks not here of the first
creation, but of the continued production of living creatures. Created -
Other living creatures are produced; the word created being taken in its
largest sense for the production of things by second causes. Renewest -

succession of living creatures.

generation, and he takes pleasure in the preservation of his works, as

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 104:32</span></span>

He looketh - This is a farther illustration of God's powerful
providence: as when he affords his favour to creatures, they live and
thrive, so on the contrary, one angry look or touch of his upon the
hills or earth, makes them tremble and smoke, as Sinai did when God
appeared in it.

[Psalms 104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 104:35</span></span>

Praise ye the Lord - Heb. Hallelujah. This is the first time that this
word occurs. And it comes in here on occasion of the destruction of the
wicked. And the last time it occurs, [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md), [Rev
19:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003.md), [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md), it is on a like occasion, the
destruction of Babylon.
