### [James Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

[James 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 1:1</span></span>

A servant of Jesus Christ - Whose name the apostle mentions but once
more in the whole epistle, [Jam 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md).
And not at all in his whole discourse, [Act
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md), &c.; or [Act
21:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md). It might have seemed, if he
mentioned him often, that he did it out of vanity, as being the brother
of the Lord. To the twelve tribes - Of Israel; that is, those of them
that believe. Which are scattered abroad - In various countries. Ten of
the tribes were scattered ever since the reign of Hosea; and great part
of the rest were now dispersed through the Roman empire: as was
foretold, [Deu 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025.md), &c., [Deu
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md). Greeting - That is, all
blessings, temporal and eternal.

[James 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 1:2</span></span>

My brethren, count it all joy - Which is the highest degree of patience,
and contains all the rest. When ye fall into divers temptations - That
is, trials.

[James 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 1:4</span></span>

Let patience have its perfect work - Give it full scope, under whatever
trials befal you. That ye may be perfect and entire - Adorned with every
Christian grace. And wanting nothing - Which God requires in you.

[James 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 1:5</span></span>

If any want - The connexion between the first and following verses, both
here and in the fourth chapter, will be easily discerned by him who
reads them, while he is suffering wrongfully. He will then readily
perceive, why the apostle mentions all those various affections of the
mind. Wisdom - To understand, whence and why temptations come, and how
they are to be improved. Patience is in every pious man already. Let him
exercise this, and ask for wisdom. The sum of wisdom, both in the
temptation of poverty and of riches, is described in [Jam
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md). Who giveth to all - That ask
aright. And upbraideth not - Either with their past wickedness, or
present unworthiness.

[James 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 1:6</span></span>

But let him ask in faith - A firm confidence in God. St. James also both
begins and ends with faith, [Jam 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md);
the hinderances of which he removes in the middle part of his epistle.
He that doubteth is like a wave of the sea - Yea, such are all who have
not asked and obtained wisdom. Driven with the wind - From without. And
tossed - From within, by his own unstableness.

[James 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 1:8</span></span>

A doubleminded man - Who has, as it were, two souls; whose heart is not
simply given up to God. Is unstable - Being without the true wisdom;
perpetually disagrees both with himself and others, [Jam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md).

[James 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 1:9</span></span>

Let the brother - St James does not give this appellation to the rich.
Of low degree - Poor and tempted. Rejoice - The most effectual remedy
against doublemindedness. In that he is exalted - To be a child of God,
and an heir of glory.

[James 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 1:10</span></span>

But the rich, in that he is made low - Is humbled by a deep sense of his
true condition. Because as the flower - Beautiful, but transient. He
shall pass away - Into eternity.

[James 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 1:11</span></span>

For the sun arose and withered the grass - There is an unspeakable
beauty and elegance, both in the comparison itself, and in the very
manner of expressing it, intimating both the certainty and the
suddenness of the event. So shall the rich fade away in his ways - In
the midst of his various pleasures and employments.

[James 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 1:12</span></span>

Happy is the man that endureth temptation - Trials of various kinds. He
shall receive the crown - That fadeth not away. Which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him - And his enduring proves his love. For
it is love only that "endureth all things."

[James 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 1:13</span></span>

But let no man who is tempted - To sin. Say, I am tempted of God - God
thus tempteth no man.

[James 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 1:14</span></span>

Every man is tempted, when - In the beginning of the temptation. He is
drawn away - Drawn out of God, his strong refuge. By his own desire - We
are therefore to look for the cause of every sin, in, not out of
ourselves. Even the injections of the devil cannot hurt before we make
them our own. And every one has desires arising from his own
constitution, tempers, habits, and way of life. And enticed - In the
progress of the temptation, catching at the bait: so the original word
signifies.

[James 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 1:15</span></span>

Then desire having conceived - By our own will joining therewith.
Bringeth forth actual sin - It doth not follow that the desire itself is
not sin. He that begets a man is himself a man. And sin being perfected
- Grown up to maturity, which it quickly does. Bringeth forth death -
Sin is born big with death.

[James 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 1:16</span></span>

Do not err - It is a grievous error to ascribe the evil and not the good
which we receive to God.

[James 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 1:17</span></span>

No evil, but every good gift - Whatever tends to holiness. And every
perfect gift - Whatever tends to glory. Descendeth from the Father of
lights - The appellation of Father is here used with peculiar propriety.
It follows, "he begat us." He is the Father of all light, material or
spiritual, in the kingdom of grace and of glory. With whom is no
variableness - No change in his understanding. Or shadow of turning - in
his will. He infallibly discerns all good and evil; and invariably loves
one, and hates the other. There is, in both the Greek words, a metaphor
taken from the stars, particularly proper where the Father of lights is
mentioned. Both are applicable to any celestial body, which has a daily
vicissitude of day and night, and sometimes longer days, sometimes
longer nights. In God is nothing of this kind. He is mere light. If
there Is any such vicissitude, it is in ourselves, not in him.

[James 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jam 1:18</span></span>

Of his own will - Most loving, most free, most pure, just opposite to
our evil desire, [Jam 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md). Begat he
us - Who believe. By the word of truth - The true word, emphatically so
termed; the gospel. That we might be a kind of first - fruits of his
creatures - Christians are the chief and most excellent of his visible
creatures; and sanctify the rest. Yet he says, A kind of - For Christ
alone is absolutely the first - fruits.

[James 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jam 1:19</span></span>

Let every man be swift to hear - This is treated of from [Jam
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md) to the end of the next chapter.
Slow to speak - Which is treated of in he third chapter. Slow to wrath -
Neither murmuring at God, nor angry at his neighbour. This is treated of
in the third, and throughout the fourth and fifth chapters.

[James 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jam 1:20</span></span>

The righteousness of God here includes all duties prescribed by him, and
pleasing to him.

[James 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jam 1:21</span></span>

Therefore laying aside - As a dirty garment. All the filthiness and
superfluity of wickedness - For however specious or necessary it may
appear to worldly wisdom, all wickedness is both vile, hateful,
contemptible, and really superfluous. Every reasonable end may be
effectually answered without any kind or degree of it. Lay this, every
known sin, aside, or all your hearing is vain. With meekness - Constant
evenness and serenity of mind. Receive - Into your ears, your heart,
your life. The word - Of the gospel. Ingrafted - In believers, by
regeneration, [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md) and by habit,
[Heb 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md). Which is able to save your
souls - The hope of salvation nourishes meekness.

[James 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jam 1:23</span></span>

Beholding his face in a glass - How exactly does the scripture glass
show a man the face of his soul!

[James 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jam 1:24</span></span>

He beheld himself, and went away - To other business. And forgot - But
such forgetting does not excuse.

[James 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jam 1:25</span></span>

But he that looketh diligently - Not with a transient glance, but
bending down, fixing his eyes, and searching all to the bottom. Into the
perfect law - Of love as established by faith. St. James here guards us
against misunderstanding what St. Paul says concerning the "yoke and
bondage of the law." He who keeps the law of love is free, [Joh
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#031.md), &c. He that does not, is not
free, but a slave to sin, and a criminal before God, [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md). And continueth therein - Not
like him who forgot it, and went away. This man - There is a peculiar
force in the repetition of the word. Shall be happy - Not barely in
hearing, but doing the will of God.

[James 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jam 1:26</span></span>

If any one be ever so religious - Exact in the outward offices of
religion. And bridleth not his tongue - From backbiting, talebearing,
evilspeaking, he only deceiveth his own heart, if he fancies he has any
true religion at all.

[James 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jam 1:27</span></span>

The only true religion in the sight of God, is this, to visit - With
counsel, comfort, and relief. The fatherless and widows - Those who need
it most. In their affliction - In their most helpless and hopeless
state. And to keep himself unspotted from the world - From the maxims,
tempers, and customs of it. But this cannot be done, till we have given
our hearts to God, and love our neighbour as ourselves.
