Captives - There were two carryings into Babylon, the latter about

By the hand - Zedekiah having some occasion to send two messengers to
Babylon. Jeremiah knowing that as there were false prophets at
Jerusalem, who fed people with hopes of a speedy return, so there were

these two messengers, to quiet the peoples minds.

carried away.

To give - This deliverance will not depend upon your merits, but upon my
own mercy, and kind thoughts and purposes I have for the seed of Abraham
my servant, and I am resolved in my own thoughts what to do, I intend
not the blotting out of the name of Israel from the earth, but to give
such an end to their trouble as themselves expect and desire.
