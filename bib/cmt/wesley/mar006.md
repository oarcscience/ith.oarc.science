### [Mark Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001)

[Mark 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 6:1</span></span>

[Mat 13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054); [Luk
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016).

[Mark 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 6:3</span></span>

Is not this the carpenter? - There can be no doubt, but in his youth he
wrought with his supposed father Joseph.

[Mark 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 6:5</span></span>

He could do no miracle there - Not consistently with his wisdom and
goodness. It being inconsistent with his wisdom to work them there,
where it could not promote his great end; and with his goodness, seeing
he well knew his countrymen would reject whatever evidence could be
given them. And therefore to have given them more evidence, would only
have increased their damnation.

[Mark 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 6:6</span></span>

He marvelled - As man. As he was God, nothing was strange to him.

[Mark 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 6:7</span></span>

[Mat 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001); [Luk
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001).

[Mark 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 6:8</span></span>

He commanded them to take nothing for their journey - That they might be
always unincumbered, free, ready for motion. Save a staff only - He that
had one might take it; but he that had not was not to provide one, [Mat
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009). [Luk
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#003).

[Mark 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 6:9</span></span>

Be shod with sandals - As you usually are. Sandals were pieces of strong
leather or wood, tied under the sole of the foot by thongs, something
resembling modern clogs. The shoes which they are in St. Matthew
forbidden to take, were a kind of short boots, reaching a little above
the mid - leg, which were then commonly used in journeys. Our Lord
intended by this mission to initiate them into their apostolic work. And
it was doubtless an encouragement to them all their life after, to
recollect the care which God took of them, when they had left all they
had, and went out quite unfurnished for such an expedition. In this view
our Lord himself leads them to consider it, [Luk
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#035) When I sent you forth without
purse or scrip, lacked ye any thing?

[Mark 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 6:10</span></span>

[Mat 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011); [Luk
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#004).

[Mark 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 6:12</span></span>

[Luk 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#006).

[Mark 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 6:13</span></span>

They anointed with oil many that were sick - Which St. James gives as a
general direction, [Jam 5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014),
adding those peremptory words, And the Lord shall heal him - He shall be
restored to health: not by the natural efficacy of the oil, but by the
supernatural blessing of God. And it seems this was the great standing
means of healing, desperate diseases in the Christian Church, long
before extreme unction was used or heard of, which bears scarce any
resemblance to it; the former being used only as a means of health; the
latter only when life is despaired of.

[Mark 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 6:14</span></span>

[Mat 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001); [Luk
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007).

[Mark 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 6:15</span></span>

A prophet, as one of the prophets - Not inferior to one of the ancient
prophets.

[Mark 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 6:16</span></span>

But Herod hearing thereof - Of their various judgments concerning him,
still said, It is John.

[Mark 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 6:20</span></span>

And preserved him - Against all the malice and contrivances of Herodias.
And when he heard him - Probably sending for him, at times, during his
imprisonment, which continued a year and a half. He heard him gladly -
Delusive joy! While Herodias lay in his bosom.

[Mark 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 6:21</span></span>

A convenient day - Convenient for her purpose. His lords, captains, and
principal men of Galilee - The great men of the court, the army, and the
province.

[Mark 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 6:23</span></span>

To the half of my kingdom - A proverbial expression.

[Mark 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 6:26</span></span>

Yet for his oath's sake, and for the sake of his guests - Herod's honour
was like the conscience of the chief priests, [Mat
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006). To shed innocent blood wounded
neither one nor the other.

[Mark 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 6:30</span></span>

[Luk 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010).

[Mark 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 6:31</span></span>

[Mat 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013); [Joh
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001).

[Mark 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 6:32</span></span>

They departed - Across a creek or corner of the lake.

[Mark 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 6:34</span></span>

Coming out - of the vessel.

[Mark 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 6:40</span></span>

They sat down in ranks - The word properly signifies a parterre or bed
in a garden; by a metaphor, a company of men ranged in order, by
hundreds and by fifties - That is, fifty in rank, and a hundred in file.
So a hundred multiplied by fifty, make just five thousand.

[Mark 6:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 6:43</span></span>

Full of the fragments - of the bread.

[Mark 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 6:45</span></span>

He constrained his disciples - Who did not care to go without him. [Mat
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022).

[Mark 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 6:46</span></span>

[Mat 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#023); [Joh
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015).

[Mark 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mar 6:48</span></span>

And he saw them - For the darkness could veil nothing from him. And
would have passed by them - That is, walked, as if he was passing by.

[Mark 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mar 6:52</span></span>

Their heart was hardened - And yet they were not reprobates. It means
only, they were slow and dull of apprehension.

[Mark 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mar 6:53</span></span>

[Mat 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034); [Joh
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#021).
