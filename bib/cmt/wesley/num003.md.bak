### [Numbers Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 3:1</span></span>

These - Which follow in this chapter. The generations - The kindred or
family. Moses his family and children are here included under the
general name of the Amramites, [Num
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md), which includes all the children
and grand - children of Amram, the persons only of Aaron and Moses being
excepted. And the generations of Moses are thus obscurely mentioned,
because they were but common Levites, the priesthood being given solely
to Aaron's posterity, whence Aaron is here put before Moses, who
elsewhere is commonly named after him. In Sinai - Nadab and Abihu, were
then alive, though dead at the time of taking this account.

[Numbers 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 3:4</span></span>

In the sight of Aaron - Under his inspection and direction, and as their
father's servants or ministers in the priest's office.

[Numbers 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 3:6</span></span>

Present them - Offer them to the Lord for his special service. This was
promised to them before, and now actually conferred.

[Numbers 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 3:7</span></span>

His charge - That is, Aaron's, or those things which are committed
principally to Aaron's care and oversight. Of the congregation - That
is, of all the sacrifices and services which are due to the Lord from
all the people, because the people might not perform them, in their own
persons, therefore they were to be performed by some particular persons
in their stead; formerly by the first - born, [Num
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#016.md), and now by the Levites. Before
the tabernacle - Not within the tabernacle, for the care of the things
within the holy place was appropriated to the priests, as the care of
the most holy place was to the high - priest.

[Numbers 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 3:8</span></span>

Of the children of Israel - Those things which all the children of
Israel are in their several places and stations obliged to take care of,
though not in their persons, yet by others in their stead.

[Numbers 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 3:9</span></span>

Given to him - To attend upon him and observe his orders, and ease him
of his burden.

[Numbers 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 3:10</span></span>

The stranger - That is, every one who is of another family than Aaron's;
yea, though he be a Levite. That cometh nigh - To execute any part of
the priest's office.

[Numbers 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 3:12</span></span>

The first - born - Who were God's property, [Exo
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012.md), and to whom the administration
of holy things was formerly committed, which now was taken away from
them, either because they had forfeited this privilege by joining with
the rest of their brethren in the idolatrous worship of the calf, or
because they were to be mainly concerned in the distribution and
management of the inheritances which now they were going to possess, and
therefore could not be at leisure to attend upon the service of the
sanctuary: and God would not commit it to some other persons in each
tribe, which might be an occasion of idolatry, confusion, division, and
contempt of sacred things, but to one distinct tribe, which might be
entirely devoted to that service, and particularly to the tribe of Levi;
partly out of his respect to Moses and Aaron, branches of this tribe;
partly as a recompence of their zeal for God against idolaters, and
partly because it was the smallest of the tribes, and therefore most
likely to find both employment in, and maintenance for the work.

[Numbers 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">num 3:15</span></span>

From a month old - Because at that time the first - born, in whose stead
the Levites came, were offered to God. And from that time the Levites
were consecrated to God, and were, as soon as capable, instructed in
their work. Elsewhere they are numbered from twenty - five years old,
when they were entered as novices into part of their work, [Num
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#024.md), and from thirty years old, when
they were admitted to their whole office.

[Numbers 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">num 3:25</span></span>

The tabernacle - Not the boards, which belonged to Merari, [Num
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#036.md), but the ten curtains. The tent -
The curtains of goats hair. The coverings - That is, the coverings of
rams - skins and badgers - skins.

[Numbers 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 3:26</span></span>

The cords - By which the tabernacle was fastened to the pins, and
stretched out, [Exo 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#018.md).

[Numbers 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">num 3:27</span></span>

Of Kohath - This family had many privileges above the others: of that
were Moses and Aaron, and all the priests: they had the chief place
about the tabernacle, and the care of the most holy things here, and in
the land of Canaan they had twenty three cities, which were almost as
many as both their brethren received. Yet the posterity of Moses were
not at all dignified or distinguished from other Levites. So far was he
from seeking any advantage or honour for his own family.

[Numbers 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 3:28</span></span>

Keeping - That is, appointed for that work, as soon as they were capable
of it. Of the sanctuary - That is, of the holy things contained in or
belonging to the sanctuary.

[Numbers 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 3:31</span></span>

The hanging - Which covered the most holy place, for all other hangings
belonged to the Gershonites. The service - That is, all the other
furniture belonging to it.

[Numbers 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 3:32</span></span>

Chief - Next under the high - priest; whence he is called the second
priest, [Kg2 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), and in case of the
high - priest's absence by sickness or other necessary occasions, he was
to perform his work, and he had a superiority over all the rest of the
priests and Levites. The chief of the Levites - That is, over those
three persons, who were each the chief of their several families, [Num
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#024.md), [Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md), [Num
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#034.md).

[Numbers 3:38](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 3:38</span></span>

For the charge - Either in their stead, that charge which they were
obliged to keep, if God had not committed it to those: or for their
benefit; for their preservation, as the word may be rendered.

[Numbers 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 3:39</span></span>

Two and twenty thousand - If the particular numbers mentioned [Num
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#022.md), [Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028.md), [Num
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#034.md), be put together, they make
22,300. But the odd 300 are omitted here, either according to the use of
the holy scripture, where in so great numbers small sums are commonly
neglected, or, because they were the first - born of the Levites, and
therefore belonged to God already, and so could not be given to him
again instead of the other first - born. If this number of first - born
seem small to come from 22,000 Levites, it must be considered, that only
such first - born are here named as were males, and such as continued in
their parents families, not such as had erected new families of their
own. Add to this, that God so ordered things by his wise providence for
divers weighty reasons, that this tribe should be much the least of all
the tribes, as is evident by comparing the numbers of the other tribes,
from twenty years old, Num. 1:3-49, with the number of this from a month
old; and therefore it is not strange if the number of their first - born
be less than in other tribes.

[Numbers 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 3:41</span></span>

Instead of the first - born - Such as are now alive of them, but those
which should be born of them hereafter are otherwise disposed. Of the
Levites - Not that they were to be taken from the Levites, or to be
sacrificed to God, any more than the Levites themselves were; but they
together with the Levites were to be presented before the Lord by way of
acknowledgment, that the Levites might be set apart for God's service,
and their cattle for themselves as God's ministers, and for their
support in God's work.

[Numbers 3:46](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">num 3:46</span></span>

For those that are to be redeemed - 'Tis probable, in the exchange they
began with the eldest of the first - born, and so downwards, so that
those were to be redeemed, who were the two hundred, seventy three
youngest of them.

[Numbers 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 3:47</span></span>

Five shekels - Which was the price paid for the redemption of a first -
born a month old.
