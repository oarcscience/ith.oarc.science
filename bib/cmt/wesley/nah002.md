### [Nahum Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001)

[Nahum 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 2:1</span></span>

He - The Medes or Chaldeans, that dash Nineveh in pieces. The munition -
The forts. Make thy loins strong - Strengthen thyself.

[Nahum 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 2:2</span></span>

For - Israel and Jacob were more to God, yet he punished them; much more
will he punish Nineveh. Turned - Laid low. The excellency - The wealth,
the valiant men, all that Jacob gloried in. Jacob - The two tribes.
Israel - The ten tribes. Emptied them - Quite exhausted them. Their vine
- branches - Destroyed all the fruit of the land.

[Nahum 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 2:3</span></span>

The shield - One part for the whole of the armour, and furniture. Mighty
men - Medes or Chaldeans. Red - With the blood of the slain. Torches -
Torches were always carried in them. In the day - When he shall muster
his armies. Shaken - By axes cutting them down for the war.

[Nahum 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 2:4</span></span>

In the streets - Of Nineveh, when taken. Justle - By reason of their
multitude and fury. In the broad ways - Where is most room, and yet
scarce enough for them to move. Like torches - What with sparkling fire
caused by their horses and chariots, what with the glittering of the
polished irons about them, and what with the light of flaming torches
carried in them. Like the lightnings - Both for speed, irrestibleness
and terror.

[Nahum 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">nah 2:5</span></span>

He - The king of Babylon. His worthies - Approved officers and
commanders. Stumble - Shew such forwardness, that they shall not stand
to pick their way. They - The Assyrians to defend, the Chaldeans to
assault the walls of Nineveh.

[Nahum 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">nah 2:6</span></span>

The gates - Of the city toward the river. The rivers - Of the Tigris,
upon which Nineveh stood. Dissolved - While the Chaldeans besieged
Nineveh, a mighty deluge overthrew the walls of Nineveh, by the space of
twenty furlongs, through which breach the besiegers made their entrance.
Dissolved - As if melted, it shall drop to pieces.

[Nahum 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 2:7</span></span>

Huzzab - The queen. The voice of doves - Sighing out their complaints.
Upon their breasts - Instead of musical instruments, on which they were
used to play, now they only strike their breasts.

[Nahum 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 2:8</span></span>

Like a pool - Very populous, like a pool which hath been long breeding
fish, and is full of them. Yet - Yet these multitudes shall flee
discomfited and terrified. They - The chieftains, and most valiant among
the Ninevites.

[Nahum 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 2:9</span></span>

Take - Thus the Chaldeans encourage one another in the plundering of the
city.

[Nahum 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 2:11</span></span>

Of the lions - Tyrants and bloody warriors.

[Nahum 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 2:12</span></span>

Did tear - Formerly fell upon his neighbour nations. His lionesses -
Queens, concubines, or ladies in the Assyrian court.

[Nahum 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">nah 2:13</span></span>

I will burn her - Nineveh. In the smoke - The city being first
plundered, then burnt; these chariots were burnt in that smoke. Thy prey
- Cause thee to cease from making a prey any more. Thy messengers -
Embassadors or muster - masters. Probably this refers to Rabshaketh who
had blasphemed the living God. Those are not worthy to be heard again,
that have once spoken reproachfully against God.
