### [Exodus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

The curtains were to be embroidered with cherubim, to intimate that the
angels of God pitched their tents round about the church, [Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md). As there were cherubim over the
mercy - seat, so there were round the tabernacle. There were to be two
hangings, five breadths to each, sewed together, and the two hangings
coupled together with golden clasps or tacks, so that it might be all
one tabernacle, [Exo 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md). Thus the
churches of Christ, though they are many, yet are one, being fitly
joined together in holy love and by the unity of the Spirit, so growing
into one holy temple in the Lord. This tabernacle was very strait and
narrow, but at the preaching of the gospel, the church is bid to enlarge
the place of her tent, and to stretch forth her curtains, [Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002.md).

[Exodus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md)

Badger skins - So we translate it, but it should rather seem to have
been some strong sort of leather, (but very fine) for we read of the
best sort of shoes made of it. [Eze
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010.md).

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md)

Very particular directions are here given about the boards of the
tabernacle, which were to bear up the curtains. These had tenons which
fell into the mortaises that were made for them in silver bases. The
boards were coupled together with gold rings at top and bottom, and kept
firm with bars that run through golden staples in every board. Thus
every thing in the tabernacle was very splendid, agreeable to that
infant state of the church, when such things were proper to possess the
minds of the worshippers with a reverence of the divine glory. In
allusion to this, the new Jerusalem is said to be of pure gold, [Rev
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018.md). But the builders of the gospel
church said, Silver and gold have we none; and yet the glory of their
building far exceeded that of the tabernacle.

[Exodus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 26:31</span></span>

The veils are here ordered to be made, one for a partition between the
holy place and the most holy, which not only forbad any to enter, but so
much as to look into the holiest of all. Under that dispensation divine
grace was veiled, but now we behold it with open face. The apostle tells
us, this veil, intimated that the ceremonial law could not make the
comers thereunto perfect. The way into the holiest was not made manifest
while the first tabernacle was standing; life and immortality lay
concealed till they were brought to light by the gospel, which was
therefore signified by the rending of this veil at the death of Christ.
We have now boldness to enter into the holiest in all acts of devotion
by the blood of Jesus; yet such as obliges us to a holy reverence, and a
humble sense of our distance. Another veil was for the outward door of
the tabernacle. Through this the priests went in every day to minister
in the holy - place, but not the people, [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md). This veil was all the defence the
tabernacle had against thieves and robbers, which might easily be broken
through, for it could be neither locked nor bared, and the abundance of
wealth in it, one would think, might be a temptation. But by leaving it
thus exposed, The priests and Levites would be so much the more obliged
to keep a strict watch upon it: and, God would shew his care of his
church on earth, though it be weak and defenceless, and continually
exposed. A curtain shall be (if God please to make it so) as strong a
defence, as gates of brass and bars of iron.
