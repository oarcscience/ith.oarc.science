### [Psalms Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 36:1</span></span>

No fear - When I consider the manifold transgressions of ungodly men, I
conclude within myself, that they have cast off all fear of the Divine
majesty.

[Psalms 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 36:2</span></span>

Flattereth - He deceiveth himself with vain persuasions, that God does
not mind his sins, or will not punish them. Found - Punish, as the same
phrase is used, [Num 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#023.md).

[Psalms 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 36:3</span></span>

Left off - Once he had some degrees of wisdom, but now he is become an
open apostate.

[Psalms 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 36:4</span></span>

Deviseth - Freely, from his own inclination, when none are present to
provoke him to it.

[Psalms 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 36:5</span></span>

Thy mercy - Mine enemies are cruel and perfidious, but thou art infinite
in mercy, and faithfulness. Heavens - Is infinite and incomprehensible.
Faithfulness - The truth both of thy threatenings against thine enemies,
and of thy promises made to good men. The clouds - Is far above our
reach, greater and higher than we can apprehend.

[Psalms 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 36:6</span></span>

Mountains - Stedfast and unmoveable: eminent and conspicuous to all men.
Judgments - The executions of thy counsels. Deep - Unsearchable, as the
ocean. Man - The worst of men; yea, the brute - beasts have experience
of thy care and kindness.

[Psalms 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 36:7</span></span>

Loving - kindness - Though all thine attributes be excellent, yet, above
all, thy mercy is most excellent, or precious and amiable.

[Psalms 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 36:8</span></span>

Satisfied - Who trust in thee, as he now said. Fatness - With those
delightful provisions, which thou hast prepared for them in heaven. The
river - Which denotes both their plenty, and their perpetuity.

[Psalms 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 36:9</span></span>

Life - It is in God as in a fountain, and from him is derived to us. But
- Of that glorious and blessed, and endless life, which alone is worthy
of the name. Light - In the light of thy glorious presence, which shall
be fully manifested, when we see thee face to face. Light - Joy and
comfort, and happiness: the word light is elegantly repeated in another
signification; in the former clause it is light discovering, in this
light, discovered or enjoyed.

[Psalms 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 36:11</span></span>

The foot - Of my proud and insolent enemies. Come - So as to overthrow
me.

[Psalms 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 36:12</span></span>

There - He seems as it were to point at the place, as if it were already
done.
