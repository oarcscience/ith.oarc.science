### [Deuteronomy Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 8:1</span></span>

Live - Live comfortably and happily.

[Deuteronomy 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 8:2</span></span>

All the way - All the events which befel three in the way, the
miraculous protections, deliverances, provisions, instructions which God
gave thee; and withal the frequent and severe punishments of thy
disobedience. To know - That thou mightest discover to thyself and
others that infidelity, inconstancy, hypocrisy, and perverseness, which
lay hid in thy heart; the discovery whereof was of singular use both to
them, and to the church of God in all succeeding ages. It is good for us
likewise to remember all the ways both of God's providence and grace, by
which he has led us hitherto through the wilderness, that we may trust
him, and chearfully serve him.

[Deuteronomy 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 8:3</span></span>

By every word - That is, by every or any thing which God appoints for
this end, how unlikely so - ever it may seem to be for nourishment;
seeing it is not the creature, but only God's command and blessing upon
it, that makes it sufficient for the support of life.

[Deuteronomy 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 8:5</span></span>

As a man chastiseth his son - That is, unwillingly, being constrained by
necessity; moderately, in judgment remembering mercy; and for thy
reformation not thy destruction.

[Deuteronomy 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 8:7</span></span>

Depths - Deep wells or springs, or lakes, which were numerous and large.

[Deuteronomy 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 8:9</span></span>

Whose stones are iron - Where are mines of iron in a manner as plentiful
as stones, and upon which travellers must tread, as in other parts they
do upon stones.

[Deuteronomy 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 8:10</span></span>

Bless the Lord - Solemnly praise him for thy food; which is a debt both
of gratitude and justice, because it is from his providence and favour
that thou receivest both thy food and refreshment and strength by it.
The more unworthy and absurd is that too common profaneness of them,
who, professing to believe a God, from whom all their comforts come,
grudge to own him at their meals, either by desiring his blessing before
them, or by offering due praise to God after them.

[Deuteronomy 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 8:14</span></span>

Lifted up - As if thou didst receive and enjoy these things, either, by
thy owns wisdom, and valour, and industry, or for thy own merit.

[Deuteronomy 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 8:16</span></span>

That he might humble thee - By keeping thee in a constant dependence
upon him for every day's food, and convincing thee what an impotent,
helpless creature thou art, having nothing whereon to subsist, and being
supported wholly by the alms of divine goodness from day to day. The
mercies of God, if duly considered, are as powerful a mean to humble us
as the greatest afflictions, because they increase our debts to God, and
manifest our dependance upon him, and by making God great, they make us
little in our own eyes. To do thee good - That is, that after he hath
purged and prepared thee by afflictions, thou mayest receive and enjoy
his blessings with less disadvantage, whilst by the remembrance of
former afflictions. thou art made thankful for them, and more cautious
not to abuse them.
