### [Numbers Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 10:2</span></span>

Two trumpets - For Aaron's two sons: though afterwards the number of the
trumpets was much increased, as the number of the priests also was.
These trumpets were ordained, both for signification of the great duty
of ministers, to preach the word; and for use, as here follows.

[Numbers 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 10:6</span></span>

For their journeys - As a sign for them to march forward, and
consequently for the rest to follow them.

[Numbers 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 10:9</span></span>

Ye shall be saved - If you use this ordinance of God with trust and
dependance upon God for help.

[Numbers 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 10:10</span></span>

In the days of your gladness - Days appointed for rejoicing and
thanksgiving to God for former mercies, or deliverances. Your solemn
days - Your stated festivals. For a memorial - That God may remember you
for good to accept and bless you. God then takes pleasure in our
religious exercises, when we take pleasure in them. Holy work should be
done with holy joy.

[Numbers 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 10:12</span></span>

Paran - From which they travelled to other places, and then returned
into it again, [Num 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#016.md).

[Numbers 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 10:21</span></span>

The others - The Gershonites, and Merarites, who therefore marched after
the first camp, a good distance from, and before the Kohathites, that
they might prepare the tabernacle for the reception of its utensils,
which the Kohathites brought some time after them.

[Numbers 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 10:29</span></span>

Raguel - Called also Reuel, [Exo 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018.md),
who seems to be the same with Jethro; it being usual in scripture for
one person to have two or three names. And therefore this Hobab is not
Jethro, but his son, which may seem more probable, because Jethro was
old and unfit to travel, and desirous, as may well be thought, to die in
his own country, whither he returned, [Exo
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#027.md), but Hobab was young and fitter
for these journeys, and therefore entreated by Moses to stay and bear
them company.

[Numbers 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">num 10:30</span></span>

I will not go - So he might sincerely say, though afterward he was
overcome by the persuasions of Moses.

[Numbers 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 10:31</span></span>

Thou mayest be to us instead of eyes - To direct and guide us: for
though the cloud determined them to a general place, yet many
particulars might be unknown to Moses, wherein Hobab, having long lived
in those parts, might be able to advise him, as concerning the
conveniences of water for their cattle, concerning the safety or danger
of the several parts, by reason of serpents or wild - beasts, or
enemies, in the parts adjoining to them, that so they might guard
themselves better against them. Or, this is to be understood of his
directing them not so much in their way. as about great and difficult
matters, wherein the counsel he had from God did not exclude the advice
of men, as we see in Hobab's father Jethro, [Exo
18:19-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#019.md). And it is probable, this was
the wise son of a wise father.

[Numbers 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 10:33</span></span>

Three days - With continued journeys; only it seems probable, that the
cloud made little pauses that they might have time for sleep and
necessary refreshments. The ark went before them - Altho' in their
stations it was in the middle, yet in their marches it went before them;
and the cloud was constantly over the ark whether it stood or went;
therefore the ark is said to go before and direct them, not as if the
ark could be seen of all the camps, which being carried only upon mens
shoulders was impossible; but because the cloud, which always attended
upon the ark, and did, together with the ark, constitute, in a manner,
one sign of God's presence, did lead and direct them. To search out - A
metaphorical expression, for discovering to them; for the ark could not
search, and God, who knew all places and things, needed not to search.

[Numbers 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 10:34</span></span>

By day - And by night too, as was expressed before. So we must learn to
compare places of scripture, and to supply the defects of one out of
another, as we do in all authors.

[Numbers 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 10:36</span></span>

Return - Or, give rest, that is, a safe and quiet place, free from
enemies and dangers.
