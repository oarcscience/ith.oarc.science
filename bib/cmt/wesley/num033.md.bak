### [Numbers Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 33:2</span></span>

And Moses wrote their goings out - When they set out, God ordered him to
keep a journal of all the remarkable occurrences in the way, that it
might be a satisfaction to himself and an instruction to others. It may
be of use to Christians, to preserve an account of the providences of
God concerning them, the constant series of mercies they have
experienced, and especially those turns which have made some days of
their lives more remarkable.

[Numbers 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 33:4</span></span>

On their gods - Their false gods, namely those beasts which the brutish
Egyptians worshipped as gods, which were killed with the rest, for the
first - born both of men and beasts were then killed. Probably their
images likewise were thrown down, as Dagon afterward before the ark.

[Numbers 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 33:10</span></span>

By the Red - sea - By another part of that sea which they passed over.

[Numbers 33:48](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">num 33:48</span></span>

Shittim - The place where the people sinned in the matter of Peor, is
here called Abel - Shittim - Abel signifies mourning; and probably this
place was so called, from the mourning of Israel for that sin, and the
heavy punishment inflicted on the sinners.

[Numbers 33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">num 33:52</span></span>

Drive out - Not by banishing, but by destroying them. Pictures - Which
seem to have been stones curiously engraven, and set up for worship.
High Places - Chapels, altars, groves, or other means of worship there
set up.
