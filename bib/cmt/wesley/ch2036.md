### [2 Chronicles Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 36:8</span></span>

Found in him - That crime of rebellion against the king of Babylon,
which for a time he kept in his own breast, but when he saw fit,
discovered it, and was convicted of it.

[2 Chronicles 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 36:10</span></span>

Expired - Heb. at the return of the year: at the beginning of the next
year, according to the sacred account of the Hebrews, at the spring of
the year, the time when kings go forth to battle, as is elsewhere said,
when Nebuchadnezzar, among others, went forth to settle and enlarge his
conquests. His brother - Largely so called, for this was his uncle, or
his father's brother, being the son of Josiah.

[2 Chronicles 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 36:13</span></span>

By God - Who had required him to swear fealty and constant obedience to
him by the true God, whom he called upon to be a witness against him if
he broke his oath. So his rebellion was aggravated with perjury, and
horrid contempt of God.

[2 Chronicles 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 36:15</span></span>

Rising - Sending them early and diligently, as a careful house - holder,
who rises betimes about his business. God sent them many prophets and
messages, some at the very beginning of their apostacy, and others
afterward, 'till the very day of their captivity.

[2 Chronicles 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 36:16</span></span>

No remedy - Because the people would not repent, and God would not
pardon them.

[2 Chronicles 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 36:17</span></span>

Chaldees - Abraham was called out of Ur of the Chaldees, when God took
him into covenant with himself. And now his degenerate seed are carried
into that country again, to signify that they had forfeited all that
kindness wherewith they had been loved for their father's sake, and the
benefit of the covenant into which he was called.

[2 Chronicles 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 36:21</span></span>

Sabbaths - Had rested from the labour of the husbandman in plowing and
harrowing it; the people that should have managed it being destroyed.
Many a time had they ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year,
when it should have rested: and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten
times seven years. Yet even this might encourage them to hope, that they
should in due time return to it again. Had others come and taken
possession of it, they might have despaired of ever recovering it. But
while it lay desolate, it, as it were, waited for them, and refused to
acknowledge any other owners.
