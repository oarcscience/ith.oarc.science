### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001)

[Amos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 9:1</span></span>

The altar - Of burnt - offering before the temple at Jerusalem, this
altar and temple Israel had forsaken, and set up others against it; and
here God in his jealousy appears prepared to take vengeance. Possibly it
may intimate his future departure from Judah too. There Ezekiel, [Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002), saw the slaughter - men stand.
The door - The door of the gate that led into the priests court. And cut
them - Wound deep, the people who were visionally represented as
standing in the court of the temple.

[Amos 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 9:2</span></span>

Hell - The center of the earth, or the depth of hell.

[Amos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 9:3</span></span>

The serpent - The crocodile or shark.

[Amos 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 9:4</span></span>

Set my eyes - I will perpetually watch over them.

[Amos 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 9:5</span></span>

Toucheth - He needs not take great pains therein, a touch of his finger
will do this. Shall melt - As snow before the sun.

[Amos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 9:6</span></span>

His stories - The celestial orbs one over another, as so many stories in
an high and stately palace. And he hath founded his troop in the earth:
all the creatures, which are one army, one body; so closely are they
connected, and so harmoniously do they all act for the accomplishing of
their creator's purposes. Calleth for the waters - Either in judgment to
drown, or in mercy to give rain.

[Amos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 9:7</span></span>

The Arabians - A wild, thievish, and servile nation. Have not I brought
- And whereas you boast my kindness to you, bringing you out of Egypt,
and thereupon conclude, God cannot leave you whom he hath so redeemed;
you argue amiss, for this aggravates your sin. From Kir - Conquered by
some potent enemies, and sent away to Kir, a country of Media, yet at
last delivered. Should these nations, argue themselves to be out of
danger of divine justice, because I had done this for them.

[Amos 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 9:8</span></span>

The sinful kingdom - Every sinful kingdom.

[Amos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 9:9</span></span>

The least grain - Though tumbled and tossed with the great violence, yet
the smallest, good grain, shall not be lost or destroyed.

[Amos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 9:10</span></span>

All the sinners - The great, notorious sinners. The evil - Is far off,
we shall die first, and be safe in the grave.

[Amos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 9:11</span></span>

In that day - In the set time which I have fixt. Raise up - Bring back
out of captivity, and re - establish in their own land, the house of
David, and those that adhere to his family. Fallen - By the revolt of
the ten tribes. The breaches - Which are in it by that long division.

[Amos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 9:12</span></span>

They - Literally the Jews. Possess - Both the lands of Edom, and some of
the posterity of Edom; these as servants, the other as their propriety.
The remnant - Left by Nebuchadnezzar. All the heathen - That is, round
about. That doth this - But this is also a prophecy of setting up the
kingdom of the Messiah, and bringing in the Gentiles.

[Amos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 9:13</span></span>

Behold the days come - Here is another promise literally of abundant
plenty to the returned captives, and mystically of abundant grace poured
forth in gospel - days. The plowman - Who breaks up the ground, and
prepares it for sowing, shall be ready to tread on the heels of the
reaper who shall have a harvest so large, that before he can gather it
all in, it shall be time to plow the ground again. The treader of grapes
- So great shall their vintage be that e'er the treaders of grapes can
have finished their work, the seeds - man shall be sowing his seed
against the next season. Shall drop - The vineyards shall be so
fruitful, and new wine so plentiful as if it ran down from the
mountains. Shall melt - Or, as if whole hills were melted into such
liquors. If any object, it never was so: I answer, the sins of the
returned captives prevented these blessings, which are promised under a
tacit condition.

[Amos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 9:15</span></span>

Pulled up - On condition that they seek the Lord. This was on God's part
with admirable constancy performed through six hundred years, perhaps
the longest time of freedom from captivity they ever knew.
