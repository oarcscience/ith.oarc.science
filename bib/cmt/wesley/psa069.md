### [Psalms Chapter 69](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001)

[Psalms 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 69:1</span></span>

Waters - Tribulations.

[Psalms 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 69:4</span></span>

I restored - For peace sake.

[Psalms 69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 69:5</span></span>

My sins - But O Lord, although I have been innocent to mine enemies, I
am guilty of many sins and follies against thee.

[Psalms 69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 69:6</span></span>

For my sake - Because of my sad disappointments. For if they see me
forsaken, they will be discouraged by this example.

[Psalms 69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 69:7</span></span>

For thy sake - For my obedience to thy commands, and zeal for thy glory.

[Psalms 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 69:9</span></span>

Zeal - That fervent love which I have for thy house and service, and
glory, and people. Eaten - Exhausted my spirits. Upon me - I have been
as deeply affected with thy reproaches, as with mine own. This tho'
truly belonging to David, yet was also directed by the spirit of God in
him, to represent the disposition and condition of Christ, in whom it
was more fully accomplished, to whom therefore it is applied in the New
Testament, the first part of it, [Joh
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017), and the latter, [Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003).

[Psalms 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 69:10</span></span>

Wept - For their impiety. Reproach - They derided me for it.

[Psalms 69:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 69:11</span></span>

Proverb - A proverb of reproach.

[Psalms 69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 69:12</span></span>

That sit - Vain and idle persons, that spend their time in the gates and
markets.

[Psalms 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 69:13</span></span>

In the truth - Or, According to thy saving truth, or faithfulness; grant
me that salvation, which thou hast graciously promised.

[Psalms 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 69:21</span></span>

Gall - Instead of giving me that comfort which my condition required,
they added to my afflictions. Vinegar - These things were metaphorically
fulfilled in David, but properly in Christ, the description of whose
sufferings was principally intended here by the Holy Ghost.

[Psalms 69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 69:22</span></span>

Their table - And this punishment in their table, exactly answers their
sin, in giving Christ gall for his meat, [Psa
69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021). A snare - Their table or meat,
which is set before them, shall become a snare: the occasion of their
destruction.

[Psalms 69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 69:23</span></span>

Eyes - Not the eyes of their bodies, but of their minds: as they that
shut their eyes and will not see, so they shall be judicially blinded.
To shake - To take away their strength.

[Psalms 69:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 69:26</span></span>

For - Which is an act of barbarous cruelty. Talk - Reproaching them, and
triumphing in their calamities.

[Psalms 69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 69:27</span></span>

Wilt add - Give them up to their own lusts. Not let them - Partake of
thy righteousness, or of thy mercy and goodness.

[Psalms 69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 69:28</span></span>

Living - Of eternal life.

[Psalms 69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029)

[Psalms 69:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 69:31</span></span>

This - This hearty sacrifice of praise, is more grateful to God, than
the most glorious legal sacrifices. Hath horns - That is both tender and
mature, as it is when the horns bud forth, and the hoofs grow hard.

[Psalms 69:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 69:32</span></span>

The humble - Those pious persons who are grieved for their calamities,
will heartily rejoice in my deliverance. Live - Or, be revived, which
were dejected, and in a manner dead with sorrow.

[Psalms 69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 69:33</span></span>

Prisoners - Those who are in prison or affliction for his sake.

[Psalms 69:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 69:35</span></span>

Sion - His church and people. They - His servants, as is explained in
the following verse. There - In the literal Canaan for a long time, in
the heavenly Canaan for ever.
