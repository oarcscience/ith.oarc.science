<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 41:1</span></span>

Keep silence - Attend diligently to my plea. Islands - By islands he
means countries remote from Judea, inhabited by the idolatrous Gentiles.
Renew - Strengthen themselves to maintain their cause against me; let
them unite all their strength together. Near - Unto me that we may stand
together, and plead our cause, and I will give them free liberty to say
what they can on their own behalf.

Who - Was it not my work alone? Raised - Into being and power, stirring
up his spirit, and strengthening him to the work. The man - Cyrus. The
east - Persia was directly eastward, both from Judea and from Babylon.
He was raised up by God in an eminent manner. And although these things
were yet to come; yet the prophet speaks of them as if they were already
past. And by this instance he pleads his cause against the Gentiles;
because this was an evident proof of God's almighty power, and of the
vanity of idols, which eminently appeared in the destruction of the
Babylonians, who were a people mad upon their idols. Called him - To
march after him, and under God's banner against Babylon.
