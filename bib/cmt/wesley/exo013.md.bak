### [Exodus Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 13:2</span></span>

Sanctify to me all the first - born - The parents were not to look upon
themselves as interested in their first - born, till they had first
solemnly presented them to God, and received them back from him again.
It is mine - By a special right, being by my singular favour preserved
from the common destruction.

[Exodus 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 13:5</span></span>

When the lord shall bring you into the land, thou shalt keep this
service - 'Till then they were not obliged to keep the passover, without
a particular command from God.

[Exodus 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 13:7</span></span>

There shall no leavened bread be seen in all thy quarters - Accordingly
the Jews usage was, before the feast of the passover, to cast all the
leavened bread out of their houses; either they burnt it, or buried it,
or broke it small, and threw it into the wind; they searched diligently
with lighted candles in all the corners of their houses, lest any leaven
should remain. The strictness enjoined in this matter was designed, To
make the feast the more solemn, and consequently the more taken notice
of by the children, who would ask, why is so much ado made? To teach us
how solicitous we should be to put away from us all sin.

[Exodus 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 13:9</span></span>

Upon thy hand, between thine eyes - Proverbial expressions; denoting
things which are never out of our thoughts.

[Exodus 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 13:13</span></span>

Thou shalt redeem - The price of the redemption was fixed by the law.

[Exodus 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 13:16</span></span>

For frontlets between thine eyes - As conspicuous as any thing fixt to
thy forehead, or between thine eyes.

[Exodus 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 13:18</span></span>

There were many reasons why God led them through the way of the
wilderness of the red sea. The Egyptians were to be drowned in the Red -
sea, the Israelites were to be humbled, and proved in the wilderness.
[Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002.md). God had given it to Moses
for a sign, [Exo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md), ye shall serve
God in this mountain. They had again and again told Pharaoh that they
must go three days journey into the wilderness to do sacrifice, and
therefore it was requisite they should march that way, else they had
justly been exclaimed against as dissemblers. Before they entered the
lifts with their enemies, matters must be settled between them and their
God; laws must be given, ordinances instituted, covenants sealed; and
for the doing of this it was necessary they should retire into the
solitudes of a wilderness, the only closet for such a crowd; the high
road would be no proper place for these transactions. The reason why God
did not lead them the nearest way, which would have brought them in a
few days to the land of the Philistines, was because they were not yet
fit for war, much less for war with the Philistines. Their spirits were
broke with slavery; the Philistines were formidable enemies; it was
convenient they should begin with the Amalekites, and be prepared for
the wars of Canaan, by experiencing the difficulties of the wilderness.
God is said to bring Israel out of Egypt as the eagle brings up her
young ones, [Deu 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md), teaching them
by degrees to fly. They went up harnessed - They went up by five in a
rank, so some; in five squadrons, so others. They marched like an army
with banners, which added much to strength and honour.

[Exodus 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 13:21</span></span>

And the Lord went before them in a pillar - In the two first stages, it
was enough that God directed Moses whither to march; he knew the
country, and the road; but now they are come to the edge of the
wilderness, they would have occasion for a guide, and a very good guide
they had, infinitely wise, kind, and faithful, the Lord went up before
them; The Shechinah or appearance of the divine Majesty, which was a
precious manifestation of the eternal Word, who in the fulness of time
was to be made flesh, and dwell among us. Christ was with the church in
the wilderness, [Co1 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009.md). What a
satisfaction to Moses and the pious Israelites, to be sure that they
were under a divine conduct? They need not fear missing their way who
were thus led, nor being lost who were thus directed; they need not fear
being benighted, who were thus illuminated, nor being robbed, who were
thus protected. And they who make the glory of God their end, and the
word of God their rule, the spirit of God the guide of their affections,
and the providence of God the guide of their affairs, may be confident
that the Lord goes before them, as truly is he went before Israel in the
wilderness, though not so sensibly. They had sensible effects of God's
going before them in this pillar. For, It led them the way in that vast
howling wilderness, in which there was no road, no track, no way - marks
through which they had no guides. When they marched, this pillar went
before them, at the rate that they could follow, and appointed the place
of their encampment, as infinite Wisdom saw fit; which eased them from
care, and secured them from danger, both in moving, and in resting. It
sheltered them from the heat by day, which at sometimes of the year was
extreme: And it gave them light by night when they had occasion for it.

[Exodus 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 13:22</span></span>

He took not away the pillar of the cloud, - No not when they seemed to
have less occasion for it: it never left them 'till it brought them to
the borders of Canaan. It was a cloud which the wind could not scatter.
There was something spiritual in this pillar of cloud and fire. The
children of Israel were baptized unto Moses in this cloud, [Co1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#002.md). By coming under this cloud they
signified their putting themselves under the conduct and command of
Moses. Protection draws allegiance; this cloud was the badge of God's
protection, and so became the bond of their allegiance. Thus they were
initiated, and admitted under that government, now when they were
entering upon the wilderness. And it signifies the special conduct and
protection which the church of Christ is under in this world.
