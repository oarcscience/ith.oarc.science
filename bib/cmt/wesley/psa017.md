[Psalms 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003)

Proved - Or, searched or tried it, by many temptations and afflictions.
Night - When mens minds being freed from the distraction of business,

according to their several inclinations. Tried - As gold - smiths do
metals. Nothing - Nothing of unrighteousness. Purposed - I have
resolved, upon deliberation, as the word implies. Mouth - I am so far
from practising against Saul's life, as they charge me, that I will not
wrong him so much as in a word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 17:4</span></span>

Concerning - Observing the works of the men of this age, how wicked they

By the help of thy blessed word. Paths - The customs and practices.
Destroyer - Or, of the violent man: such as Saul, and his courtiers and
soldiers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 17:11</span></span>

Steps - In all our ways. We go from place to place, to rocks, and caves,
and woods; but wheresoever we go they are at hand, and ready to surround
us. Eyes - They keep their eyes fixed upon us. Bowing - Couching down
upon the earth, that they may watch the fittest opportunity to surprize
us.

[Psalms 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 17:13</span></span>

Sword - Thy instrument to execute vengeance upon thine enemies. Do not
punish me with this rod: let me fall into thy hands, and not into the
hands of men.

upon this world, and neither have, nor desire any other portion. Belly -

I will - I do not place my portion in earthly treasures, but in
beholding God's face, in the enjoyment of God's presence and favour;
which is enjoyed in part in this life, but not fully. Satisfied - The
time is coming, wherein I shall be abundantly satisfied with beholding
thy face. Awake - When I arise from he dead. Likeness - With the image
of God stamped upon my glorified soul.
