### [John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)

[John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 4:1</span></span>

The Lord knew - Though none informed him of it.

[John 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 4:3</span></span>

He left Judea - To shun the effects of their resentment.

[John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 4:4</span></span>

And he must needs go through Samaria - The road lying directly through
it.

[John 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 4:5</span></span>

Sychar - Formerly called Sichem or Shechem. Jacob gave - On his death
bed, [Gen 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md).

[John 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 4:6</span></span>

Jesus sat down - Weary as he was. It was the sixth hour - Noon; the heat
of the day.

[John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 4:7</span></span>

Give me to drink - In this one conversation he brought her to that
knowledge which the apostles were so long in attaining.

[John 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 4:8</span></span>

For his disciples were gone - Else he needed not have asked her.

[John 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 4:9</span></span>

How dost thou - Her open simplicity appears from her very first words.
The Jews have no dealings - None by way of friendship. They would
receive no kind of favour from them.

[John 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 4:10</span></span>

If thou hadst known the gift - The living water; and who it is - He who
alone is able to give it: thou wouldst have asked of him - On those
words the stress lies. Water - In like manner he draws the allegory from
bread, [Joh 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md), and from light, [Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); the first, the most simple,
necessary, common, and salutary things in nature. Living water - The
Spirit and its fruits. But she might the more easily mistake his
meaning, because living water was a common phrase among the Jews for
spring water.

[John 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 4:12</span></span>

Our father Jacob - So they fancied he was; whereas they were, in truth,
a mixture of many nations, placed there by the king of Assyria, in the
room of the Israelites whom he had carried away captive, [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md). Who gave us the well - In
Joseph their supposed forefather: and drank thereof - So even he had no
better water than this.

[John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 4:14</span></span>

Will never thirst - Will never (provided he continue to drink thereof)
be miserable, dissatisfied, without refreshment. If ever that thirst
returns, it will be the fault of the man, not the water. But the water
that I shall give him - The spirit of faith working by love, shall
become in him - An inward living principle, a fountain - Not barely a
well, which is soon exhausted, springing up into everlasting life -
Which is a confluence, or rather an ocean of streams arising from this
fountain.

[John 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 4:15</span></span>

That I thirst not - She takes him still in a gross sense.

[John 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 4:16</span></span>

Jesus saith to her - He now clears the way that he might give her a
better kind of water than she asked for. Go, call thy husband - He
strikes directly at her bosom sin.

[John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 4:17</span></span>

Thou hast well said - We may observe in all our Lord's discourses the
utmost weightiness, and yet the utmost courtesy.

[John 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 4:18</span></span>

Thou hast had five husbands - Whether they were all dead or not, her own
conscience now awakened would tell her.

[John 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 4:19</span></span>

Sir, I perceive - So soon was her heart touched.

[John 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 4:20</span></span>

The instant she perceived this, she proposes what she thought the most
important of all questions. This mountain - Pointing to Mount Gerizim.
Sanballat, by the permission of Alexander the Great, had built a temple
upon Mount Gerizim, for Manasseh, who for marrying Sanballat's daughter
had been expelled from the priesthood and from Jerusalem, [Neh
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#028.md). This was the place where the
Samaritans used to worship in opposition to Jerusalem. And it was so
near Sychar, that a man's voice might be heard from the one to the
other. Our fathers worshipped - This plainly refers to Abraham and Jacob
(from whom the Samaritans pretended to deduce their genealogy) who
erected altars in this place: [Gen
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md), and [Gen
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md), [Gen
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#020.md). And possibly to the whole
congregation, who were directed when they came into the land of Canaan
to put the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, [Deu
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029.md). Ye Jews say, In Jerusalem is
the place - Namely, the temple.

[John 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 4:21</span></span>

Believe me - Our Lord uses this expression in this manner but once; and
that to a Samaritan. To his own people, the Jews, his usual language is,
I say unto you. The hour cometh when ye - Both Samaritans and Jews,
shall worship neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem - As preferable
to any other place. True worship shall be no longer confined to any one
place or nation.

[John 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 4:22</span></span>

Ye worship ye know not what - Ye Samaritans are ignorant, not only of
the place, but of the very object of worship. Indeed, they feared the
Lord after a fashion; but at the same time served their own gods, [Kg2
17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033.md). Salvation is from the Jews - So
spake all the prophets, that the Saviour should arise out of the Jewish
nation: and that from thence the knowledge of him should spread to all
nations under heaven.

[John 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 4:23</span></span>

The true worshippers shall worship the Father - Not here or there only,
but at all times and in all places.

[John 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 4:24</span></span>

God is a Spirit - Not only remote from the body, and all the properties
of it, but likewise full of all spiritual perfections, power, wisdom,
love, holiness. And our worship should be suitable to his nature. We
should worship him with the truly spiritual worship of faith, love, and
holiness, animating all our tempers, thoughts, words, and actions.

[John 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 4:25</span></span>

The woman saith - With joy for what she had already learned, and desire
of fuller instruction.

[John 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 4:26</span></span>

Jesus saith - Hasting to satisfy her desire before his disciples came. l
am He - Our Lord did not speak this so plainly to the Jews who were so
full of the Messiah's temporal kingdom. If he had, many would doubtless
have taken up arms in his favour, and others have accused him to the
Roman governor. Yet he did in effect declare the thing, though he denied
the particular title. For in a multitude of places he represented
himself, both as the Son of man, and as the Son of God: both which
expressions were generally understood by the Jews as peculiarly
applicable to the Messiah.

[John 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 4:27</span></span>

His disciples marvelled that he talked with a woman - Which the Jewish
rabbis reckoned scandalous for a man of distinction to do. They
marvelled likewise at his talking with a woman of that nation, which was
so peculiarly hateful to the Jews. Yet none said - To the woman, What
seekest thou? - Or to Christ, Why talkest thou with her?

[John 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 4:28</span></span>

The woman left her water pot - Forgetting smaller things.

[John 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 4:29</span></span>

A man who told me all things that ever I did - Our Lord had told her but
a few things. But his words awakened her conscience, which soon told her
all the rest. Is not this the Christ? - She does not doubt of it
herself, but incites them to make the inquiry.

[John 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 4:31</span></span>

In the meantime - Before the people came.

[John 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 4:34</span></span>

My meat - That which satisfies the strongest appetite of my soul.

[John 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 4:35</span></span>

The fields are white already - As if he had said, The spiritual harvest
is ripe already. The Samaritans, ripe for the Gospel, covered the ground
round about them.

[John 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 4:36</span></span>

He that reapeth - Whoever saves souls, receiveth wages - A peculiar
blessing to himself, and gathereth fruit - Many souls: that he that
soweth - Christ the great sower of the seed, and he that reapeth may
rejoice together - In heaven.

[John 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 4:37</span></span>

That saying - A common proverb; One soweth - The prophets and Christ;
another reapeth - The apostles and succeeding ministers.

[John 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 4:38</span></span>

I - he Lord of the whole harvest, have sent you - He had employed them
already in baptizing, [Joh 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#002.md).

[John 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 4:42</span></span>

We know that this is the Saviour of the world - And not of the Jews
only.

[John 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 4:43</span></span>

He went into Galilee - That is, into the country of Galilee: but not to
Nazareth. It was at that town only that he had no honour. Therefore he
went to other towns.

[John 4:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 4:44</span></span>

[Mat 13:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#057.md).

[John 4:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 4:47</span></span>

To come down - For Cana stood much higher than Capernaum.

[John 4:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 4:48</span></span>

Unless ye see signs and wonders - Although the Samaritans believed
without them.

[John 4:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 4:52</span></span>

He asked the hour when he amended - The more exactly the works of God
are considered, the more faith is increased.
