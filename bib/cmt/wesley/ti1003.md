### [1 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 3:1</span></span>

He desireth a good work - An excellent, but laborious, employment.

[1 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 3:2</span></span>

Therefore - That he may be capable of it. A bishop - Or pastor of a
congregation. Must be blameless - Without fault or just suspicion. The
husband of one wife - This neither means that a bishop must be married,
nor that he may not marry a second wife; which it is just as lawful for
him to do as to marry a first, and may in some cases be his bounden
duty. But whereas polygamy and divorce on slight occasions were common
both among the Jews and heathens, it teaches us that ministers, of all
others, ought to stand clear of those sins. Vigilant, prudent - Lively
and zealous, yet calm and wise. Of good behaviour - Naturally flowing
from that vigilance and prudence.

[1 Timothy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 3:4</span></span>

Having his children in subjection with all seriousness - For levity
undermines all domestic authority; and this direction, by a parity of
reason, belongs to all parents.

[1 Timothy 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 3:6</span></span>

Lest being puffed up - With this new honour, or with the applause which
frequently follows it. He fall into the condemnation of the devil - The
same into which the devil fell.

[1 Timothy 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 3:7</span></span>

He ought also to have a good report - To have had a fair character in
time past. From them that are without - That are not Christians. Lest he
fall into reproach - By their rehearsing his former life, which might
discourage and prove a snare to him.

[1 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 3:8</span></span>

Likewise the deacons must he serious - Men of a grave, decent, venerable
behaviour. But where are presbyters? Were this order essentially
distinct from that of bishops, could the apostle have passed it over in
silence? Not desirous of filthy gain - With what abhorrence does he
everywhere speak of this! All that is gained (above food and raiment) by
ministering in holy things is filthy gain indeed; far more filthy than
what is honestly gained by raking kennels, or emptying common sewers.

[1 Timothy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 3:9</span></span>

Holding fast the faith in a pure conscience - Steadfast in faith, holy
in heart and life.

[1 Timothy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 3:10</span></span>

Let these he proved first - Let a trial be made how they believe. Then
let them minister - Let them be fixed in that office.

[1 Timothy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 3:11</span></span>

Faithful in all things - Both to God, their husbands, and the poor.

[1 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 3:13</span></span>

They purchase a good degree - Or step, toward some higher office. And
much boldness - From the testimony of a good conscience.

[1 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 3:15</span></span>

That thou mayest know how to behave - This is the scope of the epistle.
In the house of God - Who is the master of the family. Which is - As if
he had said, By the house of God, I mean the church.

[1 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 3:16</span></span>

The mystery of godliness - Afterwards specified in six articles, which
sum up the whole economy of Christ upon earth. Is the pillar and ground
- The foundation and support of all the truth taught in his church. God
was manifest in the flesh - In the form of a servant, the fashion of a
man, for three and thirty years. Justified by the Spirit - Publicly
"declared to be the Son of God," by his resurrection from the dead. Seen
- Chiefly after his resurrection. By angels - Both good and bad.
Preached among the gentiles - This elegantly follows. The angels were
the least, the gentiles the farthest, removed from him; and the
foundation both of this preaching and of their faith was laid before his
assumption. Was believed on in the world - Opposed to heaven, into which
he was taken up. The first point is, He was manifested in the flesh; the
last, He was taken up into glory.
