### [Deuteronomy Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 24:1</span></span>

Some uncleanness - Some hateful thing, some distemper of body or quality
of mind not observed before marriage: or some light carriage, as this
phrase commonly signifies, but not amounting to adultery. Let him write
- This is not a command as some of the Jews understood it, nor an
allowance and approbation, but merely a permission of that practice for
prevention of greater mischiefs, and this only until the time of
reformation, till the coming of the Messiah when things were to return
to their first institution and purest condition.

[Deuteronomy 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 24:4</span></span>

May not - This is the punishment of his levity and injustice in putting
her away without sufficient cause, which by this offer he now
acknowledgeth. Defiled - Not absolutely, as if her second marriage were
a sin, but with respect to her first husband, to whom she is as a
defiled or unclean woman, that is, forbidden things; forbidden are
accounted and called unclean, [Jdg
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007.md), because they may no more be
touched or used than an unclean thing. Thou shalt not cause the land to
sin - Thou shalt not suffer such lightness to be practised, lest the
people be polluted, and the land defiled and accursed by that means.

[Deuteronomy 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 24:5</span></span>

Business - Any publick office or employment, which may cause an absence
from or neglect of his wife. One year - That their affections may be
firmly settled, so as there may be no occasions for the divorces last
mentioned.

[Deuteronomy 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 24:6</span></span>

Mill - stone - Used in their hand - mills. Under this, he understands
all other things necessary to get a livelihood, the taking away whereof
is against the laws both of charity and prudence, seeing by those things
alone he can be enabled both to subsist and to pay his debts. Life - His
livelihood, the necessary support of his life.

[Deuteronomy 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 24:10</span></span>

Thou shalt not go in - To prevent both the poor man's reproach by having
his wants exposed, and the creditor's greediness which might be
occasioned by the sight of something which he desired, and the debtor
could not spare.

[Deuteronomy 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 24:11</span></span>

The pledge - He shall chuse what pledge he pleases, provided it be
sufficient for the purpose.

[Deuteronomy 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 24:12</span></span>

Thou shalt not sleep - But restore it before night, which intimates that
he should take no such thing for pledge, without which a man cannot
sleep.

[Deuteronomy 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 24:13</span></span>

Bless thee - Bring down the blessing of God upon thee by his prayers:
for though his prayers, if he be not a good man, shall not avail for his
own behalf, yet they shall avail for thy benefit. It shall be right -
Esteemed and accepted by God as a work of righteousness, or mercy.

[Deuteronomy 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 24:15</span></span>

At this day - At the time appointed, weekly or daily.

[Deuteronomy 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 24:16</span></span>

Not put to death - If the one be free from the guilt of the others sin,
except in those cases where the sovereign Lord of life and death, before
whom none is innocent, hath commanded it, as Deu. 13:1-18; [Jos
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024.md). For though God do visit the
father's sins upon the children, [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md), yet he will not suffer men to do
so.

[Deuteronomy 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 24:17</span></span>

Raiment - Not such as she hath daily and necessary use of, as being
poor. But this concerns not rich persons, nor superfluous raiment.
