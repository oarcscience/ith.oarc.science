### [Leviticus Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)

[Leviticus 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 7:7</span></span>

So is - In the matter following, for in other things they differed. The
priests shall have it - That part of it, which was by God allowed to the
priest.

[Leviticus 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 7:9</span></span>

All the meal - offering - Except the part reserved by God, [Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002), [Lev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#009). Because these were ready drest
and hot, and to be presently eaten; shall be the priests - The priest,
who offered it, was in reason to expect, something more than his
brethren who laboured not about it; and that he had only in this
offering; for the others were equally distributed.

[Leviticus 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 7:10</span></span>

Dry - Without oil, or drink - offering, as those [Lev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011), [Num
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#015). All the sons of Aaron - These
were to be equally divided among all the priests. And there was manifest
reason for this difference, because these were in greater quantity than
the former; and being raw, might more easily be reserved for the several
priests to dress it in that way which each of them liked.

[Leviticus 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 7:13</span></span>

Leavened bread - Because this was a sacrifice of another kind than those
in which leaven was forbidden, this being a sacrifice of thanksgiving
for God's blessings, among which leavened bread was one. Leaven indeed
was universally forbidden, [Lev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011).
But that prohibition concerned only things offered and burnt upon the
altar, which this bread was not.

[Leviticus 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 7:14</span></span>

Of it - That is, of the offering, one of each part of the whole: it
being most agreeable to the rules laid down before and afterward, that
the priest should have a share in the unleavened cakes and wafers, as
well as in the leavened bread.

[Leviticus 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 7:16</span></span>

A vow - Offered in performance of a vow, the man having desired some
special favour from God, and vowed the sacrifice to God if he would
grant it. On the morrow also - Which was not allowed for the thank -
offering.

[Leviticus 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 7:18</span></span>

Neither shall it be imputed - For an acceptable service to God.

[Leviticus 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 7:19</span></span>

And the flesh - Namely of the holy offering, of which he is here
treating; and therefore the general word is to be so limited; for other
flesh one might eat in this case. That toucheth - After its oblation;
which might easily happen, as it was conveyed from the altar to the
place where it was eaten: for it was not eaten in the holy place, as
appears, because it was eaten by the priests, together with the
offerers, who might not come thither. The flesh - That is, the other
flesh; that which shall not be polluted by any unclean touch. All that
are clean - Whether priests or offerers, or guests invited to the feast.

[Leviticus 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 7:20</span></span>

That eateth - Knowingly; for if it were done ignorantly, a sacrifice was
accepted for it. Not being cleansed from his uncleanness according to
the appointment, [Lev 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#024), &c. This
verse speaks of uncleanness from an internal cause, as by an issue, &c.
for what was from an external cause is spoken of in the next verse.

[Leviticus 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 7:21</span></span>

Of man - Or, of women, for the word signifies both.

[Leviticus 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 7:23</span></span>

The general prohibition of eating fat, [Lev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev003.htm#017), is here explained of those kind
of creatures which were sacrificed. The fat of others they might eat.

[Leviticus 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 7:24</span></span>

He speaks still of the same kinds of beasts, and shews that this
prohibition reaches not only to the fat of those beasts which were
offered to God, but also of those that died, or were killed at home. And
if this seems a superfluous prohibition, since the lean as well as the
fat of such beasts were forbidden, [Lev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#008), it must be noted, that
prohibition reached only to the priests, [Lev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#004).

[Leviticus 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 7:29</span></span>

Shall bring - Not by another, but by himself, that is, those parts of
the peace - offering, which are in a special manner offered to God. His
oblation unto the Lord - That is, to the tabernacle, where the Lord was
present in a special manner. Though part of such offerings might be
eaten in any clean place, [Lev 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014),
yet not till they had been killed, and part of them offered to the Lord
in the place appointed by him for that purpose.

[Leviticus 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 7:30</span></span>

His own hands - After the beast was killed, and the parts of it divided,
the priest was to put the parts mentioned into the hands of the offerer.
Offerings made by fire - So called, not strictly, as burnt - offerings
are, because some parts of these were left for the priest, but more
largely, because even these peace - offerings were in part, tho' not
wholly, burnt. Waved - To and fro, by his hands, which were supported
and directed by the hands of the priest.

[Leviticus 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 7:31</span></span>

His sons - The portion of every succeeding high - priest and his family.

[Leviticus 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 7:34</span></span>

The wave - breast and heave - shoulder - The breast or heart is the seat
of wisdom, and the shoulder of strength for action; and these two may
denote that wisdom, and power, which were in Christ our high - priest,
and which ought to be in every priest.

[Leviticus 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 7:35</span></span>

Of the anointing of Aaron - That is, of the priesthood; the sign put for
the thing signified; and the anointing by a like figure is put for the
part of the sacrifices belonging to the priest by virtue of his
anointing. This was their portion appointed them by God in that day, and
therefore to be given to them in after ages.

[Leviticus 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 7:37</span></span>

Of the consecrations - That is, of the sacrifice offered at the
consecration of the priests.
