<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001">Psalms 72:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 72:1</A></FONT></span></p>Judgments - He saith judgments in the plural number, because though the office of judging and ruling was but one, yet there were divers parts and branches, of it; in all which he begs that Solomon may be directed to do as God would have him to do. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002">Psalms 72:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 72:2</A></FONT></span></p>Thy afflicted ones - For such are thine in a special manner, thou art their judge and patron. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003">Psalms 72:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">psa 72:3</A></FONT></span></p>The mountains - Which are so dangerous to passengers, in regard of robbers and wild beasts. Hereby it is implied, that other places should do so too, and that it should be common and universal. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004">Psalms 72:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">psa 72:4</A></FONT></span></p>Judge - Vindicate them from their oppressors. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005">Psalms 72:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 72:5</A></FONT></span></p>Thee - Thee, O God, this shall be another blessed fruit of this righteous government, that together with peace, true religion shall be established, and that throughout all generations, which was begun in Solomon's days, but not fully accomplished 'till Christ came. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006">Psalms 72:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">psa 72:6</A></FONT></span></p>He shall come - Christ did come down from heaven, and brought or sent down from heaven his doctrine, (which is often compared to rain) and the sweet and powerful influences of his spirit. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008">Psalms 72:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 72:8</A></FONT></span></p>Dominion - From one sea to another, or in all the parts of the habitable world. This was accomplished in Christ, and in him only. The river - Euphrates: which was the eastern border of the kingdom of Canaan, allotted by God, but enjoyed only by David, Solomon, and Christ. Of whose kingdom this may be mentioned, as one of the borders; because the kingdom of Christ is described under the shadow of Solomon's kingdom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010">Psalms 72:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">psa 72:10</A></FONT></span></p>The sea - Of remote countries, to which they used to go from Canaan by sea; which are frequently called isles in scripture; the kings that rule by sea or by land. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011">Psalms 72:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">psa 72:11</A></FONT></span></p>All nations - Which cannot be said of Solomon with any truth or colour, but was unquestionably verified in Christ, 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#014">Psalms 72:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 72:14</A></FONT></span></p>Deceit and violence - The two ways whereby the lives of men are usually destroyed. Precious - He will not be prodigal of the lives of his subjects, but like a true father of his people, will tenderly preserve them, and severely avenge their blood upon those who shall shed it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#015">Psalms 72:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">psa 72:15</A></FONT></span></p>Live - Long and prosperous, as Solomon: yea, eternally as Christ. Gold - This was done to Solomon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015">Kg1 10:15</A>, and to Christ, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011">Mat 2:11</A>. But such expressions as these being used of Christ and his kingdom, are commonly understood in a spiritual sense. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016">Psalms 72:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 72:16</A></FONT></span></p>A handful - This intimates the small beginnings of his kingdom; and therefore does not agree to Solomon, whose kingdom was in a manner as large at the beginning of his reign, as at the end, but it exactly agrees to Christ. The earth - Sown in the earth. Mountains - In the most barren grounds. Shake - It shall yield such abundance of corn, that the ears being thick and high, shall, when they are shaken with the wind, make a noise not unlike that which the tops of the trees of Lebanon, sometimes make. Of the city - The citizens of Jerusalem, which are here put for the subjects of this kingdom. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020">Psalms 72:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 72:20</A></FONT></span></p>The prayer - This psalm is the last which David composed: for this was wrote but a little before his death.
