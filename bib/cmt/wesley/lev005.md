### [Leviticus Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 5:1</span></span>

And hear - And for that is, as that particle is often used. For this
declares in particular what the sin was. Or, namely, that of cursing, or
blasphemy, or execration, as the word commonly signifies, and that
either against one's neighbour, or against God. This may seem to be
principally intended here, because the crime spoken of is of so high a
nature, that he who heard it, was obliged to reveal it, and prosecute
the guilty. He hath seen - Been present when it was said. Or known - By
sufficient information from others. His iniquity - That is, the
punishment of it; so that word is oft used, as [Gen
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015.md), [Num
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#001.md).

[Leviticus 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 5:2</span></span>

If it be hidden from him - If he do it unawares, yet that would not
excuse him, because he should have been more circumspect to avoid all
unclean things. Hereby God designed to awaken men to watchfulness
against, and repentance for, their unknown, or unobserved sins. He shall
be clean - Not morally, for the conscience was not directly polluted by
these things, but ceremonially.

[Leviticus 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 5:3</span></span>

When he knoweth - As soon as he knoweth it, he must not delay to make
his peace with God. Otherwise he shall be guilty - For his violation and
contempt of God's authority and command.

[Leviticus 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 5:4</span></span>

If a soul swear - Rashly, without consideration either of God's law, or
his own power or right, as David did, [Sa1
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#022.md). To do evil - To himself, to
punish himself either in his body, or estate, or something else which is
dear to him. Or rather to his neighbour. And it be hid from him - That
is, he did not know, or not consider, that what he swore to do, was or
would be impossible, or unlawful: When he discovers it to be so, either
by his own consideration, or by information from others, whether it was
good or evil which he swore to do.

[Leviticus 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 5:5</span></span>

In one of these things - In one of the three forementioned cases, either
by sinful silence, or by an unclean touch, or by rash swearing. He shall
confess - Before the Lord in the place of public worship. And this
confession is not to be restrained to the present case, but by a parity
of reason, and comparing of other scriptures, to be extended to other
sacrifices for sin, to which this was a constant companion.

[Leviticus 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 5:6</span></span>

His trespass - offering - But how comes confession and a sacrifice to be
necessary for him that touched an unclean thing, when such persons were
cleansed with simple washing, as appears from [Lev
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#025.md), [Lev
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#028.md), [Lev
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#032.md), [Lev
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#040.md), [Lev
11:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#043.md), and [Num
19:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#007.md), [Num
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#010.md), [Num
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#019.md)? This place speaks of him that
being so unclean did come into the tabernacle, as may be gathered by
comparing this place with [Num 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013.md),
which if any man did, knowing himself to be unclean, which was the case
there, he was to be cut off for it; and if he did it ignorantly, which
is the case here, he was upon discovery of it to offer this sacrifice.

[Leviticus 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 5:7</span></span>

Not able - Through poverty. And this exception was allowed also in other
sin - offerings. For a sin - offering - Which was for that particular
sin, and therefore offered first: before the burnt - offering, which was
for sins in general; to teach us not to rest in general confessions and
repentance, but distinctly and particularly, as far as we can, to search
out, and confess, and loath, and leave our particular sins, without
which God will not accept our other religious services.

[Leviticus 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 5:9</span></span>

It is a sin - offering - This is added as the reason why its blood was
so sprinkled and spilt.

[Leviticus 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 5:10</span></span>

According to the manner - Or order appointed by God. The priest shall
make an atonement - Either declaratively, he shall pronounce him to be
pardoned; or typically, with respect to Christ.

[Leviticus 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 5:11</span></span>

The tenth part of an ephah - About six pints. He shall put no oil,
neither frankincense - Either to distinguish these from the meal -
offerings, [Lev 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md), or as a fit
expression of their sorrow for their sins, in the sense whereof they
were to abstain from things pleasant; or to signify that by his sins he
deserved to be utterly deprived both of the oil of gladness, the gifts,
graces and comforts of the Holy Ghost; and of God's gracious acceptance
of his prayers and sacrifices, which is signified by incense, [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 5:13</span></span>

As a meal offering - As it was in the meal - offering, where all, except
one handful, fell to the share of the priests. And this is the rather
mentioned here, because in the foregoing sacrifices, [Lev
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md), &c. [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), &c. the priest had no part
reserved for him.

[Leviticus 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 5:15</span></span>

A trespass - Against the Lord and his priests. Through ignorance - For
if a man did it knowingly, he was to be cut off, [Num
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#030.md). In the holy things - In things
consecrated to God, and to holy uses; such as tithes and first - fruits,
or any things due, or devoted to God, which possibly a man might either
with - hold, or employ to some common use. A ram - A more chargeable
sacrifice than the former, as the sin of sacrilege was greater. With thy
estimation - As thou shalt esteem or rate it, thou, O priest; and at
present, thou, O Moses, for he as yet performed the priest's part. And
this was an additional charge and punishment to him; besides the ram, he
was to pay for the holy thing which he had with - held or abused, so
many shekels of silver as the priest should esteem proportionable to it.

[Leviticus 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 5:17</span></span>

The former law concerns the alienation of holy things from sacred to
common use; this may concern other miscarriages about holy things, and
holy duties, as may be gathered from [Lev
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#019.md), where this is said to be a
trespass against the Lord, not in a general sense, for so every sin was;
but in a proper and peculiar sense.
