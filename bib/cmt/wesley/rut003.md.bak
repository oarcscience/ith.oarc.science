Perform, &c. - Take thee to wife, to raise up seed to his brother.

wanton, blesseth her as a father, encourages her as a friend, promises
her as a kinsman, rewards her as a patron, and sends her away laden with
hopes and gifts, no less chast, but more happy than she came. O
admirable temperance, worthy the progenitor of him, in whose lips and
heart there was no guile!"

she had said, Art thou in very deed my daughter? I can hardly believe
it. How camest thou hither in this manner, and thus early?
