### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 21:3</span></span>

The Lord forbid - For God had expressly, and for divers weighty reasons
forbidden the alienation of lands from the tribes and families to which
they were allotted. And although these might have been alienated 'till
the jubilee, yet he durst not sell it to the king for that time; because
he supposed, if once it came into the king's hand, neither he, nor his
posterity, could ever recover it; and so he should both offend God, and
wrong his posterity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 21:7</span></span>

Dost thou govern - Art thou fit to be king, that hast not courage to use
thy power.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 21:9</span></span>

A fast - To remove all suspicion of evil design in Ahab, and to beget a
good opinion of him amongst his people, as if he were grown zealous for
God's honour, and careful of his people's welfare, and therefore
desirous to enquire into all those sins which provoked God against them.
On high - On a scaffold, or high - place, where malefactors were usually
placed, that they might be seen, and heard by all the people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 21:10</span></span>

Blaspheme God and the king - Indeed his blaspheming God would only be
the forfeiture of his life, not his estate. Therefore he is charged with
treason also, that his estate may be confiscated, and so Ahab have his
vineyard.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 21:13</span></span>

Stoned him - And it seems his sons too, either with him or after him.
For God afterward says, ([Kg2 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#026).md) I
have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons. Let us commit
the keeping of our lives and comforts to God; for innocence itself will
not always be our security.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 21:19</span></span>

Saying - Thou hast murdered an innocent man; and instead of repenting
for it, hast added another piece of injustice and violence to it, and
art going confidently and chearfully to reap the fruit of thy
wickedness. Thy blood - The threatening was so directed at first; but
afterwards, upon his humiliation, the punishment was transferred from
him to his son, as is expressed, [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md), yet upon Ahab's returning to
sin, in the next chapter, he brings back the curse upon himself, and so
it is no wonder if it be in some sort fulfilled in him also.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 21:20</span></span>

Hast thou found - Dost thou pursue me from place to place? Wilt thou
never let me rest? Art thou come after me hither with thy unwelcome
messages? Thou art always disturbing, threatening, and opposing me. I
have - The hand of God hath found and overtaken thee. Sold thyself -
Thou hast wholly resigned up thyself to be the bondslave of the devil,
as a man that sells himself to another is totally in his master's power.
To work evil, &c. - Impudently and contemptuously. Those who give
themselves up to sin will certainly be found out, sooner or later, to
their unspeakable amazement.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 21:23</span></span>

By the wall - Or, in the portion, as it is explained [Kg2
9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 21:24</span></span>

Him that dieth, &c. - Punishments after death are here most insisted on.
And these, tho' lighting on the body only, yet undoubtedly were designed
as figures of the soul's misery in an after state.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 21:25</span></span>

Was none - None among all the kings of Israel which had been before him.
Whom Jezebel - This is added to shew, that temptations to sin are no
excuse to the sinner.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 21:27</span></span>

Softly - Slowly and silently, after the manner of mourners, or those who
are under a great consternation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 21:29</span></span>

Humbleth himself - His humiliation was real, though not lasting, and
accordingly pleasing to God. This discovers the great goodness of God,
and his readiness to shew mercy. It teaches us to take notice of that
which is good, even in the worst of men. It gives a reason why wicked
persons often prosper: God rewards what little good is in them. And it
encourages true penitents. If even Ahab goes to his house reprieved,
doubtless they shall go to their houses justified.
