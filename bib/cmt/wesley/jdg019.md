### [Judges Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

[Judges 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 19:1</span></span>

A. concubine - Heb. a wife, a concubine, that is, such a concubine as
was also his wife: called a concubine, only because she was not endowed.
Perhaps he had nothing to endow her with, being himself only a
sojourner.

[Judges 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 19:2</span></span>

Against him - That is, against her faith given to him. Went away -
Either for fear of punishment; or, because her heart was alienated from
him; wherein not only she sinned, but her father by connivance at her
sin, and neglect of just endeavours for her reconciliation to her
husband.

[Judges 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#003.md)

Friendly - To offer her pardon and reconciliation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 19:12</span></span>

A stranger - That is, of a strange nation: which the Canaanites possess;
for though the city Jerusalem had been taken by Caleb, [Jdg
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md), yet the strong fort of Zion was
still in their hands, whence it is likely they did much molest, and
afterwards by God's permission, drive out the Israelites who dwelt
there.

[Judges 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 19:15</span></span>

To lodge - Though they were soft and effeminate in other respects, yet
they were hard - hearted to strangers, and at that time there were no
public - houses in that country.

[Judges 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 19:16</span></span>

Ephraim - Whence also the Levite was, which enclined him to shew the
more kindness to his country - man. Benjamites - This was indeed one of
the cities belonging to the priests; but the cities which were given to
the priests, and whereof they were owners, were not inhabited by the
priests or Levites only, especially at this time when they were but few
in number, but by many other persons of different professions.

[Judges 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 19:18</span></span>

House of the Lord - Which was in Shiloh. Thither he went, either because
he lived there, for that was in the tribe of Ephraim; or, rather,
because he would there offer prayers and praises, and sacrifices to God,
for his mercy in reconciling him and his wife.

[Judges 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 19:20</span></span>

Let all, &c. - It matters not whether thou wantest nothing or
everything, I will take care to supply all thy wants.

[Judges 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 19:21</span></span>

Washed - As they used to do to travellers in those hot countries.

[Judges 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 19:22</span></span>

Merry - That is, refreshing themselves with the provisions set before
them. Sons of belial - Children of the devil, wicked and licentious men.

[Judges 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#023.md)

Into my house - And therefore I am obliged to protect him by the laws of
hospitality.

[Judges 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 19:26</span></span>

Fell down - Namely, dead; killed partly with grief of heart, and partly
with excessive abuse. Thus the sin she formerly chose, [Jdg
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#002.md), is now her destruction; and
though her husband pardoned her, God would punish her, at least as to
this life.

[Judges 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 19:29</span></span>

Sent - By several messengers, with a relation of the fact.

[Judges 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 19:30</span></span>

Speak - Let us meet together, and seriously consider, and every one
freely speak what is to be done in this case.
