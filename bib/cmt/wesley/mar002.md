[Mark 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 2:1</span></span>

And again - After having been in desert places for some time, he
returned privately to the city. In the house - In Peter's house.

[Mark 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 2:2</span></span>

And immediately many were gathered together - Hitherto continued the
general impression on their hearts. Hitherto, even at Capernaum, all who
heard received the word with joy.

[Mark 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 2:3</span></span>

[Mat 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#002); [Luk
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#018).

[Mark 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 2:4</span></span>

They uncovered the roof - Or, took up the covering, the lattice or trap
door, which was on all their houses, (being flat roofed.) And finding it
not wide enough, broke the passage wider, to let down the couch.

[Mark 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 2:6</span></span>

But certain of the scribes - See whence the first offence cometh! As yet
not one of the plain unlettered people were offended. They all rejoiced
in the light, till these men of learning came, to put darkness for
light, and light for darkness. Wo to all such blind guides! Good had it
been for these if they had never been born. O God, let me never offend
one of thy simple ones! Sooner let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth!

[Mark 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 2:12</span></span>

They were all amazed - Even the scribes themselves for a time.

[Mark 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 2:13</span></span>

All the multitude came to him - Namely, by the sea side. And he as
readily taught them there as if they had been in a synagogue.

5:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027).

[Mark 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 2:15</span></span>

Many publicans and notorious sinners sat with Jesus - Some of them
doubtless invited by Matthew, moved with compassion for his old
companions in sin. But the next words, For there were many, and they
followed him, seem to imply, that the greater part, encouraged by his
gracious words and the tenderness of his behaviour, and impatient to
hear more, stayed for no invitation, but pressed in after him, and kept
as close to him as they could.

[Mark 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 2:16</span></span>

And the scribes and Pharisees said - So now the wise men being joined by
the saints of the world, went a little farther in raising prejudices
against our Lord. In his answer he uses as yet no harshness, but only
calm, dispassionate reasoning.

[Mark 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 2:17</span></span>

I came not to call the righteous - Therefore if these were righteous I
should not call them. But now, they are the very persons I came to save.

[Mark 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 2:18</span></span>

[Mat 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#014); [Luk
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#033).

[Mark 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 2:23</span></span>

[Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001); [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001).

[Mark 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 2:26</span></span>

In the days of Abiathar the high priest - Abimelech, the father of
Abiathar, was high priest then; Abiathar himself not till some time
after. This phrase therefore only means, In the time of Abiathar, who
was afterward the high priest. [Sa1
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006).

[Mark 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 2:27</span></span>

The Sabbath was made for man - And therefore must give way to man's
necessity.

[Mark 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 2:28</span></span>

Moreover the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath - Being the supreme
Lawgiver, he hath power to dispense with his own laws; and with this in
particular.
