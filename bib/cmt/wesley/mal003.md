[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

I - The Messiah. My messenger - John the Baptist. The Lord - The
Messiah. Whom ye seek - Whom ye, who truly fear God, long and wait for.
Suddenly come - After the coming of his fore - runner. To his temple -
That which was the second temple at Jerusalem, lately built by
Zerubbabel and Joshua. The messenger - The angel of the covenant, the
Messiah, in whose blood the covenant between God and man was confirmed.
Whom ye delight in - You Jews, among whom, few there are, who do not
please themselves to think of his coming, tho' from various motives.

[Malachi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 3:2</span></span>

Abide - Who shall be able to stand under the weight of those crosses
which in that day, will fall on all sorts of men? The day - This day was
from his preaching, 'till the utter destruction of Jerusalem, about
seventy years after the birth of Christ. A refiner's fire - Some are
like metals, which nothing but a fierce fire can purge, such fire shall
the troubles of these days be. Fuller's soap - As boiling waters, into
which, spotted cloaths are thrown, and as the rubbing of them with soap;
so that day will prove to all, a day of great trial, to purge and
refine.

[Malachi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 3:3</span></span>

He shall fit - As resolved to attend his work and finish it. He shall
purify - The effect of this fiery trial, shall be the thorough cleansing
of the persons that are to pass through it. Sons of Levi - Either the
Jewish Levites, or all Christians, who are made priests unto God. In
righteousness - That they may offer themselves, their souls and bodies
to God, in righteousness and true holiness.

[Malachi 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 3:4</span></span>

Pleasant - Well pleasing to him.

[Malachi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 3:5</span></span>

I will come near - You have spoken as if you thought I was far off, but
you shall see I am near. To you - O Jews, not those very persons Malachi
preached to, but those who were living when the Messiah came.

[Malachi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 3:6</span></span>

I change not - I have an unchangeable hatred to sin: and my long
suffering also changeth not, therefore you are not consumed in your
sins. Not consumed - God is the same in his wisdom to order the rewards
of good and bad in the fittest season, therefore neither the one nor the
other are consumed, but preserved to the season appointed of God.

dealings one with another.

Cursed with a curse - Are greatly cursed.

[Malachi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 3:10</span></span>

Bring ye - Make a punctual and full payment of all tithes; about this
did Nehemiah contend with the rulers, and made them comply, and then all
Judah obeyed and did the like, [Neh
13:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010). To the store - house - This
was one or more large rooms, built on purpose for this use. That there
may be meat - For the priests and Levites to live upon. Prove me - Make
the experiment. The windows of heaven - A kind of proverbial speech, to
express great abundance. A blessing - First of rain to water the earth,
next a blessing of corn, wine and oil, and all other products of the
earth.

[Malachi 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 3:11</span></span>

The devourer - All kind of devourers, the locusts, the canker - worm,
and the caterpillar, which though they are in incredible multitudes, yet
a rebuke from God will check them all at once, as if they were but one.
For your sakes - For your good. Your vine - Your vine shall carry their
fruit 'till they are fully ripe.

[Malachi 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mal 3:12</span></span>

All nations - All that are about you. A delightsome land - The revival

all good men.

God and his law, are the flourishing ones. Delivered - Escape all
punishment.

Then - When contempt of God was grown so high. That feared the Lord -
Those that were truly religious. Spake often - Conversed together the
more frequently. And a book - All this is spoken after the manner of
men. For them - On their behalf.

[Malachi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mal 3:17</span></span>

Make up my jewels - This shall be fully made good in the last great day,
and in heaven to eternal ages. I will spare them - In the mean time they
shall be spared, pitied, preserved, and loved.

[Malachi 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mal 3:18</span></span>
