### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 7:1</span></span>

Sat - That is, was settled in the house which Hiram's men had built for
him, then he reflected upon the unsettled state of the ark.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 7:2</span></span>

Curtains - That is, in a tent or tabernacle, [Sa2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md), composed of several curtains.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 7:3</span></span>

Nathan said - Pursue thy intentions, and build an house for the ark. The
design being pious and the thing not forbidden by God, Nathan hastily
approves it, before he had consulted God about it, as both he and David
ought to have done in a matter of so great moment. And therefore Nathan
meets with this rebuke, that he is forced to acknowledge his error, and
recant it. For the holy prophets did not speak all things by prophetic
inspiration, but some things by an human spirit.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 7:4</span></span>

The word of the Lord came - Because David's mistake was pious, and from
an honest mind, God would not suffer him to lie long in it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 7:5</span></span>

Shalt thou - That is, thou shalt not.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 7:6</span></span>

Tent and tabernacle - These two seem thus to be distinguished, the one
may note the curtains and hangings within, the other the frame of
boards, and coverings upon it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 7:8</span></span>

My servant - Lest David should be too much discouraged, or judge himself
neglected of God, as one thought unworthy of so great an honour, God
here gives him the honourable title of his servant, thereby signifying
that he accepted of his service, and good intentions.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 7:10</span></span>

Appoint - That is, I will make room for them, whereas hitherto they have
been much distressed by their enemies. Or, I will establish a place for
them, that is, I will establish them in their place or land. My people -
Among the favours which God had vouchsafed, and would vouchsafe to
David, he reckons his blessings to Israel, because they were great
blessings to David; partly, because the strength and happiness of a king
consists in the multitude and happiness of his people; and partly,
because David was a man of a public spirit, and therefore no less
affected with Israel's felicity than with his own. Before time - Namely
in Egypt.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 7:11</span></span>

And as since - Nor as they did under the judges. But all this is to be
understood with a condition, except they should notoriously forsake God.
And have caused thee - That is, and as until this time in which I have
given thee rest. But these words, though according to our translation
they be enclosed in the same parenthesis with the foregoing clauses, may
be better put without it, and taken by themselves. For the foregoing
words in this verse, and in [Sa2 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#010.md),
all concern the people of Israel; but these words concern David alone,
to whom the speechs returns after a short digression concerning the
people of Israel. And they may be rendered thus. And I will cause thee
to rest, &c. - More fully and perfectly than yet thou dost. He will, &c.
- For thy good intentions to make him an house, he will make thee an
house, a sure house, that is, he will increase and uphold thy posterity,
and continue thy kingdom in thy family.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 7:12</span></span>

And when, &c. - When the time of thy life shall expire. This phrase
implies, that his days shall be prolonged to the usual course of nature,
and not cut off in the midst, by any violent or untimely death. I will
set - I will set up in thy throne, thy posterity, first Solomon, and
then others successively, and at last the Messiah. So the following
words may be understood, part of his posterity in general, part of
Solomon, and part of Christ only, according to the different nature of
the several passages.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 7:13</span></span>

He shall - This is meant literally of Solomon, who alone did build the
material house or temple; but ultimately of Christ, who is the builder
of God's spiritual house or temple. For my name - That is, for my
service, and glory. For ever - This is not meant of Solomon, for his
kingdom was not for ever. But it is to be understood of David's
posterity, in general, and with special respect to Christ, in whose
person the kingdom was to be lodged for ever.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 7:14</span></span>

His father - I will carry myself towards him as a father, with all
affection, and I will own him as my son. This is intended both of
Solomon, as a type of Christ; and of Christ himself as is evident from
[Heb 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md). If he commit - This agrees
only to Solomon and some others of David's posterity; but not to Christ,
who never committed iniquity, as Solomon did, who therein was no type of
Christ, and therefore this branch is terminated in Solomon; whereas in
those things wherein Solomon was a type of Christ, the sense passes
through Solomon to Christ. Rod of men - With such rods as are gentle and
moderate, and suited to man's weakness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 7:15</span></span>

My mercy - That is, Or, my kindness, that is, the kingdom which I have
mercifully promised to thee and thine. From Saul - In regard of his
posterity, for the kingdom was continued to his person during life.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 7:16</span></span>

Before thee - Thine eyes in some sort beholding it: for he lived to see
his wise son Solomon actually placed in the throne, with reputation and
general applause, which was in itself a good presage of the continuance
of the kingdom in his family: and being considered, together with the
infallible certainty of God's promise to him and his, (of the
accomplishment whereof, this was an earnest,) gave him good assurance
thereof; especially considering that he had his eyes and thoughts upon
the Messiah, [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), &c. whose day
he saw by faith, as Abraham did, [Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md), and whom he knew that God would
raise out of the fruit of his loins to sit on his throne, and that for
ever: and so the eternity of his kingdom is rightly said to be before
him.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 7:18</span></span>

In - Into the tabernacle. Sat - He might sit for a season whilst he was
meditating upon these things, and then alter his posture and betake
himself to prayer. Who am I, &c. - How infinitely unworthy am I and my
family of this great honour and happiness!

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 7:19</span></span>

This - Which thou hast already done for me, that thou hast brought me
hitherto, to that pitch of honour, and peace, and prosperity, in which
through thy favour I now stand. Was small - Though it was more than I
deserved, or could expect, yet thou didst not think it enough for thee
to give to me. A great while - For many future ages, and indeed to all
eternity. Is this, &c. - Do men use to deal so kindly with their
inferiors, as thou hast done with me? No: this is the prerogative of
divine grace.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 7:20</span></span>

David say - Either in a way of gratitude and praise, words cannot
express my obligations to thee, nor my sense of these obligations: Or in
a way of prayer. What can I ask of thee more than thou hast freely done?
Thou knowest - Thou knowest my deep sense of thy favours, and my
obligations to thee. And my condition and necessities, what I do or may
need hereafter; and as thou knowest this, so I doubt not thou wilt
supply me.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 7:21</span></span>

Thy word's sake - That thou mightest fulfil thy promises made to me, and
thereby demonstrate thy faithfulness. Own heart - Or thy own mere
liberality and good pleasure, without any desert of mine. So far was
David, though a very gracious man, from thinking his actions
meritorious.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 7:22</span></span>

Great - Both in power and in goodness, as appears by the great and good
things which thou hast done for me.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 7:24</span></span>

Confirmed - Partly, by thy promises, and that sure covenant which thou
hast made with them: and partly, by thy glorious works wrought on their
behalf, as it appears this day. Their God - In a peculiar manner, and by
special relation and covenant: for otherwise he is the God and father of
all things.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 7:26</span></span>

Let thy name - That is, do thou never cease to manifest thyself to be
the God and governor of Israel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 7:27</span></span>

This prayer, &c. - That prayer that is found in the tongue only will not
please God. It must be found in the heart. That must be lifted up and
poured out before God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 7:28</span></span>

That God - That God who hast declared thyself to be Israel's God, and in
particular my God.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 7:29</span></span>

Continue forever, &c. - When Christ for ever sat down on the right -
hand of God, and received all possible assurance, that his seed and
throne should be as the days of heaven, then this prayer was abundantly
answered.
