### [Judges Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

[Judges 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 1:1</span></span>

After the death - Not long after it; for Othniel, the first judge, lived
in Joshua's time. Asked the Lord - Being assembled together at Shiloh,
they enquired of the high - priest by the Urim and the Thummim. Against
the Canaanites first - Finding their people multiply exceedingly, and
consequently the necessity of enlarging their quarters, they renew the
war. They do not enquire who shall be captain general to all the tribes;
but what tribe shall first undertake the expedition, that by their
success the other tribes may be encouraged to make the like attempt upon
the Canaanites in their several lots.

[Judges 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 1:2</span></span>

Judah - The tribe of Judah is chosen for the first enterprise, because
they were both most populous, and so most needing enlargement; and
withal most valiant, and therefore most likely to succeed: for God
chooseth fit means for the work which he designs. Moreover the
Canaanites were numerous and strong in those parts, and therefore to be
suppressed, before they grew too strong for them.

[Judges 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 1:3</span></span>

To Simeon - As nearest to him both by relation, being his brother by
both parents, and by habitation. The Canaanites - Specially so called,
because they are distinguished from the Perizzites, [Jdg
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#004).

[Judges 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 1:4</span></span>

In Bezek - Not in the city, for that was not yet taken, [Jdg
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#005), but in the territory of it.

[Judges 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 1:5</span></span>

Adoni - bezek - The lord or king of Bezek; as his name signifies. In
Bezek - Whither he fled when he lost the field. Against him - That is,
against the city wherein he had encamped himself, and the rest of his
army.

[Judges 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 1:6</span></span>

Great toes - And this they did, either by the direction of God, or upon
notice of his former tyranny and cruelty.

[Judges 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 1:7</span></span>

Threescore and ten - Which is not strange in those times and places. For
it is well known, that anciently each ruler of a city, or great town,
was called a king, and had kingly power in that place; and many such
kings we meet with in Canaan: and it is probable, that some years
before, kings were more numerous there, 'till the greater devoured many
of the less. Under my table - An act of barbarous inhumanity thus to
insult over the miserable, joined with abominable luxury.

[Judges 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 1:8</span></span>

And took - Yet some of the inhabitants retired into the castle, and held
out there 'till David's time.

[Judges 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 1:10</span></span>

Judah went - Under the conduct of Caleb, as is recorded, [Jos
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014), &c., for that relation, and
this, are doubtless one and the same expedition, and it is mentioned
there by anticipation.

[Judges 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 1:16</span></span>

Moses's father - in - law - That is, of Jethro, so called from the
people whom he descended, [Num
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021). And, whatsoever he did, it
is evident, that his posterity came into Canaan with the Israelites, and
were there seated with them, see [Jdg
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011), [Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017), [Jdg
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024); [Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006); 1Ch. 2:1-55. City of palm -
trees - That is, from Jericho, so called, [Deu
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#003), not the city which was
destroyed, but the territory belonging to it, where it seems they were
seated, in a most pleasant, and fruitful, and safe place, according to
the promise made by Moses to their father, [Num
10:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029), and whence they might
remove, either to avoid the neighboring Canaanites; or out of love to
the children of Judah. South of Arad - In the southern part of the land
of Canaan, where Arad was, [Num 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).
They went - That is some of them, for others of them dwelt in a contrary
quarter, in the most northern part of the land. Among the people - Heb.
that people, namely, those children of Judah that lived there.

[Judges 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 1:17</span></span>

Judah went with Simeon - According to his promise, [Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003), and the laws of justice and
gratitude. Hormah - Either, The same place so called, [Num
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#003), and so what was there vowed, is
here executed: or, Some other place called by the same name upon the
like occasion, which was frequent among the Hebrews. This seems more
probable.

[Judges 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 1:18</span></span>

Judah took - It is only said, they took the cities, and probably
contented themselves with making them tributary; but it is not said that
they slew the people, as they ought to have done; and as it is said of
the other cities here. And the people being thus spared, did by God's
just judgment recover their strength, and expel the Jews out of their
cities. It is farther observable, that Ekron here taken, was one of
Dan's cities, [Jos 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#043), and it was
taken here by Judah and Simeon, partly out of love for their brother
Dan, and partly to secure their new conquests, and other adjoining
territories, from such potent neighbours.

[Judges 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 1:19</span></span>

Could not drive - Because of their unbelief, whereby they distrusted
God's power to destroy those who had chariots of iron, and so gave way
to their own fear and sloth, whereby God was provoked to withdraw his
helping hand.

[Judges 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 1:22</span></span>

House of Joseph - That is, the tribe of Ephraim.

[Judges 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 1:24</span></span>

The entrance - On which side it is weakest, that we might best invade
and take it.

[Judges 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 1:25</span></span>

His family - Together with his estate, as the following verse manifests.

[Judges 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 1:26</span></span>

The Hittites - Where the Hittites seated themselves after they were
driven out of Canaan, which seems to be northward from Canaan, and near
upon it.

[Judges 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 1:27</span></span>

Manasseh - That is, that half of this tribe which dwelt in Canaan.

[Judges 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 1:29</span></span>

In Gezer - Which they possessed 'till Solomon's time, [Kg1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016).

[Judges 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 1:34</span></span>

The valley - That is, into the plain country; which was the occasion of
that expedition for the getting new quarters, of which we read [Jos
19:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047) and Jdg. 18:1-31.

[Judges 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 1:35</span></span>

House of Joseph - That is, of the Ephraimites, who helped their brethren
the Danites against the Amorites.

[Judges 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 1:36</span></span>

Akrabbim - Which was in the southern part of Canaan, [Jos
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002), from whence it went up towards
the north. This is added to shew the great power and large extent of
this people.
