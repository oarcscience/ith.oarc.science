### [Luke Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md)

[Luke 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 11:1</span></span>

Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples - The Jewish
masters used to give their followers some short form of prayer, as a
peculiar badge of their relation to them. This it is probable John the
Baptist had done. And in this sense it seems to be that the disciples
now asked Jesus, to teach them to pray. Accordingly he here repeats that
form, which he had before given them in his sermon on the mount, and
likewise enlarges on the same head, though still speaking the same
things in substance. And this prayer uttered from the heart, and in its
true and full meaning, is indeed the badge of a real Christian: for is
not he such whose first and most ardent desire is the glory of God, and
the happiness of man by the coming of his kingdom? Who asks for no more
of this world than his daily bread, longing meantime for the bread that
came down from heaven? And whose only desires for himself are
forgiveness of sins, (as he heartily forgives others,) and
sanctification.

[Luke 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 11:2</span></span>

When ye pray, say - And what he said to them is undoubtedly said to us
also. We are therefore here directed, not only to imitate this in all
our prayers, but to use this very form of prayer. [Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md).

[Luke 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 11:4</span></span>

Forgive us; for we forgive them - Not once, but continually. This does
not denote the meritorious cause of our pardon; but the removal of that
hinderance which otherwise would render it impossible.

[Luke 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 11:5</span></span>

At midnight - The most unseasonable time: but no time is unseasonable
with God, either for hearing or answering prayer.

[Luke 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 11:9</span></span>

[Mat 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md).

[Luke 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 11:13</span></span>

How much more shall your heavenly Father - How beautiful is the
gradation! A friend: a father: God! Give the Holy Spirit - The best of
gifts, and that which includes every good gift.

[Luke 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 11:14</span></span>

It was dumb - That is, it made the man so. [Mat
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md).

[Luke 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 11:15</span></span>

But some said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub - These he answers,
[Luk 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#017.md). Others, to try whether it
were so or no, sought a sign from heaven. These he reproves in [Luk
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029.md) and following verses. Beelzebub
signifies the lord of flies, a title which the heathens gave to Jupiter,
whom they accounted the chief of their gods, and yet supposed him to be
employed in driving away flies from their temple and sacrifices. The
Philistines worshipped a deity under this name, as the god of Ekron:
from hence the Jews took the name, and applied it to the chief of the
devils. [Mar 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md).

[Luke 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 11:16</span></span>

[Mat 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md).

[Luke 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 11:17</span></span>

A house - That is, a family.

[Luke 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 11:20</span></span>

If I cast out devils by the finger of God - That is, by a power
manifestly Divine. Perhaps the expression intimates farther, that it was
done without any labour: then the kingdom of God is come upon you -
Unawares, unexpected: so the Greek word implies.

[Luke 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 11:21</span></span>

The strong one armed - The devil, strong in himself, and armed with the
pride, obstinacy, and security of him in whom he dwells.

[Luke 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 11:26</span></span>

The last state of that man becometh worse than the first - Whoever reads
the sad account Josephus gives of the temple and conduct of the Jews,
after the ascension of Christ and before their final destruction by the
Romans, must acknowledge that no emblem could have been more proper to
describe them. Their characters were the vilest that can be conceived,
and they pressed on to their own ruin, as if they had been possessed by
legions of devils, and wrought up to the last degree of madness. But
this also is fulfilled in all who totally and finally apostatize from
true faith.

[Luke 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 11:27</span></span>

Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked!
- How natural was the thought for a woman! And how gently does our Lord
reprove her!

[Luke 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 11:28</span></span>

Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it - For
if even she that bare him had not done this, she would have forfeited
all her blessedness.

[Luke 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 11:29</span></span>

It seeketh - The original word implies seeking more, or over and above
what one has already.

[Luke 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 11:32</span></span>

They repented at the preaching of Jonah - But it was only for a season.
Afterward they relapsed into wickedness, till (after about forty years)
they were destroyed. It is remarkable, that in this also the comparison
held. God reprieved the Jews for about forty years; but they still
advanced in wickedness, till having filled up their measure, they were
destroyed with an utter destruction.

[Luke 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 11:33</span></span>

The meaning is, God gives you this Gospel light, that you may repent.
Let your eye be singly fixed on him, aim only at pleasing God; and while
you do this, your whole soul will be full of wisdom, holiness, and
happiness. [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); [Mar
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021.md); [Luk
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016.md).

[Luke 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 11:34</span></span>

But when thine eye is evil - When thou aimest at any thing else, thou
wilt be full of folly, sin, and misery. On the contrary, [Mat
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022.md).

[Luke 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 11:36</span></span>

If thy whole body be full of light - If thou art filled with holy
wisdom, having no part dark, giving way to no sin or folly, then that
heavenly principle will, like the clear flame of a lamp in a room that
was dark before, shed its light into all thy powers and faculties.

[Luke 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 11:39</span></span>

Now ye Pharisees - Probably many of them were present at the Pharisee's
house. [Mat 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md).

[Luke 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 11:41</span></span>

Give what is in them - The vessels which ye clean, in alms, and all
things are clean to you. As if he had said, By acts directly contrary to
rapine and wickedness, show that your hearts are cleansed, and these
outward washings are needless.

[Luke 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 11:42</span></span>

Wo to you - That is, miserable are you. In the same manner is the phrase
to be understood throughout the chapter.

[Luke 11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 11:44</span></span>

For ye are as graves which appear not - Probably in speaking this our
Lord fixed his eyes on the scribes. As graves which appear not, being
overgrown with grass, so that men are not aware, till they stumble upon
them, and either hurt themselves, or at least are defiled by touching
them. On another occasion Christ compared them to whited sepulchres,
fair without, but foul within; [Mat
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md).

[Luke 11:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 11:45</span></span>

One of the lawyers - That is scribes; expounders of the law.

[Luke 11:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 11:48</span></span>

Whom they killed, ye build their sepulchres - Just like them pretending
great reverence for the ancient prophets, while ye destroy those whom
God sends to yourselves. Ye therefore bear witness by this deep
hypocrisy that ye are of the very same spirit with them.

[Luke 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 11:49</span></span>

The wisdom of God, agreeably to this, hath said - In many places of
Scripture, though not in these very words, I will send them prophets -
Chiefly under the Old Testament: and apostles - Under the New. [Mat
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md).

[Luke 11:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 11:50</span></span>

The blood of all shall be required of this generation - That is, shall
be visibly and terribly punished upon it.

[Luke 11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 11:51</span></span>

And so it was within forty years, in a most astonishing manner, by the
dreadful destruction of the temple, the city, and the whole nation.
Between the temple and the altar - In the court of the temple.

[Luke 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 11:52</span></span>

Ye have taken away the key of knowledge - Ye have obscured and destroyed
the knowledge of the Messiah, which is the key of both the present and
the future kingdom of heaven; the kingdom of grace and glory. Ye have
not entered in - Into the present kingdom of heaven.
