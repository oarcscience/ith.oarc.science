### [Ezekiel Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 40:1</span></span>

Of our captivity - Of those that were carried away into captivity with
Jeconiah eleven years before Jerusalem was burnt. And this falls in with
the three thousand three hundred and seventy fourth year of the world,
about five hundred and seventy four years before Christ's incarnation.
The beginning - In the month Nisan. The tenth day - The day that the
paschal lamb was to be taken up in order to the feast on the tenth day.
Brought me - To Jerusalem, the place where it did stand.

[Ezekiel 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 40:2</span></span>

In the visions of God - By this it appears it was not a corporeal
transportation of the prophet. The frame - The portrait of a city. On
the south - On the south of the mountain, where the prophet was set.

[Ezekiel 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 40:3</span></span>

A man - The same no doubt that appeared to the prophet, [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md), whose name is the branch, and
who builds the temple, [Zac 6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md),
whose colour was like burnished brass; [Rev
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md), which speaks glory and strength.
A line - A plumb - line, a mason's line to discover the rectitude of the
building, or its defects. In the gate - In the north gate, next toward
the east.

[Ezekiel 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 40:5</span></span>

A wall - This was that outmost wall, that compassed the whole mount
Sion, upon whose top the temple stood. The man's hand - Christ, hath,
and keeps the reed in his own hand, as the only fit person to take the
measures of all. A measuring reed - Or cane, for this measuring rod was
of those canes growing in that country, long, and light, which
architects made use of. Six cubits long - Each cubit consisting of
eighteen inches in our common account. An hand breadth - Added to each
six cubits. The breadth - The thickness of the walls, which were one
reed, and one hand's breadth, or three yards, and three inches thick.
Height - And the height equal, taking the measure from the floor on the
inside of the wall.

[Ezekiel 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 40:6</span></span>

The east - Either of one of the inner walls, or of the temple itself.
Went up - 'Till he was got up, he could not measure the threshold, which
was at the top of the stairs, and these were ten, if the measurer be
supposed in the gate of the house; or eight, if in the gate of the court
of the priests; or seven, if in the court of Israel; and each stair was
half a cubit in height, too high for him to take the measure of the
threshold, if he did not go up the stairs. The threshold - It is
probable he measured the lower threshold first, as next at hand. The
other threshold - The upper threshold, or lintel of the gate, which was
of equal dimensions with the lower, three yards and three inches broad,
or thick.

[Ezekiel 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 40:7</span></span>

Chamber - Along the wall of the porch were chambers, three on one side,
and three on the other, each one reed square. Five cubits - A space of
two yards and one half between each chamber, either filled with some
neat posts or pillars, or it may be quite void. Within - The inward and
outward threshold, were of the same measures, and curiously arched over
head from side to side, and end to end, which was from east to west.

[Ezekiel 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 40:8</span></span>

The porch - The posts which were joined together at the top by an arch,
and so made the portico.

[Ezekiel 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 40:9</span></span>

The porch - Probably another porch, or another gate distinct from that,
[Eze 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006.md). The posts - These were half
columns, that from the floor to the height of the wall jetted out, as if
one half of the column were in the wall, and the other without, and the
protuberance of this half column, was one cubit.

[Ezekiel 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 40:10</span></span>

Chambers - These chambers were for the priests and Levites to lodge in
during their ministration.

[Ezekiel 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 40:11</span></span>

Of the entry - It is meant of the whole length of the entry, or walk
through the porch, to which they ascended by stairs of a semicircular
form.

[Ezekiel 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 40:12</span></span>

The space - The rails, which were set up at a cubit distance from the
front of these little chambers, on the outside for convenient placing of
benches for the priests to sit on. The space - Between the rails, and
the chambers.

[Ezekiel 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 40:13</span></span>

From the roof - From the extremity of one little chamber on the north
side of the gate, to the extremity of the opposite chamber on the south
side, and so one cubit and half for the back wall of one chamber, and as
much for the back wall of the other chamber, with the length of the
chambers, six cubits each, and ten for the breadth of the gate, amounts
to twenty five cubits. Door against door - It seems the doors of the
chambers were two in each chamber in the east and west parts, and so
exactly set, that the doors being all open you had a clear prospect
through all the chambers to the temple.

[Ezekiel 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 40:14</span></span>

He made - Measured, and thereby shewed what kind of posts they should
be. Threescore cubits - Probably this refers to the height of this gate
built up two stories above the arch, and the posts in their height are
only mentioned, but imply all the rest of the building over the east
gate. Unto the post - These high columns, on the inner front of this
gate were so disposed, that the last on each side was very near the
first post, or pillar of the court on either side of the gate, and so
the posts and buildings laid on those posts joined on each side of this
gate.

[Ezekiel 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 40:15</span></span>

And - This verse seems to sum up all the dimensions; this gate, its
porch, and thickness of its walls, and so sum the cubits, six in the
thickness of the outer wall, eighteen in the three chambers, twenty in
the spaces between the chambers, and six cubits in the thickness in the
inner wall of the porch.

[Ezekiel 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 40:16</span></span>

Narrow windows - Windows narrowed inward to the middle. Their posts -
The upper lintel of each door over which was a window. To the arches -
Windows under the arches between post and post, to give light to the
five cubits space between chamber and chamber. Round about - These were
on both sides of the porch within the gate, exactly alike.

[Ezekiel 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 40:17</span></span>

The outward court - So called in regard of the more inward court,
between that where he was, and the temple itself; this court, was the
second about the temple. Chambers - Not only lodging rooms for the
priests, but also store - houses for tithes and offerings. A pavement -
A beautiful floor laid with checker works. The whole floor of this court
was thus paved. Thirty chambers - That is, fifteen on the south side of
the gate, and fifteen on the north side, built over the pavement.

[Ezekiel 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 40:18</span></span>

The pavement - That mentioned, [Eze
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md). By the side - That part which
lay on each side of the gate, and from thence spread itself toward the
chambers, leaving a space of pavement of equal breadth with the porch,
or gate in the middle. The length - The length was measured fifty
cubits. The inner pavement - The side pavement was laid somewhat lower
than this middle pavement, not only for state, but for the more
convenient, keeping it clean; so the middle pavement rose with a little
convex surface.

[Ezekiel 40:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 40:19</span></span>

The breadth - Of the whole ground between the inner front of one gate
and porch, to the outer front of the next gate more inward to the
temple. The lower gate - Called so in respect to the next gate, which
was on the higher ground. The forefront - To the outside front of the
gate of the priests court, which was next to this gate now measured,
that is from the west front of the lower to the east front of the upper
gate. The inner court - This court from the west front of the lower
gate, was one hundred cubits in length to the east front of the gate of
the inner court. East - ward and north - ward - And so was the space
from the south front of the court to the north front. So the court was
exactly square. Divers courts are here spoken of, which may put us in
mind, of the diversity of gifts, graces and offices in the church: as
also of the several degrees of glory in the courts and mansions of
heaven.

[Ezekiel 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 40:22</span></span>

Before them - Within the steps or gate.

[Ezekiel 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 40:23</span></span>

Toward the east - The east gate of the inner court was directly over
against the east gate of the outer court, and equally distant from each
other.

[Ezekiel 40:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 40:26</span></span>

To it - The floor, or square court.

[Ezekiel 40:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 40:28</span></span>

Brought me - From the south - gate of the outer court through the porch,
and over the hundred cubit pavement, to the south - gate of the inner
court.

[Ezekiel 40:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 40:32</span></span>

The inner court - The court of the priests, which was next to the
temple.

[Ezekiel 40:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">eze 40:43</span></span>

Within - Within the porch, where these tables stood. Hooks - Hooks on
which the slaughtered sacrifice might be hanged, while they prepared it
farther. Fastened - To walls no doubt, near these tables.

[Ezekiel 40:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">eze 40:45</span></span>

The keepers - While, according to their courses, they had the charge of
the house of God, and attended on the service of it.

[Ezekiel 40:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 40:46</span></span>

The keepers - To preserve the fire perpetually on the altar.

[Ezekiel 40:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 40:48</span></span>

The breadth - The whole breadth was eleven cubits, but the breadth of
each leaf of this folding - gate was three cubits, and they met, or shut
on an upright post, set in the middle of the gate space, and this was
one cubit broad. And each leaf hung on posts two cubits thick, which
amount to eleven cubits.
