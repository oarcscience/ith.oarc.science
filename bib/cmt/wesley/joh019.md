### [John Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001)

[John 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 19:1</span></span>

[Mat 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026); [Mar
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#015).

[John 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 19:7</span></span>

By our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God -
Which they understood in the highest sense, and therefore accounted
blasphemy.

[John 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 19:8</span></span>

He was the more afraid - He seems to have been afraid before of shedding
innocent blood.

[John 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 19:9</span></span>

Whence art thou? - That is, whose son art thou?

[John 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 19:11</span></span>

Thou couldst have no power over me - For I have done nothing to expose
me to the power of any magistrate. Therefore he that delivered me to
thee, namely, Caiaphas, knowing this, is more blamable than thou.

[John 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 19:13</span></span>

Pilate sat down on the judgment seat - Which was then without the
palace, in a place called, in Greek, the pavement, on account of a
beautiful piece of Mosaic work, with which the floor was adorned: but in
Hebrew, Gabbatha - Or the high place, because it stood on an eminence,
so that the judge sitting on his throne might be seen and heard by a
considerable number of people.

[John 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 19:14</span></span>

It was the preparation of the passover - For this reason both the Jews
and Pilate were desirous to bring the matter to a conclusion. Every
Friday was called the preparation, (namely, for the Sabbath.) And as
often as the passover fell on a Friday, that day was called the
preparation of the passover.

[John 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 19:17</span></span>

Bearing his cross - Not the whole cross, (for that was too large and
heavy,) but the transverse beam of it, to which his hands were afterward
fastened. This they used to make the person to be executed carry. [Mat
27:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#031); [Mar
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#020); [Luk
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026).

[John 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 19:19</span></span>

Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews - Undoubtedly these were the
very words, although the other evangelists do not express them at large.

[John 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 19:20</span></span>

It was written in Latin - For the majesty of the Roman empire; in Hebrew
- Because it was the language of the nation; and in Greek - For the
information of the Hellenists, who spoke that language, and came in
great numbers to the feast.

[John 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 19:22</span></span>

What I have written, I have written - That shall stand.

[John 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 19:23</span></span>

The vesture - The upper garment.

[John 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 19:24</span></span>

They parted my garments among them - No circumstance of David's life
bore any resemblance to this, or to several other passages in the 22d
Psalm. So that in this scripture, as in some others, the prophet seems
to have been thrown into a preternatural ecstacy, wherein, personating
the Messiah, he spoke barely what the Spirit dictated, without any
regard to himself. [Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018).

[John 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 19:25</span></span>

His mother's sister - But we do not read she had any brother. She was
her father's heir, and as such transmitted the right of the kingdom of
David to Jesus: Mary, the wife of Cleopas - Called likewise Alpheus, the
father, as Mary was the mother of James, and Joses, and Simon, and
Judas.

[John 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 19:27</span></span>

Behold thy mother - To whom thou art now to perform the part of a son in
my place, a peculiar honour which Christ conferred on him. From that
hour - From the time of our Lord's death.

[John 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 19:29</span></span>

A stalk of hyssop - Which in those countries grows exceeding large and
strong. [Psa 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021).

[John 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 19:30</span></span>

It is finished - My suffering: the purchase of man's redemption. He
delivered up his spirit - To God, [Mat
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050).

[John 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 19:31</span></span>

Lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath - Which they
would have accounted a profanation of any Sabbath, but of that in
particular. For that Sabbath was a great day - Being not only a Sabbath,
but the second day of the feast of unleavened bread (from whence they
reckoned the weeks to pentecost:) and also the day for presenting and
offering the sheaf of new corn: so that it was a treble solemnity.

[John 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 19:34</span></span>

Forthwith there came out blood and water - It was strange, seeing he was
dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also; and
most strange of all, that both should come out immediately, at one time,
and yet distinctly. It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true
blood. The asseveration of the beholder and testifier of it, shows both
the truth and greatness of the miracle and mystery.

[John 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 19:35</span></span>

His testimony is true - Valid, unexceptionable. And he knoweth - And his
conscience beareth him witness, that he testifieth this for no other
end, than that ye may believe.

[John 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 19:36</span></span>

A bone of it shall not be broken - This was originally spoken of the
paschal lamb, an eminent type of Christ. [Exo
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046).

[John 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 19:37</span></span>

They shall look on him whom they have pierced - He was pierced by the
soldier's spear. They who have occasioned his sufferings by their sins
(and who has not?) shall either look upon him in this world with
penitential sorrow: or with terror, when he cometh in the clouds of
heaven, [Rev 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007). [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).

[John 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 19:38</span></span>

Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate - And Nicodemus also came -
Acknowledging Christ, when even his chosen disciples forsook him. In
that extremity Joseph was no longer afraid, Nicodemus no longer ashamed.

[John 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 19:41</span></span>

In the place where he was crucified - There was a garden in the same
tract of land: but the cross did not stand in the garden.

[John 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 19:42</span></span>

Because of the preparation - That is, they chose the rather to lay him
in that sepulchre which was nigh, because it was the day before the
Sabbath, which also was drawing to an end, so that they had no time to
carry him far.
