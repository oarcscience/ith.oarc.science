A wicked man - Who will rule him with rigour and cruelty. Satan - To
accuse him; for this was the place and posture of accusers in the Jewish
courts.

Garment - Which a man wears constantly. Like water - Water in the cavity
of the belly, between the bowels, is almost certain death. And oil
soaking into any of the bones, will soon utterly destroy it.
