### [Isaiah Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 55:1</span></span>

Thirsteth - For the grace of God and the blessings of the gospel. This
thirst implies a vehement, and active, and restless desire after it. No
money - Those who are most worthless and wicked, if they do but thirst
may be welcome. Buy - Procure or receive that which is freely offered.
Wine and milk - All gospel - blessings; in particular, that peace and
joy in the Holy Ghost, which are better than wine, and that love of God
which nourishes the soul, as milk does the body.

[Isaiah 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 55:2</span></span>

Money - All your time, and strength, and cost. Not bread - For those
things which can never nourish or satisfy you, such as worldly goods, or
pleasures. Eat ye - That which is truly and solidly, and everlastingly
good. In fatness - In this pleasant food of gospel - enjoyments.

[Isaiah 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 55:3</span></span>

An everlasting covenant - That everlasting covenant of grace and peace
which I made with Abraham, and his seed. Of David - Even that covenant
which was made first with Abraham, and then with David, concerning those
glorious and sure blessings which God hath promised to his people, one
and the chief of which was giving Christ to die for their sins. David
here seems to be put for the son of David.

[Isaiah 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 55:4</span></span>

Behold - I have appointed, and will in due time actually give. Him - The
David last mentioned, even Christ. A witness - To declare the will of
God concerning the duty and salvation of men, to bear witness to truth,
to confirm God's promises, and, among others, those which respect the
calling of the Gentiles: to be a witness of both parties of that
covenant made between God and men. The people - To all people.

[Isaiah 55:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 55:5</span></span>

Thou - Thou, O Messiah. Call - To the knowledge of thyself. Knewest not
- With that special knowledge which implies approbation. Because -
Because the Lord shall by many tokens, manifest himself to be thy God,
and thee to be his son and faithful servant. Glorify thee - By
confirming thy word with illustrious signs and miracles, and
particularly by thy resurrection, and glorious ascension.

[Isaiah 55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 55:6</span></span>

Seek - Labour to get the knowledge of God's will, and to obtain his
grace and favour. While - In this day of grace, while he offers mercy
and reconciliation. Near - Ready and desirous to receive you to mercy.

[Isaiah 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 55:7</span></span>

Return - By sincere repentance, and faith.

[Isaiah 55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 55:8</span></span>

For - If any man injure you, especially if he do it greatly and
frequently, you are slow and backward to forgive him. But I am ready to
forgive all penitents, how many, and great, and numberless soever their
sins be.

[Isaiah 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 55:10</span></span>

The snow - Which in its season contributes to the fruitfulness of the
earth. Returneth not - Without effect. And bread - That it may bring
forth store of bread - corn, both for mens present supplies, and for
seed for the next year.

[Isaiah 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 55:11</span></span>

My word - My promises, concerning the pardon of the greatest sinners.
Void - Without success.

[Isaiah 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 55:12</span></span>

Therefore - Ye shall be released from your bondage. Peace - Safely and
triumphantly. Clap - There shall be a general rejoicing, so that even
the senseless creatures shall seem to rejoice with you.

[Isaiah 55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 55:13</span></span>

Instead - Whereas your land was filled with thorns and briars, as was
foretold, they shall be rooted out, and it shall be planted with fir -
trees and myrtle - trees, and such other trees, as are useful either for
fruit or for delight. The church shall be delivered from pernicious
things, and replenished with all divine graces and blessings. It - This
wonderful change shall bring much honour to God. A sign - For a
monument, of God's infinite power, and faithfulness, and love to his
people to all succeeding generations.
