### [Romans Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

[Romans 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 3:1</span></span>

What then, may some say, is the advantage of the Jew, or of the
circumcision - That is, those that are circumcised, above the gentiles?

[Romans 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 3:2</span></span>

Chiefly in that they were intrusted with the oracles of God - The
scriptures, in which are so great and precious promises. Other
prerogatives will follow, [Rom 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md).
St. Paul here singles out this by which, after removing the objection,
he will convict them so much the more.

[Romans 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 3:3</span></span>

Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God - Will he not
still make good his promises to them that do believe?

[Romans 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 3:4</span></span>

[Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md).

[Romans 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 3:5</span></span>

But, it may be farther objected, if our unrighteousness be subservient
to God's glory, is it not unjust in him to punish us for it? I speak as
a man - As human weakness would be apt to speak.

[Romans 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 3:6</span></span>

God forbid - By no means. If it were unjust in God to punish that
unrighteousness which is subservient to his own glory, how should God
judge the world - Since all the unrighteousness in the world will then
commend the righteousness of God.

[Romans 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 3:7</span></span>

But, may the objector reply, if the truth of God hath abounded - Has
been more abundantly shown. Through my lie - If my lie, that is,
practice contrary to truth, conduces to the glory of God, by making his
truth shine with superior advantage. Why am I still judged as a sinner -
Can this be said to be any sin at all? Ought I not to do what would
otherwise be evil, that so much "good may come?" To this the apostle
does not deign to give a direct answer, but cuts the objector short with
a severe reproof.

[Romans 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 3:8</span></span>

Whose condemnation is just - The condemnation of all who either speak or
act in this manner. So the apostle absolutely denies the lawfulness of "
doing evil," any evil, "that good may come."

[Romans 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 3:9</span></span>

What then - Here he resumes what he said, [Rom
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md). Under sin - Under the guilt and
power of it: the Jews, by transgressing the written law; the gentiles,
by transgressing the law of nature.

[Romans 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 3:10</span></span>

As it is written - That all men are under sin appears from the vices
which have raged in all ages. St. Paul therefore rightly cites David and
Isaiah, though they spoke primarily of their own age, and expressed what
manner of men God sees, when he "looks down from heaven;" not what he
makes them by his grace. There is none righteous - This is the general
proposition. The particulars follow: their dispositions and designs,
[Rom 3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md); their discourse, [Rom
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md); their actions, [Rom
3:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#016.md). [Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md), &c.

[Romans 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 3:11</span></span>

There is none that understandeth - The things of God.

[Romans 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 3:12</span></span>

They have all turned aside - From the good way. They are become
unprofitable - Helpless impotent, unable to profit either themselves or
others.

[Romans 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 3:13</span></span>

Their throat - Is noisome and dangerous as an open sepulchre. Observe
the progress of evil discourse, proceeding out of the heart, through the
throat, tongue, lips, till the whole mouth is filled therewith. The
poison of asps - Infectious, deadly backbiting, tale - bearing, evil -
speaking, is under (for honey is on) their lips. An asp is a venomous
kind of serpent. [Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md); [Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003.md).

[Romans 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 3:14</span></span>

Cursing - Against God. Bitterness - Against their neighbour. [Psa
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007.md).

[Romans 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 3:15</span></span>

[Isa 59:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md)

[Romans 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 3:17</span></span>

Of peace - Which can only spring from righteousness.

[Romans 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 3:18</span></span>

The fear of God is not before their eyes - Much less is the love of God
in their heart. [Psa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001.md).

[Romans 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 3:19</span></span>

Whatsoever the law - The Old Testament. Saith, it saith to them that are
under the law - That is, to those who own its authority; to the Jews,
and not the gentiles. St. Paul quoted no scripture against them, but
pleaded with them only from the light of nature. Every mouth - Full of
bitterness, [Rom 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014.md), and yet of
boasting, [Rom 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md). May become guilty
- May be fully convicted, and apparently liable to most just
condemnation. These things were written of old, and were quoted by St.
Paul, not to make men criminal, but to prove them so.

[Romans 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 3:20</span></span>

No flesh shall be justified - None shall be forgiven and accepted of
God. By the works of the law - On this ground, that he hath kept the
law. St. Paul means chiefly the moral part of it, [Rom
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md), [Rom
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md), [Rom
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021.md), [Rom
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026.md); &c. which alone is not
abolished, [Rom 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md). And it is not
without reason, that he so often mentions the works of the law, whether
ceremonial or moral; for it was on these only the Jews relied, being
wholly ignorant of those that spring from faith. For by the law is only
the knowledge of sin - But no deliverance either from the guilt or power
of it.

[Romans 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 3:21</span></span>

But now the righteousness of God - That is, the manner of becoming
righteous which God hath appointed. Without the law - Without that
previous obedience which the law requires; without reference to the law,
or dependence on it. Is manifested - In the gospel. Being attested by
the Law itself, and by the Prophets - By all the promises in the Old
Testament.

[Romans 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 3:22</span></span>

To all - The Jews. And upon all - The gentiles That believe: for there
is no difference - Either as to the need of justification, or the manner
of it.

[Romans 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 3:23</span></span>

For all have sinned - In Adam, and in their own persons; by a sinful
nature, sinful tempers, and sinful actions. And are fallen short of the
glory of God - The supreme end of man; short of his image on earth, and
the enjoyment of him in heaven.

[Romans 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 3:24</span></span>

And are justified - Pardoned and accepted. Freely - Without any merit of
their own. By his grace - Not their own righteousness or works. Through
the redemption - The price Christ has paid. Freely by his grace - One of
these expressions might have served to convey the apostle's meaning; but
he doubles his assertion, in order to give us the fullest conviction of
the truth, and to impress us with a sense of its peculiar importance. It
is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all
consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically
ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness.

[Romans 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 3:25</span></span>

Whom God hath set forth - Before angels and men. A propitiation - To
appease an offended God. But if, as some teach, God never was offended,
there was no need of this propitiation. And, if so, Christ died in vain.
To declare his righteousness - To demonstrate not only his clemency, but
his justice; even that vindictive justice whose essential character and
principal office is, to punish sin. By the remission of past sins - All
the sins antecedent to their believing.

[Romans 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 3:26</span></span>

For a demonstration of his righteousness - Both of his justice and
mercy. That he might be just - Showing his justice on his own Son. And
yet the merciful justifier of every one that believeth in Jesus. That he
might be just - Might evidence himself to be strictly and inviolably
righteous in the administration of his government, even while he is the
merciful justifier of the sinner that believeth in Jesus. The attribute
of justice must be preserved inviolate; and inviolate it is preserved,
if there was a real infliction of punishment on our Saviour. On this
plan all the attributes harmonize; every attribute is glorified, and not
one superseded no, nor so much as clouded.

[Romans 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 3:27</span></span>

Where is the boasting then of the Jew against the gentile? It is
excluded. By what law? of works? Nay - This would have left room for
boasting. But by the law of faith - Since this requires all, without
distinction, to apply as guilty and helpless sinners, to the free mercy
of God in Christ. The law of faith is that divine constitution which
makes faith, not works, the condition of acceptance.

[Romans 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 3:28</span></span>

We conclude then that a man is justified by faith - And even by this,
not as it is a work, but as it receives Christ; and, consequently, has
something essentially different from all our works whatsoever.

[Romans 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 3:29</span></span>

Surely of the gentiles also - As both nature and the scriptures show.

[Romans 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 3:30</span></span>

Seeing it is one God who - Shows mercy to both, and by the very same
means.

[Romans 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 3:31</span></span>

We establish the law - Both the authority, purity, and the end of it; by
defending that which the law attests; by pointing out Christ, the end of
it; and by showing how it may be fulfilled in its purity.
