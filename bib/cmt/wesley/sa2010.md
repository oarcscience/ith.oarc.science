### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002)

David sent - There had hitherto been friendship between David and him:
and therefore the spoils of the children of Ammon are mentioned, [Sa2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#012), by way of anticipation, and with
respect to the story here following.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004)

Shaved - To fasten this is a reproach upon them, and to make them
ridiculous and contemptible. Cut off, &c. - This was worse than the
former, because the Israelites wore no breeches, and so their nakedness
was hereby uncovered.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 10:19</span></span>

And served them - And thus at length was fulfilled the promise made to
Abraham, and repeated to Joshua, that the borders of Israel should
extend as far as the river Euphrates. The son of David sent his
ambassadors, his apostles and ministers, to the Jewish church and
nation. But they intreated them shamefully, as Hanun did David's, mocked
them, abused them, slew them. And this it was that filled the measure of
their iniquity, and brought upon them ruin without remedy.
