------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 John Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)

[1 John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 3:1</span></span>

That we should be called - That is, should be, the children of God.
Therefore the world knoweth us not - They know not what to make of us.
We are a mystery to them.

[1 John 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 3:2</span></span>

It doth not yet appear - Even to ourselves. What we shall be - It is
something ineffable, which will raise the children of God to be, in a
manner, as God himself. But we know, in general, that when he, the Son
of God, shall appear, we shall be like him - The glory of God
penetrating our inmost substance. For we shall see him as he is -
Manifestly, without a veil. And that sight will transform us into the
same likeness.

[1 John 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 3:3</span></span>

And every one that hath this hope in him - In God.

[1 John 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 3:4</span></span>

Whosoever committeth sin - Thereby transgresseth the holy, just, and
good law of God, and so sets his authority at nought; for this is
implied in the very nature of sin.

[1 John 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 3:5</span></span>

And ye know that he - Christ. Was manifested - That he came into the
world for this very purpose. To take away our sins - To destroy them
all, root and branch, and leave none remaining. And in him is no sin -
So that he could not suffer on his own account, but to make us as
himself.

[1 John 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 3:6</span></span>

Whosoever abideth in communion with him, by loving faith, sinneth not -
While he so abideth. Whosoever sinneth certainly seeth him not - The
loving eye of his soul is not then fixed upon God; neither doth he then
experimentally know him - Whatever he did in time past.

[1 John 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 3:7</span></span>

Let no one deceive you - Let none persuade you that any man is righteous
but he that uniformly practises righteousness; he alone is righteous,
after the example of his Lord.

[1 John 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 3:8</span></span>

He that committeth sin is a child of the devil; for the devil sinneth
from the beginning - That is, was the first sinner in the universe, and
has continued to sin ever since. The Son of God was manifested to
destroy the works of the devil - All sin. And will he not perform this
in all that trust in him?

[1 John 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 3:9</span></span>

Whosoever is born of God - By living faith, whereby God is continually
breathing spiritual life into his soul, and his soul is continually
breathing out love and prayer to God, doth not commit sin. For the
divine seed of loving faith abideth in him; and, so long as it doth, he
cannot sin, because he is born of God - Is inwardly and universally
changed.

[1 John 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 3:10</span></span>

Neither he that loveth not his brother - Here is the transition from the
general proposition to one particular.

[1 John 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 3:12</span></span>

Who was of the wicked one - Who showed he was a child of the devil by
killing his brother. And wherefore slew he him - For any fault? No, but
just the reverse; for his goodness.

[1 John 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 3:13</span></span>

Marvel not if the world hate you - For the same cause.

[1 John 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 3:14</span></span>

We know - As if he had said, We ourselves could not love our brethren,
unless we were passed from spiritual death to life, that is, born of
God. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death - That is, is not
born of God. And he that is not born of God, cannot love his brother.

[1 John 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 3:15</span></span>

He, I say, abideth in spiritual death, is void of the life of God. For
whosoever hateth his brother, and there is no medium between loving and
hating him, is, in God's account, a murderer: every degree of hatred
being a degree of the same temper which moved Cain to murder his
brother. And no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him - But every
loving believer hath. For love is the beginning of eternal life. It is
the same, in substance, with glory.

[1 John 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 3:16</span></span>

The word God is not in the original. It was omitted by the apostle just
as the particular name is omitted by Mary, when she says to the
gardener, "Sir, if thou hast borne him hence;" and by the church, when
she says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth," [Sol
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002.md); in both which places there is a
language, a very emphatical language, even in silence. It declares how
totally the thoughts were possessed by the blessed and glorious subject.
It expresses also the superlative dignity and amiableness of the person
meant, as though He, and He alone, was, or deserved to be, both known
and admired by all. Because he laid down his life - Not merely for
sinners, but for us in particular. From this truth believed, from this
blessing enjoyed, the love of our brethren takes its rise, which may
very justly be admitted as an evidence that our faith is no delusion.

[1 John 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 3:17</span></span>

But whoso hath this world's good - Worldly substance, far less valuable
than life. And seeth his brother have need - The very sight of want
knocks at the door of the spectator's heart. And shutteth up - Whether
asked or not. His bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love
of God in him - Certainly not at all, however he may talk, [Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md), of loving God.

[1 John 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 3:18</span></span>

Not in word - Only. But in deed - In action: not in tongue by empty
professions, but in truth.

[1 John 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 3:19</span></span>

And hereby we know - We have a farther proof by this real, operative
love. That we are of the truth - That we have true faith, that we are
true children of God. And shall assure our hearts before him - Shall
enjoy the assurance of his favour, and the "testimony of a good
conscience toward God." The heart, in St. John's language, is the
conscience. The word conscience is not found in his writings.

[1 John 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 3:20</span></span>

For if we have not this testimony, if in anything our heart, our own
conscience, condemn us, much more does God, who is greater than our
heart - An infinitely holier and a more impartial Judge. And knoweth all
things - So that there is no hope of hiding it from him.

[1 John 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 3:21</span></span>

If our heart condemn us not - If our conscience, duly enlightened by the
word and Spirit of God, and comparing all our thoughts, words, and works
with that word, pronounce that they agree therewith. Then have we
confidence toward God - Not only our consciousness of his favour
continues and increases, but we have a full persuasion, that whatsoever
we ask we shall receive of him.

[1 John 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jo1 3:23</span></span>

And this is his commandment - All his commandments in one word. That we
should believe and love - in the manner and degree which he hath taught.
This is the greatest and most important command that ever issued from
the throne of glory. If this be neglected, no other can be kept: if this
be observed, all others are easy.

[1 John 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jo1 3:24</span></span>

And he that keepeth his commandments - That thus believes and loves.
Abideth in him, and God in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in
us, by the Spirit which he hath given us - Which witnesses with our
spirits that we are his children, and brings forth his fruits of peace,
love, holiness. This is the transition to the treating of the Holy
Spirit which immediately follows.
