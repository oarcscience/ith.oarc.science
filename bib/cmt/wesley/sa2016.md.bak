### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 16:1</span></span>

Bottle - A large bottle, or vessel proportionable to the other
provisions.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 16:4</span></span>

Behold - A rash sentence, and unrighteous to condemn a man unheard, upon
the single testimony of his accuser, and servant. Find grace - Thy
favour is more to me, than this gift; which, as a token of thy favour, I
accept with all thankfulness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 16:8</span></span>

Of Saul - Either, The blood of Abner and Ishbosheth; which he imputes to
David, as if they had been killed by David's contrivance: or, the death
of Saul's seven sons, [Sa2 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008.md),
which, though related after this, seems to have been done before. Art
taken - The same mischief thou didst bring upon others, is now returned
upon thy own head.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 16:10</span></span>

What have I, &e. - In this matter I ask not your advice, nor will I
follow it; nor do I desire you should at all concern yourselves in it.
The Lord - God did not put any wickedness into Shimei's heart, for he
had of himself an heart full of malignity against David; but only left
him to his own wickedness; and brought David into so distressed a
condition, that he might seem a proper object of his scorn. And this is
ground enough for this expression, the Lord said, not by the word of his
precept, but by the word of his providence, in respect whereof he is
said to command the ravens, [Kg1 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#004.md),
and to send forth his word to senseless creatures, [Psa
147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md), [Psa
147:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#018.md). Who shall reproach God's
providence for permitting this? Or, who shall restrain him from
executing his just judgment against me?

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 16:11</span></span>

My life - Which is a greater mischief, than to reproach me with words.
Benjamites - Of that tribe and family from which God hast taken away the
kingdom, and given it to me. Let him - Do not now hinder him violently
from it, nor punish him for it. It is meet I should bear the indignation
of the Lord, and submit to his pleasure.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 16:14</span></span>

Came - To the city of Bahurim.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 16:17</span></span>

Is this - Doth this action answer that profession of friendship which
thou hast hitherto made to him? He speaks thus only to try him. And he
saith, thy friend, by way of reflection upon David; as one who was a
friend to Hushai, and to strangers but not to his own son, whom, by his
severity he provoked to this course; and therefore he doth not vouchsafe
to call him his father.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 16:21</span></span>

Go - This counsel he gave, partly to revenge the injury done to
Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, [Sa2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003.md), who was the son of Ahithophel,
[Sa2 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#034.md), and principally for his
own, and the people's safety, that the breach between David and Absalom
might be irreparable. For this would provoke David in the highest degree
and cut of all hope of reconciliation, which otherwise might have been
expected by some treaty between Absalom and his tender - hearted father.
But in that case his followers, and especially Ahithophel, had been left
to David's mercy, and therefore obliged to prosecute the war with all
vigour, and to abandon all thoughts of peace: as knowing that his
father, though be might dissemble, yet would never forgive so foul a
crime. Be strong - They will fight with greater courage and resolution,
when they are freed from the fear of thy reconciliation, which otherwise
would make their hearts faint, and hands slack in thy cause. But by this
we may see the character of Absalom's party, and how abominably wicked
they were, whom such a scandalous action tied the faster to him. And we
may farther learn, how corrupt the body of the people was, how ripe for
that judgment which is now hastening to them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 16:22</span></span>

The top - Of the king's palace, the very place from whence David had
gazed upon Bathsheba, [Sa2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md), so
that his sin was legible in the very place of his punishment. Went in -
To one, or some of them. And by so doing did farther make claim to the
kingdom; and, as it were, take possession of it. It being usual in the
eastern countries to account the wives and concubines of the late king,
to belong of right to the successor. Israel - Who saw him go into the
tent; and thence concluded, that he lay with them, as he had designed to
do. God had threatened by Nathan, that for his defiling Bathsheba,
David's own wives should be defiled in the face of the sun. This is now
fulfilled: the Lord is righteous; and no word of his shall fall to the
ground.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 16:23</span></span>

The counsel, &c. - It was received by the people with equal veneration,
and was usually attended with as certain success. Which is mentioned as
the reason why a counsel which had so ill a face, should meet with such
general approbation.
