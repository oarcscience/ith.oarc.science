### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 13:1</span></span>

A sister - His sister by father and mother.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 13:2</span></span>

A virgin - And therefore diligently kept, so he could not get private
converse with her.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 13:5</span></span>

My sister - So he calls her, to prevent the suspicion of any dishonest
design upon so near a relation. At her hand - Pretending, his stomach
was so nice, that he could eat nothing but what he saw dressed, and that
by a person whom he much esteemed.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 13:9</span></span>

Out - Out of the frying - pan into the dish.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa2 13:10</span></span>

Chamber - Amnon lying upon his couch in one chamber where the company
were with him, where also she made the cakes before him, first sends all
out of that room, and then rises from his couch, and, upon some
pretence, goes into another secret chamber.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 13:12</span></span>

Brother - Whom nature both teaches to abhor such thoughts and obliges to
defend me from such a mischief with thy utmost hazard, if another should
attempt it. Force - Thou shouldst abhor it, if I were willing; but to
add violence, is abominable. Israel - Among God's people who are taught
better things; who also will be infinitely reproached for such a base
action.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 13:13</span></span>

Shame - How can I either endure or avoid the shame? Fools - That is,
contemptible to all the people, whereas now thou art heir apparent of
the crown. Withhold - This she spoke, because she thought her royal
father would dispense with it, upon this extraordinary occasion, to save
his first - born son's life:

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa2 13:15</span></span>

Hated her - By the just judgment of God both upon Amnon and David, that
so the sin might be made publick, and way for the succeeding tragedies.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 13:16</span></span>

No cause - For me to go. Greater thou the other - This she might truly
say, because though the other was in itself a greater sin, yet this was
an act of greater cruelty, and a greater calamity to her because it
exposed her to publick infamy and contempt, and besides, it turned a
private offence into a publick scandal, to the great dishonour of God
and of his people, and especially of all the royal family.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 13:18</span></span>

Garment - Of embroidered work.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 13:19</span></span>

Put ashes - To signify her grief for some calamity which had befallen
her, and what that was, concurring circumstances easily discovered. Head
- In token of grief and shame, as if she were unable and ashamed to shew
her face. Crying - To manifest her abhorrency of the fact, and that it
was not done by her consent.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 13:20</span></span>

Been with thee - Behold, and imitate the modesty of scripture
expressions. Brother - Wherefore thou must forgive and forgot the
injury; therefore thy disgracing of him will be a blot to us all;
therefore thou wilt not get right from David against him, because he is
as near and dear to him as thou; therefore thy dishonour is the less,
because thou wast not abused by any mean person, but by a king's son;
therefore this evil must be borne, because it cannot be revenged: and
thus he covers his design of taking vengeance upon him at the first
opportunity. Regard not - So as to torment thyself. Desolate - Through
shame and dejection of mind, giving her self up to solitude and
retirement.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa2 13:21</span></span>

Wroth - With Amnon: whom yet he did not punish, at least so severely as
he should either from the consciousness of his own guilt in the like
kind; or, from that foolish indulgence which he often shewed to his
children.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa2 13:22</span></span>

Spake - That is, he said nothing at all to him, about that business. He
neither debated it with him, nor threatened him for it; but seemed
willing to pass it by with brotherly kindness. If he had wholly forborne
all discourse with him, it would have raised jealousies in Amnon and
David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 13:23</span></span>

Two years - This circumstance of time is noted, as an aggravation of
Absalom's malice, which was so implacable: and as an act of policy, that
both Amnon and David might more securely comply with his desires.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa2 13:26</span></span>

Let Amnon - For the king designed (as the following words shew) to keep
him at home with him, as being his eldest son, and heir of his kingdom:
otherwise Absalom would never have made particular mention of him; which
now he was forced to do. Nor did this desire of Amnon's presence want
specious pretences, as that seeing the king would not, he who was next
to him might, honour him with his company; and that this might be a
publick token of friendship between him and his brother, notwithstanding
the former occasion of difference.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa2 13:27</span></span>

Pressed him - It is strange that his urgent desire of Amnon's company
raised no suspicion in so wise a king; but God suffered him to be
blinded that he might execute his judgments upon David, and bring upon
Amnon the just punishment of his lewdness.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa2 13:28</span></span>

Merry - When he least suspects, and will be most unable to prevent the
evil. I - I who am the king's son, and, when Amnon is gone, his heir:
who therefore shall easily obtain pardon for you, and will liberally
reward you.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa2 13:29</span></span>

Commanded - Now the threatened sword is drawn in David's house, which
will not depart from it. His eldest son falls by it, thro' his own
wickedness, and his father by his connivance is accessory to it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa2 13:37</span></span>

Talmai - His mother's father, that he might have present protection and
sustenance from him; and that by his mediation he might obtain his
father's pardon.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa2 13:39</span></span>

Go forth - And could not he recalled, to visit him, or to send for him.
What amazing weakness was this! At first he could not find in his heart,
to do justice to the ravisher of his sister! And now he can almost find
in his heart to receive into favour the murderer of his brother? How can
we excuse David from the sin of Eli; who honoured his sons more than
God?
