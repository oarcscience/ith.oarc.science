12:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#054.md) to all the people. [Mat

hypocrite, or conceal any thing which I have commissioned you to
publish.

[Luke 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 12:5</span></span>

Fear him who hath power to cast into hell - Even to his peculiar
friends, Christ gives this direction. Therefore the fearing of God as
having power to cast into hell, is to be pressed even on true believers.

last day. [Mar 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038.md); [Luk
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026.md).

[Luke 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 12:10</span></span>

And whosoever - As if he had said, Yet the denying me in some degree,
may, upon true repentance, be forgiven; but if it rise so high as that
of the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, it shall never be forgiven,
neither is there place for repentance. [Mat
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md); [Mar
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028.md).

people. A man's life - That is, the comfort or happiness of it.

[Luke 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 12:17</span></span>

What shall I do? - The very language of want! Do? Why, lay up treasure
in heaven.

[Luke 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 12:20</span></span>

depend on living many years! Yea, one day! They - The messengers of
death, commissioned by God, require thy soul of thee!

any speculations or musings in which the mind fluctuates, or is
suspended (like meteors in the air) in an uneasy hesitation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 12:33</span></span>

Sell what ye have - This is a direction, not given to all the multitude:
(much less is it a standing rule for all Christians:) neither to the
apostles; for they had nothing to sell, having left all before: but to
his other disciples, (mentioned [Luk
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#022.md), and [Act
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015),.md) especially to the seventy, that

they journeyed or were employed in any labour: as also to the lights
that servants used to carry at weddings, which were generally in the
night.

[Luke 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 12:41</span></span>

Speakest thou this parable to us - Apostles and disciples: Or to all -
The people? Does it concern us alone? Or all men?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 12:42</span></span>

Who is that faithful and wise steward - Our Lord's answer manifestly
implies, that he had spoken this parable primarily (though not wholly)
to the ministers of his word: Whom his lord shall make ruler over his
household - For his wisdom and faithfulness.

happy! Yet we see, he might fall from all, and perish for ever.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 12:46</span></span>

the unfaithful - As faithful as he was once, God himself being the
Judge!

[Luke 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 12:47</span></span>

And that servant who knew his Lord's will shall be beaten with many
stripes - And his having much knowledge will increase, not lessen, his
punishment.

[Luke 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md)

can set up my kingdom. And how I long to fight my way through all!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 12:51</span></span>

Suppose ye that I am come to send peace upon earth - That universal
peace will be the immediate effect of my coming? Not so, but quite the
contrary. [Mat 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">luk 12:58</span></span>

When thou art going - As if he had said, And ye have not a moment to
lose. For the executioners of God's vengeance are at hand. And when he
