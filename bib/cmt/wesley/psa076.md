<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 76:2</span></span>

[Psalms 76:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 76:4</span></span>

Thou - O God. Than - The greatest kings and empires of the earth, which
in prophetic writings are often compared to mountains. And they are
called mountains of prey, because they generally were established by
tyranny, and maintained by preying upon their own subjects, or other
kingdoms.

[Psalms 76:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 76:8</span></span>

Thou - Didst execute judgment upon thine enemies, by an angel from
heaven: which is said to be heard, either because it was accompanied
with thunders and earthquakes, or because the fame of it was quickly
spread abroad. Feared - The rest of the world were afraid to disturb
Israel.

[Psalms 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010.md)

and others to praise thee for thy admirable wisdom, power, and
faithfulness.

[Psalms 76:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#011.md)
