### [Psalms Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 21:3</span></span>

Prevent - Crowning him with manifold blessings, both more and sooner
than he expected. With - With excellent blessings.

[Psalms 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 21:4</span></span>

For ever - Thou gavest him a long life and reign here, and after that
didst translate him to live with thee for ever. But this was more
eminently fulfilled in Christ, who asked of his father, life, or to be
saved from death, [Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md), though
with submission to his will: but his father, though he saw it necessary
to take away his temporal life, yet instantly gave him another, far more
noble, even the perfect possession of an everlasting life both in his
soul and body, at his right hand.

[Psalms 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 21:5</span></span>

Glory - His fame or renown. Salvation - By reason of those great and
glorious deliverances which thou hast wrought both for him, and by him.

[Psalms 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 21:6</span></span>

Countenance - Smiling upon him, by thy grace and favour.

[Psalms 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 21:9</span></span>

Oven - Like wood, which when it is cast in there, is quickly consumed.

[Psalms 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 21:10</span></span>

Fruit - Their children. God will take away both root and branch, the
parents and all that wicked race.

[Psalms 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 21:11</span></span>

Thee - Against God, not directly, but by consequence, because it was
against David, whom God had anointed, and against the Lord's people,
whose injuries God takes as done to himself.

[Psalms 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 21:13</span></span>

Exalted - By thy own power, or by the manifestation thereof.
