### [Hebrews Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001)

[Hebrews 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 4:2</span></span>

But the word which they heard did not profit them - So far from it, that
it increased their damnation. It is then only when it is mixed with
faith, that it exerts its saving power.

[Hebrews 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 4:3</span></span>

For we only that have believed enter into the rest - The proposition is,
There remains a rest for us. This is proved, [Heb
4:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003), thus: That psalm mentions a
rest: yet it does not mean, God's rest from creating; for this was long
before the time of Moses. Therefore in his time another rest was
expected, of which they who then heard fell short Nor is it, The rest
which Israel obtained through Joshua; for the Psalmist wrote after him.
Therefore it is, The eternal rest in heaven. As he said - Clearly
showing that there is a farther rest than that which followed the
finishing of the creation. Though the works were finished - Before:
whence it is plain, God did not speak of resting from them.

[Hebrews 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 4:4</span></span>

For, long after he had rested from his works, he speaks again. [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002).

[Hebrews 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 4:5</span></span>

In this psalm, of a rest yet to come.

[Hebrews 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 4:7</span></span>

After so long a time - It was above four hundred years from the time of
Moses and Joshua to David. As it was said before - St. Paul here refers
to the text he had just cited.

[Hebrews 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 4:8</span></span>

The rest - All the rest which God had promised.

[Hebrews 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 4:9</span></span>

Therefore - Since he still speaks of another day, there must remain a
farther, even an eternal, rest for the people of God.

[Hebrews 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 4:10</span></span>

For they do not yet so rest. Therefore a fuller rest remains for them.

[Hebrews 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 4:11</span></span>

Lest any one should fall - Into perdition.

[Hebrews 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 4:12</span></span>

For the word of God - Preached, [Heb
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#002), and armed with threatenings, [Heb
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003). Is living and powerful - Attended
with the power of the living God, and conveying either life or death to
the hearers. Sharper than any two - edged sword - Penetrating the heart
more than this does the body. Piercing - Quite through, and laying open.
The soul and spirit, joints and marrow - The inmost recesses of the
mind, which the apostle beautifully and strongly expresses by this heap
of figurative words. And is a discerner - Not only of the thoughts, but
also of the intentions.

[Hebrews 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 4:13</span></span>

In his sight - It is God whose word is thus "powerful:" it is God in
whose sight every creature is manifest; and of this his word, working on
the conscience, gives the fullest conviction. But all things are naked
and opened - Plainly alluding to the sacrifices under the law which were
first flayed, and then (as the Greek word literally means) cleft asunder
through the neck and backbone; so that everything both without and
within was exposed to open view.

[Hebrews 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 4:14</span></span>

Having therefore a great high priest - Great indeed, being the eternal
Son of God, that is passed through the heavens - As the Jewish high
priest passed through the veil into the holy of holies, carrying with
him the blood of the sacrifices, on the yearly day of atonement; so our
great high priest went once for all through the visible heavens, with
the virtue of his own blood, into the immediate presence God.

[Hebrews 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 4:15</span></span>

He sympathizes with us even in our innocent infirmities, wants,
weaknesses, miseries, dangers. Yet without sin - And, therefore, is
indisputably able to preserve us from it in all our temptations.

[Hebrews 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 4:16</span></span>

Let us therefore come boldly - Without any doubt or fear. Unto the
throne of God, our reconciled Father, even his throne of grace - Grace
erected it, and reigns there, and dispenses all blessings in a way of
mere, unmerited favour.
