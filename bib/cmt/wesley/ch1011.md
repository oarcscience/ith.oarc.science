### [1 Chronicles Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 11:6</span></span>

Chief - Before this he was one of David's chief captains: but now he is
made captain - general of all the forces of Israel and Judah.

[1 Chronicles 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 11:10</span></span>

Mighty men - Yet David ascribed his success, not to the hosts he had,
but to the Lord of hosts: not to the mighty men that were with him, but
to the mighty God, whole presence with us is all in all.

[1 Chronicles 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch1 11:11</span></span>

Slain - By his own hand, five hundred more being slain by others then
joining with him, who pursued the victory, both which sums make up the
eight hundred, numbered [Sa2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#008.md). The
slaughter of all is justly ascribed to him, because it was the effect of
his valour.

[1 Chronicles 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 11:18</span></span>

Would not drink of it - That water which he thought too precious for his
own drinking, he poured out to the Lord for a drink - offering. If we
have any thing better than other, let God be honoured with it, who is
the best and should have the best.

[1 Chronicles 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch1 11:19</span></span>

Shall I drink the blood, &c. - It put him into the utmost confusion, to
think three brave men should hazard their lives, to fetch water for him.
In his account, it turns the water into blood. It is to the honour of
great men, not to be prodigal of the blood of those they employ.

[1 Chronicles 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 11:21</span></span>

Attained not - He did not equal them.

[1 Chronicles 11:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">ch1 11:41</span></span>

Uriah - The last of that catalogue in [Sa2
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#039.md). But here some others are added
to the number, because though they were not of the thirty, yet they were
men of great valour and renown amongst David's commanders.

[1 Chronicles 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 11:42</span></span>

Thirty - Thirty captains who were under him as their colonel.
