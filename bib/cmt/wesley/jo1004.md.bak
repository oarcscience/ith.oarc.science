Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1 John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)

[1 John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 4:1</span></span>

Believe not every spirit - Whereby any teacher is actuated. But try the
spirits - By the rule which follows. We are to try all spirits by the
written word: "To the law and to the testimony!" If any man speak not
according to these, the spirit which actuates him is not of God.

[1 John 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 4:2</span></span>

Every spirit - Or teacher. Which confesseth - Both with heart and voice.
Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God - This his coming
presupposes, contains, and draws after it, the whole doctrine of Christ.

[1 John 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 4:3</span></span>

Ye have heard - From our Lord and us, that it cometh.

[1 John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 4:4</span></span>

Ye have overcome these seducers, because greater is the Spirit of Christ
that is in you than the spirit of antichrist that is in the world.

[1 John 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 4:5</span></span>

They - Those false prophets. Are of the world - Of the number of those
that know not God. Therefore speak they of the world - From the same
principle, wisdom, spirit; and, of consequence, the world heareth them -
With approbation.

[1 John 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 4:6</span></span>

We - Apostles. Are of God - Immediately taught, and sent by him. Hereby
we know - From what is said, [Jo1
4:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md).

[1 John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 4:7</span></span>

Let us love one another - From the doctrine he has just been defending
he draws this exhortation. It is by the Spirit that the love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts. Every one that truly loveth God and his
neighbour is born of God.

[1 John 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 4:8</span></span>

God is love - This little sentence brought St. John more sweetness, even
in the time he was writing it, than the whole world can bring. God is
often styled holy, righteous, wise; but not holiness, righteousness, or
wisdom in the abstract, as he is said to be love; intimating that this
is his darling, his reigning attribute, the attribute that sheds an
amiable glory on all his other perfections.

[1 John 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 4:12</span></span>

If we love one another, God abideth in us - This is treated of, [Jo1
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013.md). And his love is perfected -
Has its full effect. In us - This is treated of, [Jo1
4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md).

[1 John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 4:14</span></span>

And in consequence of this we have seen and testify that the Father sent
the Son - These are the foundation and the criteria of our abiding in
God and God in us, the communion of the Spirit, and the confession of
the Son.

[1 John 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 4:15</span></span>

Whosoever shall, from a principle of loving faith, openly confess in the
face of all opposition and danger, that Jesus is the Son of God, God
abideth in him.

[1 John 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 4:16</span></span>

And we know and believe - By the same Spirit, the love that God hath to
us.

[1 John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 4:17</span></span>

Hereby - That is, by this communion with God. Is our love made perfect;
that we may - That is, so that we shall have boldness in the day of
judgment - When all the stout - hearted shall tremble. Because as he -
Christ. Is - All love. So are we - Who are fathers in Christ, even in
this world.

[1 John 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 4:18</span></span>

There is no fear in love - No slavish fear can be where love reigns. But
perfect, adult love casteth out slavish fear: because such fear hath
torment - And so is inconsistent with the happiness of love. A natural
man has neither fear nor love; one that is awakened, fear without love;
a babe in Christ, love and fear; a father in Christ, love without fear.

[1 John 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 4:19</span></span>

We love him, because he first loved us - This is the sum of all
religion, the genuine model of Christianity. None can say more: why
should any one say less, or less intelligibly?

[1 John 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 4:20</span></span>

Whom he hath seen - Who is daily presented to his senses, to raise his
esteem, and move his kindness or compassion toward him.

[1 John 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 4:21</span></span>

And this commandment have we from him - Both God and Christ. That he who
loveth God love his brother - Every one, whatever his opinions or mode
of worship be, purely because he is the child, and bears the image, of
God. Bigotry is properly the want of this pure and universal love. A
bigot only loves those who embrace his opinions, and receive his way of
worship; and he loves them for that, and not for Christ's sake.
