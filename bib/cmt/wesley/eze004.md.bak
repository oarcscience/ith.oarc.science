### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 4:1</span></span>

Portray - Draw a map of Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 4:2</span></span>

Lay siege - Draw the figure of a siege about the city. Build - Raise a
tower and bulwarks.

[Ezekiel 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 4:3</span></span>

A wall - That it may resemble a wall of iron, for as impregnable as such
a wall, shall the resolution and patience of the Chaldeans be.

[Ezekiel 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 4:4</span></span>

Lay - Take upon thee the representation of their guilt and punishment.
House of Israel - The ten tribes. The number - By this thou shalt
intimate how long I have borne with their sins, and how long they shall
bear their punishment.

[Ezekiel 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 4:5</span></span>

I have laid - I have pointed out the number of years wherein apostate
Israel sinned against me, and I did bear with them. Years - These years
probably began at Solomon's falling to idolatry, in the twenty - seventh
year of his reign, and ended in the fifth of Zedekiah's captivity.

[Ezekiel 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 4:6</span></span>

Accomplished - That is, almost accomplished. House of Judah - Of the two
tribes. Forty days - Probably from Josiah's renewing the covenant, until
the destruction of the temple, during which time God deferred to punish,
expecting whether they would keep their covenant, or retain their
idolatries, which latter they did for thirteen years of Josiah's reign,
for eleven of Jehoiakim's, and eleven of Zedekiah's reign, and five of
his captivity, which amount to just forty years. But all this was done
in a vision.

[Ezekiel 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 4:7</span></span>

Set - While thou liest on thy side thou shalt fix thy countenance on the
portrait of besieged Jerusalem. Uncovered - Naked and stretched out as
being ready to strike.

[Ezekiel 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 4:8</span></span>

Bands - An invisible restraint assuring him, that those could no more
remove from the siege, than he from that side he lay on.

[Ezekiel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 4:9</span></span>

Take - Provide thee corn enough: for a grievous famine will accompany
the siege. Wheat - All sorts of grain are to be provided, and all will
be little enough. One vessel - Mix the worst with the best to lengthen
out the provision.

[Ezekiel 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 4:10</span></span>

By weight - Not as much as you will, but a small pittance delivered by
weight to all. Twenty shekels - Ten ounces: scarce enough to maintain
life. From time to time - At set hours this was weighed out.

[Ezekiel 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 4:11</span></span>

The sixth part - About six ounces.

[Ezekiel 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 4:12</span></span>

As barley cakes - Because they never had enough to make a loaf with,
they eat them as barley cakes. With dung - There was no wood left, nor
yet dung of other creatures. This also was represented in a vision.

[Ezekiel 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 4:17</span></span>

May want - So because they served not God with chearfulness in the
abundance of all things, He made them serve their enemies in the want of
all things.
