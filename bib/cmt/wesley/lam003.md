<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 3:9</span></span>

insuperable difficulties like walls of hewn stone. Crooked - Nay, God
not only defeated their counsels, but made them fatal and pernicious to
them.

[Lamentations 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015.md)

affliction.

providences.

[Lamentations 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023.md)

Faithfulness - In fulfilling thy promises to thy people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lam 3:27</span></span>

lay upon us. And if God tame us when young, by his word or by his rod,
it is an unspeakable advantage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lam 3:37</span></span>

Who - Nothing comes to pass in the world, but by the disposal of divine

Wherefore - The Jews, check themselves in their complaints from the
consideration, that nothing had befallen them, but what was the just
reward of their sins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lam 3:53</span></span>

Dungeon - Dungeon seems here to be taken for the lowest condition of
misery.

[Lamentations 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054.md)
