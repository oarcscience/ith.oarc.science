### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 17:1</span></span>

Gathered, &c. - Probably they had heard, that Samuel had forsaken Saul,
and that Saul himself was unfit for business. The enemies of the church
are watchful to take all advantages, and they never have greater
advantage, than when her protectors have provoked God's Spirit and
prophets to leave them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 17:4</span></span>

Six cubits - At least, nine feet, nine inches high. And this is not
strange; for besides the giants mentioned in Scripture, Herodotus,
Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny, make mention of persons seven cubits high.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 17:5</span></span>

Coat of mail - Made of brass plates laid over one another, like the
scales of a fish. The weight, &c. - The common shekel contained a fourth
part of an ounce; and so five thousand shekels made one thousand two
hundred and fifty ounces, or seventy - eight pounds: which weight is not
unsuitable to a man of such vast strength as his height speaks him to
be.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 17:6</span></span>

Greaves - Boots.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 17:7</span></span>

Beam - On which the weavers fasten their web. It was like this for
thickness. And though the whole weight of Goliath's armour may seem
prodigious; yet it is not so much by far as one Athanatus did manage: of
whom Pliny relates, That he saw him come into the theatre with arms
weighing twelve thousand ounces. A shield - Probably for state: for he
that was clad in brass, little needed a shield.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 17:8</span></span>

Come down - That the battle may be decided by us two alone.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 17:11</span></span>

Afraid - This may seem strange, considering the glorious promises, and
their late experience of divine assistance. And where was Jonathan, who
in the last war had so bravely engaged an whole army of the Philistines?
Doubtless he did not feel himself so stirred up of God as he did at that
time. As the best, so the bravest of men, are no more than what God
makes them. Jonathan must sit still now, because this honour is reserved
for David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 17:12</span></span>

Old man - Therefore he went not himself to the camp.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 17:15</span></span>

Went - From Saul's court: where having relieved Saul, he was permitted
to go to his father's house, to be sent for again upon occasion.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 17:18</span></span>

Pledge - That is, bring me some token of their welfare.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 17:19</span></span>

Fighting - That is, in a posture and readiness to fight with them; as it
is explained, [Sa1 17:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 17:20</span></span>

Went, &c. - Jesse little thought of sending his son to the camp, just at
that critical juncture. But the wise God orders the time and all the
circumstances of affairs, so as to serve the designs of his own glory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 17:24</span></span>

Fled - One Philistine could never have thus put ten thousand Israelites
to flight, unless their rock, being forsaken by them, had justly sold
them and shut them up.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 17:25</span></span>

Free - Free from all those tributes and charges which either the court
or the camp required.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 17:28</span></span>

Naughtiness - Thy false - confidence, and vain gloried curiosity. See
the folly and wickedness of envy! How groundless its jealousies are, how
unjust its censures, how unfair it representations? God preserve us from
such a spirit!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">sa1 17:29</span></span>

A cause - Of my thus speaking? Is this giant invincible? Is our God
unable to oppose him, and subdue him? However David is not deterred from
his undertaking, by the hard words of Eliab. They that undertake public
services must not think it strange, if they be opposed by those from
whom they had reason to expect assistance, but must humbly go on with
their work, in the face, not only of their enemies threats, but of their
friends slights, suspicions, and censures.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 17:30</span></span>

He tarried - For being secretly moved by God's spirit to undertake the
combat. He speaks with divers persons about it, that it might come to
the king's ear.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 17:32</span></span>

Let no man's heart, &c. - It would have reflected upon his prince to
say, Let not thy heart fail: therefore he speaks in general terms, Let
no man's heart fail. A little shepherd, come but this morning from
keeping sheep, has more courage than all the mighty men of Israel! Thus
doth God often do great things for his people by the weak things of the
world.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">sa1 17:33</span></span>

A youth - Not above 20 years old; and a novice, a raw and unexperienced
soldier.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 17:37</span></span>

The Lord, &c. - The lion and the bear were only enemies to me and my
sheep, and it was in defence of them I attacked them. But this
Philistine is an enemy to my God and his people, and it is for their
honour that I attack him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">sa1 17:38</span></span>

Armour - With armour taken out of his armoury. He seems to speak of some
military vestments which were then used in war, and were contrived for
defence; such as buff - coats are now.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:39](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">sa1 17:39</span></span>

Proved them - I have no skill or experience in the managements of this
kind of arms.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa1 17:40</span></span>

Staff - His shepherd's staff. These arms in themselves were
contemptible, yet chosen by David; because he had no skill to use other
arms; because he had inward assurance of the victory, even by these
weapons; and because such a conquest would be more honourable to God,
and most shameful, and discouraging to the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">sa1 17:41</span></span>

Drew near - Probably a signal was made, that his challenge was accepted.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 17:42</span></span>

Fair - Not having so much as the countenance of a martial person.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">sa1 17:43</span></span>

Dog - Dost thou think to beat me as easily as thou wouldst thy dog?

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:46](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">sa1 17:46</span></span>

A God - Heb. that God, the only true God, is for Israel; or on Israel's
side, and against you. Or, that Israel hath a God, a God indeed, one who
is able to help them; and not such an impotent idol as you serve.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 17:47</span></span>

Saveth - That is, that he can save without these arms, and with the most
contemptible weapons. The battle - That is, the events of war are wholly
in his power. He will - David speaks thus confidently, because he was
assured of it by a particular inspiration.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:48](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">sa1 17:48</span></span>

Drew nigh - Like a stalking mountain. Ran - So far was he from fear!

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 17:49</span></span>

Forehead - Probably the proud giant had lift up that part of his helmet
which covered his fore - head; in contempt of David and his weapons, and
by the singular direction of providence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">sa1 17:51</span></span>

David took - Hence it appears, that David was not a little man, as many
fancy; but a man of considerable bulk and strength, because he was able
to manage a giant's sword. The stone threw him down to the earth, and
bereaved him of sense and motion; but there remained some life in him,
which the sword took away, and so compleated the work. God is greatly
glorified, when his proud enemies are cut off with their own sword.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:55](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">sa1 17:55</span></span>

Whose son - David had been some considerable time dismissed from Saul's
court, and was returned home. And therefore it is not strange, if Saul
for the present had forgot David. Besides the distemper of Saul's mind
might make him forgetful; and that David might be now much changed, both
in his countenance and in his habit. I cannot tell - Abner's employment
was generally in the camp, when David was at the court; and when Abner
was there, he took little notice of a person so much inferior to him as
David was.
