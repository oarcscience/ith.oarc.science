### [2 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 19:2</span></span>

Therefore - Therefore God will chastise thee for this miscarriage. Which
he did partly by stirring up the Moabites, and others to invade him,
[Ch2 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001), partly by permitting his
eldest son Jehoram to kill all his brethren, [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004), and principally by bringing that
almost general destruction upon his grand - children by Jehu, [Kg2
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027), [Kg2
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013), which was the fruit of his
alliance with Ahab.

[2 Chronicles 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 19:3</span></span>

Good things - Good marks proceeding from an honest heart; which God more
regards than this particular error: and therefore though he will chasten
thee, yet he will not utterly destroy thee.

[2 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 19:4</span></span>

Through - Through the whole kingdom, whereof these were the two bounds.
And brought - Such of them as had revolted from God to idols, he
reclaimed by his counsel and example, and by the instructions of the
Levites and priests, whom he carried with him. Many, probably, had
revolted to idolatry, when they saw their king so intimate with
idolaters. Therefore he thought himself doubly obliged to do all he
could to reduce them. If we truly repent of sin, we shall do our utmost
to repair the damage we have done to religion, or the souls of others.

[2 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 19:6</span></span>

The Lord - You represent God's person to whom judgment belongeth, you
have your commission from God, and not from man only; and your
administration of justice is not only for man's good, but also for God's
honour and service. With you - Both to observe your carriage, and to
defend you against all those enemies whom the impartial exercise of
justice may provoke.

[2 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 19:7</span></span>

Wherefore - And therefore you who are in God's stead, and do his work,
and must give an account to him, must imitate God herein.

[2 Chronicles 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 19:8</span></span>

The fathers - Persons of other tribes eminent for their dignity, ability
and integrity. But whether these persons made up one court, called the
Sanhedrim, by which all causes ecclesiastical and civil were decided; or
there were two distinct courts, the one ecclesiastical, consisting of
the priests and Levites; the other civil, consisting of the chief of the
fathers of Israel, it is not easy to determine. The Lord - For matters
concerning the laws and worship, of God. Controversies - For matters of
difference between man and man. When - When Jehoshaphat and his company
were returned to Jerusalem, he made this order concerning establishing
judges there.

[2 Chronicles 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 19:10</span></span>

Blood - This refers to [Deu 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008),
between the blood of the person slain, and the blood of the man -
slayer. All the cities of refuge, except Hebron, now belonged to the
kingdom of Israel, so that the man - slayer now usually fled to the
courts of the temple, or the horns of the altar. And therefore the trial
of these, was reserved for the court at Jerusalem. Law, &c. - When any
debates shall arise about the meaning of any of God's laws. Warn - Ye
shall not only give a righteous sentence for what is past, but ye shall
admonish the offender, and others, to take better heed for the future.

[2 Chronicles 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 19:11</span></span>

Over you - Shall be your president. Matters of the Lord - In Spiritual,
or ecclesiastical matters. Ruler - The prince, or chief ruler, under the
king, of the tribe of Judah. The king's matters - For civil causes, or
controversies either between the king and his people; or between subject
and subject, which may be called the king's matters, because it was a
principal part of his office to see them justly decided. The Levites -
Shall be at your command to see your just sentences executed; which work
was fitly committed to the Levites, as persons who might add their
instructions to the corrections, and might work the guilty to an
acknowledgement of their fault and a submission to their punishment. The
Lord - Shall protect and bless good judges.
