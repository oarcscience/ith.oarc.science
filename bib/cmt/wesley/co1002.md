### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

And I accordingly came to you, not with loftiness of speech or of wisdom
- I did not affect either deep wisdom or eloquence. Declaring the
testimony of God - What God gave me to testify concerning his Son.

[1 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 2:2</span></span>

I determined not to know anything - To wave all my other knowledge, and
not to preach anything, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified - That is,
what he did, suffered, taught. A part is put for the whole.

[1 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 2:3</span></span>

And I was with you - At my first entrance. In weakness - Of body, [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007) And in fear - Lest I should
offend any. And in much trembling - The emotion of my mind affecting my
very body.

[1 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 2:4</span></span>

And my speech in private, as well as my public preaching, was not with
the persuasive words of human wisdom, such as the wise men of the world
use; but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power - With that
powerful kind of demonstration, which flows from the Holy Spirit; which
works on the conscience with the most convincing light, and the most
persuasive evidence.

[1 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 2:5</span></span>

That your faith might not be built on the wisdom or power of man, but on
the wisdom and power of God.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

Yet we speak wisdom - Yea, the truest and most excellent wisdom. Among
the perfect - Adult, experienced Christians. By wisdom here he seems to
mean, not the whole Christian doctrine, but the most sublime and
abstruse parts of it. But not the wisdom admired and taught by the men
of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, Jewish or heathen, that
come to nought - Both they and their wisdom, and the world itself.

[1 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 2:7</span></span>

But we speak the mysterious wisdom of God, which was hidden for many
ages from all the world, and is still hidden even from "babes in
Christ;" much more from all unbelievers. Which God ordained before the
world - So far is this from coming to nought, like worldly wisdom. For
our glory - Arising from the glory of our Lord, and then to be revealed
when all worldly glory vanishes.

[1 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 2:8</span></span>

Had they known it - That wisdom. They would not have crucified -
Punished as a slave. The Lord of glory - The giving Christ this august
title, peculiar to the great Jehovah, plainly shows him to be the
supreme God. In like manner the Father is styled, "the Father of glory,"
[Eph 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017); and the Holy Ghost, "the
Spirit of glory," [Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014). The
application of this title to all the three, shows that the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost are "the God of glory;" as the only true God is called,
[Psa 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003), and [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002).

[1 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 2:9</span></span>

But this ignorance of theirs fulfils what is written concerning the
blessings of the Messiah's kingdom. No natural man hath either seen,
heard, or known, the things which God hath prepared, saith the prophet,
for them that love him. [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004)

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

But God hath revealed - Yea, and "freely given," [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012). Them to us - Even inconceivable
peace, and joy unspeakable. By his Spirit - Who intimately and fully
knows them. For the Spirit searcheth even the deep things of God - Be
they ever so hidden and mysterious; the depths both of his nature and
his kingdom.

[1 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 2:11</span></span>

For what man knoweth the things of a man - All the inmost recesses of
his mind; although men are all of one nature, and so may the more easily
know one another. So the things of God knoweth no one but the Spirit -
Who, consequently, is God.

[1 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 2:12</span></span>

Now we have received, not the spirit of the world - This spirit is not
properly received; for the men of the world always had it. But
Christians receive the Spirit of God, which before they had not.

[1 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 2:13</span></span>

Which also we speak - As well as know. In words taught by the Holy
Spirit - Such are all the words of scripture. How high a regard ought
we, then, to retain for them! Explaining spiritual things by spiritual
words; or, adapting spiritual words to spiritual things - Being taught
of the Spirit to express the things of the Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

But the natural man - That is, every man who hath not the Spirit; who
has no other way of obtaining knowledge, but by his senses and natural
understanding. Receiveth not - Does not understand or conceive. The
things of the Spirit - The things revealed by the Spirit of God, whether
relating to his nature or his kingdom. For they are foolishness to him -
He is so far from understanding, that he utterly despises, them Neither
can he know them - As he has not the will, so neither has he the power.
Because they are spiritually discerned - They can only be discerned by
the aid of that Spirit, and by those spiritual senses, which he has not.

[1 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 2:15</span></span>

But the spiritual man - He that hath the Spirit. Discerneth all the
things of God whereof we have been speaking. Yet he himself is discerned
by no man - No natural men. They neither understand what he is, nor what
he says.

[1 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 2:16</span></span>

Who - What natural man. We - Spiritual men; apostles in particular. Have
- Know, understand. The mind of Christ - Concerning the whole plan of
gospel salvation. [Isa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013)
