### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 3:1</span></span>

A season - A certain time appointed by God for its being and
continuance, which no human wit or providence can alter. And by virtue
of this appointment of God, all vicissitudes which happen in the world,
whether comforts or calamities, come to pass. Which is here added to
prove the principal proposition, That all things below are vain, and
happiness is not to be found in them, because of their great
uncertainty, and mutability, and transitoriness, and because they are so
much out of the reach and power of men, and wholly in the disposal of
God. Purpose - Not only natural, but even the voluntary actions of men,
are ordered and disposed by God. But it must be considered, that he does
not here speak of a time allowed by God, wherein all the following
things may lawfully be done, but only of a time fixed by God, in which
they are actually done.

[Ecclesiastes 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 3:2</span></span>

To die - And as there is a time to die, so there is a time to rise
again, a set time when they that lie in the grave shall be remembered.

[Ecclesiastes 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 3:3</span></span>

To kill - When men die a violent death. To heal - When he who seemed to
be mortally wounded is healed.

[Ecclesiastes 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 3:4</span></span>

To weep - When men have just occasion for weeping.

[Ecclesiastes 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 3:5</span></span>

Stones - Which were brought together in order to the building of a wall
or house. To embrace - When persons perform all friendly offices one to
another.

[Ecclesiastes 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 3:6</span></span>

To life - When men lose their estates, either by God's providence, or by
their own choice. To cast away - When a man casts away his goods
voluntarily, as in a storm, to save his life, or out of love and
obedience to God.

[Ecclesiastes 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 3:7</span></span>

To rent - When men rend their garments, as they did in great and sudden
griefs.

[Ecclesiastes 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 3:8</span></span>

To love - When God stirs up love, or gives occasion for the exercise of
it.

[Ecclesiastes 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 3:9</span></span>

What profit - Seeing then all events are out of man's power, and no man
can do or enjoy any thing at his pleasure, but only when God pleaseth,
as has been shewed in many particulars, and is as true and certain in
all others, hence it follows, that all men's labours, without God's
blessing, are unprofitable, and utterly insufficient to make them happy.

[Ecclesiastes 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 3:10</span></span>

Seen - I have diligently observed mens various employments, and the
different successes of them. Hath given - Which God hath imposed upon
men as their duty; to which therefore men ought quickly to submit.
Exercised - That hereby they might have constant matter of exercise for
their diligence, and patience, and submission to God's will and
providence.

[Ecclesiastes 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 3:11</span></span>

He hath - This seems to be added as at apology for God's providence,
notwithstanding all the contrary events and confusions which are in the
world. He hath made (or doth make or do, by his providence in the
government of the world) every thing (which he doth either immediately,
or by the ministry of men, or other creatures) beautiful (convenient, so
that, all things considered, it could not have been done better) in its
time or station, (when it was most fit to be done). Many events seem to
mens shallow judgments, to be very irregular and unbecoming, as when
wicked men prosper, and good men are oppressed; but when men shall
throughly understand God's works, and the whole frame and contexture of
them, and see the end of them, they will say, all things were done
wisely. He hath set - It is true, God hath put the world into mens
hearts, or made them capable of observing all the dispensations of God
in the world; but this is to be understood with a limitation, because
there are some more mysterious works of God, which no man can fully,
understand, because he cannot search them out from the beginning to the
end.

[Ecclesiastes 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 3:12</span></span>

Them - In creatures or worldly enjoyments. To do good - To employ them
in acts of charity and liberality.

[Ecclesiastes 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 3:13</span></span>

Should eat - Use what God hath given him.

[Ecclesiastes 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 3:14</span></span>

For ever - All God's counsels or decrees are eternal and unchangeable.
Nothing - Men can neither do any thing against God's counsel and
providence, nor hinder any work or act of it. Fear - That by the
consideration of his power in the disposal of all persons and things,
men should learn to trust in him, to submit to him, to fear to offend
him, and more carefully study to please him.

[Ecclesiastes 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 3:15</span></span>

Hath been - Things past, present, and to come, are all ordered by one
constant counsel, in all parts and ages of the world. There is a
continual return of the same motions of the heavenly bodies, of the same
seasons of the year, and a constant succession of new generations of men
and beasts, but all of the same quality.

[Ecclesiastes 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 3:16</span></span>

Moreover - This is another argument of the vanity of worldly things, and
an hindrance of that comfort which men expect in this life, because they
are oppressed by their rulers. Judgment - ln the thrones of princes, and
tribunals of magistrates. Solomon is still shewing that every thing in
this world without the fear of God is vanity. In these verses he shews,
that power, of which men are so ambitious, and life itself, are worth
nothing without it.

[Ecclesiastes 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 3:17</span></span>

I said - I was sorely grieved at this, but I quieted myself with this
consideration. Shall judge - Absolving the just, and condemning the
wicked. A time - God will have his time to rectify all these disorders.
There - At the judgment - seat of God. For - For examining not only all
men's actions, but all their thoughts and purposes.

[Ecclesiastes 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 3:18</span></span>

I said - And further I considered concerning their condition in this
present world. That God - God suffers these disorders among men, that he
might discover men to themselves, and shew what strange creatures they
are, and what vile hearts they have. Beasts - That altho' God made them
men, yet they have made themselves beasts by their brutish practices,
and that, considered only with respect to the present life, they are as
vain and miserable creatures as the beasts themselves.

[Ecclesiastes 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 3:19</span></span>

For - They are subject to the same diseases, pains, and calamities. So
dieth - As certainly, and no less, painfully. One breath - One breath of
life, which is in their nostrils by which the beasts perform the same
animal operations. No pre - eminence - In respect of the present life.

[Ecclesiastes 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 3:20</span></span>

One place - To the earth, out of which they were taken. All turn - All
their bodies.

[Ecclesiastes 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 3:21</span></span>

Who knoweth? - True it is, there is a difference, which is known by good
men; but the generality of mankind never mind it: their hearts are
wholly set on present and sensible things, and take no thought for the
things of the future and invisible world.

[Ecclesiastes 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 3:22</span></span>

Better - For a man's present satisfaction. Should rejoice - That he
comfortably enjoys what God hath given him. His portion - This is the
benefit of his labours. For - When once he is dead he shall never return
to see into whose hands his estate falls.
