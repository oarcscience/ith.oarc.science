### [Jonah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 2:2</span></span>

Affliction - Straits with which he was encompassed, his body and mind
being both shut up, the one by the monstrous dungeon of the fish's
belly, and the other by the terrors of the Almighty. Heardest my voice -
Of which undoubtedly God gave him an assurance in his own soul.

[Jonah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 2:4</span></span>

I said - With myself, I thought in the midst of my fears and sufferings.
Cast out - Cut off from all hope of life, and as it were forgotten of
God. I will look - Toward heaven.

[Jonah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 2:5</span></span>

The weeds - It seems to mean, my case was as hopeless as that of a man
wrapt about with weeds in the depth of the sea.

[Jonah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 2:6</span></span>

I went down - The fish carried him down as deep in the sea as are the
bottoms of the mountains. With her bars - I seemed to be imprisoned
where the bars that secured were as durable as the rocks, which they
were made of. Yet - By what was first my danger, thou hast wonderfully
secured me. From corruption - Or the pit, a description of the state of
the dead. O Lord - In the assurance of faith, he speaks of the thing as
already done.

[Jonah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 2:7</span></span>

Thine holy temple - Heaven, the temple of his glory, whence God gives
the command for his delivery.

[Jonah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 2:8</span></span>

They - Whoever they are that depend upon idols. Mercy - The Lord, who is
to all that depend upon him, the fountain of living waters; who is an
eternal fountain of mercy, and flows freely to all that wait for him.

[Jonah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 2:9</span></span>

Vowed - Which probably was to go to Nineveh, and preach what God
commanded him. The Lord - He only can save.

[Jonah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 2:10</span></span>

Spake - Though fishes understand not as man, yet they have ears to hear
their Creator.
