### [Numbers Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 19:2</span></span>

Red - A fit colour to shadow forth the bloody nature of sin, and the
blood of Christ, from which this water and all other rites had their
purifying virtue. No blemish - A fit type of Christ. Upon which never
came yoke - Whereby may be signified, either that Christ in himself was
free from all the yoke or obligation of God's command, till for our
sakes he put himself under the law; or that Christ was not forced to
undertake our burden and cross, but did voluntarily chuse it. He was
bound and held with no other cords but those of his own love.

[Numbers 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 19:3</span></span>

Eleazar - Who was the second priest, and in some cases, the deputy of
the high - priest. To him, not to Aaron, because this service made him
unclean for a season, and consequently unfit for holy ministrations,
whereas the high - priest was, as far as possibly he could, to be
preserved from all sorts of defilement, fit for his high and holy work.
Without the camp - Partly because it was reputed an unclean and accursed
thing, being laden with the sins of all the people; and partly to
signify that Christ should suffer without the camp, in the place where
malefactors suffered.

[Numbers 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 19:4</span></span>

Before the tabernacle - Or, towards the tabernacle, standing at a good
distance from it, even without the camp, yet turning and looking towards
it. For here is no intimation that he went into the camp before this
work was done, but rather the contrary is implied, [Num
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#007.md). And because being defiled by
this work he could not come near the tabernacle, it was sufficient for
him to turn and look towards it. This signified his presenting this
blood before the Lord by way of atonement for his and the people's sins,
and his expectation of acceptance and pardon only from God, and from his
mercy - seat in the tabernacle. And this typified the satisfaction that
was made to God, by the death of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit
offered himself without spot to God, and did as it were sprinkle his own
blood before the sanctuary, when he said, Into thy hands I commend my
spirit!

[Numbers 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 19:5</span></span>

Burn the heifer - To signify the sharp and grievous sufferings of Christ
for our sins. Her blood - All of it, but what was spent in sprinkling.

[Numbers 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 19:6</span></span>

Cedar - wood, hyssop, scarlet - All which are here burnt, and as it were
offered to God, that they might be sanctified to this holy use for the
future; for of these kinds of things was the sprinkle made wherewith the
unclean were sprinkled, [Lev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#004.md).

[Numbers 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 19:7</span></span>

Shall be unclean - Partly to teach us the imperfection of the Levitical
priesthood, in which the priest himself was defiled by some parts of his
work, and partly to shew that Christ himself, though he had no sin of
his own, yet was reputed by men, and judged by God, as a sinful person,
by reason of our sins which were laid upon him.

[Numbers 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 19:9</span></span>

For a water - Or, to the water, that is, to be put to the water, or
mixed with it. Of separation - Appointed for the cleansing of them that
are in a state of separation, who for their uncleanness are separated
from the congregation. It is a purification for sin - Heb. a sin, that
is, an offering for sin, or rather a mean for expiation or cleansing of
sin. And this was a type of that purification for sin, which our Lord
Jesus made by his death.

[Numbers 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 19:10</span></span>

The stranger - A proselyte.

[Numbers 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 19:12</span></span>

With it - With the water of separation. On the third day - To typify
Christ's resurrection on that day by which we are cleansed or
sanctified.

[Numbers 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 19:13</span></span>

Whosoever toucheth - If this transgression be done presumptuously; for
if it was done ignorantly, he was only to offer sacrifice. Defiled - By
approaching to it in his uncleanness: for holy things or places were
ceremonially defiled with the touch of any unclean person or thing. Is
upon him - He continues in his guilt, not now to be washed away by this
water, but to be punished by cutting off.

[Numbers 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 19:16</span></span>

With a sword - Or by any other violent way.

[Numbers 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 19:17</span></span>

Running water - Waters flowing from a spring or river, which are the
purest. These manifestly signify God's spirit, which is oft compared to
water, and by which alone true purification is obtained. Those who
promise themselves benefit by the righteousness of Christ, while they
submit not to the influence of his spirit, do but deceive themselves;
for they cannot be purified by the ashes, otherwise than in the running
water.

[Numbers 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 19:20</span></span>

That shall not purify himself - Shall contemptuously refuse to submit to
this way of purification.

[Numbers 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 19:21</span></span>

Shall wash his clothes - Because he is unclean. It is strange, that the
same water should cleanse one person, and defile another. But God would
have it so, to teach us that it did not cleanse by any virtue in itself,
or in the work done, but only by virtue of God's appointment: to mind
the laws of the imperfection of their priesthood, and their ritual
purifications and expiations, and consequently of the necessity of a
better priest and sacrifice and way of purifying; and to shew that the
efficacy of God's ordinances doth not depend upon the person or quality
of his ministers, because the same person who, was polluted himself
could and did cleanse others. He that toucheth the water - Either by
sprinkling of it, or by being sprinkled with it; for even he that was
cleansed by it, was not fully cleansed as soon as he was sprinkled, but
only at the even of that day.

[Numbers 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 19:22</span></span>

The unclean person - Not he who is so only by touching the water of
separation, [Num 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#021.md), but he who is
so by the greater sort of uncleanness, which lasted seven days, and
which was not removed without the use of this water of purification.
