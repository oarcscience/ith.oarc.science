### [Mark Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

[Mark 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 8:1</span></span>

[Mat 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#032.md).

[Mark 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 8:8</span></span>

So they did eat - This miracle was intended to demonstrate, that Christ
was the true bread which cometh down from heaven; for he who was
almighty to create bread without means to support natural life, could
not want power to create bread without means to support spiritual life.
And this heavenly bread we stand so much in need of every moment, that
we ought to be always praying, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

[Mark 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 8:11</span></span>

Tempting him - That is, trying to ensnare him. [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md).

[Mark 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 8:12</span></span>

[Mat 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004.md).

[Mark 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 8:15</span></span>

Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod, or of the Sadducees;
two opposite extremes.

[Mark 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 8:17</span></span>

Our Lord here affirms of all the apostles, (for the question is
equivalent to an affirmation,) That their hearts were hardened; that
having eyes they saw not, having ears they heard not; that they did not
consider, neither understand: the very same expressions that occur in
the thirteenth of Matthew. And yet it is certain they were not
judicially hardened. Therefore all these strong expressions do not
necessarily import any thing more than the present want of spiritual
understanding.

[Mark 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 8:23</span></span>

He led him out of the town - It was in just displeasure against the
inhabitants of Bethsaida for their obstinate infidelity, that our Lord
would work no more miracles among them, nor even suffer the person he
had cured, either to go into the town, or to tell it to any therein.

[Mark 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 8:24</span></span>

I see men as trees walking - He distinguished men from trees only by
their motion.

[Mark 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 8:30</span></span>

He enjoined them silence for the present, That he might not encourage
the people to set him up for a temporal king; That he might not provoke
the scribes and Pharisees to destroy him before the time and, That he
might not forestall the bright evidence which was to be given of his
Divine character after his resurrection.

[Mark 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#031.md)

He spake that saying openly - Or in express terms. Till now he had only
intimated it to them. And Peter taking hold of him - Perhaps by the arms
or clothes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 8:33</span></span>

Looking on his disciples - That they might the more observe what he said
to Peter.

[Mark 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 8:34</span></span>

And when he called the people - To hear a truth of the last importance,
and one that equally concerned them all. Let him deny himself - His own
will, in all things small and great, however pleasing, and that
continually: And take up his cross - Embrace the will of God, however
painful, daily, hourly, continually. Thus only can he follow me in
holiness to glory.

[Mark 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 8:35</span></span>

whatever I have said (particularly of self denial and the daily cross)
both by word and action. [Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md);
[Luk 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026.md); [Luk
