### [2 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 15:1</span></span>

Spirit of God - Both to instruct him what to say, and to enable him to
say it plainly and boldly.

[2 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 15:3</span></span>

Now Israel - They have long lived without the found knowledge and
worship of the true God. Israel is here understood of the whole nation
of Israel in former times, and especially in the times of the judges:
for then many times they were in a great measure, without God and his
law, and teaching priests, as plainly appears from the book of the
Judges; they were brought to all the exigencies and calamities
following; and they sometimes turned to the Lord, and he was found of
them.

[2 Chronicles 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 15:5</span></span>

In those times - When Israel lived in the gross neglect of God and his
law. No peace - Men could not go abroad about their private occasions
without great danger; as it was in the days of Shamgar, [Jdg
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006).

[2 Chronicles 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 15:6</span></span>

And nation, &c. - One part of the people of Israel destroyed the other
by civil wars. As all Israel are called a nation, so the several tribes
of them are sometimes called nations.

[2 Chronicles 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 15:7</span></span>

Be strong - Go on resolutely to maintain God's worship and to root out
idolatry, as you have begun to do; for this is the only method of
preserving yourselves from such calamities as your predecessors have
felt.

[2 Chronicles 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 15:8</span></span>

Of Oded - Of Azariah, [Ch2 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#001), who
was also called by his father's name Oded.

[2 Chronicles 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 15:12</span></span>

Into covenant - The matter of this covenant was nothing but what they
were before obliged to. And tho' no promise could lay any higher
obligation upon them, than they were already under, yet it would help to
increase their sense of the obligation, and to arm them against
temptations. And by joining all together in this, they strengthened the
hands of each other

[2 Chronicles 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 15:15</span></span>

Rejoiced at the oath - The times of renewing our covenant with God,
should be times of rejoicing. It is an honour and happiness to be in
bonds with God. And the closer, the better.
