### [Psalms Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)

[Psalms 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 23:2</span></span>

Lie down - To repose myself at noon, as the manner was in those hot
countries. Green - Where there is both delight and plenty of provisions.

[Psalms 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 23:3</span></span>

Restoreth - Heb. He bringeth it back; from its errors and wandering. For
- Not for any worth in me, but for the glory of his justice, and
faithfulness, and goodness.

[Psalms 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 23:4</span></span>

Thy rod and thy staff - Two words denoting the same thing, and both
designing God's pastoral care over him.

[Psalms 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 23:5</span></span>

A table - Thou furnishest me with plenty of provisions and comforts. Oil
- With aromatic ointments, which were then used at great feasts; thy
comforts delight my soul. Runneth over - Thou hast given me a plentiful
portions, signified by the cup, given to the guests by the master of the
feast.
