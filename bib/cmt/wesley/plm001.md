### [Philemon Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

[Philemon 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">plm 1:1</span></span>

This single epistle infinitely transcends all the wisdom of the world.
And it gives us a specimen how Christians ought to treat of secular
affairs from higher principles. Paul a prisoner of Christ - To whom, as
such, Philemon could deny nothing. And Timotheus - This was written
before the second epistle to Timothy, [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md).

[Philemon 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">plm 1:2</span></span>

To Apphia - His wife, to whom also the business in part belonged. And
the church in thy house - The Christians who meet there.

[Philemon 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">plm 1:5</span></span>

Hearing - Probably from Onesimus.

[Philemon 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">plm 1:6</span></span>

I pray that the communication of thy faith may become effectual - That
is, that thy faith may be effectually communicated to others, who see
and acknowledge thy piety and charity.

[Philemon 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">plm 1:7</span></span>

The saints - To whom Philemon's house was open, [Plm
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md).

[Philemon 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">plm 1:8</span></span>

I might be bold in Christ - Through the authority he hath given me.

[Philemon 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">plm 1:9</span></span>

Yet out of love I rather entreat thee - In how handsome a manner does
the apostle just hint, and immediately drop, the consideration of his
power to command, and tenderly entreat Philemon to hearken to his
friend, his aged friend, and now prisoner for Christ! With what
endearment, in the next verse, does he call Onesimus his son, before he
names his name! And as soon as he had mentioned it, with what fine
address does he just touch on his former faults, and instantly pass on
to the happy change that was now made upon him! So disposing Philemon to
attend to his request, and the motives wherewith he was going to enforce
it.

[Philemon 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">plm 1:10</span></span>

Whom I have begotten in my bonds - The son of my age.

[Philemon 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">plm 1:11</span></span>

Now profitable - None should be expected to be a good servant before he
is a good man. He manifestly alludes to his name, Onesimus, which
signifies profitable.

[Philemon 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">plm 1:12</span></span>

Receive him, that is, my own bowels - Whom I love as my own soul. Such
is the natural affection of a father in Christ toward his spiritual
children.

[Philemon 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">plm 1:13</span></span>

To serve me in thy stead - To do those services for me which thou, if
present, wouldest gladly have done thyself.

[Philemon 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">plm 1:14</span></span>

That thy benefit might not be by constraint - For Philemon could not
have refused it.

[Philemon 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">plm 1:15</span></span>

God might permit him to be separated (a soft word) for a season, that
thou mightest have him for ever - Both on earth and in heaven.

[Philemon 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">plm 1:16</span></span>

In the flesh - As a dutiful servant. In the Lord - As a fellow -
Christian.

[Philemon 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">plm 1:17</span></span>

If thou accountest me a partner - So that thy things are mine, and mine
are thine.

[Philemon 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">plm 1:19</span></span>

I will repay it - If thou requirest it. Not to say, that then owest me
thyself - It cannot be expressed, how great our obligation is to those
who have gained our souls to Christ. Beside - Receiving Onesimus.

[Philemon 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">plm 1:20</span></span>

Refresh my bowels in Christ - Give me the most exquisite and Christian
pleasure.

[Philemon 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">plm 1:22</span></span>

Given to you - Restored to liberty.
