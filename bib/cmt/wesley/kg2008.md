### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 8:1</span></span>

Sojourn - In any convenient place out of the land of Israel. The Lord,
&c. - Hath appointed to bring a famine. This expression intimates, that
all afflictions are sent by God, and come at his call or command. Seven
years - A double time to the former famine under Elijah, which is but
just, because they were still incorrigible under all the judgments of
God, and the powerful ministry of Elisha.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 8:3</span></span>

Her house - Which having been forsaken by her, were possessed by her
kindred.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 8:4</span></span>

Gehazi the servant - Formerly his servant. The law did not forbid
conversing with lepers, but only dwelling with them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 8:8</span></span>

Enquire of the Lord, &c - In his health he bowed down in the house of
Rimmon; but now he tends to enquire of the God of Israel. Among other
instances of the change of mens minds by affliction or sickness, this is
one; that it often gives them other thoughts of God's ministers, and
teacheth them to value those whom they before hated and despised.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 8:9</span></span>

Thy son - He who before persecuted him as an enemy, now in his extremity
honours him like a father.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 8:10</span></span>

Howbeit - Here is no contradiction: for the first words contain an
answer to Benhadad's question, shall I recover? To which the answer is,
thou mayest, notwithstanding thy disease, which is not mortal. The
latter words contain the prophet's addition to that answer, which is,
that he should die, not by the power of his disease, but by some other
cause.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 8:11</span></span>

He settled - The prophet fixed his eyes upon Hazael. Until - 'Till
Hazael was ashamed, as apprehending the prophet discerned something of
an evil and shameful nature in him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 8:13</span></span>

A dog - So fierce, barbarous, and inhuman. King - And when thou shalt
have power in thy hand, thou wilt discover that bloody disposition, and
that hatred against God's people, which now lies hid from others, and
possibly from thyself.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 8:15</span></span>

Spread it - So closely, that he choaked him therewith.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 8:16</span></span>

Jehoram - Jehoram was first made king or vice - roy, by his father
divers years before this time, at his expedition to Ramoth - Gilead,
which dominion of his, ended at his father's return. But now
Jehoshaphat, being not far from his death, and having divers sons and
fearing some competition among them, makes Jehoram king the second time,
as David did Solomon upon the like occasion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 8:18</span></span>

He walked - After his father's death. The daughter - Athaliah. This
unequal marriage, though Jehoshaphat possibly designed it as a means of
uniting the two kingdoms under one head, is here and elsewhere noted, as
the cause both of the great wickedness of his posterity, and of those
sore calamities which befel them. No good could be reasonably expected
from such an union. Those that are ill matched are already half -
ruined.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 8:19</span></span>

Alway - Until the coming of the Messiah: for so long, and not longer,
this succession might seem necessary for the making good of God's
promise and covenant made with David. But when the Messiah, was once
come, there was no more need of any succession, and the scepter might
and did without any inconvenience depart from Judah, and from all the
succeeding branches of David's family, because the Messiah was to hold
the kingdom forever in his own person, though not in so gross a way as
the carnal Jews imagined. A light - A son and successor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 8:29</span></span>

Ramah - The same place with Ramoth, or Ramoth - Gilead.
