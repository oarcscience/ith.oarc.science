### [Revelation Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 17:1</span></span>

And there came one of the seven angels, saying, Come hither - This
relation concerning the great whore, and that concerning the wife of the
Lamb, [Rev 21:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md), have the same
introduction, in token of the exact opposition between them. I will show
thee the judgment of the great whore - Which is now circumstantially
described. That sitteth as a queen - In pomp, power, ease, and luxury.
Upon many waters - Many people and nations, [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 17:2</span></span>

With whom the kings of the earth - Both ancient and modern, for many
ages. Have committed fornication - By partaking of her idolatry and
various wickedness. And the inhabitants of the earth - The common
people. Have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication - No wine
can more thoroughly intoxicate those who drink it, than false zeal does
the followers of the great whore.

[Revelation 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 17:3</span></span>

And he carried me away - In the vision. Into a wilderness - The campagna
di Roma, the country round about Rome, is now a wilderness, compared to
what it was once. And I saw a woman - Both the scripture and other
writers frequently represent a city under this emblem. Sitting upon a
scarlet wild beast - The same which is described in Rev. 13:1-18. But he
was there described as he carried on his own designs only: here, as he
is connected with the whore. There is, indeed, a very close connexion
between them; the seven heads of the beast being "seven hills on which
the woman sitteth." And yet there is a very remarkable difference
between them, - between the papal power and the city of Rome. This woman
is the city of Rome, with its buildings and inhabitants; especially the
nobles. The beast, which is now scarlet - coloured, (bearing the bloody
livery, as well as the person, of the woman,) appears very different
from before. Therefore St. John says at first sight, I saw a beast, not
the beast, full of names of blasphemy - He had' before "a name of
blasphemy upon his head," [Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md);
now he has many. From the time of Hildebrand, the blasphemous titles of
the Pope have been abundantly multiplied. Having seven heads - Which
reach in a succession from his ascent out of the sea to his being cast
into the lake of fire. And ten horns - Which are contemporary with each
other, and belong to his last period.

[Revelation 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 17:4</span></span>

And the woman was arrayed - With the utmost pomp and magnificence. In
purple and scarlet - These were the colours of the imperial habit: the
purple, in times of peace; and the scarlet, in times of war. Having in
her hand a golden cup - Like the ancient Babylon, [Jer
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md). Full of abominations - The most
abominable doctrines as well as practices.

[Revelation 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 17:5</span></span>

And on her forehead a name written - Whereas the saints have the name of
God and the Lamb on their foreheads. Mystery - This very word was
inscribed on the front of the Pope's mitre, till some of the Reformers
took public notice of it. Babylon the great - Benedict XIII., in his
proclamation of the jubilee, A.D. 1725, explains this sufficiently. His
words are, "To this holy city, famous for the memory of so many holy
martyrs, run with religious alacrity. Hasten to the place which the Lord
hath chose. Ascend to this new Jerusalem, whence the law of the Lord and
the light of evangelical truth hath flowed forth into all nations, from
the very first beginning of the church: the city most rightfully called
'The Palace,' placed for the pride of all ages, the city of the Lord,
the Sion of the Holy One of Israel. This catholic and apostolical Roman
church is the head of the world, the mother of all believers, the
faithful interpreter of God and mistress of all churches." But God
somewhat varies the style. The mother of harlots - The parent,
ringleader, patroness, and nourisher of many daughters, that losely copy
after her. And abominations - Of every kind, spiritual and fleshly. Of
the earth - In all lands. In this respect she is indeed catholic or
universal.

[Revelation 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 17:6</span></span>

And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints - So that Rome
may well be called, "The slaughter - house of the martyrs." She hath
shed much Christian blood in every age; but at length she is even drunk
with it, at the time to which this vision refers. The witnesses of Jesus
- The preachers of his word. And I wondered exceedingly - At her cruelty
and the patience of God.

[Revelation 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 17:7</span></span>

I will tell thee the mystery - The hidden meaning of this.

[Revelation 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 17:8</span></span>

The beast which thou sawest (namely, [Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003).md) was, &c. - This is a very
observable and punctual description of the beast, [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008.md), [Rev
17:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010.md). His whole duration is here
divided into three periods, which are expressed in a fourfold manner.
He, 1. Was; 2 And is not; 3. And will ascend out of the bottomless pit,
and go into perdition. He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3. And will be again.
The seven heads are seven hills and seven kings: 1. Five are fallen; 2.
One is; 3. The other is not come; and when he cometh, he must continue a
short space. He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3 Even he is the eighth, and is
one of the seven, and goeth into perdition. The first of these three is
described in Rev. 13:1-18. This was past when the angel spoke to St.
John. The second was then in its course; the third woe to come. And is
not - The fifth phial brought darkness upon his kingdom: the woman took
this advantage to seat herself upon him. Then it might be said, He is
not. Yet shall he afterwards ascend out of the bottomless pit - Arise
again with diabolical strength and fury. But he will not reign long:
soon after his ascent he goeth into perdition for ever.

[Revelation 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 17:9</span></span>

Here is the mind that hath wisdom - Only those who are wise will
understand this. The seven heads are seven hills.

[Revelation 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 17:10</span></span>

And they are seven kings - Anciently there were royal palaces on all the
seven Roman bills. These were the Palatine, Capitoline, Coelian,
Exquiline, Viminal, Quirinal, Aventine hills. But the prophecy respects
the seven hills at the time of the beast, when the Palatine was deserted
and the Vatican in use. Not that the seven heads mean hills distinct
from kings; but they have a compound meaning, implying both together.
Perhaps the first head of the beast is the Coelian hill, and on it the
Lateran, with Gregory VII. and his successors; the second, the Vatican
with the church of St. Peter, chosen by Boniface VIII. the third, the
Quirinal, with the church of St. Mark, and the Quirinal palace built by
Paul II. and the fourth, the Exquiline hill, with the temple of St.
Maria Maggiore, where Paul V. reigned. The fifth will be added
hereafter. Accordingly, in the papal register, four periods are
observable since Gregory VII. In the first almost all the bulls made in
the city are dated in the Lateran; in the second, at St. Peter's; in the
third, at St. Mark's, or in the Quirinal; in the fourth, at St. Maria
Maggiore. But no fifth, sixth, or seventh hill has yet been the
residence of any Pope. Not that the hill was deserted, when another was
made the papal residence; but a new one was added to the other sacred
palaces. Perhaps the times hitherto mentioned might be fixed thus: 1058
Wings are given to the woman. 1077 The beast ascends out of the sea.
1143 The forty - two months begin. 1810 The forty - two months end. 1832
The beast ascends out of the bottomless pit. 1836 The beast finally
overthrown.
