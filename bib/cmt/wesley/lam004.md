<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 4:1</span></span>

The top - Are scattered in the head of every street.

[Lamentations 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 4:2</span></span>

Earthen pitchers - The nobles, the priests, and the good men, are looked
upon no better than earthen vessels, the workmanship of an ordinary
potter.

[Lamentations 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 4:3</span></span>

Cruel - The Jewish women are become cruel to their children, or forced
to appear so, having through the famine no milk to give them, nor any
thing to relieve them. Ostriches - Like ostriches that lay their eggs,
and leave them in the sand.

[Lamentations 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 4:6</span></span>

Of Sodom - Their punishment was greater, because more lingering, and
gradual, whereas Sodom was overthrown in a moment, and that by no human
hands that abode upon her, causing her a continued torment.

[Lamentations 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 4:7</span></span>

either in respect of birth, education, estate, or place of magistracy,
were distinguished from the rest of the people.

Not known - So that those who before knew them, do not know them now.

[Lamentations 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 4:13</span></span>

Priests - The ecclesiastical men were a great cause of the first and
last destruction of Jerusalem. And so they are of most other places that
come to ruin, through their neglect of their duty, or encouraging others
in their wicked courses.

[Lamentations 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 4:14</span></span>

They - The prophets and priests wandered up and down the streets
polluting themselves with blood, either the blood of the children which
they slew, or the just men, mentioned [Lam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md), the slaughter of whom they
either encouraged, or at least did not discourage; so that one could not
touch a prophet or priest, but he must be legally polluted, and there
were so many of them, that men could not walk in the streets, but he
must touch some of them.

[Lamentations 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 4:15</span></span>

Touch not - The Jews that made conscience of keeping the law against
touching dead bodies, cried to the other Jews to leave the city as
themselves did, the city being now so full of dead bodies that they
could not stay in it without polluting themselves.

[Lamentations 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 4:16</span></span>

The anger - These words seem to be the language of their enemies
triumphing over them. They - Their enemies had no regard to the most
venerable persons among them.

[Lamentations 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 4:17</span></span>

A nation - The Egyptians.

[Lamentations 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 4:18</span></span>

They - The Chaldeans.

[Lamentations 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 4:20</span></span>

The anointed - Zedekiah, who though a bad man yet afforded some
protection to the Jews. We said - We promised ourselves that though the
land of Judah was encompassed with Pagan nations, yet through Zedekiah's
valour and good conduct we should live comfortably.

[Lamentations 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 4:21</span></span>

Rejoice - The prophet speaks ironically, Rejoice; but thy joy shall be
but for a little time. Drunken - Thou shalt be intoxicated with it, and
make thyself naked as drunken men sometimes do.

[Lamentations 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 4:22</span></span>

Captivity - Not for thy past sins. Thy sins - By the punishment of them.
