### [Deuteronomy Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 22:1</span></span>

Thy brother's - Any man's. Thou shalt not hide thyself - Dissemble or
pretend that thou dost not see them; or pass them by as if thou hadst
not seen them.

[Deuteronomy 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 22:2</span></span>

To thine own house - To be used like thine own cattle.

[Deuteronomy 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 22:3</span></span>

Hide thyself - Dissemble that thou hast found it. Or, hide it, that is,
conceal the thing lost.

[Deuteronomy 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 22:5</span></span>

Shall not wear - Namely, ordinarily or unnecessarily, for in some cases
this may be lawful, as to make an escape for one's life. Now this is
forbidden, both for decency sake, that men might not confound those
sexes which God hath distinguished, that all appearance of evil might be
avoided, such change of garments carrying a manifest sign of effeminacy
in the man, of arrogance in the woman, of lightness and petulancy in
both; and also to cut off all suspicions and occasions of evil, which
this practice opens a wide door to.

[Deuteronomy 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 22:7</span></span>

Let the dam go - Partly for the bird's sake, which suffered enough by
the loss of its young; for God would not have cruelty exercised towards
the brute creatures: and partly for mens sake, to refrain their
greediness, that, they should not monopolize all to themselves, but
leave the hopes of a future seed for others.

[Deuteronomy 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 22:8</span></span>

A battlement - A fence or breastwork, because the roofs of their houses
were made flat, that men might walk on them. Blood - The guilt of blood,
by a man's fall from the top of thy house, thro' thy neglect of this
necessary provision. The Jew's say, that by the equity of this law, they
are obliged, and so are we, to fence or remove every thing, whereby life
may he endangered, as wells, or bridges, lest if any perish thro' our
omission, their blood be required at our hand.

[Deuteronomy 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 22:9</span></span>

Divers seeds - Either With divers kinds of seed mixed and sowed together
between the rows of vines in thy vineyard: which was forbidden to be
done in the field, [Lev 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md), and
here, in the vineyard. Or, With any kind of seed differing from that of
the vine, which would produce either herbs, or corn, or fruit - bearing
trees, whose fruit might be mingled with the fruit of the vines. Now
this and the following precepts, tho' in themselves small and trivial,
are given, according to that time and state of the church, for
instructions in greater matters, and particularly to commend to them
simplicity in all their carriage towards God and man, and to forbid all
mixture of their inventions with God's institutions in doctrine or
worship. Defiled - Legally and morally, as being prohibited by God's
law, and therefore made unclean; as on the contrary, things are
sanctified by God's word, allowing and approving them, [Ti1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md).

[Deuteronomy 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 22:10</span></span>

An ox and an ass - Because the one was a clean beast, the other unclean
whereby God would teach men to avoid polluting themselves by the touch
of unclean persons or things.

[Deuteronomy 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 22:12</span></span>

Fringes - Or laces, or strings, partly to bring the commands of God to
their remembrance, as it is expressed, [Num
15:38](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038.md), and partly is a public
profession of their nation and religion, whereby they might be
distinguished from strangers, that so they might be more circumspect to
behave as became the people of God, and that they should own their
religion before all the world. Thou coverest thyself - These words seem
restrictive to the upper garment wherewith the rest were covered.

[Deuteronomy 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 22:13</span></span>

If any man take a wife - And afterward falsely accuse her - What the
meaning of that evidence is, by which the accusation was proved false,
the learned are not agreed. Nor is it necessary for us to know: they for
whom this law was intended, undoubtedly understood it.

[Deuteronomy 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 22:19</span></span>

The father - Because this was a reproach to his family, and to himself,
as such a miscarriage of his daughter would have been ascribed to his
evil education.

[Deuteronomy 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 22:24</span></span>

She cried not - And therefore is justly presumed to have consented to
it.

[Deuteronomy 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 22:26</span></span>

Even so - Not an act of choice, but of force and constraint.

[Deuteronomy 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 22:27</span></span>

The damsel cried - Which is in that case to be presumed; charity
obliging us to believe the best, 'till the contrary be manifest.

[Deuteronomy 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 22:29</span></span>

Fifty shekels - Besides the dowry, as Philo, the learned Jew notes,
which is here omitted, because that was customary, it being sufficient
here to mention what was peculiar to this case. His wife - If her father
consented to it.

[Deuteronomy 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 22:30</span></span>

Take - To wife. So this respects the state, and the next branch speaks
of the act only.
