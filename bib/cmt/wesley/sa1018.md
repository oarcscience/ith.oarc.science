### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 18:1</span></span>

Loved him - For his excellent virtues and endowments, which shone forth
both in his speeches and actions; for the service he had done to God and
to his people; and for the similitude of their age and qualities.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 18:2</span></span>

Took him, &c. - By which it appears, that before this David had not his
constant residence at court.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 18:5</span></span>

Went - Upon military expeditions, of which that word is often used.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 18:10</span></span>

The evil spirit, &c. - His fits of frenzy returned upon him. The very
next day after he conceived envy at David, the evil spirit was permitted
by God to seize him again. Such is the fruit of envy and
uncharitableness. Prophesied - That is, he used uncouth gestures, and
signs, as the prophets often did.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 18:11</span></span>

And Saul cast the javelin - Being now quite under the power of that evil
spirit. Twice - Once now, and another time upon a like occasion, [Sa1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#010).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 18:12</span></span>

Afraid - Lest as he had gained the favour of God and of all the people,
he should also take away his kingdom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 18:13</span></span>

Removed him from him - From his presence and court; which he did,
because he feared lest David should find an opportunity to kill him, as
he had designed to kill David; because his presence now made him more
sad than ever his musick made him chearful: and principally, that hereby
he might expose him to the greatest hazards.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 18:18</span></span>

What is my life - How little is my life worth, that by the exposing of
that to some hazard, I should purchase a king's daughter! In these
expressions David sheweth not only his humility, but also his wisdom, in
discovering so deep a sense of his own meanness, that Saul might see how
far he was from aspiring at the kingdom.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 18:19</span></span>

Adriel - The son of Bar - zillai, as he is called, [Sa2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008). This was an act of great
injustice; and accordingly this marriage was accursed by God, and the
children begotten in it, were, by God's appointment cut off, [Sa2
21:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#008).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 18:26</span></span>

The days - That is, the time allowed by Saul to David for the execution
of this exploit.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 18:27</span></span>

Two hundred - He doubled the number required; to oblige Saul the more to
the performance of his promise; and to shew his great respect and
affection to Saul's daughter.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">sa1 18:30</span></span>

Went forth - To war against the Israelites, being provoked by their
former losses, and especially by that act of David's.
