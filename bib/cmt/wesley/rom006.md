### [Romans Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md)

[Romans 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 6:1</span></span>

The apostle here sets himself more fully to vindicate his doctrine from
the consequence above suggested, [Rom
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md). He had then only in strong
terms denied and renounced it: here he removes the very foundation
thereof.

[Romans 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 6:2</span></span>

Dead to sin - Freed both from the guilt and from the power of it.

[Romans 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 6:3</span></span>

As many as have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into
his death - In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ; and
we draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit, who
fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and
resurrection.

[Romans 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 6:4</span></span>

We are buried with him - Alluding to the ancient manner of baptizing by
immersion. That as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory -
Glorious power. Of the Father, so we also, by the same power, should
rise again; and as he lives a new life in heaven, so we should walk in
newness of life. This, says the apostle, our very baptism represents to
us.

[Romans 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 6:5</span></span>

For - Surely these two must go together; so that if we are indeed made
conformable to his death, we shall also know the power of his
resurrection.

[Romans 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 6:6</span></span>

Our old man - Coeval with our being, and as old as the fall; our evil
nature; a strong and beautiful expression for that entire depravity and
corruption which by nature spreads itself over the whole man, leaving no
part uninfected. This in a believer is crucified with Christ, mortified,
gradually killed, by virtue of our union with him. That the body of sin
- All evil tempers, words, and actions, which are the "members" of the
"old man," [Col 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md), might be
destroyed.

[Romans 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 6:7</span></span>

For he that is dead - With Christ. Is freed from the guilt of past, and
from the power of present, sin, as dead men from the commands of their
former masters.

[Romans 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 6:8</span></span>

Dead with Christ - Conformed to his death, by dying to sin.

[Romans 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 6:10</span></span>

He died to sin - To atone for and abolish it. He liveth unto God - A
glorious eternal life, such as we shall live also.

[Romans 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 6:12</span></span>

Let not sin reign even in your mortal body - It must be subject to
death, but it need not be subject to sin.

[Romans 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 6:13</span></span>

Neither present your members to sin - To corrupt nature, a mere tyrant.
But to God - Your lawful King.

[Romans 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 6:14</span></span>

Sin shall not have dominion over you - It has neither right nor power.
For ye are not under the law - A dispensation of terror and bondage,
which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it. But under
grace - Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings
complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful
influences of the Spirit of Christ.

[Romans 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 6:17</span></span>

The form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered - Literally it
is, The mould into which ye have been delivered; which, as it contains a
beautiful allusion, conveys also a very instructive admonition;
intimating that our minds, all pliant and ductile, should be conformed
to the gospel precepts, as liquid metal, take the figure of the mould
into which they are cast.

[Romans 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 6:18</span></span>

Being then set free from sin - We may see the apostles method thus far
at one view: -

1\. Bondage to sin [Rom 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md).

2\. The knowledge of sin by the law; a sense of God's wrath; inward
death [Rom 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md).

3\. The revelation of the righteousness of God in Christ through the
gospel [Rom 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md).

4\. The centre of all, faith, embracing that righteousness [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md).

5\. Justification, whereby God forgives all past sin, and freely accepts
the sinner [Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md).

6\. The gift of the Holy Ghost; a sense of [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md), God's love new inward life [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md).

7\. The free service of righteousness [Rom
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012.md).

[Romans 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 6:19</span></span>

I speak after the manner of men - Thus it is necessary that the
scripture should let itself down to the language of men. Because of the
weakness of your flesh - Slowness of understanding flows from the
weakness of the flesh, that is, of human nature. As ye have presented
your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, so now
present your members servants of righteousness unto holiness - Iniquity
(whereof uncleanness is an eminent part) is here opposed to
righteousness; and unto iniquity is the opposite of unto holiness.
Righteousness here is a conformity to the divine will; holiness, to the
whole divine nature. Observe, they who are servants of righteousness go
on to holiness; but they who are servants to iniquity get no farther.
Righteousness is service, because we live according to the will of
another; but liberty, because of our inclination to it, and delight in
it.

[Romans 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 6:20</span></span>

When ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness - In
all reason, therefore, ye ought now to be free from unrighteousness; to
be as uniform and zealous in serving God as ye were in serving the
devil.

[Romans 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 6:21</span></span>

Those things - He speaks of them as afar off.

[Romans 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 6:23</span></span>

Death - Temporal, spiritual, and eternal. Is the due wages of sin; but
eternal life is the gift of God - The difference is remarkable. Evil
works merit the reward they receive: good works do not. The former
demand wages: the latter accept a free gift.
