### [Exodus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 1:1</span></span>

Every man of his household - That is, children and grand - children.

[Exodus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 1:3</span></span>

And Benjamin - Who tho' youngest of all is placed before Dan, Naphtali,
&c. because they were the children of the hand - maidens.

[Exodus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 1:5</span></span>

Seventy souls - According to the computation we had, [Gen
46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md), including Joseph and his two
sons. This was just the number of the nations by which the earth was
peopled, Gen. 10:1-32, for when God separated the sons of Adam, he set
the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of
Israel, [Deu 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md).

[Exodus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 1:6</span></span>

All that generation by degrees wore off: perhaps all Jacob's sons died
much about the same time, for there was not past seven years difference
in age between the eldest and the youngest of them, except Benjamin.

[Exodus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 1:7</span></span>

And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly -
Like fishes or insects, so that they multiplied; and being generally
healthful and strong, they waxed exceeding mighty, so that the land was
filled with them, at least Goshen, their own allotment. This wonderful
increase was the product of the promise long before made to the fathers.
From the call of Abraham, when God first told him he would make him a
great nation, to the deliverance of his seed out of Egypt, was 430
years; during the first 215 of which, they were increased to 70, but in
the latter half, those 70 multiplied to 600,000 fighting men.

[Exodus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 1:8</span></span>

There arose a new king (after several successions in Joseph's time)
which knew not Joseph - All that knew him loved him, and were kind to
his relations for his sake; but when he was dead he was soon forgotten,
and the remembrance of the good offices he had done was either not
retained or not regarded. If we work for men only, our works at farthest
will die with us; if for God, they will follow us, [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md).

[Exodus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 1:10</span></span>

Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply - When men
deal wickedly it is common for them to imagine that they deal wisely,
but the folly of sin will at last be manifested before all men.

[Exodus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 1:11</span></span>

They set over them task - masters, to afflict them - With this very
design. They not only made them serve, which was sufficient for
Pharaoh's profit, but they made them serve with rigour, so that their
lives became bitter to them; intending hereby to break their spirits,
and to rob them of every thing in them that was generous: to ruin their
health, and shorten their days, and so diminish their numbers: to
discourage them from marrying, since their children would be born to
slavery; and to oblige them to desert the Hebrews, and incorporate with
the Egyptians. And 'tis to be feared the oppression they were under did
bring over many of them to join with the Egyptians in their idolatrous
worship; for we read, [Jos 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014.md), that
they served other gods in Egypt; and we find, [Eze
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008.md), that God had threatned to
destroy them for it, even while they were in the land of Egypt. Treasure
- cities - To keep the king's money or corn, wherein a great part of the
riches of Egypt consisted.

[Exodus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 1:12</span></span>

But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied - To the
grief and vexation of the Egyptians. Times of affliction, have oft been
the church's growing times: Christianity spread most when it was
persecuted.

[Exodus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 1:15</span></span>

And the king spake to the Hebrew midwives - The two chief of them. They
are called Hebrew midwives, probably not because they were themselves
Hebrews; for sure Pharaoh could never expect they should be so barbarous
to those of their own nation, but because they were generally made use
of by the Hebrews, and being Egyptians he hoped to prevail with them.

[Exodus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 1:16</span></span>

The stools - Seats used on that occasion.

[Exodus 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 1:17</span></span>

But the midwives feared God - Dreaded his wrath more than Pharaoh's, and
therefore saved the men - children alive.

[Exodus 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 1:19</span></span>

I see no reason we have to doubt the truth of this; it is plain they
were now under an extraordinary blessing of increase, which may well be
supposed to have this effect, that the women had quick and easy labour,
and the mothers and children being both lively, they seldon needed the
help of midwives; this these midwives took notice of, and concluding it
to be the finger of God, were thereby emboldened to disobey the king,
and with this justify themselves before Pharaoh, when he called them to
an account for it.

[Exodus 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 1:20</span></span>

Therefore God dealt well with them - That is, built them up in families,
and blessed their children.
