### [Job Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#001.md)

[Job 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 16:2</span></span>

Such things - These things are but vulgar and trivial. And so are all
creatures, to a soul under deep conviction of sin, or the arrest of
death.

[Job 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 16:3</span></span>

End - When wilt thou put an end to these impertinent discourses? He
retorts upon him his charge, [Job
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002.md).

[Job 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 16:7</span></span>

He - God, as appears by the following words. Weary - Either of
complaining, or, of my life. Desolate - Hast turned my society into
desolation, by destroying my children and servants.

[Job 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 16:9</span></span>

Eyes - Looks upon me with a fierce, and sparkling eye, as enraged
persons use to do.

[Job 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 16:10</span></span>

They - My friends. Gaped - Opened their mouths wide against me. In all
this Job was a type of Christ. These very expressions are used in the
predictions of his sufferings, [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013.md). They gaped upon me with their
mouths, and [Mic 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md). They shall smite
the judge of Israel upon the check.

[Job 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 16:11</span></span>

The wicked - And thus Christ was delivered into wicked hands, by the
determinate counsel of God.

[Job 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 16:12</span></span>

Shaken - As a mighty man doth with some stripling, when he wrestleth
with him. Mark - That he may shoot all his arrows in me.

[Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 16:13</span></span>

His archers - Whoever are our enemies, we must look on them as God's
archers, and see him directing the arrow.

[Job 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 16:15</span></span>

I have - So far am I from stretching out my hand against God, [Job
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#025.md), that I have humbled myself
deeply under his hand. I have not only put on sackcloth, but sewed it
on, as being resolved to continue my humiliation, as long as my
affliction continues. Defiled my horn - I have willingly parted with all
my wealth, and power, and glory (as the horn often signifies in
scripture,) and been content to lie in the dust.

[Job 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 16:17</span></span>

Not - And all this is not come upon me for any injurious dealing, but
for other reasons known to God only. Pure - I do not cast off God's fear
and service, [Job 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004.md). I do still
pray and worship God, and my prayer is accompanied with a sincere heart.

[Job 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 16:18</span></span>

Earth - The earth is said to cover that blood, which lies undiscovered
and unrevenged: but saith Job, if I be guilty of destroying any man, let
the earth disclose it; let it be brought to light. Cry - Let the cry of
my complaints to men, or prayers to God, find no place in the ears or
hearts of God or men, if this be true.

[Job 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 16:19</span></span>

Witness - Besides the witness of my conscience, God is witness of my
integrity.

[Job 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 16:22</span></span>

Go - To the state and place of the dead, whence men cannot return to
this life. The meaning is, my death hastens, and therefore I earnestly
desire that the cause depending, between me and my friends, may be
determined, that if I be guilty of these things, I may bear the shame of
it before all men, and if I be innocent, that I may see my own
integrity, and the credit of religion, (which suffers upon this
occasion) vindicated. How very certainly, and how very shortly are we
likewise to go this journey.
