### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 2:1</span></span>

His footstool - His temple; but suffered the Chaldeans to destroy it.
Cast down - That is, thrown them down from the highest glory and honour,
to the meanest degree of servitude.

[Lamentations 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 2:2</span></span>

Polluted - Dealt with them as with a polluted thing; cast them off,
brake them in pieces.

[Lamentations 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 2:3</span></span>

The horn - All their beauty and strength. Drawn back - God hath drawn
back his assistance which he was wont to give the Jews against their
enemies. Round about - God consumed them, not in this or that part, but
round about, as a fire seizing an house at once on all sides.

[Lamentations 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 2:4</span></span>

He - That is, God, (whom by their sins they had provoked and made their
enemy) behaved himself as an enemy. And slew - All their young men, and
maidens who were pleasant to look upon.

[Lamentations 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 2:6</span></span>

His tabernacle - His temple. The places - The synagogues. The king - By
the king and the priests are meant persons of greatest rank and
eminency, though it is thought here is a special reference to Zedekiah
the king of Judah, and Seraiah who was the high priest; the former of
which was miserably handled, the latter slain.

[Lamentations 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 2:7</span></span>

They - The enemies with their triumphs and blasphemies, made as great a
noise, as those that sang holy songs, or played on instruments, were
wont to make to the glory of God.

[Lamentations 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 2:8</span></span>

The wall - The strength and security of the Jews. A line - Artificers
used with lines not only to mark out places for building, but also for
destruction, to direct them what to cut off; and such a line is here
meant.

[Lamentations 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 2:9</span></span>

Among the Gentiles - In miserable captivity. The law - Is no more read,
opened or observed. Her prophets - They had but very few prophets, from
this time to the time of the gospel, and very few of those at this time
alive had any revelation from God.

[Lamentations 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 2:10</span></span>

The virgins - The whole city is in a mournful posture.

[Lamentations 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 2:11</span></span>

Mine eyes - This whole verse is but expressive of the prophets great
affliction for the miseries come upon the Jews. He wept himself almost
blind. Bowels - His passion had disturbed his bodily humours, that his
bowels were troubled. Liver - His gall lying under his liver. All these
are expressions of great affliction and sorrow. Swoon - During the
famine, occasioned by the long siege.

[Lamentations 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 2:12</span></span>

Bosom - When they died in their mother's arms.

[Lamentations 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 2:13</span></span>

Who - There was no people whose condition was in any degree parallel to
the misery of the Jews: nor was there any cure for them, their breach
was like a sea breach where the waters come in with such a torrent, that
there is no making any defence against them.

[Lamentations 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 2:14</span></span>

The prophets - False prophets told you vain stories. Not discovered -
Whereas they ought to have made you sensible of your sins, and this
might have prevented your captivity. False burdens - False stories to
encourage you in sin, and so cause your banishment.

[Lamentations 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 2:18</span></span>

O wall - That is, those that are upon it.

[Lamentations 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 2:20</span></span>

Whom - Not the Heathen, but to thy own people. Women - Wilt thou suffer
women to satisfy their hunger with the fruit of their own bodies?

[Lamentations 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 2:22</span></span>

My terrors - As my people were wont to be called together from all parts
in a solemn day, so now my terrible enemies, or terrible things are by
thee called together.
