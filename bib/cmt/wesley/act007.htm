<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">act 7:2</A></FONT></span></p>And he said - St. Stephen had been accused of blasphemy against Moses, and even against God; and of speaking against the temple and the law, threatening that Jesus would destroy the one, and change the other. In answer to this accusation, rehearsing as it were the articles of his historical creed, he speaks of God with high reverence, and a grateful sense of a long series of Acts of goodness to the Israelites, and of Moses with great respect, on account of his important and honourable employments under God: of the temple with regard, as being built to the honour of God; yet not with such superstition as the Jews; putting them in mind, that no temple could comprehend God. And he was going on, no doubt, when he was interrupted by their clamour, to speak to the last point, the destruction of the temple, and the change of the law by Christ. Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken - The sum of his discourse is this: I acknowledge the glory of God revealed to the fathers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002">Act 7:2</A>, the calling of Moses, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034">Act 7:34</A> &amp;c; the dignity of the law, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008">Act 7:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038">Act 7:38</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044">Act 7:44</A>; the holiness of this place, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#007">Act 7:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045">Act 7:45</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047">Act 7:47</A>. And indeed the law is more ancient than the temple; the promise more ancient than the law. For God showed himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their children freely, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002">Act 7:2</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009">Act 7:9</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#017">Act 7:17</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#032">Act 7:32</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034">Act 7:34-35</A> and they showed faith and obedience to God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004">Act 7:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020">Act 7:20</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023">Act 7:23</A> particularly by their regard for the law, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008">Act 7:8</A> and the promised land, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016">Act 7:16</A>. Meantime, God never confined his presence to this one place or to the observers of the law. For he hath been acceptably worshipped before the law was given, or the temple built, and out of this land, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002">Act 7:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009">Act 7:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#033">Act 7:33</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044">Act 7:44</A>. And that our fathers and their posterity were not tied down to this land, their various sojournings, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004">Act 7:4</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014">Act 7:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#029">Act 7:29</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044">Act 7:44</A> and exile, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043">Act 7:43</A>, show. But you and your fathers have always been evil, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009">Act 7:9</A> have withstood Moses, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025">Act 7:25</A>, &amp;c; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039">Act 7:39</A>, &amp;c;  have despised the land, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039">Act 7:39</A>, forsaken God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040">Act 7:40</A>, &amp;c, superstitiously honoured the temple, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048">Act 7:48</A>, resisted God and his Spirit, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#050">Act 7:50</A>, killed the prophets and the Messiah himself, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051">Act 7:51</A>, and kept not the law for which ye contend, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053">Act 7:53</A>. Therefore God is not bound to you; much less to you alone. And truly this solemn testimony of Stephen is most worthy of his character, as a man full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith and power: in which, though he does not advance so many regular propositions, contradictory to those of his adversaries, yet he closely and nervously answers them all. Nor can we doubt but he would, from these premises, have drawn inferences touching the destruction of the temple, the abrogation of the Mosaic law, the punishment of that rebellious people; and above all, touching Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah, had not his discourse been interrupted by the clamours of the multitude, stopping their ears, and rushing upon him. Men, brethren, and fathers - All who are here present, whether ye are my equals in years, or of more advanced age. The word which in this and in many other places is rendered men is a mere expletive. The God of glory - The glorious God, appeared to Abraham before he dwelt in Haran - Therefore Abraham knew God, long before he was in this land. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001">Gen 12:1</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 7:3</A></FONT></span></p>Which I will show thee - Abraham knew not where he went.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">act 7:4</A></FONT></span></p>After his father was dead - While Terah lived, Abraham lived partly with him, partly in Canaan: but after he died, altogether in Canaan.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">act 7:5</A></FONT></span></p>No, not to set his foot on - For the field mentioned, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016">Act 7:16</A>, he did not receive by a Divine donation, but bought it; even thereby showing that he was a stranger in the land. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006">Acts 7:6</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009">Acts 7:9</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">act 7:14</A></FONT></span></p>Seventy - five souls - So the seventy interpreters, (whom St. Stephen follows,) one son and a grandson of Manasseh, and three children of Ephraim, being added to the seventy persons mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027">Gen 46:27</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#016">Acts 7:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">act 7:16</A></FONT></span></p>And were carried over to Shechem - It seems that St. Stephen, rapidly running over so many circumstances of history, has not leisure (nor was it needful where they were so well known) to recite them all distinctly. Therefore he here contracts into one, two different sepulchres, places, and purchases, so as in the former history, to name the buyer, omitting the seller, in the latter, to name the seller, omitting the buyer. Abraham bought a burying place of the children of Heth, Gen. 23:1-20. There Jacob was buried. Jacob bought a field of the children of Hamor. There Joseph was buried. You see here, how St. Stephen contracts these two purchases into one. This concise manner of speaking, strange as it seems to us, was common among the Hebrews; particularly, when in a case notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to be supplied in the mind of the hearer. And laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought - The first land which these strangers bought was for a sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven. Perhaps the whole sentence might be rendered thus: So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over to Shechem, and laid by the sons (that is, decendants) of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money.

Probably, not they, but their fathers did it, and God imputes it to them. So God frequently imputes the sins of the fathers to those of their children who are of the same spirit. Him did God send to be a deliverer - Which is much more than a judge; by the hand of - That is, by means of the angel - This angel who spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai expressly called himself Jehovah, a name which cannot, without the highest presumption, be assumed by any created angel, since he whose name alone is Jehovah, is the Most High over all the earth, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018">Psa 83:18</A>. It was therefore the Son of God who delivered the law to Moses, under the character of Jehovah, and who is here spoken of as the angel of the covenant, in respect of his mediatorial office.

Have ye offered to me - They had offered many sacrifices; but God did not accept them as offered to him, because they sacrificed to idols also; and did not sacrifice to him with an upright heart. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025">Amo 5:25</A>.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_055">act 7:55</A></FONT></span></p>But he looking steadfastly up to heaven, saw the glory of God - Doubtless he saw such a glorious representation, God miraculously operating on his imagination, as on Ezekiel's, when he sat in his house at Babylon, and saw Jerusalem, and seemed to himself transported thither, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1-4</A>. And probably other martyrs, when called to suffer the last extremity, have had extraordinary assistance of some similar kind. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056">Acts 7:56</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_056">act 7:56</A></FONT></span></p>I see the Son of man standing - As if it were just ready to receive him. Otherwise he is said to sit at the right hand of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057">Acts 7:57</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_057">act 7:57</A></FONT></span></p>They rushed upon him - Before any sentence passed. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058">Acts 7:58</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_058">act 7:58</A></FONT></span></p>The witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul - O Saul, couldst thou have believed, if one had told thee, that thou thyself shouldst be stoned in the same cause? and shouldst triumph in committing thy soul likewise to that Jesus whom thou art now blaspheming? His dying prayer reached thee, as well as many others. And the martyr Stephen, and Saul the persecutor, (afterward his brother both in faith and martyrdom,) are now joined in everlasting friendship, and dwell together in the happy company of those who have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059">Acts 7:59</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_059">act 7:59</A></FONT></span></p>And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit - This is the literal translation of the words, the name of God not being in the original. Nevertheless such a solemn prayer to Christ, in which a departing soul is thus committed into his hands, is such an act of worship, as no good man could have paid to a mere creature; Stephen here worshipping Christ in the very same manner in which Christ worshipped the Father on the cross.
