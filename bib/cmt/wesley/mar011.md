To Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives - The limits of Bethany
reached to the mount of Olives, and joined to those of Bethphage.
Bethphage was part of the suburbs of Jerusalem, and reached from the
mount of Olives to the walls of the city. Our Lord was now come to the
place where the boundaries of Bethany and Bethphage met. [Mat
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md); [Luk

For it was not a season of figs - It was net (as we say) a good year for
figs; at least not for that early sort, which alone was ripe so soon in
the spring. If we render the words, It was not the season of figs, that
is, the time of gathering them in, it may mean, The season was not yet:
and so (inclosing the words in a parenthesis, And coming to it, he found
nothing but leaves) it may refer to the former part of the sentence, and
may be considered as the reason of Christ's going to see whether there
were any figs on this tree. Some who also read that clause in a
parenthesis, translate the hollowing words, for where he was, it was the
season of figs. And it is certain, this meaning of the words suits best
with the great design of the parable, which was to reprove the Jewish
Church for its unfruitfulness at that very season, when fruit might best
be expected from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 11:16</span></span>

He suffered not that any should carry a vessel through the temple - So
strong notions had our Lord, of even relative holiness! And of the
regard due to those places (as well as times) that are peculiarly
dedicated to God.

They feared him - That is, they were afraid to take him by violence,
lest it should raise a tumult; because all the people was astonished at
his teaching - Both at the excellence of his discourse, and at the
majesty and authority with which he taught.

Have faith in God - And who could find fault, if the Creator and
Proprietor of all things were to destroy, by a single word of his mouth,
a thousand of his inanimate creatures, were it only to imprint this
important lesson more deeply on one immortal spirit?

[Mark 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 11:25</span></span>
