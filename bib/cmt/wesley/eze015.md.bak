### [Ezekiel Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 15:2</span></span>

The vine - tree - Israel is here compared to a vine, which, when
fruitless, is utterly unprofitable. This the prophet minds them of to
humble them, and awaken them to fruitfulness. A branch - One branch of a
tree in the forest is of more use than the whole vine - tree is, except
for its fruit.

[Ezekiel 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 15:3</span></span>

A pin - Will it afford even a pin to drive into a wall or post, on which
you may safely fasten any weight.

[Ezekiel 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 15:4</span></span>

For fuel - When for its barrenness it is cut down, it is fit only to
burn.

[Ezekiel 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 15:6</span></span>

Given - Doomed for food to the fire.

[Ezekiel 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 15:8</span></span>

Because - They have been so perpetually trespassing, that it seems a
continued act.
