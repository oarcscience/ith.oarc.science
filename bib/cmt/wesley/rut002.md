### [Ruth Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#001)

[Ruth 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 2:2</span></span>

Glean - Which was permitted to the poor, and the stranger, [Deu
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#019), nor was she ashamed to confess
her poverty, nor would she eat the bread of idleness. In whose sight -
For though it was their duty to permit this, yet she thought it might
perhaps be denied her; at least, that it became her modestly and humbly
to acknowledge their kindness herein.

[Ruth 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rut 2:3</span></span>

Her hap - It was a chance in reference to second causes, but ordered by
God's providence. God wisely orders small events, even those that seem
altogether contingent. Many a great affair is brought about by a little
turn, fortuitous as to men, but designed by God.

[Ruth 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 2:4</span></span>

Said, &c - They expressed their piety, even in their civil conversation,
and worldly transactions; which now so many are ashamed of.

[Ruth 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rut 2:7</span></span>

I pray - She did not boldly intrude herself, but modestly ask leave of
us. 'Till now - She is not retired through idleness, for she hath been
diligent and constant in her labours. The house - In the little house or
tent, which was set up in the fields at these times, and was necessary
in those hot countries, where the labourers might retire for a little
repose or repast. Being weary with her continued labours, she comes
hither to take a little rest.

[Ruth 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 2:8</span></span>

Maidens - Not by the young men, to avoid both occasion of sin, and
matter of scandal. Herein he shews his piety and prudence.

[Ruth 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 2:9</span></span>

Touch - So as to offer any incivility or injury to thee.

[Ruth 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rut 2:10</span></span>

Fell - This was the humblest posture of reverence, either civil when
performed to men, or religious, when to God. Take knowledge - That is,
shew any respect and kindness to me.

[Ruth 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 2:12</span></span>

Wings - That is, protection and care. An allusion either to hens, which
protect and cherish their young ones under their wings; or to the wings
of the Cherubim, between which God dwelt.

[Ruth 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 2:13</span></span>

Tho' I be not - I humbly implore the continuance of thy good opinion of
me, though I do not deserve it, being a person more mean, necessitous,
and, obscure, a stranger, and one born of heathen parents, and not of
the holy and honourable people of Israel, as they are.

[Ruth 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 2:14</span></span>

She sat - Not with or among them, but at some little distance from them,
as one inferior to them. It is no disparagement to the finest hand, to
be reached forth to the needy.

[Ruth 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 2:17</span></span>

An Ephah - About a bushel.

[Ruth 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 2:18</span></span>

Reserved - At dinner, after she had eaten and was sufficed, or
satisfied.

[Ruth 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 2:19</span></span>

Where hast thou gleaned to - day? - It is a good question to ask
ourselves in the evening, "Where have I gleaned to - day?" What
improvements have I made in grace or knowledge? What have I learned or
done, which will turn to account?

[Ruth 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rut 2:20</span></span>

To the dead - That is, which he formerly shewed to those who are now
dead, my husband and his sons whilst they were living, and now continues
to us.

[Ruth 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rut 2:21</span></span>

Harvest - Both barley - harvest, and wheat - harvest. She tells what
kindness Boaz had shewed her; but not, how he had commended her.
Humility teaches not only not to praise ourselves, but not to be forward
in repeating the praise which others have given us.

[Ruth 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rut 2:22</span></span>

Other field - Whereby thou wilt both expose thyself to many
inconveniences, which thou mayst expect from strangers; and incur his
displeasure, as if thou didst despise his kindness.
