High places - It is hard to get clear of those corruptions, which by
long usage have gained prescription.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 14:6</span></span>

Slew not - Wherein he shewed faith and courage, that he would obey this
command of God, though it was hazardous to himself, such persons being
likely to seek revenge for their father's death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 14:7</span></span>

Joktheel - Which signifies, the obedience of God, that is, given him by
God as a reward of his obedience to God's message by the prophet, [Ch2

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 14:8</span></span>

Sent - This challenge he sent, from self - confidence, and a desire of
advancing his glory. But he that is fond either of fighting or going to
law, will probably be the first that repents it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 14:9</span></span>

Saying, &c. - By the thistle, a low and contemptible, yet troublesome
shrub, he understands Amaziah; and by the cedar, himself, whom he
intimates to be far stronger than he, and out of his reach. Trod down -
And with no less ease shall my soldiers tread down thee and thy forces.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 14:10</span></span>

Glory - Content thyself with that glory, and let not thine ambition
betray thee to ruin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 14:12</span></span>

Tents - Josephus says, when they were to engage, they were struck with
such a terror, that they did not strike a stroke, but every man made the
best of his way.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 14:13</span></span>

Ahaziah - Amaziah's pedigree comes in somewhat abruptly, the son of
Joash, the son of Ahaziah: Probably because he now smarted, for the
iniquity of his ancestors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 14:20</span></span>

On horses - Or, with horses, in a chariot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 14:21</span></span>

Azariah - This Azariah is called Uzziah, [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030), both names signifying the same
thing for substance; that, God's help; and this, God's strength. But
this was not done till twelve years after his father's death: so long
the government was in the hands of protectors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 14:25</span></span>

The sea - Unto the dead sea, once a goodly plain, [Gen
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010), which was their southern
border.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 14:26</span></span>

Was bitter - Whereby he was moved to pity and help them, though they
were an unworthy people. Nor any left - Both towns and country were
utterly laid waste.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 14:27</span></span>

Said not - Not yet; he had not yet declared this, as afterwards he did
by the succeeding prophets.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 14:29</span></span>

Jeroboam - It was in the reign of this Jeroboam, that Hosea began to
prophesy, and he was the first that wrote his prophecies. At the same
time Amos prophesied, soon after Micah, and then Isaiah in the days of
Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God never left himself without witness, but in
the darkest ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining
lights, to their own age, by their preaching and living; and a few by
their writings to reflect light upon us, on whom the ends of the world
are come.
