### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 2:1</span></span>

I - These are the words of the bridegroom. He compares himself to the
rose and lilly, for fragrancy and beauty. Sharon, was a very fruitful
place, and famous for roses.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 2:2</span></span>

Among - Compared with thorns, which it unspeakably exceeds in glory and
beauty. So - So far, doth my church or people, excel all other
assemblies. The title of daughter, is often given to whole nations.
These are Christ's words, to which the spouse makes the following reply.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

The apple - tree - Whose fruit is very pleasant and wholesome. The trees
- Which are barren. I sat - I confidently reposed myself under his
protection. His fruit - The benefits which I received by him, remission
of sins, faith, grace, and assurance of glory.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 2:4</span></span>

Banquetting house - The places in which believers receive the graces and
blessings of Christ. His banner - By the lifting up whereof I was
invited to come to him, and to list myself under him. Love - The love of
Christ crucified, which, like a banner, is displayed in the gospel.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 2:5</span></span>

Stay me - Or, support me, keep me from fainting. The spouse speaks this
to her bride - maids, the daughters of Jerusalem: or to the bridegroom
himself. Flaggons - With wine, which is a good cordial. Apples - With
odoriferous apples, the smell whereof was grateful to persons ready to
faint. By this understand the application of the promises, and the
quickening influences of the Spirit.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 2:6</span></span>

His hand - No sooner did I cry out for help, but he was at hand to
succour me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 2:7</span></span>

I charge you - This is spoken by the bride. By the roes - By the example
of those creatures, which are pleasant and loving in their carriage
towards one another. Nor awake - That you do not disturb nor offend him.
'Till - Never, as this word, until, in such phrases, is commonly used.
For neither can sin ever please him, nor can the church bear it that
Christ should ever be offended.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 2:8</span></span>

The voice - Christ's voice, the word of grace revealed outwardly in the
gospel, and inwardly by the Spirit of God. Leaping - He saith, leaping
and skipping, to denote that Christ came readily, and swiftly, with
great desire and pleasure and adds, upon the mountains and hills, to
signify Christ's resolution to come in spite of all difficulties.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 2:9</span></span>

Like a roe - In swiftness. He is coming to me with all speed and will
not tarry a moment beyond the proper season. He standeth behind - And
while he doth for wise reasons forbear to come; he is not far from us.
Both this and the following phrases may denote the obscure manner of
Christ's manifesting himself to his people, under the law, in comparison
of his discoveries in the gospel. The window - This phrase, and that
through the lattess, intimate that the church does indeed see Christ,
but, as through a glass, darkly, as it is said even of gospel -
revelations, [Co1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md), which was
much more true of legal administrations.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 2:10</span></span>

Spake - Invited me outwardly by his word, and inwardly by his Spirit.
Rise up - Shake off sloth, and disentangle thyself more fully from all
the snares of this world. Come - Unto me, and with me; follow me fully,
serve me perfectly, labour for a nearer union, and more satisfying
communion with me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 2:11</span></span>

The winter - Spiritual troubles arising from a deep sense of the guilt
of sin, the wrath of God, the curse of the law; all which made them
afraid to come unto God. But, saith Christ, I have removed these
impediments, God is reconciled; therefore cast off all discouragements,
and excuses, and come to me.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 2:12</span></span>

The flowers - The communications of God's grace, the gifts, and graces,
and comforts of the Holy Spirit, are vouchsafed unto, and appear in
believers, as buds and blossoms do in the spring. The turtle - This
seems particularly to be mentioned because it not only gives notice of
the spring, but aptly represents the Spirit of God, which even the
Chaldee paraphrast understands by this turtle, which appeared in the
shape of a dove, and which worketh a dove - like meekness, and chastity,
and faithfulness, in believers.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 2:13</span></span>

Her figs - Which it shoots forth in the spring.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 2:14</span></span>

My dove - So the church is called, for her dove - like temper, and for
her dove - like condition, because she is weak, and exposed to
persecution, and therefore forced to hide herself in rocks. The stairs -
In the holes of craggy and broken rocks, which resemble stairs. Let me
see - Be not afraid to appear before me. Hear - Thy prayers and praises.
For - Thy person and services are amiable in my sight.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 2:15</span></span>

Take us - The bridegroom gives this charge to his bridemen or friends.
By whom he understands those magistrates and ministers to whom, under
Christ, the custody of the vineyards, the churches, principally belong.
These he commands to take the foxes, to restrain them from doing this
mischief. Foxes - The disturbers of the vineyard, or the church,
seducers or false teachers. Little foxes - This he adds for more
abundant caution, to teach the church to prevent errors and heresies in
the beginnings. Spoil vines - Which foxes do many ways, by gnawing and
breaking the little branches and leaves, by digging holes in the
vineyards, and so spoiling the roots. Tender grapes - Which are easily
spoiled, if great care be not used to prevent it.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 2:16</span></span>

My beloved - These are the words of the bride, who having come to him
upon his gracious invitation, now maketh her boast of him. He feedeth -
Abideth and refresheth himself amongst his faithful people, who are
compared to lillies, [Sol 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002.md).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 2:17</span></span>

Until - Until the morning of that blessed day of the general
resurrection, when all the shadows, not only of ignorance, and sin, and
calamity, but even of outward administrations, shall cease. Turn -
Return to me. For although Christ had come to her, and she had gladly
received him, yet he was gone again, as is here implied, and evidently
appears from the following verse. Which sudden change is very agreeable
to the state of God's people in this world, where they are subject to
frequent changes. A roe - In swiftness; make haste to help me. Of Bether
- A place in the land of promise, where it seems those creatures were in
great abundance.
