### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 10:1</span></span>

Strange fire - Fire so called, because not taken from the altar, as it
ought, but from some common fire. Before the Lord - Upon the altar of
incense. Which he commanded not - Not commanding may be here put for
forbidding, as it is, [Jer 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035.md). Now
as this was forbidden implicitly; [Lev
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012.md), especially when God himself made
a comment upon that text, and by sending fire from heaven declared of
what fire he there spake; so it is more than probable it was forbidden
expressly, though that be not here mentioned, nor was it necessary it
should be.

[Leviticus 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 10:2</span></span>

From the Lord - From heaven, or rather from the sanctuary. Devoured them
- Destroyed their lives; for their bodies and garments were not
consumed. Thus the sword is said to devour, [Sa2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#026.md). Thus lightning many times kill
persons, without any hurt to their garments.

[Leviticus 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 10:3</span></span>

The Lord spake - Though the words be not recorded in scripture, where
only the heads of discourses are contained, yet it is probable they were
uttered by Moses in God's name. Howsoever the sense of them is in many
places. I will be sanctified - This may note, either, their duty to
sanctify God, to demean themselves with such care, and reverence, and
watchfulness, as becomes the holiness of the God whom they serve; whence
he leaves them to gather the justice of the present judgment. Or, God's
purpose to sanctify himself, to manifest himself to be an holy and
righteous God by his severe and impartial punishment of all
transgressors, how near soever they are to him. That come nigh me - Who
draw near to me, or to the place where I dwell, and are admitted into
the holy place, whence others are shut out. It is a description of the
priests. I will be glorified - As they have sinned publickly and
scandalously, so I will vindicate my honour in a public and exemplary
manner, that all men may learn to give me the glory of my holiness by an
exact conformity to my laws. And Aaron held his peace - In
acknowledgment of God's justice and submission to it. He murmured not,
nor replied against God.

[Leviticus 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 10:4</span></span>

Moses called Mishael - For Aaron and his sons were employed in their
holy ministrations, from which they were not called for funeral
solemnities. Brethren - That is, kinsmen, as that word is oft used. Out
of the camp - Where the burying - places of the Jews were, that the
living might neither be annoyed by the unwholesome scent of the dead,
nor defiled by the touch of their graves.

[Leviticus 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 10:5</span></span>

In their coats - In the holy garments wherein they ministered; which
might be done, either, as a testimony of respect due to them,
notwithstanding their present failure; and that God in judgment
remembered mercy, and when he took away their lives, spared their souls.
Or, because being polluted both by their sin, and by the touch of their
dead bodies, God would not have them any more used in his service.

[Leviticus 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 10:6</span></span>

Uncover not your head - That is, give no signification of your sorrow;
mourn not for them; partly lest you should seem to justify your
brethren, and tacitly reflect upon God as too severe; and partly lest
thereby you should be diverted from, or disturbed in your present
service, which God expects to be done chearfully. But bewail the burning
- Not so much in compassion to them, as in sorrow for the tokens of
divine displeasure.

[Leviticus 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 10:7</span></span>

Ye shall not go from the tabernacle - Where at this time they were,
because this happened within seven days of their consecration. The oil
of the Lord is upon you - You are persons consecrated peculiarly to
God's service, which therefore it is just you should prefer before all
funeral solemnities.

[Leviticus 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 10:9</span></span>

Drink not wine - it is not improbable, that the sin of Nadab and Abihu
was owing to this very thing. But if not, yet drunkenness is so odious a
sin in itself, especially in a minister, and most of all in the time of
his administration of sacred things, that God saw fit to prevent all
occasions of it. And hence the devil, who is God's ape, required this
abstinence from his priests in their idolatrous service.

[Leviticus 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 10:10</span></span>

Between holy and unholy - Persons and things, which Nadab and Abihu did
not.

[Leviticus 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 10:11</span></span>

Ye may teach - Which drunken persons are very unfit to do.

[Leviticus 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 10:12</span></span>

Eat it - Moses repeats the command, partly lest their grief should cause
them to neglect their meat prescribed by God, (which abstinence would
have been both a signification of their sorrow which God had forbidden
them, and a new transgression of a divine precept;) and partly to
encourage them to go on in their holy services, and not to be dejected,
as if God would no more accept them or their sacrifices.

[Leviticus 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 10:13</span></span>

In the holy place - in the court, near the altar of burnt - offerings.

[Leviticus 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 10:14</span></span>

In a clean place - In any of your dwellings, or any place in the camp,
which was kept clean from all ceremonial defilement. In any place where
the women as well as the men might come, for the daughters of the priest
might eat these as well as their sons, if they were maids, or widows, or
divorced, [Lev 22:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#011.md).

[Leviticus 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 10:16</span></span>

He was angry with Eleazar - He spares Aaron at this time, as overwhelmed
with sorrow, and because the rebuking him before his sons might have
exposed him to some contempt; but he knew that the reproof though
directed to them, would concern him too. Who were left alive - And
therefore ought to have taken warning.

[Leviticus 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 10:17</span></span>

God hath given it to you - As a reward of your service, whereby you
expiate, bear, and take away their sins, by offering those sacrifices,
by which God through Christ is reconciled to the penitent and believing
offerers.

[Leviticus 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 10:18</span></span>

The blood was not brought in - Because Aaron was not yet admitted into
the holy place, whither that blood should have been brought, 'till he
had prepared the way by the sacrifices which were to be offered in the
court.

[Leviticus 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 10:19</span></span>

They have offered - They have done the substance of the thing, though
they have mistaken this one circumstance. Such things - Whereby, haying
been oppressed with grief, it is not strange nor unpardonable if I have
mistaked. Should it have been accepted - Because it was not to be eaten
with sorrow, but with rejoicing and thanksgiving.

[Leviticus 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 10:20</span></span>

He rested satisfied with his answer. it appeared, that Aaron sincerely
aimed at pleasing God: and those who do so, will find he is not extreme
to mark what is done amiss.
