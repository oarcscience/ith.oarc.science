### [Isaiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 8:1</span></span>

A roll - Or, a great volume, because the prophecy to be written in it
was large, and God would have it written in large and legible
characters. Pen - With such a pen as writers use. Concerning -
Concerning that thing which is signified by the name of the child, which
is here mentioned by way of anticipation.

[Isaiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 8:3</span></span>

Prophetess - To his own wife, so called, because the wife of a prophet.

[Isaiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 8:4</span></span>

To cry - To speak and to know his parents; which is within the space of
two years. And his agrees with the other prophecy, [Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md). Before the child shall know to
refuse the evil and chuse the good, which requires a longer time than to
distinguish his parents, and suits well to Shear - Jashub, who, being
born some years before, was capable of that farther degree of knowledge,
as soon as this was capable of the lower degree. Before - In his
presence, and by himself and his forces.

[Isaiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 8:6</span></span>

This people - The people of Israel, of whom he last spake, who rejoiced
not only in their own king, but also in the assistance of so powerful an
ally as Rezin. Shiloah - That small brook which ran by Jerusalem. Hereby
he understands the munitions and strength of the Jews, which their
enemies derided.

[Isaiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 8:7</span></span>

The river - Of Euphrates, called the river, for its eminent greatness;
whereby he understands the Assyrian forces. Glory - His numerous and
puissant army. He - This great river shall overflow its own proper
channels. That is, this great monarch shall enlarge his dominions, and
add the lands of Syria and Israel to them.

[Isaiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 8:8</span></span>

Reach - So that they shall be in great danger of being desired. He
persists in the metaphor of a river swelling so high as to reach to a
man's neck, and be ready to overwhelm him. Such was the danger of
Judah's land, when Sennacherib took all the fenced cities of Judah, [Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md), and sent his army against
Jerusalem. Wings - Of his forces, or of the wings of his army, as they
still are called. My land - Of the land of Judah, so called because the
Messiah, who is called Immanuel, should be born there. And this is added
emphatically for the consolation of God's people, to assure them, that
notwithstanding this dreadful scourge, yet God would make a difference
between Israel and Judah, and whereas Israel should not be a people,
Judah should be restored, for the sake of the Messiah, to be the place
of his birth and ministry.

[Isaiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 8:9</span></span>

Ye people - Syrians and Israelites. All ye - Whosoever you be, who
conspire against Immanuel's land. Gird - Prepare yourselves for war.
Broken - This is repeated for the greater assurance of the thing, and
the comfort of God's people.

[Isaiah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 8:11</span></span>

Spake - With a vehement and more than ordinary inspiration. In the way -
Of the generality of the people of Judah; whose eminent danger and
calamity he foretells.

[Isaiah 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 8:12</span></span>

Say not - Thou Isaiah, and my children, do not consent to this
confederacy with the king of Assyria. Their fear - That thing which they
fear, that, if they do not call in the Assyrian succours, they shall be
destroyed by those two potent kings.

[Isaiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 8:13</span></span>

Sanctify - Give him the glory of his power, and goodness, and
faithfulness, by trusting to his promises. Let him - Let God, and not
the kings of Syria and Israel be the object of your fear.

[Isaiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 8:14</span></span>

Sanctuary - A sure refuge to all that truly fear him, and rely upon him.
A stone - An occasion of sin and ruin, at whom they will take offence
and stumble, so as to fall and be broken. To both - To the two kingdoms,
that of the ten tribes, and that of the two tribes. Jerusalem - Which
are distinctly mentioned, as a wonderful thing, because Jerusalem was
the seat of the temple, and of God's solemn worship, where all the means
of knowledge and grace were in greatest plenty, where the thrones of
civil and ecclesiastical judicature were established, where the most
wise and learned doctors had their constant abode. And that such a place
and people should reject Immanuel when he should appear, was so strange
an occurrence, that the prediction of it was highly necessary, lest
otherwise, when it came to pass, it should shake the faith of all who
did believe on him; whereas now the accomplishment hereof was a notable
confirmation of their faith.

[Isaiah 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 8:15</span></span>

Many - Not all; for there shall be a remnant, as was foretold, [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), [Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md). Stumble - At that stone or rock,
mentioned, [Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md). This was
accomplished at the coming of the Messiah, whom the Jews rejected to
their own destruction.

[Isaiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 8:16</span></span>

The testimony - By the testimony and the law or doctrine, he understands
one and the same thing, as he doth also, [Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md), the word of God, and especially
that which is the main scope thereof, the doctrine of the Messiah,
which, though now professed by all the Israelites, shall be disowned by
the generality of them, when the Messiah shall come. Bind up and seal
are to be understood prophetically, declare and prophesy, that it shall
be bound up and sealed. Moreover, bind up and seal, design the same
thing. Security and secrecy, signifying, that it should certainly be
fulfilled, yet withal kept secret from the unbelieving Jews. By the
disciples he means those who were taught of God.

[Isaiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 8:17</span></span>

Yet - Yet, notwithstanding this dreadful prophecy concerning the
rejection of Israel. Wait - I will cast my care upon him, and expect the
accomplishment of his promise, in sending the Messiah, and in conferring
upon me and all believing Israelites all his mercies and blessings.
Hideth - That now withdraws his favour and blessings, from the people of
Israel.

[Isaiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 8:18</span></span>

Behold - These words are literally spoken by Isaiah concerning himself,
but mystically concerning Christ; and therefore they are fitly ascribed
to Christ, [Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md). The children -
His spiritual children, whom he had either begotten or brought up by his
ministry. Wonders - Are a gazing flock, for our folly in believing God's
promises. From the Lord - Which comes to pass by the wise providence of
God. Zion - Where the temple now was, and where the Messiah was to set
up his kingdom.

[Isaiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 8:19</span></span>

And when they - The Israelites, who are fallen from God, into
superstition and idolatry. You - My children, whom the prophet arms
against the common temptation. Mutter - That speak with a low voice, as
these two words signify, which they affected to do, speaking rather
inwardly in their bellies, than audibly with their mouths. Should not -
This answer the prophet puts into their mouths, doth not every nation,
in cases of difficulty, seek to their gods? Much more should we do so,
that have the only true God for our God. For the living - That is, for
living men to enquire of the living God, is proper and reasonable; but
it is highly absurd for them to forsake him, and to seek dead idols,
either to the images, or to the spirits of dead men, which are supposed
to speak in them.

[Isaiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 8:20</span></span>

To the law - Let this dispute between you and them be determined by
God's word, which is here and in many other places called the law, to
signify their obligation to believe and obey it; and the testimony,
because it is a witness between God and man, of God's will, and of man's
duty. They - Your antagonists. No light - This proceeds from the
darkness of their minds, they are blind, and cannot see.

[Isaiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 8:21</span></span>

It - Their own land. Hungry - Sorely distressed, and destitute of food,
and all necessaries. Their king - Either because he doth not relieve
them; or because by his foolish counsels, he brought them into these
miseries. God - Their idol, to whom they trusted, and whom they now find
unable to help them. Look - To heaven for help.

[Isaiah 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 8:22</span></span>

Earth - Finding no help from heaven, they turn their eyes downward,
looking hither and thither for comfort.
