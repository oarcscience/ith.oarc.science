### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 22:2</span></span>

Came down, &c. - It is strange, that so good a man would be so closely
connected with a king revolted from the worship of God! But he appears
to have been of too easy a temper, which betrayed him to many
inconveniencies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 22:3</span></span>

Is ours - Belongeth to us by right. both by God's donation, and by our
last agreement with Ben - hadad, [Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034.md), which yet he refuseth to
deliver up.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 22:5</span></span>

Enquire - A good man, wherever he goes, will take God along with him,
will acknowledge him in all his ways, and look to him for success. And
wherever he goes, he ought to take his religion along with him: and not
be ashamed to own it, even among those who have no kindness for it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 22:6</span></span>

The prophets - Doubtless his own false prophets, or the priests of the
groves; who yet gave in their answer in the name of Jehovah; either, in
compliance with Jehoshaphat, or by Ahab's direction, that Jehoshaphat
might be deceived by them, into a good opinion of the war.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 22:8</span></span>

One man - In this place, for whom I can speedily send: for there were
also other prophets elsewhere in the kingdom, but these were not at
hand. Micaiah - Not one of the twelve prophets, who lived about a
hundred and fifty years after this time, but another of that name. Let
not, &c. - Let us neither hate his person, nor despise his message; but
first hear it, and then do as we see cause.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 22:9</span></span>

Micaiah - It seems, he had imprisoned him; for [Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md), he bids the officer carry him
back, namely to the place where he was before. Probably this was he that
had reproved him, for letting Ben - hadad go: And for that, had lain in
prison three years. But this did not make him less confident, or less
faithful in delivering his message.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 22:14</span></span>

Said - What answer God shall put in to my mouth. Bravely resolved! And
as became one who had an eye to a greater king than either of these.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 22:15</span></span>

Go - Using the very words of the false prophets, in way of derision.
Micaiah's meaning is plainly this, because thou dost not seek to know
the truth, but only to please thyself, go to the battle, as all thy
prophets advise thee, and try the truth of their prediction by thy own
experience.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 22:17</span></span>

I saw - In the spirit, or in a vision. The hills - Upon the mountains of
Gilead, nigh Ramoth, where they lay encamped by Ahab's order. As sheep -
As people who have lost their king. Return - Discharged from the war:
which was fulfilled, [Kg1 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 22:18</span></span>

Evil - Nay, but what evil was it, to tell him, what would be the event,
if he proceeded in his expedition, while it was in his own power,
whether he would proceed, or no? The greatest kindness we can do to one
that is walking in a dangerous way, is to tell him of his danger.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 22:19</span></span>

He said - I will give thee a distinct and true account of the whole
matter, in God's name and presence. I saw - By the eyes of my mind: for
he could not see the Lord with bodily eyes. The Host - The angels, both
good and bad, the one possibly on his right, the other on his left hand.
Nor is it strange that the devils are called the host of heaven; if you
consider, first, that their original seat was in heaven. Secondly, that
the name of heaven is often given to all that part of the world which is
above the earth, and among the rest, to the air, and where the devil's
residence and dominion lies, [Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md),
and that both Michael and his angels, and the Dragon and his angels, are
said to be, and to wage war in heaven, [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md), either the air, or the church.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg1 22:20</span></span>

Who shall - This is not to be grossly understood, as if God were at a
loss to find out an expedient to accomplish his own will; but only to
bring down divine things to our shallow capacities, and to express the
various means which God hath to execute his own designs.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 22:21</span></span>

A spirit - An evil spirit came, and presented himself before the throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 22:22</span></span>

He said - I will inspire a lie into the minds and mouths of his
prophets. Thou shalt - I will give them up into thy hands, and leave
them to their own ignorance and wickedness. Go - This is not a command,
but only a permission.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 22:24</span></span>

Zedekiah - The chief of the false prophets, who was much in the king's
favour. Which way - In what manner went it? Forasmuch as I and my
brethren have consulted the Lord, and have the same spirit which thou
pretendest to have.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 22:25</span></span>

Hide thyself - Probably he went with Ahab to the battle, after which he
was glad to shelter himself where he could.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 22:27</span></span>

Bread, &c. - With a very course and sparing diet, whereby he may be only
supported to endure his torment.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 22:31</span></span>

Save only - This he ordered, truly supposing this to be the best way to
put an end to the war: and by the providence of God, which disposeth the
hearts of kings as he pleaseth; and inclined them to this course, that
they might, though ignorantly, accomplish his counsel. Perhaps Ben -
hadad only designed to have taken him prisoner, that he might now give
him as honourable a treatment, as he had formerly received from him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 22:34</span></span>

The joints - Where the several parts of his armour were joined together.
The only place about him where this arrow of death could find entrance.
No armour is proof against the darts of divine vengeance. Case the
criminal in steel, and it is all one: he that made him, can make his
sword approach him. And that which to us seems altogether casual, comes
by the determinate counsel of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg1 22:37</span></span>

Died - Finding too late the truth of Micaiah's words; and Zedekiah's
horns of iron, pushing not the Syrians, but himself, into destruction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg1 22:39</span></span>

Ivory house - Not that it was made of solid ivory, but because the other
materials were covered, or inlaid with ivory.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg1 22:41</span></span>

Of Ahab - Who reigned twenty two years; therefore he reigned about
eighteen years with Ahab.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg1 22:43</span></span>

High places - He took them away, but not fully; or not in the beginning
of of his reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">kg1 22:44</span></span>

Made peace - With Ahab first, and then with his son. This is noted as a
blemish in his government, [Ch2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002.md),
and proved of most mischievous consequence to his posterity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 22:47</span></span>

A deputy - Sent, and set over them by the kings of Judah, from the time
of David, until the days of Jehoram, [Ch2
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">kg1 22:49</span></span>

Would not - He did join with Ahaziah before this time, and before the
ships were broken: for the breaking of the ships mentioned here, is
noted to be the effect of his sin, in joining with Ahaziah, [Ch2
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#037.md). And Jehoshaphat being warned
and chastised by God for this sin, would not be persuaded to repeat it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 22:51</span></span>

Ahaziah, &c. - Ahaziah was made king by his father, and reigned in
conjunction with him a year or two before Ahab's death, and as long
after it; even as Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat was made king by his
father in his life - time, which possibly was done in compliance with
Ahab's desire upon marriage of his daughter to Jehoshaphat's son; and it
may be Ahab, to induce him to do so, give him an example of it, and made
his son his partner in the kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:52](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">kg1 22:52</span></span>

In the way - Which seems added, to shew, how little the example of
parents, or ancestors, is to be valued where it is opposed to the will
and word of God.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">kg1 22:53</span></span>

His father, &c. - Most unhappy parents, that thus help to damn their own
children's souls!
