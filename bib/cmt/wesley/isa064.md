### [Isaiah Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 64:1</span></span>

Rent - A metaphor taken from men, that when they would resolutely help
one in distress, break and fling open doors and whatever may hinder.
Flow down - That all impediments might be removed out of the way:
possibly an allusion to God's coming down upon mount Sinai, in those
terrible flames of fire.

[Isaiah 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 64:2</span></span>

Fire - Come with such zeal for thy people, that the solid mountains may
be no more before thy breath, than metal that runs, or water that boils
by the force of a vehement fire. Known - That thine enemies may know thy
power, and that thy name may be dreaded among them.

[Isaiah 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 64:3</span></span>

Terrible things - This may relate to what he did among the Egyptians,
tho' it be not recorded, and afterward in the wilderness. Looked not for
- Such things as we could never expect. Mountains - Kings, princes, and
potentates, may metaphorically be understood by these mountains.

[Isaiah 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 64:4</span></span>

Besides thee - This is to be applied to all the wonderful works, that
God at all times wrought for his people: and thus they are a plea with
God, that they might well expect such things from him now, that had done
such wonderful things for their fathers. Waiteth - This may be taken
with reference both to the state of grace and glory, those
incomprehensible things that are exhibited through Christ in the
mysteries of the gospel.

[Isaiah 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 64:5</span></span>

Meetest - As the father the prodigal. Worketh - That rejoices to work
righteousness. Continuance - To those that work righteousness. Be saved
- In so doing, in working righteousness.

[Isaiah 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 64:6</span></span>

Unclean - Formerly there were some that feared thee; but now we are all
as one polluted mass, nothing of good left in us by reason of an
universal degeneracy. And all - The very best of us all are no better
than the uncleanest things. Taken - Carried away to Babylon, as leaves
hurried away by a boisterous wind.

[Isaiah 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 64:7</span></span>

That calleth - That call upon thee as they ought. Take hold - Either to
stay thee from departing from us, or to fetch thee back when departed.

[Isaiah 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 64:8</span></span>

Our father - Notwithstanding all this thou art our father both by
creation, and by adoption, therefore pity us thy children.

[Isaiah 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 64:9</span></span>

Thy people - Thou hast no people in covenant but us, and wilt thou not
leave thyself a people in the world?

[Isaiah 64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 64:11</span></span>

Pleasant things - The king's palace, and the houses of the nobles, and
other pieces of state and magnificence.

[Isaiah 64:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 64:12</span></span>

Wilt thou - Do none of these things move thee to take vengeance? Thy
peace - Wilt thou be as one that regards not?
