### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 23:2</span></span>

That feed - They are said to have fed this people, because it was their
duty so to do.

[Jeremiah 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 23:5</span></span>

Behold - Even the Jewish doctors, as well as the Christian interpreters,
understand this as a prophecy of the Messiah who is called the branch,
[Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md). And here, he is called the
righteous branch, not only because himself was righteous, but because he
maketh his people righteous. Shall execute - Protecting the innocent,
and defending his people throughout the world, judging the prince of the
world, and by his spirit governing his people.

[Jeremiah 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 23:6</span></span>

Judah - During the reign and kingdom of the Messiah the people of God
typified by Judah and Israel shall be saved with a spiritual salvation,
and God will be a special protection to them. And this - The name
wherewith this branch shall be called, shall be, The Lord our
righteousness. This place is an eminent proof of the Godhead of Christ,
he is here called Jehovah, and what is proper to God alone, namely to
justify, is here applied to Christ. He who knew no sin, was made sin,
(that is, a sacrifice for sin) for us, that we might be made, the
righteousness of God in him.

[Jeremiah 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 23:8</span></span>

They shall dwell - Possibly part of this prophecy remains yet to be
accomplished for the Jews are not yet come to dwell in their own land.

[Jeremiah 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 23:9</span></span>

Like a man - And he was even astonished and stupefied, and like a
drunken man, at the apprehensions of the wrath of the Lord ready to be
revealed against them, and considering also what words the holy God had
put into his mouth, to speak against them.

[Jeremiah 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 23:10</span></span>

Adulterers - Under this term all species of uncleanness are
comprehended. Swearing - By false - swearing, or by idle and profane
swearing. The pleasant places - The wrath of God was extended to all
places whether more or less inhabited. Their courses - The prophets did
not only err in single acts, but the whole course of their actions was
evil, and particularly their power, rule and government, was not right.

[Jeremiah 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md)

so caused the ten tribes to err, which then were called Israel in
contradistinction to Judah.

[Jeremiah 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 23:16</span></span>

Hearken not - People are under no religious obligation to hear any thing
but the revealed will of God, and are not to obey those that call to
them for what that doth not call to them.

[Jeremiah 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 23:18</span></span>

against this city is a privy - counsellor to God? The words seem to be

The anger - The prophet speaks of the judgment as of a messenger, which
should not return till it had done its errand, and executed what God had
resolved it should effect. Ye shall consider - And though you will not
now believe it, yet hereafter when it shall be too late, you shall
consider it perfectly.

[Jeremiah 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 23:28</span></span>

What is the wheat - There is as much difference between my will and
their dreams, as there is betwixt the chaff and the wheat.

[Jeremiah 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)

threatenings. And his house - I will not only punish him, but his whole
family.

Mention no more - Not in scorn and derision. For - These false and
irreverent speeches which are in every man's mouth, shall be burdensome
to them, shall bring down vengeance upon them. Perverted - Because you
