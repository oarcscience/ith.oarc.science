Exceeding great - The greatest city of the known world at that day, it
was then in its flourishing state greater than Babylon, whose compass
was three hundred eighty - five furlongs, but Nineveh was in compass,
four hundred and eighty. It is said, her walls were an hundred foot in
height, her walls broad enough for three coaches to meet, and safely
pass by each other; that it had fifteen hundred towers on its walls,
each two hundred foot high, and one million, four hundred thousand men
employed for eight years to build it. Of three days journey - To walk
round the walls, allowing twenty miles to each day's journey.

with God, on condition of repentance.

Taste any thing - Man and beast are to forbear to eat and drink, that
the fast might be most solemn, that the cry of man, seconded with the
cry of hungry cattle, might enter the ears of God, who preserveth man
and beast.

[Jonah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 3:8</span></span>

And beast - Their horses and camels, both which they adorned with rich
and costly clothing, they must now in testimony of an hearty repentance,
clothe with sackcloth; the clothing of beasts must witness for men. The
violence - Oppression and rapine. In their hands - Which are practised
by them.
