### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 3:1</span></span>

Before Eli - That is, under his inspection and direction. Word - The
word of prophecy, or the revelation of God's will to and by the
prophets. Precious - Rare or scarce, such things being most precious in
mens' esteem, whereas common things are generally despised. Open vision
- God did not impart his Mind by way of vision or revelation openly, or
to any public person, to whom others might resort for satisfaction,
though he might privately reveal himself to some pious persons for their
particular direction. This is premised, as a reason why Samuel
understood not, when God called him once or twice.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 3:2</span></span>

His place - In the court of the tabernacle.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 3:3</span></span>

Went out - Before the lights of the golden candlestick were put out in
the morning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 3:7</span></span>

Did not know - He was not acquainted with God in that extraordinary or
prophetical way. And this ignorance of Samuel's served God's design,
that his simplicity might give Eli the better assurance of the truth of
God's call, and message to Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 3:10</span></span>

Came and stood - Before, he spake to him at a distance, even from the
holy oracle between the cherubim: but now, to prevent all farther
mistake, the voice came near to him, as if the person speaking had been
standing near him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 3:12</span></span>

In that day - In that time which I have appointed for this work, which
was about twenty or thirty years after this threatning. So long space of
repentance God allows to this wicked generation. When I begin, &c. -
Tho' this vengeance shall be delayed for a season, to manifest my
patience, and incite them to repentance; yet when once I begin to
inflict, I shall not desist 'till I have made a full end.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 3:13</span></span>

Restrained them not - He contented himself with a cold reproof, and did
not punish, and effectually restrain them. They who can, and do not
restrain others from sin, make themselves partakers of the guilt. Those
in authority will have a great deal to answer for, if the sword they
bear be not a terror to evil - doers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 3:14</span></span>

Have sworn - Or, I do swear: the past tense being commonly put for the
present in the Hebrew tongue. Unto - Or, concerning it. Purged - That
is, the punishment threatened against Eli and his family, shall not he
prevented by all their sacrifices, but shall infallibly be executed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 3:15</span></span>

Doors - Altho' the tabernacle, whilst it was to be removed from place to
place in the wilderness, had no doors, but consisted only of curtains,
and had hangings before the entrance, instead of doors; yet when it was
settled in one place, as now it was in Shiloh, it was enclosed within
some solid building, which had doors and posts, and other parts
belonging to it. Feared - The matter of the vision or revelation, partly
from the reverence he bore to his person, to whom he was loth to be a
messenger of such sad tidings; partly, lest if he had been hasty to
utter it, Eli might think him guilty of arrogancy or secret complacency
in his calamity.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 3:17</span></span>

God do so, &c. - God inflict the same evils upon thee, which I suspect
he hath pronounced against me, and greater evils too.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 3:18</span></span>

It is the Lord - This severe sentence is from the sovereign Lord of the
world, who hath an absolute right to dispose of me and all his
creatures; who is in a special manner the ruler of the people of Israel,
to whom it properly belongs to punish all mine offences; whose
chastisement I therefore accept.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 3:19</span></span>

Fail, &c. - That is, want its effect: God made good all his predictions.
A metaphor from precious liquors, which when they are spilt upon the
ground, are altogether useless.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 3:20</span></span>

From Dan, &c. - Thro' the whole Land, from the northern bound Dan, to
the southern, Beersheba; which was the whole length of the Land.
