### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 10:1</span></span>

Among them - That is, were conversant with them, had submitted to their
laws, and mingled interests with them.

[Joshua 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 10:2</span></span>

Thy - That is, he and his people, the king being spoken of [Jos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md), as a publick person representing
all his people. Royal cities - Either really a royal city, or equal to
one of the royal cities, though it had no king, but seems to have been
governed by elders, [Jos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#011.md).

[Joshua 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 10:3</span></span>

Adoni - zedek sent - Either because he was superior to them, or because
he was nearest the danger, and most forward in the work.

[Joshua 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 10:5</span></span>

Of the Amorites - This name being here taken largely for any of the
Canaanites, as is frequent; for, to speak strictly, the citizens of
Hebron here mentioned, [Jos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md), were
Hittites. It is reasonably supposed, that the Amorites being numerous
and victorious beyond Jordan poured forth colonies into the land of
Canaan, subdued divers places, and so communicated their name to all the
rest.

[Joshua 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 10:6</span></span>

Slack not thy hand - Do not neglect or delay to help us. Whom thou art
obliged to protect both in duty as thou art our master; and by thy owns
interest, we being part of thy possessions; and in ingenuity, because we
have given ourselves to thee, and put ourselves under thy protection. In
the mountains - ln the mountainous country.

[Joshua 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 10:7</span></span>

Joshua ascended - Having no doubt asked advice of God first, which is
implied by the answer God gives him, [Jos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008.md). All the mighty men - That is, an
army of the most valiant men picked out from the rest; for it is not
probable, either that he would take so many hundred thousands with him,
which would have hindered one another, or that he would leave the camp
without an army to defend it.

[Joshua 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 10:9</span></span>

Came suddenly - Though assured by God of the victory, yet he uses all
prudent means. All night - It is not said, that he went from Gilgal to
Gibeon in a night's space; but only that he travelled all night; unto
which you may add part either of the foregoing or of the following day.
It is true, God had promised, that he would without fail deliver the
enemies into his hand. But God's promises are intended, not to slacken,
but to quicken our endeavours. He that believeth doth not make haste, to
anticipate providence; but doth make haste to attend it, with a
diligent, not a distrustful speed.

[Joshua 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 10:10</span></span>

At Gibeon - Heb. in Gibeon, not in the city, but in the territory
belonging to it.

[Joshua 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 10:11</span></span>

Great stones - That is, hailstones of extraordinary greatness, cast down
with that certainty, as to hit the Canaanites and not their pursuers the
Israelites. Josephus affirms, that thunder and lightning were mixed with
the hail, which may seem probable from [Hab
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md). They had robbed the true God of
his honour, by worshipping the host of heaven, and now the hosts of
heaven fights against them, and triumphs in their ruin. Beth - horon lay
north of Gibeon, Azekah and Makkedah, south, so that they fled each way.
But which way soever they fled, the hailstones pursued them. There is no
fleeing out of the hands of God!

[Joshua 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 10:12</span></span>

Spoke Joshua - Being moved to beg it out of zeal to destroy God's
enemies, and directed to it by the motion of God's spirit, and being
filled with holy confidence of the success, he speaks the following
words before the people, that that they might be witnesses. In the sight
- That is, in the presence and audience of Israel. Over Gibeon - That
is, in that place and posture in which now it stands towards, and looks
upon Gibeon. Let it not go down lower, and by degrees, out of the sight
of Gibeon. It may seem, that the sun, was declining, and Joshua
perceiving that his work was great and long, and his time but short,
begs of God the lengthening out of the day, and that the sun and moon
might stop their course, He mentions two places, Gibeon and Ajalon, not
as if the sun stood over the one and the moon over the other, which is
absurd especially these places being so near the one to the other; but
partly to vary the phrase, as is common in poetical passages; partly
because he was in his march in the pursuit of his enemies, to pass from
Gibeon to Ajalon; and he begs that he may have the help of longer light
to pursue them, and to that end that the sun might stand still, and the
moon also; not that he needed the moon's light, but because it was fit,
either that both sun and moon should go, or that both should stand still
to prevent disorder in the heavenly bodies. The prayer is thus exprest
with authority, because it was not an ordinary prayer, but the prayer of
a prophet, divinely inspired at this very time for this purpose. And yet
it intimates to us the prevalency of prayer in general, and may mind us
of that honour put upon prayer, concerning the work of my hands command
you me.

[Joshua 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 10:13</span></span>

Avenged them on their enemies - That is, till they bad utterly destroyed
them. Book of Jasher - This book was written and published before Joshua
wrote his, and so is fitly alluded here. But this, as well as some other
historical books, is lost, not being a canonical book, and therefore not
preserved by the Jews with the same care as they were. The sun stood -
Here is no mention of the moon, because the sun's standing was the only
thing which Joshua desired and needed; and the moon's standing he
desired only by accident to prevent irregularity in the motions of those
celestial lights. And if it seem strange to any one, that so wonderful a
work should not be mentioned in any Heathen writers; he must consider,
that it is confessed by the generality of writers, Heathens and others,
that there is no certain history or monument in Heathen authors of any
thing done before the Trojan war, which was a thousand years after
Joshua's time; and that all time before that, is called by the most
learned Heathens, the uncertain, unknown, or obscure time. A whole day -
That is, for the space of a whole day. Understand an artificial day
between sun - rising and sun - setting; for that was the day which
Joshua needed and desired, a day to give him light for his work.

[Joshua 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 10:14</span></span>

No day like that - Namely, in those parts of the world in which he here
speaks, vain therefore is that objection, that the days are longer near
the northern and southern poles, where they are constantly longer at
certain seasons, and that by the order of nature; whereas the length of
this day was purely contingent, and granted by God in answer to Joshua's
prayer. The Lord hearkened to a man - Namely, in such a manner to alter
the course of nature, and of the heavenly bodies, that a man might have
more time to pursue and destroy his enemies. The Lord fought - This is
added as the reason why God was so ready to answer Joshua's petition,
because he was resolved to fight for Israel, and that in a more than
ordinary manner. But this stupendous miracle was designed for something
more, than to give Israel light to destroy the Canaanites. It was
designed to convince and confound those idolaters, who worshipped the
sun and moon, by demonstrating, that these also were subject to the
command of the God of Israel: as also to signify, that in the latter
days, when the world was covered with darkness, the sun of
righteousness, even our Joshua, should arise, and be the true light of
the world. To which we may add, that when Christ conquered our enemies
upon the cross, the miracle wrought on the sun was the reverse of this.
It was then darkened, as if going down at noon. For Christ needed not
the light of the sun, to compleat his victory: so he made darkness his
pavilion.

[Joshua 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 10:15</span></span>

Joshua returned - Not upon the same day, but after he had dispatched the
matter which here follows; as appears by [Jos
10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043.md), where the very same words are
repeated. And they are put here to close the general discourse of the
fight which begun [Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md), and ends
here; which being done he particularly describes some remarkable
passages, and closeth them with the same words.

[Joshua 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 10:16</span></span>

A cave - A place of the greatest secrecy; but there is no escaping the
eye or hand of God. At Makkedah - Heb. in Makkedah, not in the city, for
that was not yet taken; but in the territory of it.

[Joshua 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 10:19</span></span>

Enter their cities - Whereby they will recover their strength, and renew
the war. God hath delivered them - Your work will be easy, God hath
already done the work to your hands.

[Joshua 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 10:20</span></span>

The children of Israel - That is, a party of them by the command of
Joshua; for Joshua himself went not with them, but abode in the siege
before Makkedah, [Jos 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md).

[Joshua 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 10:21</span></span>

To the camp - To the body, of the army which were engaged there with
Joshua to besiege that place. None moved his tongue - Not only their men
of war could not find their hands, but they were so confounded, that
they could not move their tongues in way of insult, as doubtless they
did when the Israelites were smitten at Ai; but now they were silenced
as well as conquered: they durst no more provoke the Israelites.

[Joshua 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 10:24</span></span>

Put your feet on the necks - This he did not from pride and contempt;
but as a punishment of their impious rebellion against their Sovereign
Lord; in pursuance of that curse of servitude due to all this people,
and as a token to assure his captains, that God would subdue the
proudest of them under their feet.

[Joshua 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 10:27</span></span>

Took them down - That neither wild beasts could come to devour them, nor
any of their people to give them honourable burial. Thus that which they
thought would have been their shelter, was made their prison first, and
then their grave. So shall we surely be disappointed, in whatever we
flee to from God.

[Joshua 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 10:28</span></span>

And that day - On which the sun stood still. Nor is it strange that so
much work was done, and places so far distant taken in one day, when the
day was so long, and the Canaanites struck with such a terror.

[Joshua 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 10:29</span></span>

All Israel - Namely, who were with him in this expedition.

[Joshua 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 10:35</span></span>

On that day - On which they first attempted it.

[Joshua 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jos 10:36</span></span>

Unto Hebron - The conquest of Hebron is here generally related,
afterwards repeated, and more particularly described, [Jos
15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013.md).

[Joshua 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jos 10:37</span></span>

All the cities - Which were subject to its jurisdiction; this being, it
seems, a royal city as Gibeon was, [Jos
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md), and having cities under it as
that had.

[Joshua 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jos 10:38</span></span>

Joshua returned - He is said to return thither, not as if he had been
there before, but because having gone as far westward and southward as
he thought fit, even as far as Gaza, [Jos
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041.md), he now returned towards Gilgal,
which lay north - ward and eastward from him, and in his return fell
upon Debir.

[Joshua 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jos 10:40</span></span>

All that breathed - That is, all mankind, they reserved the cattle for
their own uses. As God had commanded - This is added for the vindication
of the Israelites, whom God would not have to suffer in their reputation
for executing his commands; and therefore he acquits them of that
cruelty, which they might be thought guilty of, and ascribes it to his
own just indignation. And hereby was typified the final destruction of
all the impenitent enemies of the Lord Jesus, who having slighted the
riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath.

[Joshua 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jos 10:41</span></span>

Kadesh - barnea - Which lay in the south of Canaan, [Num
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#004.md); [Deu
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md); [Jos
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003.md). Gaza - Which was in the south -
west of Canaan. So he here signifies, that Joshua did in this expedition
subdue all those parts which lay south and west from Gilgal. Goshen -
Not that Goshen in Egypt, but another in Judah.
