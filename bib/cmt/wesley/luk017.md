### [Luke Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

[Luke 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 17:1</span></span>

It is impossible but offences will come - And they ever did and do come
chiefly by Pharisees, that is, men who trust in themselves that they are
righteous, and despise others. [Mat
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md); [Mar
9:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#042.md).

[Luke 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 17:2</span></span>

Little ones - Weak believers.

[Luke 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 17:3</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves - That ye neither offend others, nor be offended
by others. [Mat 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md).

[Luke 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 17:4</span></span>

If he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day
return, saying, I repent - That is, if he give sufficient proof that he
does really repent, after having sinned ever so often, receive him just
as if he had never sinned against thee. But this forgiveness is due only
to real penitents. In a lower sense we are to forgive all, penitent or
impenitent; (so as to bear them the sincerest good will, and to do them
all the good we can;) and that not seven times only, but seventy times
seven.

[Luke 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 17:5</span></span>

Lord, increase our faith - That we may thus forgive, and may neither
offend nor be offended. [Mat 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020.md).

[Luke 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 17:6</span></span>

And he said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed - If ye had the
least measure of true faith, no instance of duty would be too hard for
you. Ye would say to this sycamine tree - This seems to have been a kind
of proverbial expression.

[Luke 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 17:7</span></span>

But which of you - But is it not meet that you should first obey, and
then triumph? Though still with a deep sense of your utter
unprofitableness.

[Luke 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 17:9</span></span>

Doth he thank that servant - Does he account himself obliged to him?

[Luke 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 17:10</span></span>

When ye have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants - For a man
cannot profit God. Happy is he who judges himself an unprofitable
servant: miserable is he whom God pronounces such. But though we are
unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us. For he
is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works, which in
consequence of his promise entitles us to an eternal reward.

[Luke 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 17:20</span></span>

The kingdom of God cometh not with observation - With such outward pomp
as draws the observation of every one.

[Luke 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 17:21</span></span>

Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there - This shall not be the
language of those who are, or shall be sent by me, to declare the coming
of my kingdom. For behold the kingdom of God is within or among you -
Look not for it in distant times or remote places: it is now in the
midst of you: it is come: it is present in the soul of every true
believer: it is a spiritual kingdom, an internal principle. Wherever it
exists, it exists in the heart.

[Luke 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 17:22</span></span>

Ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man - One day of
mercy. or one day wherein you might converse with me, as you do now.

[Luke 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 17:23</span></span>

They shall say, See, Christ is here, or there - Limiting his presence to
this or that place. [Mat 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#023.md).

[Luke 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 17:24</span></span>

So shall also the Son of man be - So swift, so wide, shall his appearing
be: In his day - The last day.

[Luke 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 17:26</span></span>

The days of the Son of man - Those which immediately follow that which
is eminently styled his day. [Mat
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md).

[Luke 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 17:31</span></span>

In that day - (Which will be the grand type of the last day) when ye
shall see Jerusalem encompassed with armies.

[Luke 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 17:32</span></span>

Remember Lot's wife - And escape with all speed, without ever looking
behind you. [Luk 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#024.md); [Joh
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#025.md).

[Luke 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 17:33</span></span>

The sense of this and the following verses is, Yet as great as the
danger will be, do not seek to save your life by violating your
conscience: if you do, you will surely lose it: whereas if you should
lose it for my sake, you shall be paid with life everlasting. But the
most probable way of preserving it now, is to be always ready to give it
up: a peculiar Providence shall then watch over you, and put a
difference between you and other men.

[Luke 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 17:37</span></span>

[Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md).
