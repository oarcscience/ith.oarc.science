### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 9:1</span></span>

He - The man whom he had seen upon the throne. Them - Those whom God
hath appointed to destroy the city: perhaps angels. Every man - Every
one; 'tis an Hebrew idiom. Each of these had a weapon proper for that
kind of destruction which he was to effect; and so, some to slay with
the sword, another with the pestilence, another with famine. In his hand
- Denoting both expedition in, and strength for the work.

[Ezekiel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 9:2</span></span>

And - As soon as the command was given, the ministers of God's
displeasure appear. Men - In appearance and vision they were men, and
the prophet calls them as he saw them. The north - Insinuating whence
their destruction should come. One man - Not a companion, but as one of
authority over them. With linen - A garment proper to the priesthood.
They - All the seven.

[Ezekiel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 9:3</span></span>

The glory - The glorious brightness, such as sometimes appeared above
the cherubim in the most holy place. Gone up - Departing from the place
he had so long dwelt in. He was - Wont to sit and appear. Threshold - Of
the temple, in token of his sudden departure from the Jews, because of
their sins.

[Ezekiel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 9:4</span></span>

That sigh - Out of grief for other mens sins and sorrows. Cry - Who dare
openly bewail the abominations of this wicked city, and so bear their
testimony against it.

[Ezekiel 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 9:5</span></span>

The others - The six slaughter - men.

[Ezekiel 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 9:6</span></span>

At my sanctuary - There are the great sinners, and the abominable sins
which have brought this on them.

[Ezekiel 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 9:7</span></span>

And slew - The slaughter also was in vision.

[Ezekiel 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 9:8</span></span>

Was left - Left alone, now both the sealer, and the slayers were gone.
