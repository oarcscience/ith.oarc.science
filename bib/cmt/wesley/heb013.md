### [Hebrews Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 13:1</span></span>

Brotherly love is explained in the following verses.

[Hebrews 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 13:2</span></span>

Some - Abraham and Lot. Have entertained angels unawares - So may an
unknown guest, even now, be of more worth than he appears, and may have
angels attending him, though unseen. [Gen
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002.md); [Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md).

[Hebrews 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 13:3</span></span>

Remember - In your prayers, and by your help. Them that are in bonds, as
being bound with them - Seeing ye are members one of another. And them
that suffer, as being yourselves in the body - And consequently liable
to the same.

[Hebrews 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 13:4</span></span>

Marriage is honourable in, or for all sorts of men, clergy as well as
laity: though the Romanists teach otherwise. And the bed undefiled -
Consistent with the highest purity; though many spiritual writers, so
called, say it is only licensed whoredom. But whoremongers and
adulterers God will judge - Though they frequently escape the sentence
of men.

[Hebrews 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 13:5</span></span>

He - God. Hath said - To all believers, in saying it to Jacob, Joshua,
and Solomon. [Gen 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015.md); [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005.md); [Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020.md).

[Hebrews 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 13:6</span></span>

[Psa 118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md).

[Hebrews 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 13:7</span></span>

Remember them - Who are now with God, considering the happy end of their
conversation on earth.

[Hebrews 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 13:8</span></span>

Men may die; but Jesus Christ, yea, and his gospel, is the same from
everlasting to everlasting.

[Hebrews 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 13:9</span></span>

Be not carried about with various doctrines - Which differ from that one
faith in our one unchangeable Lord. Strange - To the ears and hearts of
all that abide in him. For it is good - It is both honourable before God
and pleasant and profitable That the heart be stablished with grace -
Springing from faith in Christ. Not with meats - Jewish ceremonies,
which indeed can never stablish the heart.

[Hebrews 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 13:10</span></span>

On the former part of this verse, [Heb
13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md) depend; on the latter, [Heb
13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md). We have an altar - The cross
of Christ. Whereof they have no right to eat - To partake of the
benefits which we receive therefrom. Who serve the tabernacle - Who
adhere to the Mosaic law.

[Hebrews 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 13:11</span></span>

For - According to their own law, the sin - offerings were wholly
consumed, and no Jew ever ate thereof. But Christ was a sin - offering.
Therefore they cannot feed upon him, as we do, who are freed from the
Mosaic law.

[Hebrews 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 13:12</span></span>

Wherefore Jesus also - Exactly answering those typical sin - offerings.
Suffered without the gate - Of Jerusalem, which answered to the old camp
of Israel. That he might sanctify - Reconcile and consecrate to God. The
people - Who believe in him. By his own blood - Not those shadowy
sacrifices, which are now of no farther use.

[Hebrews 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 13:13</span></span>

Let us then go forth without the camp - Out of the Jewish dispensation.
Bearing his reproach - All manner of shame, obloquy, and contempt for
his sake.

[Hebrews 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 13:14</span></span>

For we have here - On earth No continuing city - All things here are but
for a moment; and Jerusalem itself was just then on the point of being
destroyed.

[Hebrews 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 13:15</span></span>

The sacrifice - The altar is mentioned, [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md); now the sacrifices: Praise;
Beneficence; with both of which God is well pleased.

[Hebrews 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 13:17</span></span>

Obey them that have the rule over you - The word implies also, that lead
or guide you; namely, in truth and holiness. And submit yourselves -
Give up (not your conscience or judgment, but) your own will, in all
things purely indifferent. For they watch over your souls - With all
zeal and diligence, they guard and caution you against all danger. As
they that must give account - To the great Shepherd, for every part of
their behaviour toward you. How vigilant then ought every pastor to be!
How careful of every soul committed to his charge! That they may do this
- Watch over you. With joy and not with groans - He is not a good
shepherd, who does not either rejoice over them, or groan for them. The
groans of other creatures are heard: how much more shall these come up
in the ears of God ! Whoever answers this character of a Christian
pastor may undoubtedly demand this obedience.

[Hebrews 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 13:20</span></span>

The everlasting covenant - The Christian covenant, which is not
temporary, like the Jewish, but designed to remain for ever. By the
application of that blood, by which this covenant was established, may
he make you, in every respect, inwardly and outwardly holy!

[Hebrews 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 13:22</span></span>

Suffer the word of exhortation - Addressed to you in this letter, which,
though longer than my usual letters, is yet contained in few words,
considering the copiousness of the subject.

[Hebrews 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 13:23</span></span>

If he come - To me.

[Hebrews 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 13:25</span></span>

\- Grace be with you all - St. Paul's usual benediction. God apply it to
our hearts!
