Upon tables - What was of publick concern, and therefore to be

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 2:4</span></span>

Which is lifted up - That proudly contests with the justice and wisdom
of the Divine Providence, and provides for his own safety by his own

divine providence, and is persuaded of the truth of divine promises.
Shall live - Supports himself, by a firm expectation of the deliverance
of Zion.

He - The king of Babylon. Wine - Hereby Belshazzar, his city and kingdom
of Babylon fell a prey to Darius and Cyrus. At home - Is ever abroad
warring upon some or other. Unto him - To his kingdom. All nations -
That are round about him.

[Habakkuk 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008.md)

To his house - His family which he would enrich, and raise high.
Delivered - Kept secure and out of danger from all below him.

Shall cry out - As if it had a voice, it cries to God for vengeance.
Answer it - Confirm the charge against thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 2:13</span></span>

Is it not of the Lord - Is it not a judgment from God? Shall labour -
That men go thro' the most painful labour. For very vanity - For
nothing; without any reward of their labour.

[Habakkuk 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 2:16</span></span>

Thou - O king of Babylon. Shall be turned - They turned the cup of
pleasure about, God will carry the cup of indignation about also, and
make them drink deep of it. Shameful spewing - Thou shalt be as much
loathed as a shameful drunkard is in his vomit.

[Habakkuk 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#017.md)

thee. The spoil of brass - Such spoil as by hunters is made among wild
beasts, when they endeavour to destroy the whole kind.

[Habakkuk 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hab 2:20</span></span>

The Lord - He is Jehovah, the fountain of being, life, power, and
salvation to his people. Keep silence - Fear, submit, and depend on him;
let his enemies be silent, reverence, hope, pray and wait for him, who
will arise and have mercy on them, who will make it to be well with the
righteous, and ill with the wicked, who will fully and satisfactorily
solve the doubts, and unfold the riddles of his providence.
