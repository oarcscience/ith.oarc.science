### [Job Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 7:1</span></span>

Is there not - Job is here excusing what he cannot justify, his
passionate longing for death. A time - Is there not a time limited by
God, wherein man shall live in this sinful, and miserable world? And is
it a crime in me, to desire that God would bring me to that joyful
period? Our time on earth is limited and short, according to the narrow
bounds of this earth. But heaven cannot be measured, nor the days of
heaven numbered. Hireling - Whose time is short, being but a few years,
or days, whose condition is full of toil and hardship.

[Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 7:2</span></span>

Shadow - That is, the sun - set, the time allotted for his rest.

[Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 7:3</span></span>

So - This so respects not so much the desire of an hired servant, as the
ground of it, his hard toil and service. Possess - God, hath given me
this as my lot and inheritance. Months - So he calls them rather than
days, to note the tediousness of his affliction. Vanity - Empty and
unsatisfying. Nights - He mentions nights, because that is the saddest
time for sick and miserable persons; the darkness and solitude of the
night being of themselves uncomfortable, and giving them more
opportunity for solemn and sorrowful reflections.

[Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 7:5</span></span>

Worms - Which were bred out of Job's corrupted flesh and sores. Dust -
The dust of the earth upon which he lay. Broken - By ulcers in all parts
of it.

[Job 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 7:6</span></span>

Swifter - The time of my life hastens to a period. Shuttle - Which
passes in a moment from one end of the web to the other. Hope - Of
enjoying any good day here.

[Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 7:7</span></span>

O - He turns his speech to God. Perhaps observing, that his friends grew
weary of hearing it. If men will not hear us, God will: if men cannot
help us, he can: for his arm is not shortened, neither is his ear heavy.

[Job 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 7:8</span></span>

No more - In this mortal state: I shall never return to this life again.
Am not - If thou cast one angry look upon me, I am not; thou canst look
me into eternity.

[Job 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 7:9</span></span>

No more - Never until the general resurrection. When we see a cloud
which looked great, as if it would eclipse the sun, of a sudden
dispersed and disappearing, say, Just such a thing is the life of man, a
vapour that appears for a while and then vanisheth away.

[Job 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 7:10</span></span>

Any more - He shall no more be seen and known in his former habitation.
It concerns us to secure a better place when we die: for this will own
us no more.

[Job 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 7:11</span></span>

Therefore - Since my life is so vain and short, and when once lost,
without all hopes of recovery. I will plead with God for pity before I
die; I will not smother my anguish within my breast, but will ease
myself by pouring out my complaints.

[Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 7:12</span></span>

A sea - Am I as fierce and unruly as the sea, which, if thou didst not
set bounds to it, would overwhelm the earth? Or, am I a vast and
ungovernable sea - monster? Which thou must restrain by thy powerful
providence. That, &c. - That thou shouldest guard and restrain me with
such heavy and unexampled miseries? We are apt in affliction to complain
of God, as if he laid more upon us than there is occasion for: whereas
we are never in heaviness, but when there is need, nor more than there
is need.

[Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 7:17</span></span>

What, &c. - What is there in that poor, mean, creature called man,
miserable man, as this word signifies, which can induce thee to take any
notice of him, or to make such account of him? Man is not worthy of thy
favour, and he is below thy anger; that thou shouldest concern thyself
so much about him, as one near and dear to thee?

[Job 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 7:18</span></span>

And try, &c. - What is man that vain, foolish creature, that thou
shouldest magnify or regard, or visit him, (with thy mercy and
blessings, that thou shouldest so far honour and regard him, as by thy
visitation to preserve his spirit, or hold his soul in life) and try
him, which God doth not only by afflictions, but also by prosperity and
both inward and outward blessings? That thou shouldst observe his
motions every moment, as in care for him, and jealous over him?

[Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 7:19</span></span>

How long - How long will it be ere thou withdraw thy afflicting hand?
Swallow - That I may have a breathing time: a proverbial expression.

[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 7:20</span></span>

Sinned - Although I am free from those crying sins, for which my friends
suppose thou hast sent this judgment upon me, yet, I freely confess I am
a sinner, and therefore obnoxious to thy justice. What, &c. - To satisfy
thy justice, or regain thy favour? Who dost know and diligently observe
all mens inward motions, and outward actions; and therefore, if thou
shalt be severe to mark mine iniquities, I have not what to say or do
unto thee. My case is singular, none is shot at as I am.

[Job 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 7:21</span></span>

Pardon - Seeing thou art so gracious to others, why may not I hope for
the same favour from thee? Dust - If thou dost not speedily help me, it
will be too late. But I shall not be - It will be to late to shew me
favour.
