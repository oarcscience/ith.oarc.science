### [Mark Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

[Mark 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 3:1</span></span>

He entered again into the synagogue - At Capernaum on the same day. [Mat
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md); [Luk
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md).

[Mark 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 3:2</span></span>

And they - The scribes and Pharisees, watched him, that they might
accuse him - Pride, anger, and shame, after being so often put to
silence, began now to ripen into malice.

[Mark 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 3:4</span></span>

Is it lawful to save life or to kill? - Which he knew they were seeking
occasion to do. But they held their peace - Being confounded, though not
convinced.

[Mark 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 3:5</span></span>

Looking round upon them with anger, being grieved - Angry at the sin,
grieved at the sinner; the true standard of Christian anger. But who can
separate anger at sin from anger at the sinner? None but a true believer
in Christ.

[Mark 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 3:6</span></span>

The Pharisees going out - Probably leaving the scribes to watch him
still: took counsel with the Herodians - as bitter as they usually were
against each other.

[Mark 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 3:8</span></span>

From Idumea - The natives of which had now professed the Jewish religion
above a hundred and fifty years. They about Tyre and Sidon - The
Israelites who lived in those coasts.

[Mark 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 3:10</span></span>

Plagues or scourges (so the Greek word properly means) seem to be those
very painful or afflictive disorders which were frequently sent, or at
least permitted of God, as a scourge or punishment of sin.

[Mark 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 3:12</span></span>

He charged them not to make him known - It was not the time: nor were
they fit preachers.

[Mark 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 3:13</span></span>

He calleth whom he would - With regard to the eternal states of men, God
always acts as just and merciful. But with regard to numberless other
things, he seems to us to act as a mere sovereign. [Luk
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

[Mark 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 3:14</span></span>

[Mat 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002.md); [Luk
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md); [Act
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md).

[Mark 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 3:16</span></span>

He surnamed them sons of thunder - Both with respect to the warmth and
impetuosity of their spirit, their fervent manner of preaching, and the
power of their word.

[Mark 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 3:20</span></span>

To eat bread - That is, to take any subsistence.

[Mark 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 3:21</span></span>

His relations - His mother and his brethren, [Mar
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md). But it was some time before they
could come near him.

[Mark 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 3:22</span></span>

The scribes and Pharisees, [Mat 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md);
who had come down from Jerusalem - Purposely on the devil's errand. And
not without success. For the common people now began to drink in the
poison, from these learned, good, honourable men! He hath Beelzebub - at
command, is in league with him: And by the prince of the devils casteth
he out devils - How easily may a man of learning elude the strongest
proof of a work of God! How readily can he account for every incident
without ever taking God into the question. [Mat
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md); [Luk
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#015.md).

[Mark 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 3:28</span></span>

[Mat 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md); [Luk
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md).

[Mark 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 3:30</span></span>

Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit - Is it not astonishing,
that men who have ever read these words, should doubt, what is the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? Can any words declare more plainly,
that it is "the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil which
Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost?"

[Mark 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 3:31</span></span>

Then come his brethren and his mother - Having at length made their way
through the crowd, so as to come to the door. His brethren are here
named first, as being first and most earnest in the design of taking
him: for neither did these of his brethren believe on him. They sent to
him, calling him - They sent one into the house, who called him aloud,
by name. [Mat 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md); [Luk
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019.md).

[Mark 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 3:34</span></span>

Looking round on them who sat about him - With the utmost sweetness; He
said, Behold my mother and my brethren - In this preference of his true
disciples even to the Virgin Mary, considered merely as his mother after
the flesh, he not only shows his high and tender affection for them, but
seems designedly to guard against those excessive and idolatrous
honours, which he foresaw would in after ages be paid to her.
