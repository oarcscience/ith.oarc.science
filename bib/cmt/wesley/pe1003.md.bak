### [1 Peter Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 3:1</span></span>

If any - He speaks tenderly. Won - Gained over to Christ.

[1 Peter 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 3:2</span></span>

Joined with a loving fear of displeasing them.

[1 Peter 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 3:3</span></span>

Three things are here expressly forbidden: curling the hair, wearing
gold, (by way of ornament,) and putting on costly or gay apparel. These,
therefore, ought never to be allowed, much less defended, by Christians.

[1 Peter 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 3:4</span></span>

The hidden man of the heart - Complete inward holiness, which implies a
meek and quiet spirit. A meek spirit gives no trouble willingly to any:
a quiet spirit bears all wrongs without being troubled. In the sight of
God - Who looks at the heart. All superfluity of dress contributes more
to pride and anger than is generally supposed. The apostle seems to have
his eye to this by substituting meekness and quietness in the room of
the ornaments he forbids. "I do not regard these things," is often said
by those whose hearts are wrapped up in them: but offer to take them
away, and you touch the very idol of their soul. Some, indeed only dress
elegantly that they may be looked on; that is, they squander away their
Lord's talent to gain applause: thus making sin to beget sin, and then
plead one in excuse of the other.

[1 Peter 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 3:5</span></span>

The adorning of those holy women, who trusted in God, and therefore did
not act thus from servile fear, was, Their meek subjection to their
husbands: Their quiet spirit, "not afraid," or amazed: and Their
unblamable behaviour, "doing" all things "well."

[1 Peter 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 3:6</span></span>

Whose children ye are - In a spiritual as well as natural sense, and
entitled to the same inheritance, while ye discharge your conjugal
duties, not out of fear, but for conscience' sake. [Gen
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012.md).

[1 Peter 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 3:7</span></span>

Dwell with the woman according to knowledge - Knowing they are weak, and
therefore to be used with all tenderness. Yet do not despise them for
this, but give them honour - Both in heart, in word, and in action; as
those who are called to be joint - heirs of that eternal life which ye
and they hope to receive by the free grace of God. That your prayers be
not hindered - On the one part or the other. All sin hinders prayer;
particularly anger. Anything at which we are angry is never more apt to
come into our mind than when we are at prayer; and those who do not
forgive will find no forgiveness from God.

[1 Peter 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 3:8</span></span>

Finally - This part of the epistle reaches to [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md). The apostle seems to have added
the rest afterwards. Sympathizing - Rejoicing and sorrowing together.
Love all believers as brethren. Be pitiful - Toward the afflicted. Be
courteous - To all men. Courtesy is such a behaviour toward equals and
inferiors as shows respect mixed with love.

[1 Peter 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 3:9</span></span>

Ye are called to inherit a blessing - Therefore their railing cannot
hurt you; and, by blessing them, you imitate God, who blesses you.

[1 Peter 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 3:10</span></span>

For he that desireth to love life, and to see good days - That would
make life amiable and desirable. [Psa
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012.md), &c.

[1 Peter 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 3:11</span></span>

Let him seek - To live peaceably with all men. And pursue it - Even when
it seems to flee from him.

[1 Peter 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 3:12</span></span>

The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous - For good. Anger appears in
the whole face; love, chiefly in the eyes.

[1 Peter 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 3:13</span></span>

Who is he that will harm you - None can.

[1 Peter 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 3:14</span></span>

But if ye should suffer - This is no harm to you, but a good. Fear ye
not their fear - The very words of the Septuagint, [Isa
8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md). Let not that fear be in you
which the wicked feel.

[1 Peter 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 3:15</span></span>

But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts - Have an holy fear, and a full
trust in his wise providence. The hope - Of eternal life. With meekness
- For anger would hurt your cause as well as your soul. And fear - A
filial fear of offending God, and a jealousy over yourselves, lest ye
speak amiss.

[1 Peter 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 3:16</span></span>

Having a good conscience - So much the more beware of anger, to which
the very consciousness of your innocence may betray you. Join with a
good conscience meekness and fear, and you obtain a complete victory.
Your good conversation in Christ - That is, which flows from faith in
him.

[1 Peter 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 3:17</span></span>

It is infinitely better, if it be the will of God, ye should suffer. His
permissive will appears from his providence.

[1 Peter 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 3:18</span></span>

For - This is undoubtedly best, whereby we are most conformed to Christ.
Now Christ suffered once - To suffer no more. For sins - Not his own,
but ours. The just for the unjust - The word signifies, not only them
who have wronged their neighbours, but those who have transgressed any
of the commands of God; as the preceding word, just, denotes a person
who has fulfilled, not barely social duties, but all kind of
righteousness. That he might bring us to God - Now to his gracious
favour, hereafter to his blissful presence, by the same steps of
suffering and of glory. Being put to death in the flesh - As man. But
raised to life by the Spirit - Both by his own divine power, and by the
power of the Holy Ghost.

[1 Peter 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 3:19</span></span>

By which Spirit he preached - Through the ministry of Noah. To the
spirits in prison - The unholy men before the flood, who were then
reserved by the justice of God, as in a prison, till he executed the
sentence upon them all; and are now also reserved to the judgment of the
great day.

[1 Peter 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe1 3:20</span></span>

When the longsuffering of God waited - For an hundred and twenty years;
all the time the ark was preparing: during which Noah warned them all to
flee from the wrath to come.

[1 Peter 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 3:21</span></span>

The antitype whereof - The thing typified by the ark, even baptism, now
saveth us - That is, through the water of baptism we are saved from the
sin which overwhelms the world as a flood: not, indeed, the bare outward
sign, but the inward grace; a divine consciousness that both our persons
and our actions are accepted through him who died and rose again for us.

[1 Peter 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 3:22</span></span>

Angels and authorities and powers - That is, all orders both of angels
and men.
