### [Esther Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001)

[Esther 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">est 5:2</span></span>

Held out - In testimony that he pardoned her presumption, and was ready
to grant her petition. Touched - In token of her thankful acceptance of
the king's favour, and of her reverence and submission.

[Esther 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 5:3</span></span>

It shall be given - God in his providence often prevents the fears and
outdoes the hopes of his servants. To the half of the kingdom - A
proverbial expression: that is, nothing in reason shall be denied.

[Esther 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 5:4</span></span>

Haman - Whom she invited, that by shewing such respect to the king's
great favourite, she might insinuate herself the more into the king's
affection; and, that if she saw fit, she might then present her request
to the king.

[Esther 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">est 5:6</span></span>

Of wine - So called, because it consisted not of meats, which probably
the king had plentifully eaten before, but of fruits and wines; which
banquets were very frequent among the Persians.

[Esther 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 5:8</span></span>

Tomorrow - I will acquaint thee with my humble request. She did not
present her petition at this time, but delayed it 'till the next
meeting; either because she was a little daunted with the king's
presence, or, because she would farther engage the king's affection to
her, and would also intimate to him that her petition was of a more than
ordinary nature: but principally by direction of Divine providence,
which took away her courage of utterance for this time, that she might
have a better opportunity for it the next time, by that great accident
which happened before it.

[Esther 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 5:9</span></span>

Nor moved - To shew how little he feared him, and that he had a firm
confidence in his God, that he would deliver him and his people in this
great exigency.

[Esther 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 5:10</span></span>

Refrained - From taking present vengeance upon Mordecai, which he might
easily have effected, either by his own, or any of his servants hands,
without any fear of inconveniency to himself. But herein God's wise and
powerful providence appeared, in disposing Haman's heart, contrary to
his own inclination, and making him, as it were, to put fetters upon his
own hands.

[Esther 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">est 5:12</span></span>

Am I - Thus he makes that matter of glorying which was the occasion of
his utter ruin. So ignorant are the wisest men, and subject to fatal
mistakes, rejoicing when they have most cause of fear, and sorrowing for
those things which tend to joy and comfort.

[Esther 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 5:13</span></span>

Availeth - Gives me no content. Such torment did his envy and malice
bring upon him. Sitting - Enjoying that honour and privilege without
disturbance, and denying me the worship due to me by the king's command.
Thus tho' proud men have much to their mind, if they have not all to
their mind, it is nothing. The thousandth part of what Haman had, would
give a modest, humble man, as much happiness as he expects to receive
from anything under the sun. And Haman as passionately complains, as if
he was in the lowest depth of poverty!

[Esther 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">est 5:14</span></span>

Fifty cubits - That it may be more conspicuous to all, and thereby be
more disgraceful to Mordecai, and strike all Haman's enemies with a
greater dread of despising or opposing him.
