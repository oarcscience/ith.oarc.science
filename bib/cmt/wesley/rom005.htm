<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</I>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p> <h3 align="center" align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Romans Chapter 5</A></h3> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Romans 5:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">rom 5:1</A></FONT></span></p>Being justified by faith - This is the sum of the preceding chapters. We have peace with God - Being enemies to God no longer, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</A>; neither fearing his wrath, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009">Rom 5:9</A>. We have peace, hope, love, and power over sin, the sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters. These are the fruits of justifying faith: where these are not, that faith is not. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Romans 5:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">rom 5:2</A></FONT></span></p>Into this grace - This state of favour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Romans 5:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">rom 5:3</A></FONT></span></p>We glory in tribulations also - Which we are so far from esteeming a mark of God's displeasure, that we receive them as tokens of his fatherly love, whereby we are prepared for a more exalted happiness. The Jews objected to the persecuted state of the Christians as inconsistent with the people of the Messiah. It is therefore with great propriety that the apostle so often mentions the blessings arising from this very thing. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004">Romans 5:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">rom 5:4</A></FONT></span></p>And patience works more experience of the sincerity of our grace, and of God's power and faithfulness. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005">Romans 5:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">rom 5:5</A></FONT></span></p>Hope shameth us not - That is, gives us the highest glorying. We glory in this our hope, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts - The divine conviction of God's love to us, and that love to God which is both the earnest and the beginning of heaven. By the Holy Ghost - The efficient cause of all these present blessings, and the earnest of those to come. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006">Romans 5:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">rom 5:6</A></FONT></span></p>How can we now doubt of God's love? For when we were without strength - Either to think, will, or do anything good. In due time - Neither too soon nor too late; but in that very point of time which the wisdom of God knew to be more proper than any other. Christ died for the ungodly - Not only to set them a pattern, or to procure them power to follow it. It does not appear that this expression, of dying for any one, has any other signification than that of rescuing the life of another by laying down our own. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007">Romans 5:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">rom 5:7</A></FONT></span></p>A just man - One who gives to all what is strictly their due The good man - One who is eminently holy; full of love, of compassion, kindness, mildness, of every heavenly and amiable temper. Perhaps - one - would - even - dare to die - Every word increases the strangeness of the thing, and declares even this to be something great and unusual. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008">Romans 5:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">rom 5:8</A></FONT></span></p>But God recommendeth - A most elegant expression. Those are wont to be recommended to us, who were before either unknown to, or alienated from, us. While we were sinners - So far from being good, that we were not even just. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009">Romans 5:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">rom 5:9</A></FONT></span></p>By his blood - By his bloodshedding. We shall be saved from wrath through him - That is, from all the effects of the wrath of God. But is there then wrath in God? Is not wrath a human passion? And how can this human passion be in God? We may answer this by another question: Is not love a human passion? And how can this human passion be in God? But to answer directly: wrath in man, and so love in man, is a human passion. But wrath in God is not a human passion; nor is love, as it is in God. Therefore the inspired writers ascribe both the one and the other to God only in an analogical sense. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Romans 5:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">rom 5:10</A></FONT></span></p>If - As sure as; so the word frequently signifies; particularly in this and the eighth chapter. We shalt be saved - Sanctified and glorified. Through his life - Who "ever liveth to make intercession for us." 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011">Romans 5:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">rom 5:11</A></FONT></span></p>And not only so, but we also glory - The whole sentence, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Rom 5:3-11</A>, may be taken together thus: We not only "rejoice in hope of the glory of God," but also in the midst of tribulations we glory in God himself through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012">Romans 5:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">rom 5:12</A></FONT></span></p>Therefore - This refers to all the preceding discourse; from which the apostle infers what follows. He does not therefore properly make a digression, but returns to speak again of sin and of righteousness. As by one man - Adam; who is mentioned, and not Eve, as being the representative of mankind. Sin entered into the world - Actual sin, and its consequence, a sinful nature. And death - With all its attendants. It entered into the world when it entered into being; for till then it did not exist. By sin - Therefore it could not enter before sin. Even so - Namely, by one man. In that - So the word is used also, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004">Co2 5:4</A>. All sinned - In Adam. These words assign the reason why death came upon all men; infants themselves not excepted, in that all sinned. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013">Romans 5:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">rom 5:13</A></FONT></span></p>For until the law sin was in the world - All, I say, had sinned, for sin was in the world long before the written law; but, I grant, sin is not so much imputed, nor so severely punished by God, where there is no express law to convince men of it. Yet that all had sinned, even then, appears in that all died. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014">Romans 5:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">rom 5:14</A></FONT></span></p>Death reigned - And how vast is his kingdom! Scarce can we find any king who has as many subjects, as are the kings whom he hath conquered. Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression - Even over infants who had never sinned, as Adam did, in their own persons; and over others who had not, like him, sinned against an express law. Who is the figure of him that was to come - Each of them being a public person, and a federal head of mankind. The one, the fountain of sin and death to mankind by his offence; the other, of righteousness and life by his free gift. Thus far the apostle shows the agreement between the first and second Adam: afterward he shows the differences between them. The agreement may be summed up thus: As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so by one man righteousness entered into the world, and life by righteousness. As death passed upon all men, in that all had sinned; so life passed upon all men, (who are in the second Adam by faith,) in that all are justified. And as death through the sin of the first Adam reigned even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression; so through the righteousness of Christ, even those who have not obeyed, after the likeness of his obedience, shall reign in life. We may add, As the sin of Adam, without the sins which we afterwards committed, brought us death ; so the righteousness of Christ, without the good works which we afterwards perform, brings us life: although still every good, as well as evil, work, will receive its due reward. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Romans 5:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">rom 5:15</A></FONT></span></p>Yet not - St. Paul now describes the difference between Adam and Christ; and that much more directly and expressly than the agreement between them. Now the fall and the free gift differ, In amplitude, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</A>. He from whom sin came, and He from whom the free gift came, termed also "the gift of righteousness," differ in power, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016">Rom 5:16</A>. The reason of both is subjoined, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017">Rom 5:17</A>. This premised, the offence and the free gift are compared, with regard to their effect, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018">Rom 5:18</A>, and with regard to their cause, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Rom 5:19</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016">Romans 5:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">rom 5:16</A></FONT></span></p>The sentence was by one offence to Adam's condemnation - Occasioning the sentence of death to pass upon him, which, by consequence, overwhelmed his posterity. But the free gift is of many offences unto justification - Unto the purchasing it for all men, notwithstanding many offences. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017">Romans 5:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">rom 5:17</A></FONT></span></p>There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018">Romans 5:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">rom 5:18</A></FONT></span></p>Justification of life - Is that sentence of God, by which a sinner under sentence of death is adjudged to life. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Romans 5:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">rom 5:19</A></FONT></span></p>As by the disobedience of one man many (that is, all men) were constituted sinners - Being then in the loins of their first parent, the common head and representative of them all. So by the obedience of one - By his obedience unto death; by his dying for us. Many - All that believe. Shall be constituted righteous - Justified, pardoned. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Romans 5:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">rom 5:20</A></FONT></span></p>The law came in between - The offence and the free gift. That the offence might abound - That is, the consequence (not the design) of the law's coming in was, not the taking away of sin, but the increase of it. Yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound - Not only in the remission of that sin which Adam brought on us, but of all our own; not only in remission of sins, but infusion of holiness; not only in deliverance from death, but admission to everlasting life, a far more noble and excellent life than that which we lost by Adam's fall. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021">Romans 5:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">rom 5:21</A></FONT></span></p>That as sin had reigned - so grace also might reign - Which could not reign before the fall; before man had sinned. Through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord - Here is pointed out the source of all our blessings, the rich and free grace of God. The meritorious cause; not any works of righteousness of man, but the alone merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. The effect or end of all; not only pardon, but life; divine life, leading to glory.
