### [Hebrews Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 6:1</span></span>

Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ - That is,
saying no more of them for the present. Let us go on to perfection; not
laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works - From open
sins, the very first thing to be insisted on. And faith in God - The
very next point. So St. Paul in his very first sermon at Lystra, [Act
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md), "Turn from those vanities unto
the living God." And when they believed, they were to be baptized with
the baptism, not of the Jews, or of John, but of Christ. The next thing
was, to lay hands upon them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
after which they were more fully instructed, touching the resurrection,
and the general judgment; called eternal, because the sentence then
pronounced is irreversible, and the effects of it remain for ever.

[Hebrews 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 6:3</span></span>

And this we will do - We will go on to perfection; and so much the more
diligently, because,

[Hebrews 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 6:4</span></span>

It is impossible for those who were once enlightened - With the light of
the glorious love of God in Christ. And have tasted the heavenly gift -
Remission of sins, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. And been made
partakers of the Holy Ghost - Of the witness and the fruit of he Spirit.

[Hebrews 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 6:5</span></span>

And have tasted the good word of God - Have had a relish for, and a
delight in it. And the powers of the world to come - Which every one
tastes, who has an hope full of immortality. Every child that is
naturally born, first sees the light, then receives and tastes proper
nourishment, and partakes of the things of this world. In like manner,
the apostle, comparing spiritual with natural things, speaks of one born
of the Spirit, as seeing the light, tasting the sweetness, and partaking
of the things "of the world to come."

[Hebrews 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 6:6</span></span>

And have fallen away - Here is not a supposition, but a plain relation
of fact. The apostle here describes the case of those who have cast away
both the power and the form of godliness; who have lost both their
faith, hope, and love, [Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md), &c.,
and that wilfully, [Heb 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md). Of
these wilful total apostates he declares, it is impossible to renew them
again to repentance. (though they were renewed once,) either to the
foundation, or anything built thereon. Seeing they crucify the Son of
God afresh - They use him with the utmost indignity. And put him to an
open shame - Causing his glorious name to be blasphemed.

[Hebrews 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 6:8</span></span>

That which beareth thorns and briers - Only or chiefly. Is rejected - No
more labour is bestowed upon it. Whose end is to be burned - As
Jerusalem was shortly after.

[Hebrews 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 6:9</span></span>

But, beloved - in this one place he calls them so. he never uses this
appellation, but in exhorting. We are persuaded of you things that
accompany salvation - We are persuaded you are now saved from your sins;
and that ye have that faith, love, and holiness, which lead to final
salvation. Though we thus speak - To warn you, lest you should fall from
your present steadfastness.

[Hebrews 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 6:10</span></span>

For - Ye give plain proof of your faith and love, which the righteous
God will surely reward.

[Hebrews 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 6:11</span></span>

But we desire you may show the same diligence unto the end - And
therefore we thus speak. To the full assurance of hope - Which you
cannot expect, if you abate your diligence. The full assurance of faith
relates to present pardon; the full assurance of hope, to future glory.
The former is the highest degree of divine evidence that God is
reconciled to me in the Son of his love; the latter is the same degree
of divine evidence (wrought in the soul by the same immediate
inspiration of the Holy Ghost) of persevering grace, and of eternal
glory. So much, and no more, as faith every moment "beholds with open
face," so much does hope see to all eternity But this assurance of faith
and hope is not an opinion, not a bare construction of scripture, but is
given immediately by the power of the Holy Ghost; and what none can have
for another, but for himself only.

[Hebrews 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 6:12</span></span>

Inherited the promises - The promised rest; paradise.

[Hebrews 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 6:13</span></span>

For - Ye have abundant encouragement, seeing no stronger promise could
be made than that great promise which God made to Abraham, and in him to
us.

[Hebrews 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 6:14</span></span>

[Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md).

[Hebrews 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 6:15</span></span>

After he had waited - Thirty years. He obtained the promise - Isaac, the
pledge of all the promises.

[Hebrews 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 6:16</span></span>

Men generally swear by him who is infinitely greater than themselves,
and an oath for confirmation, to confirm what is promised or asserted,
usually puts an end to all contradiction. This shows that an oath taken
in a religious manner is lawful even under the gospel: otherwise the
apostle would never have mentioned it with so much honour, as a proper
means to confirm the truth

[Hebrews 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 6:17</span></span>

God interposed by an oath - Amazing condescension! He who is greatest of
all acts as if he were a middle person; as if while he swears, he were
less than himself, by whom he swears! Thou that hearest the promise,
dost thou not yet believe?

[Hebrews 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 6:18</span></span>

That by two unchangeable things - His promise and his oath, in either,
much more in both of which, it was impossible for God to lie, we might
have strong consolation - Swallowing up all doubt and fear. Who have
fled - After having been tossed by many storms. To lay hold on the hope
set before us - On Christ, the object of our hope, and the glory we hope
for through him.

[Hebrews 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 6:19</span></span>

Which hope in Christ we have as an anchor of the soul - Entering into
heaven itself, and fixed there. Within the veil - Thus he slides back to
the priesthood of Christ.

[Hebrews 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 6:20</span></span>

A forerunner uses to be less in dignity than those that are to follow
him. But it is not so here; for Christ who is gone before us is
infinitely superior to us. What an honour is it to believers, to have so
glorious a forerunner, now appearing in the presence of God for them.
