<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 126:1</span></span>

Turned - Brought the captive Israelites out of Babylon into their own
land. Dream - We were so surprized and astonished.

[Psalms 126:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 126:4</span></span>

Turn - As thou hast brought us home, bring also the rest of our
brethren. As - As thou art pleased sometimes to send floods of water
into dry and barren grounds, such as the southern parts of Canaan were.
