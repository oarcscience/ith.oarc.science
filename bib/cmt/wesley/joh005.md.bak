### [John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

[John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 5:1</span></span>

A feast - Pentecost.

[John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 5:2</span></span>

There is in Jerusalem - Hence it appears, that St. John wrote his Gospel
before Jerusalem was destroyed: it is supposed about thirty years after
the ascension. Having five porticos - Built for the use of the sick.
Probably the basin had five sides! Bethesda signifies the house of
mercy.

[John 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 5:4</span></span>

An angel - Yet many undoubtedly thought the whole thing to be purely
natural. At certain times - Perhaps at a certain hour of the day, during
this paschal week, went down - The Greek word implies that he had ceased
going down, before the time of St. John's writing this. God might design
this to raise expectation of the acceptable time approaching, to add a
greater lustre to his Son's miracles, and to show that his ancient
people were not entirely forgotten of him. The first - Whereas the Son
of God healed every day not one only, but whole multitudes that resorted
to him.

[John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 5:7</span></span>

The sick man answered - Giving the reason why he was not made whole,
notwithstanding his desire.

[John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 5:14</span></span>

Sin no more - It seems his former illness was the effect or punishment
of sin.

[John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 5:15</span></span>

The man went and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole
- One might have expected, that when he had published the name of his
benefactor, crowds would have thronged about Jesus, to have heard the
words of his mouth, and to have received the blessings of the Gospel.
Instead of this, they surround him with a hostile intent: they even
conspire against his life, and for an imagined transgression in point of
ceremony, would have put out this light of Israel. Let us not wonder
then, if our good be evil spoken of: if even candour, benevolence, and
usefulness, do not disarm the enmity of those who have been taught to
prefer sacrifice to mercy; and who, disrelishing the genuine Gospel,
naturally seek to slander and persecute the professors, but especially
the defenders of it.

[John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 5:17</span></span>

My Father worketh until now, and I work - From the creation till now he
hath been working without intermission. I do likewise. This is the
proposition which is explained [Joh
5:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md), confirmed and vindicated in
[Joh 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md) and following verses.

[John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 5:18</span></span>

His own Father - The Greek word means his own Father in such a sense as
no creature can speak. Making himself equal with God - It is evident all
the hearers so understood him, and that our Lord never contradicted, but
confirmed it.

[John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 5:19</span></span>

The Son can do nothing of himself - This is not his imperfection, but
his glory, resulting from his eternal, intimate, indissoluble unity with
the Father. Hence it is absolutely impossible, that the Son should
judge, will, testify, or teach any thing without the Father, [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md), &c; [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md); [Joh
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016.md); or that he should be known or
believed on, separately from the Father. And he here defends his doing
good every day, without intermission, by the example of his Father, from
which he cannot depart: these doth the Son likewise - All these, and
only these; seeing he and the Father are one.

[John 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 5:20</span></span>

The Father showeth him all things that himself doth - A proof of the
most intimate unity. And he will show him - By doing them. At the same
time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son
seeth and doth. Greater works - Jesus oftener terms them works, than
signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes. Ye will
marvel - So they did, when he raised Lazarus.

[John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 5:21</span></span>

For - He declares which are those greater works, raising the dead, and
judging the world. The power of quickening whom he will follows from the
power of judging. These two, quickening and judging, are proposed [Joh
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md). The acquittal of believers,
which presupposes judgment, is treated of [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md); the quickening some of the dead,
[Joh 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md); and the general
resurrection, [Joh 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md).

[John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 5:22</span></span>

For neither doth the Father judge - Not without the Son: but he doth
judge by that man whom he hath ordained, [Act
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md).

[John 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 5:23</span></span>

That all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father - Either
willingly, and so escaping condemnation, by faith: or unwillingly, when
feeling the wrath of the Judge. This demonstrates the EQUALITY of the
Son with the Father. If our Lord were God only by office or investiture,
and not in the unity of the Divine essence, and in all respects equal in
Godhead with the Father, he could not be honoured even as, that is, with
the same honour that they honoured the Father. He that honoureth not the
Son - With the same equal honour, greatly dishonoureth the Father that
sent him.

[John 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 5:24</span></span>

And cometh not into condemnation - Unless he make shipwreck of the
faith.

[John 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 5:25</span></span>

The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God - So did Jairus's
daughter, the widow's son, Lazarus.

[John 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 5:26</span></span>

He hath given to the Son - By eternal generation, to have life in
himself - Absolute, independent.

[John 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 5:27</span></span>

Because he is the Son of man - He is appointed to judge mankind because
he was made man.

[John 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 5:28</span></span>

The time is coming - When not two or three, but all shall rise.

[John 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 5:29</span></span>

The resurrection of life - That resurrection which leads to life
everlasting.

[John 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 5:30</span></span>

I can do nothing of myself - It is impossible I should do any thing
separately from my Father. As I hear - Of the Father, and see, so I
judge and do; A because I am essentially united to him. See [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md).

[John 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 5:31</span></span>

If I testify of myself - That is, if I alone, (which indeed is
impossible,) my testimony is not valid.

[John 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 5:32</span></span>

There is another - The Father, [Joh
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md), and I know that, even in your
judgment, his testimony in beyond exception.

[John 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 5:33</span></span>

He bare testimony - That I am the Christ.

[John 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 5:34</span></span>

But I have no need to receive, &c. But these things - Concerning John,
whom ye yourselves reverence, I say, that ye may be saved - So really
and seriously did he will their salvation. Yet they were not saved.
Most, if not all of them, died in their sins.

[John 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 5:35</span></span>

He was a burning and a shining light - Inwardly burning with love and
zeal, outwardly shining in all holiness. And even ye were willing for a
season - A short time only.

[John 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 5:37</span></span>

He hath testified of me - Namely at my baptism. I speak not of my
supposed father Joseph. Ye are utter strangers to him of whom I speak.

[John 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 5:38</span></span>

Ye have not his word - All who believe have the word of the Father (the
same with the word of the Son) abiding in them, that is, deeply
ingrafted in their hearts.

[John 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 5:39</span></span>

Search the Scriptures - A plain command to all men. In them ye are
assured ye have eternal life - Ye know they show you the way to eternal
life. And these very Scriptures testify of me.

[John 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 5:40</span></span>

Yet ye will not come unto me - As they direct you.

[John 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 5:41</span></span>

I receive not honour from men - I need it not. I seek it not from you
for my own sake.

[John 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 5:42</span></span>

But I know you - With this ray he pierces the hearts of the hearers. And
this doubtless he spake with the tenderest compassion.

[John 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 5:43</span></span>

If another shall come - Any false Christ.

[John 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 5:44</span></span>

While ye receive honour - That is, while ye seek the praise of men
rather than the praise of God. At the feast of pentecost, kept in
commemoration of the giving the law from Mount Sinai, their sermons used
to be full of the praises of the law, and of the people to whom it was
given. How mortifying then must the following words of our Lord be to
them, while they were thus exulting in Moses and his law!

[John 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 5:45</span></span>

There is one that accuseth you - By his writings.

[John 5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 5:46</span></span>

He wrote of me - Every where; in all his writings; particularly [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md).
