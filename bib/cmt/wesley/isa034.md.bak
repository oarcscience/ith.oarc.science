### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 34:2</span></span>

All nations - Not only upon the Assyrians, but on all enemies of my
people.

[Isaiah 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 34:3</span></span>

Cast out - Into the fields.

[Isaiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 34:4</span></span>

Dissolved - The sun, moon, and stars. So great shall be the confusion
and consternation of mankind, as if all the frame of the creation were
broken into pieces. It is usual for prophetic writers, both in the Old
and New Testament, to represent great and general calamities, in such
words and phrases, as properly agree to the day of judgment; as on the
contrary, the glorious deliverances of God's people, in such
expressions, as properly agree to the resurrection from the dead.

[Isaiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 34:5</span></span>

Bathed - In the blood of these people. Heaven - Where God dwells; in
which this is said to be done, because it was there decreed and
appointed. Idumea - Upon the Edomites, who, tho' they were nearly
related to the Israelites, yet were their implacable enemies. But these
are named for all the enemies of God's church, of whom they were an
eminent type. The people - Whom I have cursed, and devoted to utter
destruction, as the word properly signifies.

[Isaiah 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 34:6</span></span>

The sword - The metaphor is taken from a great glutton, who is almost
insatiable. Rams - By lambs, and goats, and rams, he means people of all
ranks and conditions, high and low, rich and poor. Bozrah - A chief city
of Edom, and a type of those cities which should be most opposite to
God's people.

[Isaiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 34:7</span></span>

The unicorns - It is confessed, this was a beast of great strength and
fierceness; and it is used in this place to signify their princes and
potentates, who shall be humbled and cast down. Them - With the lambs,
and goats, and rams. Fatness - With the fat of the slain sacrifices,
mingled with it.

[Isaiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 34:8</span></span>

For - This is the time which God hath fixed, to avenge the cause of his
persecuted people.

[Isaiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 34:9</span></span>

The land - Idumea shall be dealt with, as Sodom and Gomorrah were.

[Isaiah 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 34:10</span></span>

For ever - It shall remain as a spectacle of God's vengeance to all
succeeding ages.

[Isaiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 34:11</span></span>

Dwell - It shall be entirely possessed by those creatures which delight
in deserts and waste places. Stretch - He shall use the line, or the
stone or plummet joined to it, not to build them, but to mark them out
to destruction, as workmen commonly use them to mark what they are to
pull down.

[Isaiah 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 34:12</span></span>

None - They shall not find any willing to undertake the government.
Nothing - Shall have no courage or strength left in them.

[Isaiah 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 34:16</span></span>

Seek - When this judgment is executed, if you pursue this prophecy, you
will find, that all things exactly come to pass, as I have told you. His
- My spirit, (such sudden changes of persons being frequent here) hath
brought all these creatures together, as he formerly brought the
creatures to Adam, and to Noah, by an instinct which he put into them.

[Isaiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 34:17</span></span>

Divided - He hath divided the land to them, as it were by lot and line,
as Canaan was divided among the Israelites.
