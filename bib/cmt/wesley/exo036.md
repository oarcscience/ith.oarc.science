### [Exodus Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001)

[Exodus 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 36:2</span></span>

And Moses called Bezaleel - "Even those whom God has qualified for, and
inclined to the service of the tabernacle, yet must wait for a call to
it, either extraordinary, as that of preachers and apostles, or
ordinary, as that of pastors and teachers. And observe who they were
that Moses called; those in whose heart God had put wisdom for this
purpose, beyond their natural capacity, and whose heart stirred him up
to come to the work in good earnest." Those are to be called to the
building of the gospel tabernacle, whom God has by his grace made in
some measure fit for the work, and free to it: ability and willingness,
with resolution, are the two things to be regarded in the call of
ministers.

[Exodus 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035)

The veil made for a partition between the holy place and the most holy,
signified the darkness and distance of that dispensation compared with
the New Testament, which shews us the glory of God more clearly, and
invites us to draw near to it; and the darkness and distance of our
present state in comparison with heaven, where we shall be ever with the
Lord, and see him as he is.

[Exodus 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 36:37</span></span>

An hanging - Which divided the holy place from the court.
