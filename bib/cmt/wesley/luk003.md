### [Luke Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)

[Luke 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 3:1</span></span>

The fifteenth year of Tiberius - Reckoning from the time when Angustus
made him his colleague in the empire. Herod being tetrarch of Galilee -
The dominions of Herod the Great were, after his death, divided into
four parts or tetrarchies. This Herod his son was tetrarch of Galilee,
reigning over that fourth part of his dominions. His brother reigned
over two other fourth parts, the region of Iturea, and that of
Trachonitis (that tract of land on the other side Jordan, which had
formerly belonged to the tribe of Manasseh.) And Lysanias (probably
descended from a prince of that name, who was some years before governor
of that country) was tetrarch of the remaining part of Abilene, which
was a large city of Syria, whose territories reached to Lebanon and
Damascus, and contained great numbers of Jews. [Mat
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001); [Mar
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001).

[Luke 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 3:2</span></span>

Annas being high priest, and Caiaphas - There could be but one high
priest, strictly speaking, at once. Annas was the high priest at that
time, and Caiaphas his sagan or deputy.

[Luke 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 3:4</span></span>

[Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).

[Luke 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 3:5</span></span>

Every valley shall be filled, &c. - That is, every hinderance shall be
removed.

[Luke 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 3:6</span></span>

The salvation of God - The Saviour, the Messiah.

[Luke 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 3:8</span></span>

Say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father - That is,
trust not in your being members of the visible Church, or in any
external privileges whatsoever: for God now requires a change of heart;
and that without delay.

[Luke 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 3:10</span></span>

He answereth - It is not properly John, but the Holy Ghost, who teaches
us in the following answers, how to come ourselves, and how to instruct
other penitent sinners to come to Christ, that he may give them rest.
The sum of all this is, Cease to do evil, learn to do well. These are
the fruits worthy of repentance.

[Luke 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 3:20</span></span>

He shut up John - This circumstance, though it happened after, is here
mentioned before our Lord's baptism, that his history (that of John
being concluded) may then follow without any interruption.

[Luke 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 3:21</span></span>

Jesus praying, the heaven was opened - It is observable, that the three
voices from heaven, see [Luk 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029),
[Luk 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#035); [Joh
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#028); by which the Father bore
witness to Christ, were pronounced either while he was praying, or
quickly after it. [Mat 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013); [Mar
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009).

[Luke 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 3:23</span></span>

And Jesus was - John's beginning was computed by the years of princes:
our Saviour's by the years of his own life, as a more august era. About
thirty years of age - He did not now enter upon his thirtieth year (as
the common translation would induce one to think) but he now entered on
his public ministry: being of such an age as the Mosaic law required.
Our great Master attained not, as it seems, to the conclusion of his
thirty - fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish
within those narrow limits of time! Happy that servant, who, with any
proportionable zeal, despatches the great business of life; and so much
the more happy, if his sun go down at noon. For the space that is taken
from the labours of time, shall be added to the rewards of eternity. The
son of Heli - That is, the son - in - law: for Heli was the father of
Mary. So St. Matthew writes the genealogy of Joseph, descended from
David by Solomon; St. Luke that of Mary, descended from David by Nathan.
In the genealogy of Joseph (recited by St. Matthew) that of Mary is
implied, the Jews being accustomed to marry into their own families.

[Luke 3:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 3:38</span></span>

Adam the son of God - That is, whatever the sons of Adam receive from
their human parents, Adam received immediately from God, except sin and
misery.
