### [Nahum Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

[Nahum 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 1:1</span></span>

The burden - When the prophets were sent to denounce judgments against a
nation or city, the word was usually called the burden of that nation or
city. The vision - As prophets were of old called seers, [Sa1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md), so their prophesies were called
visions. Nahum - His name speaks a comforter, but it is God's people to
whom he gives notice of the destruction of their oppressors.

[Nahum 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 1:2</span></span>

Jealous - For his own glory. Revengeth - As supreme governor, who by
office is bound to right the oppressed, and to punish the oppressor.

[Nahum 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 1:3</span></span>

Hath his way - The methods of his providence. The whirlwind - Which
beareth before it all things that stand in its way. The dust of his feet
- Though he be surrounded with darkness, yet as an army afar off is
discovered by the dust that their feet raise, so wilt God appear with
great power marching against his enemies.

[Nahum 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 1:4</span></span>

The flower - Whatever flourished thereon; the blossoms, and flowers
which were wont to be the glory of it.

[Nahum 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 1:7</span></span>

Knoweth - He approves, owns, and preserves them.

[Nahum 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 1:8</span></span>

An over - running flood - His judgments like a mighty flood that
overflows all banks, shall swallow up Assyria. Thereof - Of Nineveh,
that is Nineveh itself. Darkness - Troubles, and desolating afflictions.

[Nahum 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 1:9</span></span>

Against the Lord - What you imagine or design against his people, ye
design against him? Make an utter end - He will bring you to utter
desolation.

[Nahum 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">nah 1:10</span></span>

As thorns - They shall be like thorns easily burnt, and like thorns
folded together which burn together, and help to destroy each other. As
drunkards - As men drunken, and unable to help themselves, so the
Assyrians drunk with pleasure and pride, shall be surprised, and easily
overthrown.

[Nahum 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 1:11</span></span>

Come - Sennacherib, or Rabshekah. Thee - From Nineveh. Against the Lord
- Against the people of the Lord, [Ch2
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md).

[Nahum 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 1:12</span></span>

They - The Assyrians. Quiet - Be secure, and fear no dangers. Yet thus -
Irresistible, suddenly, and universally. He - The angel of the Lord.
Thee - O Israel, I will no more use that rod.

[Nahum 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">nah 1:14</span></span>

Thee - Thee, Sennacherib, and the whole kingdom of Assyria. Be sown -
None shall bear thy name, and title; but thy kingdom shall be swallowed
up.

[Nahum 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">nah 1:15</span></span>

Keep - Be careful to serve God. Thy vows - Made in thy distress. The
wicked - That wicked oppressor, Sennacherib.
