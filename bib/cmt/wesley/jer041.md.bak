Now - Three months after the city was taken. Ishmael - The same Ishmael
that came to Gedaliah, [Jer 41:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#008.md), to
whom he sware protection; only here we are told he was of the royal
blood, which might both raise his spirits, as having a more legal
pretence to the government, and rendered him a fitter instrument, for
Baalis the king or queen of the Ammonites to make use of. The princes -
Some of the princes, who had escaped the army of the king of Babylon.

Cut themselves - With all indications of mourning used in those
countries.
