### [Esther Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#001.md)

[Esther 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">est 2:3</span></span>

Keeper - Of all the women, both virgins and concubines: only the virgins
he himself took care of, as requiring more care and caution, and the
concubines be committed to Shaashgaz, [Est
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#014.md), his deputy. Purification - That
is, to cleanse them from all impurities, to perfume, and adorn, and
every way prepare them for the king: for the legal purification of the
Jews he never regarded.

[Esther 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">est 2:7</span></span>

Esther - Hadassah was her Hebrew name before her marriage; and she was
called Esther by the king after it.

[Esther 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">est 2:9</span></span>

Pleased - Because she was very beautiful, therefore he supposed she
would be acceptable to the king; and by the Divine power, which moveth
the hearts of men which way he pleaseth.

[Esther 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">est 2:10</span></span>

Shew it - Lest the knowledge hereof should either make her contemptible,
or bring some inconvenience to the whole nation; but there was also an
hand of God in causing this to be concealed, for the better
accomplishment of that which he designed, though Mordecai was ignorant
of it.

[Esther 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 2:13</span></span>

Desired - For ornament, or by way of attendance. And it should be
observed, that every one whom the king took to his bed, was his wife of
a lower rank, as Hagar was Abraham's, so that it would have been no sin
or dishonour to Esther, though she had not been made queen.

[Esther 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">est 2:19</span></span>

Sat - By office, as one of the king's guards or ministers; being
advanced to this place by Esther's favour.
