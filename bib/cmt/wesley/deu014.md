### [Deuteronomy Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 14:1</span></span>

Of the Lord - Whom therefore you must not disparage by unworthy or
unbecoming practices. Ye shall not cut yourselves - Which were the
practices of idolaters, both in the worship of their idols, in their
funerals, and upon occasion of public calamities. Is not this like a
parent's charge to his little children, playing with knives, "Do not cut
yourselves!" This is, the intention of those commands, which obliges us
to deny ourselves. The meaning is, Do yourselves no harm! And as this
also is, the design of cross providences, to remove from us those things
by which we are in danger of doing ourselves harm.

[Deuteronomy 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 14:3</span></span>

Abominable - Unclean and forbidden by me, which therefore should be
abominable to you.

[Deuteronomy 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 14:22</span></span>

All the increase - This is to be understood of the second tithes, which
seem to be the same with the tithes of the first year, mentioned [Deu
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028).

[Deuteronomy 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 14:25</span></span>

In thine hand - That is, in a bag to be taken into thy hand and carried
with thee.

[Deuteronomy 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 14:27</span></span>

Thou shalt not forsake him - Thou shalt give him a share in such tithes
or in the product of them.

[Deuteronomy 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 14:28</span></span>

At the end of three years - That is, in the third year, as it is,
expressed, [Deu 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012). The same year -
This is added to shew that he speaks of the third year, and not of the
fourth year, as some might conjecture from the phrase, at the end of
three years.
