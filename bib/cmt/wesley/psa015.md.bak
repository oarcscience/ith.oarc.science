### [Psalms Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 15:1</span></span>

Who - Who shall so dwell in thy church here, as to dwell with thee for
ever in heaven?

[Psalms 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 15:2</span></span>

Uprightly - Loving, and serving God, and loving his neighbour not in
word only, but in truth; and this constantly. Worketh - Makes it his
business to do justly, to give to every one his due, first to God, and
then to men. Speaketh - His words and professions to God and men, agree
with the thoughts and purposes of his heart.

[Psalms 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 15:3</span></span>

He - He that doth not speak evil of his neighbour. Neighbour - That is,
any man. Nor taketh - Into his mouth, doth not raise it, neither spread
or propagate it; or believe it without sufficient reason.

[Psalms 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 15:4</span></span>

Vile - An ungodly man. Honoureth - He highly esteems and loves them,
though they be mean as to their worldly condition, and though they may
differ from him in some opinions or practices of lesser moment. Sweareth
- A promissory oath. Hurt - To his own damage. As if a man solemnly
swear, that he will sell him such an estate at a price below the full
worth; or that, he will give a poor man such a sum of money, which
afterwards he finds inconvenient to him. Changeth not - His purpose, but
continues firm and resolved to perform his promise.

[Psalms 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 15:5</span></span>

To usury - In such a manner as is contrary to God's law: of which see
otherwise, [Exo 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md); [Lev
25:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036.md), &c. Reward - Or, a bribe for
him who hath a bad cause. Moved - He shall abide with God here, and when
he dies be for ever with the Lord.
