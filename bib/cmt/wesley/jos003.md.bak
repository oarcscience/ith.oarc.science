### [Joshua Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 3:1</span></span>

In the morning - Not after the return of the spies, but after the three
days, [Jos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011.md), as it follows, [Jos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md). Lodge there - That night, that
they might go over in the day time, that the miracle might be more
evident and unquestionable, and strike the greater terror into their
enemies.

[Joshua 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 3:2</span></span>

After three days - Either at the end of them, or upon the last of them.
Through the host - The second time to give them more particular
directions, as they had given them a general notice, [Jos
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#010.md).

[Joshua 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 3:3</span></span>

Commanded the people - In Joshua's name, and by his authority. Priests
and Levites - Who were not only Levites, but priests also. For altho'
the Levites were to carry the ark, [Num
4:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#001.md), yet the priests might perform
that office, and did so upon some solemn occasions. Go after it -
Towards Jordan, to go over it in such a manner as I am about to
describe. 'Till this time the ark went in the middle of the cloudy
pillar, now it goes in the front. Probably the pillar of fire and cloud
was still hovering over the ark.

[Joshua 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 3:4</span></span>

Two thousand cubits - A thousand yards, at which distance from it the
Israelites seem to have been encamped in the wilderness. And because
they generally went from their tents to the ark to worship God,
especially on the sabbath - days; hence it hath been conceived, that a
sabbath - day's journey reached only to two thousand cubits. But that
may be doubted; for those who encamped nearest the ark, were at that
distance from it, and came so far; but the rest were farther from it,
and their sabbath - day's journey was considerably longer. Near unto it
- Partly from the respect they should bear to the ark; but chiefly, that
the ark marching so far before you into the river, and standing still
there 'till you pass over, may give you the greater assurance of your
safe passage. Ye have not passed this way heretofore - While we are
here, we must expect unusual events, to pathways that we have not passed
before: and much more when we go hence, when we pass thro' the valley of
the shadow of death. But if we have the assurance of God's presence,
what have we to fear?

[Joshua 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 3:5</span></span>

And Joshua said - Or rather, had said, the day before their passage; for
it follows, to - morrow. Sanctify yourselves - Both in soul and body,
that you may be meet to receive such a favour, and with more reverence
observe this great work, and fix it in your hearts.

[Joshua 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 3:6</span></span>

Take up - Namely, upon your shoulders; for so they were to carry it,
[Num 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md). Before the people - Not in
the middle of them, as you used to do.

[Joshua 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 3:7</span></span>

Magnify thee - That is, to gain thee authority among them, as the person
whom I have set in Moses's stead, and by whom I will conduct them to the
possession of the promised land.

[Joshua 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 3:8</span></span>

The brink - Heb. to the extremity, so far as the river then spread
itself, which was now more than ordinary, [Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md). In Jordan - Within the waters of
Jordan, in the first entrance into the river; Where they stood for a
season, 'till the river was divided, and then they went into the midst
of it, and there abode 'till all the people were passed over.

[Joshua 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 3:9</span></span>

Come hither - To the ark or tabernacle, the place of public assemblies.
The Lord your God - Who is now about to give a proof that he is both the
Lord, the omnipotent governor of heaven and earth, and all creatures;
and your God, in covenant with you, having a tender care and affection
for you.

[Joshua 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 3:10</span></span>

Ye shall know - By experience and sensible evidence. The living God -
Not a dull, dead, senseless God, such as the gods of the nations are;
but a God of life, and power, and activity to watch over you, and work
for you. Among you - Is present with you to strengthen and help you.

[Joshua 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 3:12</span></span>

Twelve men - For the work described, [Jos
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 3:13</span></span>

The ark of the Lord - That so it may appear this is the Lord's doing,
and that in pursuance of his covenant made with Israel. Of all the earth
- The Lord of all this globe of earth and water, who therefore can
dispose of this river and the adjoining land as he pleaseth. Cut off -
The waters which now are united now shall be divided, and part shall
flow down the channel towards the dead sea, and the other part that is
nearer the spring of the river, and flows down from it, shall stand
still. An heap - Being as it were congealed, as the Red - Sea was, [Exo
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008.md), and so kept from overflowing the
country.

[Joshua 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 3:15</span></span>

All the time of harvest - This is meant not of wheat - harvest, but of
the barley - harvest, as is manifest from their keeping the passover at
their first entrance, [Jos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md), which
was kept on the fourteenth day of the first month, when they were to
bring a sheaf of their first - fruits, which were of barley. So that
this harvest in those hot countries fell very early in the spring, when
rivers used to swell most; partly because of the rains which have fallen
all the winter, partly because of the snows which melt and come into the
rivers. And this time God chose that the miracle might be more glorious,
more amazing and terrible to the Canaanites; and that the Israelites
might be entertained at their first entrance with plentiful and
comfortable provisions.

[Joshua 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 3:16</span></span>

Adam - The city Adam being more obscure, is described by its nearness to
a more known place, then eminent, but now unknown. The meaning is, that
the waters were stopped in their course at that place, and so kept at a
distance from the Israelites whilst they passed over. Against Jericho -
Here God carried them over, because this part was, The strongest, as
having in its neighbourhood an eminent city, a potent king, and a stout
and war - like people. The most pleasant and fruitful, and therefore
more convenient both for the refreshment of the Israelites after their
long and tedious marches, and for their encouragement.

[Joshua 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 3:17</span></span>

Stood firm - That is, in one and the same place and posture; their feet
neither moved by any waters moving in upon them, nor sinking into any
mire, which one might think was at the bottom of the river. And this may
be opposed to their standing on the bank of the water when they came to
it, commanded, [Jos 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#008.md), which was but
for a while, 'till the waters were divided and gone away; and then they
were to go farther, even into the midst of Jordan, where they are to
stand constantly and fixedly, as this Hebrew word signifies, until all
were passed over. The midst of Jordan - In the middle and deepest part
of the river.
