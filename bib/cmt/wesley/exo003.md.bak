### [Exodus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 3:1</span></span>

Now Moses - The years of Moses's life are remarkably divided into three
forties; the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the
second a shepherd in Midian, the third a king in Jeshurun. He had now
finished his second forty when he received his commission to bring
Israel out of Egypt. Sometimes it is long before God calls his servants
out to that work which of old he designed them for. Moses was born to be
Israel's deliverer, and yet not a word is said of it to him till he is
eighty years of age. Even to Horeb - Horeb and Sinai were two tops of
the same mountain.

[Exodus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 3:2</span></span>

And the angel of the Lord appeared to him - It was an extraordinary
manifestation of the divine glory; what was visible was produced by the
ministry of an angel, but he heard God in it speaking to him. In a flame
of fire - To shew that God was about to bring terror and destruction to
his enemies, light and heat to his people, and to display his glory
before all. And the bush burned, and yet was not consumed - An emblem of
the church now in bondage in Egypt, burning in the brick - kilns, yet
not consumed; cast down, but not destroyed.

[Exodus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 3:3</span></span>

I will turn aside and see - He speaks as one inquisitive, and bold in
his inquiry; whatever it was, he would if possible know the meaning of
it.

[Exodus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 3:4</span></span>

When the Lord saw that he turned aside to see it, God called to him - If
he had carelessly neglected it, it is likely God had departed and said
nothing to him. God called and said, Moses, Moses - This which he heard
could not but surprise him much more than what he saw. Divine calls are
then effectual, when the spirit of God makes them particular, and calls
us as by name. The Word calls, Ho, every one; the Spirit, by the
application of that, calls, Ho, such a one; I know thee by name. Here am
I - Not only to hear what is said, but to do what I am bidden.

[Exodus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 3:5</span></span>

Put off thy shoes from off thy feet - The putting off the shoe was then
what the putting off the hat is now, a token of respect and submission.
The ground is holy ground, made so by this special manifestation of the
divine presence. We ought to approach to God with a solemn pause and
preparation; and to express our inward reverence, by a grave and
reverent behaviour in the worship of God, carefully avoiding every thing
that looks light, or rude.

[Exodus 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 3:6</span></span>

I am the God of thy father - He lets him know it is God that speaks to
him, to engage his reverence, faith and obedience. Thy father, thy pious
father Amram, and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, thy ancestors.
Engaged to them by solemn covenant, which I am now come to perform. And
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God - The more we see
of God, the more cause we shall see to worship him with reverence and
godly fear. And even the manifestations of God's grace should increase
our humble reverence of him.

[Exodus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 3:8</span></span>

I am come down to deliver them - When God doth something very
extraordinary, he is said to come down to do it, as [Isa
64:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001.md). This deliverance was typical of
our redemption by Christ, and in that the eternal Word did indeed come
down from heaven to deliver us. A large land - So it was, according to
its true and ancient bounds, as they are described, [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md), and not according to those
narrow limits, to which they were afterwards confined for their unbelief
and impiety. A land flowing with milk and honey - A proverbial
expression, abounding with the choicest fruits, both for necessity and
delight.

[Exodus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 3:10</span></span>

I will send thee - And the same hand that now fetched a shepherd out of
a desert to be the planter of the Jewish church, afterwards fetched
fishermen from their ships to be the planters of the Christian church,
that the excellency of the power might be of God.

[Exodus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 3:11</span></span>

Who am I? - He thinks himself unworthy of the honour and unable for the
work. He thinks he wants courage, and therefore cannot go to Pharaoh: he
thinks he wants conduct, and therefore cannot bring forth the children
of Israel out of Egypt; they are unarmed, undisciplined, quite
dispirited, utterly unable to help themselves, Moses was incomparably
the fittest of any man living for this work, eminent for learning,
wisdom, experience, valour, faith, holiness, and yet Who am I? The more
fit any person is for service, commonly the less opinion he has of
himself.

[Exodus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 3:12</span></span>

Certainly I will be with thee - Those that are weak in themselves, yet
may do wonders being strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
God's presence puts wisdom and strength into the weak and foolish, and
is enough to answer all objections.

[Exodus 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 3:13</span></span>

When they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?
- What name shall I use, whereby thou mayest be distinguished from false
gods, and thy people may be encouraged to expect deliverance from thee?

[Exodus 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 3:14</span></span>

And God said - Two names God would now be known by. A name that speaks
what he is in himself, I am that I am - This explains his name Jehovah,
and signifies, 1st, That he is self - existent; he has his being of
himself, and has no dependence upon any other. And being self - existent
he cannot but be self - sufficient, and therefore all - sufficient, and
the inexhaustible fountain of being and bliss. 2dly, That he is eternal
and unchangeable, always the same, yesterday to - day, and for ever: he
will be what he will be, and what he is. 3dly. That he is faithful and
true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as in his
nature, and not a man that he should lie. Let Israel know this, I am
hath sent me unto you. A name that speaks what he is to his people. Lest
that name I am should puzzle them, he is farther directed to make use of
another name of God, more familiar.

[Exodus 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 3:15</span></span>

The Lord God of our fathers hath sent me unto you - Thus God made
himself known, that he might revive among them the religion of their
fathers, which was much decayed, and almost lost. And that he might
raise their expectations of the speedy performance of the promises made
unto their fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are particularly named,
because with Abraham the covenant was first made, and with Isaac and
Jacob oft expressly renewed, and these three were distinguished from
their brethren, and chosen to be the trustees of the covenant. This God
will have to be his name for ever, and it has been, is, and will be his
name, by which his worshippers know him, and distinguish him from all
false gods.

[Exodus 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 3:18</span></span>

Hath met with us - Hath appeared to us, declaring his will, that we
should do what follows.

[Exodus 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 3:19</span></span>

I am sure he will not let you go - God sends his messengers to those
whose obstinacy he foresees, that it may appear he would have them turn
and live.

[Exodus 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 3:22</span></span>

Everywoman shall ask (not borrow!) jewels. And I will give this people
favour in the sight of the Egyptians - God sometimes makes the enemies
of his people not only to be at peace with them, but to be kind to them.
And he has many ways of balancing accounts between the injured and the
injurious, of righting the oppressed, and compelling those that have
done wrong to make restitution.
