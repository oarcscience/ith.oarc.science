### [1 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

[1 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 1:1</span></span>

That which was - Here means, He which was the Word himself; afterwards
it means, that which they had heard from him. Which was - Namely, with
the Father, [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md), before he was
manifested. From the beginning - This phrase is sometimes used in a
limited sense; but here it properly means from eternity, being
equivalent with, "in the beginning," [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md). That which we - The apostles.
Have not only heard, but seen with our eyes, which we have beheld -
Attentively considered on various occasions. Of the Word of life - He is
termed the Word, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); the Life,
[Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); as he is the living Word of
God, who, with the Father and the Spirit, is the fountain of life to all
creatures, particularly of spiritual and eternal life.

[1 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 1:2</span></span>

For the life - The living Word. Was manifested - In the flesh, to our
very senses. And we testify and declare - We testify by declaring, by
preaching, and writing, [Jo1 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md).
Preaching lays the foundation, [Jo1
1:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md): writing builds there on. To
you - Who have not seen. The eternal life - Which always was, and
afterward appeared to us. This is mentioned in the beginning of the
epistle. In the end of it is mentioned the same eternal life, which we
shall always enjoy.

[1 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 1:3</span></span>

That which we have seen and heard - Of him and from him. Declare we to
you - For this end. That ye also may have fellowship with us - May enjoy
the same fellowship which we enjoy. And truly our fellowship - Whereby
he is in us and we in him. Is with the Father and with the son - Of the
Holy Ghost he speaks afterwards.

[1 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 1:4</span></span>

That your joy may be full - So our Lord also, [Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011.md); [Joh
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md). There is a joy of hope, a joy
of faith, and a joy of love. Here the joy of faith is directly intended.
It is a concise expression. Your joy - That is, your faith and the joy
arising from it: but it likewise implies the joy of hope and love.

[1 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 1:5</span></span>

And this is the sum of the message which we have heard of him - The Son
of God. That God is light - The light of wisdom, love, holiness, glory.
What light is to the natural eye, that God is to the spiritual eye. And
in him is no darkness at all - No contrary principle. He is pure,
unmixed light.

[1 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 1:6</span></span>

If we say - Either with our tongue, or in our heart, if we endeavour to
persuade either ourselves or others. We have fellowship with him, while
we walk, either inwardly or outwardly, in darkness - In sin of any kind.
We do not the truth - Our actions prove, that the truth is not in us.

[1 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 1:7</span></span>

But if we walk in the light - In all holiness. As God is (a deeper word
than walk, and more worthy of God) in the light, then we may truly say,
we have fellowship one with another - We who have seen, and you who have
not seen, do alike enjoy that fellowship with God. The imitation of God
being the only sure proof of our having fellowship with him. And the
blood of Jesus Christ his Son - With the grace purchased thereby.
Cleanseth us from all sin - Both original and actual, taking away all
the guilt and all the power.

[1 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 1:8</span></span>

If we say - Any child of man, before his blood has cleansed us. We have
no sin - To be cleansed from, instead of confessing our sins, [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md), the truth is not in us - Neither
in our mouth nor in our heart.

[1 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 1:9</span></span>

But if with a penitent and believing heart, we confess our sins, he is
faithful - Because he had promised this blessing, by the unanimous voice
of all his prophets. Just - Surely then he will punish: no; for this
very reason he will pardon. This may seem strange; but upon the
evangelical principle of atonement and redemption, it is undoubtedly
true; because, when the debt is paid, or the purchase made, it is the
part of equity to cancel the bond, and consign over the purchased
possession. Both to forgive us our sins - To take away all the guilt of
them. And to cleanse us from all unrighteousness - To purify our souls
from every kind and every degree of it.

[1 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 1:10</span></span>

Yet still we are to retain, even to our lives' end, a deep sense of our
past sins. Still if we say, we have not sinned, we make him a liar - Who
saith, all have sinned. And his word is not in us - We do not receive
it; we give it no place in our hearts.
