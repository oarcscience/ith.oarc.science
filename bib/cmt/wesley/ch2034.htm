<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003">2 Chronicles 34:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 34:3</A></FONT></span></p>Young - ln the sixteenth year of his age; when he was entering into the age of temptation, and had the administration of his kingdom wholly in his own power, and none to restrain him; even then he begins to be religious in good earnest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006">2 Chronicles 34:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">ch2 34:6</A></FONT></span></p>Naphtali - Which was in the utmost borders of the kingdom of Israel. For it must be remembered, that the ten tribes were now gone into captivity; and those who were come in their stead were weak and few, and not able to withstand the power of Josiah. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008">2 Chronicles 34:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 34:8</A></FONT></span></p>The house - The house of God, called the house by way of eminency. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#011">2 Chronicles 34:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">ch2 34:11</A></FONT></span></p>Houses - The chambers joining to the temple. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#012">2 Chronicles 34:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">ch2 34:12</A></FONT></span></p>Musick - All these here named, were skilful in instruments of musick. Which may be here mentioned, to intimate, that as they were skilful, so they were exercised in both employments, and did successively oversee the work, and praise God with their voices and instruments. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019">2 Chronicles 34:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">ch2 34:19</A></FONT></span></p>Rent his clothes - Were the things contained in scripture new to us, as they were here to Josiah, surely they would make deeper impressions upon us than they commonly do. But they are not the less weighty, and therefore should not be the less regarded, because they are well known. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#032">2 Chronicles 34:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">ch2 34:32</A></FONT></span></p>To stand to it - He caused them to engage by an oath or covenant, that they would observe the laws of God, as his predecessors had formerly done, and which indeed they were before obliged to do. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#033">2 Chronicles 34:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">ch2 34:33</A></FONT></span></p>Even to serve - The repetition shews, that this was the only thing his heart was set upon. He aimed at nothing in all he did, but to engage them to God and their duty.
