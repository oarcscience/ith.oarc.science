### [Genesis Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 49:1</span></span>

Gather yourselves together - Let them all be sent for to see their
father die, and to hear his dying words. "Twas a comfort to Jacob, now
he was dying, to see all his children about him tho' he had sometimes
thought himself bereaved: 'twas of use to them to attend him in his last
moments, that they might learn of him how to die, as well as how to
live; what he said to each, he said in the hearing of all the rest, for
we may profit by the reproofs, counsels and comforts that are
principally intended for others. That I may tell you that which shall
befal you, not your persons but your posterity, in the latter days - The
prediction of which would be of use to those that come after them, for
confirming their faith, and guiding their way, at their return to
Canaan. We cannot tell our children what shall befal them, or their
families, in this world; but we can tell them from the word of God, what
will befal them in the last day of all, according as they carry
themselves in this world.

[Genesis 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 49:2</span></span>

Hearken to Israel your father - Let Israel that has prevailed with God,
prevail with you.

[Genesis 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 49:3</span></span>

Reuben thou art my first - born - Jacob here puts upon him the ornaments
of the birth - right, that he and all his brethren might see what he had
forfeited and in that might see the evil of his sin. As the first - born
he was his father's joy, being the beginning of his strength. To him
belonged the excellency of dignity above his brethren, and some power
over them.

[Genesis 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 49:4</span></span>

Thou shalt not excel - A being thou shalt have as a tribe, but not an
excellency. No judge, prophet, or prince, are found of that tribe, nor
any person of renown only Dathan and Abiram, who were noted for their
impious rebellion. That tribe, as not aiming to excel, chose a
settlement on the other side Jordan. The character fastened upon Reuben,
for which he is laid under this mark of infamy, is, that he was unstable
as water. His virtue was unstable, he had not the government of himself,
and his own appetites. His honour consequently was unstable, it vanished
into smoke, and became as water spilt upon the ground. Jacob charges him
particularly with the sin for which he was disgraced, thou wentest up to
thy father's bed - It was forty years ago that he had been guilty of
this sin, yet now it is remembered against him. Reuben's sin left an
indelible mark of infamy upon his family; a wound not to be healed
without a scar.

[Genesis 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 49:5</span></span>

Simeon and Levi are brethren - Brethren in disposition, but unlike their
father: they were passionate and revengeful, fierce and wilful; their
swords, that should have been only weapons of defence, were (as the
margin reads it) weapons of violence, to do wrong to others, not to save
themselves from wrong.

[Genesis 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 49:6</span></span>

They slew a man - Shechem himself, and many others; and to effect that,
they digged down a wall, broke the houses to plunder them, and murder
the inhabitants. O my soul, come not thou into their secret - Hereby he
professeth not only his abhorrence of such practices in general, but his
innocency particularly in that matter. Perhaps he had been suspected as
under - hand aiding and abetting; he therefore solemnly expresseth his
detestation of the fact.

[Genesis 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 49:7</span></span>

Cursed be their anger - Not their persons. We ought always in the
expressions of our zeal carefully to distinguish between the sinner and
the sin, so as not to love or bless the sin for the sake of the person,
nor to hate or curse the person for the sake of the sin. I will divide
them - The Levites were scattered throughout all the tribes, and
Simeon's lot lay not together, and was so strait that many of that tribe
were forced to disperse themselves in quest of settlements and
subsistence. This curse was afterwards turned into a blessing to the
Levites; but the Simeonites, for Zimri's sin, [Num
25:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006.md), had it bound on.

[Genesis 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 49:8</span></span>

Judah's name signifies praise, in allusion to which he saith, Thou art
he whom thy brethren shall praise, God was praised for him, [Gen
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#035.md), praised by him, and praised in
him; and therefore his brethren shall praise him. Thy hand shall be in
the neck of thine enemies - This was fulfilled in David, [Psa
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040.md). Thy father's children shall bow
down before thee - Judah was the law - giver, [Psa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007.md). That tribe led the van through
the wilderness, and in the conquest of Canaan, [Jdg
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md). The prerogatives of the birth -
right which Reuben had forfeited, the excellency of dignity and power,
were thus conferred upon Judah. Thy brethren shall bow down before thee,
and yet shall praise thee, reckoning themselves happy in having so wise
and bold a commander.

[Genesis 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 49:9</span></span>

Judah is a lion's whelp - The lion is the king of beasts, the terror of
the forest when he roars; when he seizeth his prey, none can resist him;
when he goes up from the prey, none dares pursue him to revenge it. By
this it is foretold that the tribe of Judah should become very
formidable, and should not only obtain great victories but should
peaceably enjoy what was got by those victories. Judah is compared not
to a lion rampant, always raging but to a lion couching, enjoying the
satisfaction of his success, without creating vexation to others.

[Genesis 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 49:10</span></span>

The sceptre shall not depart from Judah till Shiloh come - Jacob here
foretels, (1.) That the sceptre should come into the tribe of Judah,
which was fulfilled in David, on whose family the crown was entailed.
(2.) That Shiloh should be of this tribe; that seed in whom the earth
should be blessed. That peaceable prosperous one, or, the Saviour, so
others translate it, shall come of Judah. (3.) That the sceptre should
continue in that tribe, till the coming of the Messiah, in whom as the
king of the church, and the great High - priest, it was fit that both
the priesthood and the royalty should determine. Till the captivity, all
along from David's time, the sceptre was in Judah, and from thence
governors of that tribe, or of the Levites that adhered to it, which was
equivalent; till Judea became a province of the Roman empire just at the
time of our Saviour's birth, and was at that time taxed as one of the
provinces, [Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md), and at the time
of his death the Jews expressly owned, We have no king but Caesar. Hence
it is undeniably inferred against the Jews, that our Lord Jesus is be
that should come, and we are to look for no other, for he came exactly
at the time appointed. (4.) That it should be a fruitful tribe,
especially that it should abound with milk and wine, [Gen
49:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011.md), vines so common, and so
strong, that they should tye their asses to them, and so fruitful, that
they should load their asses from them; wine as plentiful as water, so
that the men of that tribe should be very healthful and lively, their
eyes brisk and sparkling, their teeth white. Much of that which is here
said concerning Judah is to be applied to our Lord Jesus. He is the
ruler of all his Father's children, and the conqueror of all his
Father's enemies, and he it is that is the praise of all the saints. He
is the lion of the tribe of Judah, as he is called with reference to
this, [Rev 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md), who having spoiled
principalities and powers, went up a conqueror, and couched so as none
can stir him up when he sat down on the right hand of the Father. To him
belongs the sceptre, he is the lawgiver, and to him shall the gathering
of the people be, as the desire of all nations, [Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md), who being lifted up from the
earth should draw all men unto him, [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032.md), and in whom the children of God
that are scattered abroad should meet as the centre of their unity, [Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md). In him there is plenty of all
that which is nourishing and refreshing to the soul, and which maintains
and chears the divine life in it; in him we may have wine and milk, the
riches of Judah's tribe, without money, and without price, [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md).

[Genesis 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 49:13</span></span>

Zebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea - This was fulfilled, when 2
or 300 years after, the land of Canaan was divided by lot, and the
border of Zebulon went up towards the sea, [Jos
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011.md).

[Genesis 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 49:14</span></span>

Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens - The men of
that tribe shall be strong and industrious, fit for and inclined to
labour, particularly the toil of husbandry, like the ass that patiently
carries his burden. Issachar submitted to two burdens, tillage and
tribute.

[Genesis 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 49:16</span></span>

Dan shall judge his people - Though Dan was one of the sons of the
concubines, yet he shall be a tribe governed by judges of his own as
well as other tribes; and shall by art and policy, and surprise, gain
advantages against his enemies, like a serpent suddenly biting the heel
of the traveller.

[Genesis 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 49:18</span></span>

I have waited for thy salvation, Lord - If he must break off here, and
his breath will not serve him to finish what he intended, with these
words he pours out his soul into the bosom of his God, and even breaths
it out. The pious ejaculations of a warm and lively devotion, though
sometimes they maybe incoherent, yet they are not impertinent; that may
be uttered affectionately, which doth not come in methodically. It is no
absurdity, when we are speaking to men, to lift up our hearts to God.
The salvation he waited for was, 1st, Christ, the promised seed, whom he
had spoken of, [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md), now he was
going to be gathered to his people, he breathes after him to whom the
gathering of the people shall be. 2ndly, Heaven, the better country,
which he declared plainly that he sought, [Heb
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md), and continued seeking now he
was in Egypt.

[Genesis 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 49:19</span></span>

Concerning Gad, he alludes to his name, which signifies a troop,
foresees the character of that tribe, that it should be a warlike tribe;
and so we find, [Ch1 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008.md), the Gadites
were men of war fit for the battle. He foresees, that the situation of
that tribe on the other side Jordan would expose it to the incursions of
its neighbours, the Moabites and Ammonites; and that they might not be
proud of their strength and valour, he foretells that the troops of
their enemies should, in many skirmishes, overcome them; yet, that they
might not be discouraged by their defeats, he assures them, that they
should overcome at the last, which was fulfilled, when in Saul's time
and David's the Moabites and Ammonites were wholly subdued.

[Genesis 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 49:20</span></span>

Concerning Asher, he foretells, That it should be a rich tribe,
replenished not only with bread for necessity, but with fatness, with
dainties, royal dainties, and these exported out of Asher, to other
tribes, perhaps to other lands. The God of nature has provided for us
not only necessaries but dainties, that we might call him a bountiful
benefactor; yet, whereas all places are competently furnished with
necessaries, only some places afford dainties. Corn is more common than
spices. Were the supports of luxury as universal as the supports of
life, the world would be worse than it is, and that needs not.

[Genesis 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 49:21</span></span>

Naphtali is a hind let loose - Those of this tribe were, as the loosen'd
hind, zealous for their liberty, and yet affable and courteous, their
language refined, and they complaisant, giving goodly words. Among God's
Israel there is to be found a great variety of dispositions, yet all
contributing to the beauty and strength of the body. He closes with the
blessings of his best beloved sons, Joseph and Benjamin, with these he
will breathe his last.

[Genesis 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 49:22</span></span>

Joseph is a fruitful bough, or young tree, for God had made him fruitful
in the land of his affliction, as branches of a vine, or other spreading
plant, running over the wall.

[Genesis 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 49:23</span></span>

The archer have sorely grieved him - Tho' he now lived at ease and in
honour, Jacob minds him of the difficulties he had formerly waded
through. He had many enemies here called archers, being skilful to do
mischief; they hated him, they shot their poisonous darts at him. His
brethren were spiteful towards him, mocked him, stripped him, sold him,
thought they had been the death of him. His mistress sorely grieved him,
and shot at him, when she solicited his chastity; and then shot at him
by her false accusations.

[Genesis 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 49:24</span></span>

But his bow abode in strength - His faith did not fail; he kept his
ground, and came off conqueror. The arms of his hands were made strong -
That is, his other graces did their part, his wisdom, courage, patience,
which are better than weapons of war: By the hands of the mighty God -
Who was therefore able to strengthen him; and the God of Jacob, a God in
covenant with him. From thence, from this strange method of Providence,
he became the shepherd and stone, the feeder and supporter of Israel,
Jacob and his family. Herein Joseph was a type of Christ: He was shot at
and hated, but borne up under his sufferings, and was afterwards
advanced to be the shepherd and stone: and of the church in general,
hell shoots its arrows against her, but heaven protects and strengthens
her.

[Genesis 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 49:25</span></span>

Even by the God of thy father Jacob, who shall help thee - Our
experiences of God's power and goodness in strengthning us hitherto, are
encouragements still to hope for help from him. He that has helped us,
will. And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee; and he only blesseth
indeed. Observe the blessings conferred on Joseph; First, Various and
abundant blessings. Blessings of heaven above, rain in its season, and
fair weather in its season; blessings of the deep that lies under this
earth, or with subterraneous mines and springs. Blessings of the womb
and the breasts are given when children are safely born and comfortably
nursed. Secondly, Eminent and transcendent blessings, which prevail
above the blessings of my progenitors - His father Isaac had but one
blessing, and when he had given that to Jacob, he was at a loss for a
blessing to bestow upon Esau; but Jacob had a blessing for each of his
twelve sons, and now at the latter end, a copious one for Joseph.
Thirdly, Durable and extensive blessings: unto the utmost bound of the
everlasting hills - Including all the products of the most fruitful
hills, and lasting as long as they last. Of these blessings it is here
said they shall be, so it is a promise; or, let them be, so it is a
prayer, on the head of Joseph, to which let them be as a crown to adorn
it, and a helmet to protect it.

[Genesis 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 49:27</span></span>

Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf - It is plain, Jacob was guided in what
he said by a spirit of prophecy, and not by natural affection, else he
would have spoken with more tenderness of his beloved son Benjamin,
concerning whom he only foretells, that his posterity should be a
warlike tribe, strong and daring, and that they should enrich themselves
with the spoil of their enemies, that they should be active in the
world, and a tribe as much feared by their neighbours as any other; in
the morning he shall devour the prey which he seized and divided over
night.

[Genesis 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 49:29</span></span>

I am to be gathered unto my people - Though death separate us from our
children, and our people in this world, it gathers us to our fathers,
and to our people in the other world. Perhaps Jacob useth this
expression concerning death, as a reason why his sons should bury him in
Canaan, for (saith he) I am to be gathered unto my people, my soul must
be gone to the spirits of just men made perfect, and therefore bury me
with my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and their wives.

[Genesis 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 49:33</span></span>

And when Jacob had made an end of commanding of his sons - He addressed
himself to his dying work. He put himself into a posture for dying;
having sat upon the bed - side to bless his sons, the spirit of prophecy
bringing fresh oil to his expiring lamp, when that work was done, he
gathered up his feet into the bed, that he might lie along, not only as
one patiently submitting to the stroke, but as one chearfully composing
himself to rest. He then freely resigned his spirits into the hand of
God, the father of spirit; he yielded up the ghost; and his separated
soul went to the assembly of the souls of the faithful, who after they
are delivered from the burden of the flesh are in joy and felicity; he
was gathered to his people.
