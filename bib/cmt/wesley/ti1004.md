### [1 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 4:1</span></span>

But the Spirit saith - By St. Paul himself to the Thessalonians, and
probably by other contemporary prophets. Expressly - As concerning a
thing of great moment, and soon to be fulfilled. That in the latter
times - These extend from our Lord's ascension till his coming to
judgment. Some - Yea, many, and by degrees the far greater part. Will
depart from the faith - The doctrine once delivered to the saints.
Giving heed to seducing spirits - Who inspire false prophets.

[1 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 4:2</span></span>

These will depart from the faith, by the hypocrisy of them that speak
lies, having their own consciences as senseless and unfeeling as flesh
that is seared with an hot iron.

[1 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 4:3</span></span>

Forbidding priests, monks, and nuns to marry, and commanding all men to
abstain from such and such meats at such and such times. Which God hath
created to be received by them that know the truth - That all meats are
now clean. With thanksgiving - Which supposes a pure conscience.

[1 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 4:5</span></span>

It is sanctified by the word of God - Creating all, and giving it to man
for food. And by prayer - The children of God are to pray for the
sanctification of all the creatures which they use. And not only the
Christians, but even the Jews, yea, the very heathens used to consecrate
their table by prayer.

[1 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 4:7</span></span>

Like those who were to contend in the Grecian games, exercise thyself
unto godliness - Train thyself up in holiness of heart and life, with
the utmost labour, vigour, and diligence.

[1 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 4:8</span></span>

Bodily exercise profiteth a little - Increases the health and strength
of the body.

[1 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 4:10</span></span>

Therefore - Animated by this promise. We both labour and suffer reproach
- We regard neither pleasure, ease, nor honour. Because we trust - For
this very thing the world will hate us. In the living God - Who will
give us the life he has promised. Who is the Saviour of all men -
Preserving them in this life, and willing to save them eternally. But
especially - In a more eminent manner. Of them that believe - And so are
saved everlastingly.

[1 Timothy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 4:12</span></span>

Let no one have reason to despise thee for thy youth. To prevent this,
Be a pattern in word - Public and private. In spirit - In your whole
temper. In faith - When this is placed in the midst of several other
Christian graces, it generally means a particular branch of it; fidelity
or faithfulness.

[1 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 4:13</span></span>

Give thyself to reading - Both publicly and privately. Enthusiasts,
observe this! Expect no end without the means.

[1 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 4:14</span></span>

Neglect not - They neglect it who do not exercise it to the full. The
gift - Of feeding the flock, of power, and love, and sobriety. Which was
given thee by prophecy - By immediate direction from God. By the laying
on of my hands - [Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md); while the
elders joined also in the solemnity. This presbytery probably consisted
of some others, together with Paul and Silas.

[1 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 4:15</span></span>

Meditate - The Bible makes no distinction between this and to
contemplate, whatever others do. True meditation is no other than faith,
hope, love, joy, melted down together, as it were, by the fire of God's
Holy Spirit; and offered up to God in secret. He that is wholly in
these, will be little in worldly company, in other studies, in
collecting books, medals, or butterflies: wherein many pastors drone
away so considerable a part of their lives.

[1 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 4:16</span></span>

Continue in them - In all the preceding advices.
