### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 136:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 136:2</span></span>

The God of gods - Who is infinitely superior to all that are called
gods, whether angels, or princes, or idols.

[Psalms 136:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 136:22</span></span>

Israel - He speaks of all that people as of one man, because they were
united together in one body in the worship of God.

[Psalms 136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 136:25</span></span>

Food - To all living creatures. For which God deserves great praises,
which the psalmist teaches us to render to God for them, because those
who are most concerned, either cannot, or do not perform this duty.
