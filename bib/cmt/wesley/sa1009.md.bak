### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 9:2</span></span>

Goodly - Comely and personable. Higher - A tall stature was much valued
in a king in ancient times, and in the eastern countries.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 9:3</span></span>

The asses - Which were there of great price, because of the scarcity of
horses, and therefore not held unworthy of Saul's seeking, at least in
those ancient times, when simplicity, humility, and industry were in
fashion among persons of quality.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 9:6</span></span>

Honourable men - One of great reputation for his skill and faithfulness.
Acquaintance with God and serviceableness to the kingdom of God, makes
men truly honourable. The way - The course we should take to find the
asses. He saith, peradventure, because he doubted whether so great a
prophet would seek, or God would grant him a revelation concerning such
mean matters: although sometimes God was pleased herein to condescend to
his people, to cut off all pretence or occasion of seeking to heathenish
divination.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 9:7</span></span>

A present - Presents were then made to the prophets, either as a
testimony of respect: or, as a grateful acknowledgement: or, for the
support of the Prophets themselves: or, of the sons of the prophets: or,
of other persons in want, known to them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 9:9</span></span>

Seer - Because he discerned and could discover things secret and unknown
to others. And these are the words, either of some later sacred writer,
who after Samuel's death, inserted this verse. Or, of Samuel, who, being
probably fifty or sixty years old at the writing of this book, and
speaking of the state of things in his first days, might well call it
before time.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 9:12</span></span>

Came to - day to the city - He had been travelling abroad, and was now
returned to his own house in Ramah. High place - Upon the hill mentioned
[Sa1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#011.md), and near the altar which
Samuel built for this use.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 9:13</span></span>

Find him - At home and at leisure. To eat - The relicks of the
sacrifices. Doth bless - The blessing of this sacrifice seems to have
consisted both of thanksgiving, this being a thank - offering, and of
prayer to God for its acceptance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 9:15</span></span>

His ear - That is, secretly, perhaps by a still small voice.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 9:16</span></span>

Philistines - For though they were now most pressed with the Ammonites,
yet they looked upon these as a land - flood, soon up, and soon down
again: but the Philistines, their constant and nearest enemies, they
most dreaded. And from these did Saul in some measure save them, and
would have saved them much more, if his and the people's sins had not
hindered.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 9:20</span></span>

On whom - Who is he that shall be that, which all Israel desire to have,
namely, a king. Father's house - That honour is designed for thee, and,
after thy death, for thy family or posterity, is by thy sin thou dost
not cut off the entail.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 9:21</span></span>

The smallest - For so indeed this was, having been all cut off except
six hundred, [Jdg 20:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046.md), which blow
they never recovered, and therefore they were scarce reckoned as an
entire tribe, but only as a remnant of a tribe; and being ingrafted into
Judah, in the division between the ten tribes and the two, they in some
sort lost their name, and together with Judah were accounted but one
tribe.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 9:22</span></span>

Chief place - Thereby to raise their expectation, and to prepare them
for giving that honour to Saul, which his approaching dignity required.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 9:24</span></span>

I said - When I first spake that I had invited the people to join with
me in my sacrifice, and then to partake with me of the feast, I then
bade the cook reserve this part for thy use.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 9:25</span></span>

Communed - Concerning the kingdom designed for him by God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 9:27</span></span>

Pass on - That thou and I may speak privately of the matter or the
kingdom. Which Samuel hitherto endeavoured to conceal, lest he should be
thought now to impose a king upon them, as before he denied one to them;
and that it might appear by the lot mentioned in the next chapter, that
the kingdom was given to Saul by God's destination, and not by Samuel's
contrivance. Word of God - That is, a message delivered to me from God,
which now I shall impart to thee.
