Learn not - The Jews being to live among the Chaldeans in their
captivity, where many of them were already, the prophet admonishes them
against the Chaldean idolatries, who were all much addicted to
astrology. The signs - This was so common among them, that Judicial
astrologers, of what nation soever, were generally termed Chaldeans. The
Heathen - Leave this to Heathens; it doth not become God's people.

noted port, it is usually put for the ocean, and may signify any place
beyond the sea. Uphaz - Probably the best gold came from thence as the
best silver from Tarshish.

stocks and stones, Jehovah is the only living God, having life in
himself, and giving life to all things else. An everlasting king - Time
devours them all, but the true God is everlasting.

wisdom in his creating and fixing the stated order of things, so here he
farther sets it forth in his providential ordering and disposing of
them.

Portion - God, who vouchsafes to be the portion of his people. The
former - Idols are things framed or formed, but God is the former of all

[Jeremiah 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 10:18</span></span>

Sing out - It denotes with how much violence and ease the Chaldeans
shall hurry away the people into Babylon. And therefore it is said at
this once, I will make one thorough quick work of it. May find it so -
Though they would never believe it, yet they shall actually find the
truth of my threatenings.

[Jeremiah 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#019.md)

them as thou pleasest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 10:24</span></span>

Correct me - Seeing thou wilt punish us, let it be a correction only,
not a destruction. Let it be in measure; in the midst of judgment
remember mercy. Anger - Lest if thou shouldst let out thy fury upon me,
thou wouldst utterly consume me.

[Jeremiah 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 10:25</span></span>

The Heathen - Such as do not acknowledge thee for their God. Call not -
One part of worship put for the whole. If thou wilt pour out thy fury,
let the effects of it be to thine enemies, not unto thine own people.
