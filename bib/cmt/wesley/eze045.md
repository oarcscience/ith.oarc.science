### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 45:2</span></span>

Of this - Whole portion of twenty five thousand cubits long, or twelve
miles and half, and ten thousand broad, or five miles and a little more.
For the sanctuary - For a platform for the sanctuary, both house and
court.

[Ezekiel 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 45:3</span></span>

And in it - In the center of this.

[Ezekiel 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 45:6</span></span>

The possession - Land to be a possession to the citizens of Jerusalem,
and to be the content of the city. Broad - About two miles and half
broad, and twelve miles and half long. Long - This must run along
parallel in length with the holy portion, though but half its breadth.
For the whole house - As the capital city, to which the tribe's resort,
it must be large enough to entertain them.

[Ezekiel 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 45:7</span></span>

The prince - The king. Our side - One half of the prince's portion lay
on the west side of those three already set out. The other side - The
other half lay on the east - side thereof, so the portion of the city,
Levites and priests, lay in the middle. The holy portion - Of priests,
and Levites, and sanctuary. Before - It lay parallel as broad as these
three were broad, and so run on both sides in its breadth from north to
south, and had its length as the other, from east to west. Over against
- What is called now over - against, or by the side, is called before
three times together. So now you have an exact square of twenty - five
thousand cubits laid out for God, the Levites and city, which appears
thus in the breadth.

10000 For the priests.

10000 For the Levites.

5000 For the city.
