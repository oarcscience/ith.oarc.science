### [Genesis Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 39:1</span></span>

The Jews have a proverb, If the world did but know the worth of good
men, they would hedge them about with pearls. Joseph was sold to an
officer of Pharaoh, with whom he might get acquainted with public
persons, and public business, and so be fitted for the preferment he was
afterwards designed for. What God intends men for, he will be sure, some
way or other, to qualify them for.

[Genesis 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 39:2</span></span>

Those that can separate us from all our friends, cannot deprive us of
the gracious presence of our God. When Joseph had none of his relations
with him, he had his God with him, even in the house of the Egyptian:
Joseph was banished from his father's house, but the Lord was with him.
It is God's presence with us that makes all we do prosperous. Those that
would prosper, must therefore make God their friend; and those that do
prosper, must therefore give God the praise.

[Genesis 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 39:6</span></span>

He knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat - The servant
had all the care and trouble of the estate, the master had only the
enjoyment of it; an example not to be imitated by any master, unless he
could be sure that he had one like Joseph for a servant.

[Genesis 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 39:9</span></span>

How can I sin against God - Not only how shall I do it and sin against
my master, my mistress, myself, my own body and soul, but against God? -
Gracious souls look upon this as the worst thing in sin, that it is
against God, against his nature and his dominion, against his love and
his design. They that love God, for this reason hate sin.

[Genesis 39:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 39:10</span></span>

He hearkened not to her, so much as to be with her. Those that would be
kept from harm, must keep themselves out of harm's way.

[Genesis 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 39:12</span></span>

When she laid hold on him, he left his garment in her hand - He would
not stay to parley with the temptation, but flew out from it with the
utmost abhorrence, he left his garment as one escaping for his life.

[Genesis 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 39:20</span></span>

Where the king's prisoners were bound - Potiphar, it is likely, chose
that prison because it was the worst; for there the irons entered into
the soul, [Psa 105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018.md), but God
designed it to pave the way to his enlargement. Our Lord Jesus, like
Joseph was bound, and numbered with the transgressors.

[Genesis 39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 39:21</span></span>

But the Lord was with Joseph and shewed him mercy. God despiseth not his
prisoners, [Psa 69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md). No gates nor
bars can shut out his gracious presence from his people. God gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison - God can raise up
friends for his people even where they little expect them. The keeper
saw that God was with him, and that every thing prospered under his
hand, and therefore intrusted him with the management of the affairs of
the prison.
