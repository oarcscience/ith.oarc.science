### [Matthew Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 7:1</span></span>

Judge not - any man without full, clear, certain knowledge, without
absolute necessity, without tender love. [Luk
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md).

[Matthew 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 7:2</span></span>

With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you - Awful words! So
we may, as it were, choose for ourselves, whether God shall be severe or
merciful to us. God and man will favour the candid and benevolent: but
they must expect judgment without mercy, who have showed no mercy.

[Matthew 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 7:3</span></span>

In particular, why do you open your eyes to any fault of your brother,
while you yourself are guilty of a much greater? The mote - The word
properly signifies a splinter or shiver of wood. This and a beam, its
opposite, were proverbially used by the Jews, to denote, the one, small
infirmities, the other, gross, palpable faults. [Luk
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#041.md).

[Matthew 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 7:4</span></span>

How sayest thou - With what face?

[Matthew 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 7:5</span></span>

Thou hypocrite - It is mere hypocrisy to pretend zeal for the amendment
of others while we have none for our own. Then - When that which
obstructed thy sight is removed.

[Matthew 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 7:6</span></span>

Here is another instance of that transposition, where of the two things
proposed, the latter is first treated of. Give not - to dogs - lest
turning they rend you: Cast not - to swine - lest they trample them
under foot. Yet even then, when the beam is cast out of thine own eye,
Give not - That is, talk not of the deep things of God to those whom you
know to be wallowing in sin. neither declare the great things God hath
done for your soul to the profane, furious, persecuting wretches. Talk
not of perfection, for instance, to the former; not of your experience
to the latter. But our Lord does in nowise forbid us to reprove, as
occasion is, both the one and the other.

[Matthew 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 7:7</span></span>

But ask - Pray for them, as well as for yourselves: in this there can be
no such danger. Seek - Add your own diligent endeavours to your asking:
and knock - Persevere importunately in that diligence. [Luk
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md).

[Matthew 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 7:8</span></span>

For every one that asketh receiveth - Provided he ask aright, and ask
what is agreeable to God's will.

[Matthew 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 7:11</span></span>

To them that ask him - But on this condition, that ye follow the example
of his goodness, by doing to all as ye would they should do to you. For
this is the law and the prophets - This is the sum of all, exactly
answering [Mat 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md). The whole is
comprised in one word, Imitate the God of love. Thus far proceeds the
doctrinal part of the sermon. In the next verse begins the exhortation
to practise it.

[Matthew 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 7:12</span></span>

[Luk 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#031.md).

[Matthew 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 7:13</span></span>

The strait gate - The holiness described in the foregoing chapters. And
this is the narrow way. Wide is the gate, and many there are that go in
through it - They need not seek for this; they come to it of course.
Many go in through it, because strait is the other gate - Therefore they
do not care for it; they like a wider gate. [Luk
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024.md).

[Matthew 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 7:15</span></span>

Beware of false prophets - Who in their preaching describe a broad way
to heaven: it is their prophesying, their teaching the broad way, rather
than their walking in it themselves, that is here chiefly spoken of. All
those are false prophets, who teach any other way than that our Lord
hath here marked out. In sheep's clothing - With outside religion and
fair professions of love: Wolves - Not feeding, but destroying souls.

[Matthew 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 7:16</span></span>

By their fruits ye shall know them - A short, plain, easy rule, whereby
to know true from false prophets: and one that may be applied by people
of the weakest capacity, who are not accustomed to deep reasoning. True
prophets convert sinners to God, or at least confirm and strengthen
those that are converted. False prophets do not. They also are false
prophets, who though speaking the very truth, yet are not sent by the
Spirit of God, but come in their own name, to declare it: their grand
mark is, "Not turning men from the power of Satan to God." [Luk
6:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043.md).

[Matthew 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 7:18</span></span>

A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree good
fruit - But it is certain, the goodness or badness here mentioned
respects the doctrine, rather than the personal character. For a bad man
preaching the good doctrine here delivered, is sometimes an instrument
of converting sinners to God. Yet I do not aver, that all are true
prophets who speak the truth, and thereby convert sinners. I only
affirm, that none are such who do not.

[Matthew 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 7:19</span></span>

Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into
the fire - How dreadful then is the condition of that teacher who hath
brought no sinners to God!

[Matthew 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 7:21</span></span>

Not every one - That is, no one that saith, Lord, Lord - That makes a
mere profession of me and my religion, shall enter - Whatever their
false teachers may assure them to the contrary: He that doth the will of
my Father - as I have now declared it. Observe: every thing short of
this is only saying, Lord, Lord. [Luk
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#046.md).

[Matthew 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 7:22</span></span>

We have prophesied - We have declared the mysteries of thy kingdom,
wrote books; preached excellent sermons: In thy name done many wonderful
works - So that even the working of miracles is no proof that a man has
saving faith.

[Matthew 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 7:23</span></span>

I never knew you - There never was a time that I approved of you: so
that as many souls as they had saved, they were themselves never saved
from their sins. Lord, is it my case? [Luk
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#027.md).

[Matthew 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 7:24</span></span>

[Luk 6:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#047.md).

[Matthew 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 7:29</span></span>

He taught them - The multitudes, as one having authority - With a
dignity and majesty peculiar to himself as the great Lawgiver, and with
the demonstration and power of the Spirit: and not as the scribes - Who
only expounded the law of another; and that in a lifeless, ineffectual
manner.
