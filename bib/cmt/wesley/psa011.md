------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)

[Psalms 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 11:1</span></span>

Ye - Mine enemies.

[Psalms 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 11:2</span></span>

For lo - David having directed his speech to his enemies, now turns it
to God, and pours out before him his complaints. Ready - They lay
designs for my destruction and make all things ready to execute them.

[Psalms 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 11:3</span></span>

Foundations - Piety, justice, fidelity, and mercy, which are the pillars
or foundations of a state or kingdom. What - The condition of all
righteous men will be desperate.

[Psalms 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 11:4</span></span>

Temple - In heaven; which is mentioned as an evidence of his glorious
majesty, of his sovereign power and dominion over all men and things,
and of his accurate inspection into all men and their actions. Throne -
Where he sits to examine all causes, and to give righteous sentence
according to every man's works. Try - He throughly discerns all men,
their most inward and secret actions: and therefore he sees and will
reward my innocency, notwithstanding all the calumnies of mine enemies;
and withal he sees all their secret designs, and will discover and
defeat them.

[Psalms 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 11:5</span></span>

Trieth - He chastens even righteous persons, yet still he loves them,
and therefore will in due time deliver them. But as for the wicked, God
hates them, and will severely punish them.

[Psalms 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 11:6</span></span>

Rain - Send them plentifully, swiftly, and suddenly, as rain commonly
falls from heaven. Snares - Grievous plagues or judgments, which are
called snares, because wicked men are often surprized with them when
they least expect them. And because they cannot escape them, or get out
of them; but are held fast and destroyed by them. Horrible tempests -
Dreadful judgments so called, in allusion to the destruction of Sodom by
these means. But this he seems to speak not so much of present
calamities, as of eternal punishments. This - Is their portion, and as
it were the meat and drink appointed them by God.
