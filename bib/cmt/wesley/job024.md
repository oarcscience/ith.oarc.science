and seasons, are exactly known to God) do they that know him, (who love
and obey him) not see (whence is it that they cannot discern) his (that
is, God's) days? His times and seasons which he takes for the punishment
of ungodly men; which if they were constant and fixed in this life, they
would not be unknown to good men, to whom God uses to reveal his
secrets.
