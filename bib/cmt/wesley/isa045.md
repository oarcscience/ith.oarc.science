I have - I knew, and called thee by thy name, when thou didst neither
know nor think of me; nay, when thou hadst no being.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 45:6</span></span>

That - That all nations may know it by my foretelling these things so
long before, and by the wonderful success that I shall give thee, and by
my over - ruling thine heart and counsels, to the deliverance of my
people.

Drop - The righteous and gracious acts of God for his people, shall be

Open itself to bring forth those fruits which may be expected from such
showers. Them - The heavens and the earth conspiring together. Together
- Together with salvation. It - This great work of salvation and
righteousness; whereof, tho' Cyrus is the instrument, I am the author.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 45:9</span></span>

Woe - As God here makes many glorious promises to Cyrus, so he
pronounces a curse upon them, who should endeavour to hinder him.
Contend - Contend, if you please, with your fellow creatures, but not
with your creator. Or - He turns his speech to the potter.

[Isaiah 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 45:11</span></span>

of disposing of my own children and works, as I see fit?

The labour - The wealth gotten by their labour. Thee - Jerusalem shall
not only be rebuilt, but the wealth and glory of other countries shall
be brought to it again. This was in part verified in Jerusalem; but it
was much more fully accomplished in the church of the gospel, in the
accession of the Gentiles to that church which began in Jerusalem, and
from thence spread itself into all the parts of the world. Come over -
They shall be taken captive by thee, and willingly submit themselves to
thee.

[Isaiah 45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015.md)

Verily - These are the words of the prophet, on contemplation of the
various dispensations of God towards his church, and in the world.
Hidest - Thy counsels are deep and incomprehensible, thy ways are past
finding out.

[Isaiah 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 45:19</span></span>

In secret - The Heathen idols deliver oracles in obscure cells and
caverns: but I have delivered my oracles to Israel publickly and
plainly. In vain - Serve and worship me for nought. As I appointed them
work, so from time to time I have given them abundant recompence. Right
- I require nothing of my people which is not highly just and good.

[Isaiah 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 45:20</span></span>

nations - The remnant of the Gentiles, who survive the many
destructions, which I am bringing upon the Heathen nations.

[Isaiah 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md)

work, Babylon's destruction, and the redemption of God's people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 45:23</span></span>

In righteousness - It is what I will faithfully perform. Return -
Without effect. It is a metaphor from ambassadors, who sometimes return
to their princes without any success in their business. Every tongue -
Not only the Jews, but all nations.

[Isaiah 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md)

Jehovah as well as man. Righteousness - To justify me from all things
which I could not be justified by the law of Moses. Strength - Support
and assistance to bear all my burdens, overcome all my enemies, and
perform all my duties. Men - The Gentiles shall come to Christ. Ashamed
- But all his implacable enemies shall be brought to shame.
