### [Colossians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)

[Colossians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">col 2:1</span></span>

How great a conflict - Of care, desire, prayer. As many as have not seen
my face - Therefore, in writing to the Colossians, he refrains from
those familiar appellations, "Brethren," "Beloved."

[Colossians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">col 2:2</span></span>

Unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the
acknowledgment of the mystery of God - That is, unto the fullest and
clearest understanding and knowledge of the gospel.

[Colossians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">col 2:6</span></span>

So walk in him - In the same faith, love, holiness.

[Colossians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">col 2:7</span></span>

Rooted in him - As the vine. Built - On the sure foundation.

[Colossians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">col 2:8</span></span>

Through philosophy and empty deceit - That is, through the empty deceit
of philosophy blended with Christianity. This the apostle condemns,
Because it was empty and deceitful, promising happiness, but giving
none. Because it was grounded, not on solid reason, but the traditions
of men, Zeno, Epicurus, and the rest. And, Because it was so shallow and
superficial, not advancing beyond the knowledge of sensible things; no,
not beyond the first rudiments of them.

[Colossians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">col 2:9</span></span>

For in him dwelleth - Inhabiteth, continually abideth, all the fulness
of the Godhead. Believers are "filled with all the fulness of God," [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019.md). But in Christ dwelleth all the
fulness of the Godhead; the most full Godhead; not only divine powers,
but divine nature, [Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md). Bodily -
Personally, really, substantially. The very substance of God, if one
might so speak, dwells in Christ in the most full sense.

[Colossians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">col 2:10</span></span>

And ye - Who believe. Are filled with him - [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md). Christ is filled with God, and
ye are filled with Christ. And ye are filled by him. The fulness of
Christ overflows his church, [Psa
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md). He is originally full. We are
filled by him with wisdom and holiness. Who is the head of all
principality and power - Of angels as well as men Not from angels
therefore, but from their head, are we to ask whatever we stand in need
of.

[Colossians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">col 2:11</span></span>

By whom also ye have been circumcised - Ye have received the spiritual
blessings typified of old by circumcision. With a circumcision not
performed with hands - By an inward, spiritual operation. In putting
off, not a little skin, but the whole body of the sins of the flesh -
All the sins of your evil nature. By the circumcision of Christ - By
that spiritual circumcision which Christ works in your heart.

[Colossians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">col 2:12</span></span>

Which he wrought in you, when ye were as it were buried with him in
baptism - The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly
alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or
pouring of water is, [Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md). But
no stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of
performing it, in one or the other; but only on our being risen with
Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul; which we
cannot but know assuredly, if it really is so: and if we do not
experience this, our baptism has not answered the end of its
institution. By which ye are also risen with him - From the death of sin
to the life of holiness. It does not appear, that in all this St. Paul
speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether.

[Colossians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">col 2:13</span></span>

And you who were dead - Doubly dead to God, not only wallowing in
trespasses, outward sins, but also in the uncircumcision of your flesh -
A beautiful expression for original sin, the inbred corruption of your
nature, your uncircumcised heart and affections. Hath he - God the
Father. Quickened together with him - Making you partakers of the power
of his resurrection. It is evident the apostle thus far speaks, not of
justification, but of sanctification only.

[Colossians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">col 2:14</span></span>

Having blotted out - in consequence of his gracious decrees, that Christ
should come into the world to save sinners, and that whosoever believeth
on him should have everlasting life. The handwriting against us - Where
a debt is contracted, it is usually testified by some handwriting; and
when the debt is forgiven, the handwriting is destroyed, either by
blotting it out, by taking it away, or by tearing it. The apostle
expresses in all these three ways, God's destroying the handwriting
which was contrary to us, or at enmity with us. This was not properly
our sins themselves, (they were the debt,) but their guilt and cry
before God.

[Colossians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">col 2:15</span></span>

And having spoiled the principalities and powers - The evil angels, of
their usurped dominion. He - God the Father. Exposed them openly -
Before all the hosts of hell and heaven. Triumphing over them in or by
him - By Christ. Thus the paragraph begins with Christ, goes on with
him, and ends with him.

[Colossians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">col 2:16</span></span>

Therefore - Seeing these things are so. Let none judge you - That is,
regard none who judge you. In meat or drink - For not observing the
ceremonial law in these or any other particulars. Or in respect of a
yearly feast, the new moon, or the weekly Jewish sabbaths.

[Colossians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">col 2:17</span></span>

Which are but a lifeless shadow; but the body, the substance, is of
Christ.

[Colossians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">col 2:18</span></span>

Out of pretended humility, they worshipped angels, as not daring to
apply immediately to God. Yet this really sprung from their being puffed
up: (the constant forerunner of a fall, [Pro
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018).md) so far was it from being an
instance of true humility.

[Colossians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">col 2:19</span></span>

And not holding the head - He does not hold Christ, who does not trust
in him alone. All the members are nourished by faith, and knit together
by love and mutual sympathy.

[Colossians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">col 2:20</span></span>

Therefore - The inference begun, [Col
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md); is continued. A new inference
follows, [Col 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md). If ye are dead with
Christ from the rudiments of the world - That is, If ye are dead with
Christ, and so freed from them, why receive ye ordinances - Which Christ
hath not enjoined, from which he hath made you free.

[Colossians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">col 2:21</span></span>

Touch not - An unclean thing. Taste not - Any forbidden meat. Handle not
- Any consecrated vessel.

[Colossians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">col 2:22</span></span>

Perish in the using - Have no farther use, no influence on the mind.

[Colossians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">col 2:23</span></span>

Not sparing the body - Denying it many gratifications, and putting it to
many inconveniences. Yet they are not of any real value before God, nor
do they, upon the whole, mortify, but satisfy, the flesh. They indulge
our corrupt nature, our self - will, pride, and desire of being
distinguished from others.
