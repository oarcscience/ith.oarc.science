<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

See - As thou hast heard all these things, from time to time, seriously

wholly unknown to thee, concerning thy deliverance out of Babylon by
Cyrus.

Created - Revealed to thee by me; brought to light, as things are by
creation. Not - Heb. not from thence, not from these ancient times when
other things were revealed to thee. Or - Heb. and (or, or, as this
particle is frequently used) before this day. This day answers to now in
the first clause: and seems to be added as an exposition of it. Before
this time in which God hath revealed them to thee by my ministry. I knew
- Either by thine own sagacity: or by the help of thine idols.

Yea - The same thing is repeated, because this was so illustrious a

didst not hear, I did not reveal these things unto thee: for so this
phrase of opening the ear is understood, [Sa1

cautions were necessary to cure thine infidelity. Called - Justly, thou
wast indeed such.

name, that I may be praised for my power, faithfulness, and goodness.

furnace. Silver - Which is kept in the furnace so long 'till all the
dross be purged away, I will not deal so rigorously with thee; for then

this people a second time.

nature and properties, to idols, as they would do if I did not rescue my
people out of their hands in spite of their idols.

from the beginning of my taking you to be my people, and of revealing my
mind unto you. From the time - From the time that I first spoke of it, I
am or was there, to effect what I had foretold. The Lord - God by his
Spirit. Me - The prophet Isaiah; who was a type of Christ, and so this
may have a respect to him also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 48:17</span></span>

not enjoy the benefit of this mercy.
