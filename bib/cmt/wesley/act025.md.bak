### [Acts Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#001.md)

[Acts 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 25:2</span></span>

Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews appeared against Paul -
In so long a time their rage was not cooled. So much louder a call had
Paul to the Gentiles.

[Acts 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 25:4</span></span>

But Festus answered - So Festus's care to preserve the imperial
privileges was the means of preserving Paul's life. By what invisible
springs does God govern the world! With what silence, and yet with what
wisdom and energy!

[Acts 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 25:5</span></span>

Let those of you who are able - Who are best able to undertake the
journey, and to manage the cause. If there be any wickedness in him - So
he does not pass sentence before he hears the cause.

[Acts 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 25:6</span></span>

Not more than ten days - A short space for a new governor to stay at
such a city as Jerusalem. He could not with any convenience have heard
and decided the cause of Paul within that time.

[Acts 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 25:7</span></span>

Bringing many accusations - When many accusations are heaped together,
frequently not one of them is true.

[Acts 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 25:8</span></span>

While he answered - To a general charge a general answer was sufficient.

[Acts 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 25:9</span></span>

Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem - Festus could have ordered this
without asking Paul. But God secretly overruled the whole, that he might
have an occasion of appealing to Rome.

[Acts 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 25:10</span></span>

I am standing at Cesar's judgment seat - For all the courts of the Roman
governors were held in the name of the emperor, and by commission from
him. No man can give me up - He expresses it modestly: the meaning is,
Thou canst not. I appeal to Cesar - Which any Roman citizen might do
before sentence was passed.

[Acts 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 25:12</span></span>

The council - It was customary for a considerable number of persons of
distinction to attend the Roman governors. These constituted a kind of
council, with whom they frequently advised.

[Acts 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 25:13</span></span>

Agrippa - The son of Herod Agrippa, [Act
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md); and Bernice - His sister, with
whom he lived in a scandalous familiarity. This was the person whom
Titus Vespasian so passionately loved, that he would have made her
empress, had not the clamours of the Romans prevented it.

[Acts 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 25:15</span></span>

Desiring judgment against him - As upon a previous conviction, which
they falsely pretended.

[Acts 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 25:16</span></span>

It is not the custom of the Romans - How excellent a rule, to condemn no
one unheard! A rule, which as it is common to all nations, (courts of
inquisition only excepted,) so it ought to direct our proceedings in all
affairs, not only in public, but private life.

[Acts 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 25:18</span></span>

Such things as I supposed - From their passion and vehemence.

[Acts 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 25:19</span></span>

But had certain questions - How coldly does he mention the things of the
last importance! And about one Jesus - Thus does Festus speak of Him, to
whom every knee shall bow! Whom Paul affirmed to be alive - And was this
a doubtful question? But why, O Festus, didst thou doubt concerning it?
Only because thou didst not search into the evidence of it. Otherwise
that evidence might have opened to thee, till it had grown up into full
conviction; and thy illustrious prisoner have led thee into the glorious
liberty of the children of God.

[Acts 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 25:23</span></span>

With the tribunes and principal men of the city - The chief officers,
both military and civil.
