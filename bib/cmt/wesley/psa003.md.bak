### [Psalms Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 3:2</span></span>

My soul - Of me: the soul being commonly put for the person. In God -
God hath utterly forsaken him. Selah - This word is no where used but in
this poetical book, and in the song of Habakkuk. Probably it was a
musical note, directing the singer either to lift up his voice, to make
a pause, or to lengthen the tune. But withal, it is generally placed at
some remarkable passage; which gives occasion to think that it served
also to quicken the attention of the singer and hearer.

[Psalms 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 3:3</span></span>

A shield - My defence. My glory - Thou hast formerly given, and wilt
farther give occasion of glorying in thy power and favour. Lifter up -
Thou wilt restore me to my former power and dignity.

[Psalms 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 3:4</span></span>

His hill - Out of heaven, so called, [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 3:5</span></span>

Slept - Securely, casting all my cares upon God. Awaked - After a sweet
and undisturbed sleep.

[Psalms 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 3:7</span></span>

Cheek bone - Which implies contempt and reproach. Teeth - Their strength
and the instruments of their cruelty. He compares them to wild beasts.
