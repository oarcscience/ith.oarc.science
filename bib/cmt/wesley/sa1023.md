### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 23:1</span></span>

The Philistines, &c. - Probably it was the departure of God and David
from Saul, that encouraged the Philistines to make this inroad. When
princes begin to persecute God's people and ministers, let them expect
nothing but vexation on all sides.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 23:4</span></span>

Enquired again - Not for his own, but for his soldiers satisfaction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 23:6</span></span>

Ephod - With the Ephod, the high - priest's Ephod, wherein were the Urim
and the Thummim, which when Ahimelech and the rest of the priests went
to Saul, were probably left in his hand. This gave him the opportunity
both of escaping, whilst Doeg the butcher was killing his brethren, and
of bringing away the Ephod, which Saul now was justly deprived of.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 23:11</span></span>

The Lord said - From this place it may appear that God's answer by Urim
and Thummim, was not by any change in the colour or situation of the
precious stones in the breast - plate of the Ephod, but by a voice or
suggestion from God to the high - priest. He will - He purposeth to
come, if thou continuest here. For still as David's question, so God's
answer, is upon supposition.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 23:16</span></span>

And strengthened - He comforted and supported him against all his fears,
by minding him of God's infallible promises made to him, and his
singular providence which hitherto had and still would be with him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 23:17</span></span>

Next to thee - Which he gathered either from David's generosity, and
friendship to him; or from some promise made to him by David concerning
it. So that the whole imports thus much; I do not look to be king myself
(as by my birth I might expect,) but that thou shalt be king (God having
so appointed) and I but in a secondary place inferior to thee.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 23:18</span></span>

Made a covenant - They then parted, and never came together again, that
we find, in this world.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 23:19</span></span>

Ziphites - Who were of David's own tribe tho' for this their unnatural
carriage to him, he calls them strangers, [Psa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 23:25</span></span>

A rock - That is, into a cave which was in the rock; where at first he
might think to hide himself, but upon farther consideration he removed
from thence upon Saul's approach.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 23:27</span></span>

A messenger, &c. - The wisdom of God is never at a loss for ways, and
means to preserve his people.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 23:28</span></span>

Called, &c. - That is, The rock of divisions, because there Saul was
separated, and in a manner pulled asunder from David, who was now almost
within his reach.
