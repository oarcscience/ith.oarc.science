### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 26:5</span></span>

The Ziphites - Probably Saul would have pursued David no more, had not
these wretches set him on.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 26:6</span></span>

Zerujah - David's sister. His father is not named either because he was
now dead; or because he was an obscure person.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 26:7</span></span>

Came - That is, to Saul's host. It might seem a bold and strange
attempt; but it may be considered: That David had a particular assurance
that God would preserve him to the kingdom. That he had a special
instinct from God, to this work; and possibly God might inform him, that
he had cast them into a deep sleep, that he might have this second
opportunity of manifesting his innocency towards Saul.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 26:9</span></span>

Destroy him not, &c. - Though Saul be a tyrant, yet he is our Lord and
king; and I, though designed king, as yet am his subject; and therefore
cannot kill him without sin, nor will I consent that thou shouldst do
it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 26:11</span></span>

Take the spear - Which will shew where we have been, and what we could
have done.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 26:13</span></span>

Afar off - That his person might be out of their reach, and yet his
voice might be heard; which in a clear air, and in the silence of the
night might be heard at a great distance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 26:14</span></span>

Cried to the people - It is probable this was early in the morning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 26:19</span></span>

The Lord - If the Lord hath by the evil spirit which he hath sent, or by
his secret providence, directed thy rage against me for the punishment
of thine, or my sins. An offering - Let us offer up a sacrifice to God
to appease his wrath against us. Driven me - From the land which God
hath given to his people for their inheritance, and where he hath
established his presence and worship. Go serve - This was the language
of their actions. For by driving him from God's land, and the place of
his worship, into foreign and idolatrous lands, they exposed him to the
peril of being either ensnared by their counsels, or examples; or forced
by their power to worship idols.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 26:20</span></span>

Before the Lord - Remember, if thou dost it, God the judge of all men
seeth it, and will avenge it; though I will not avenge myself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 26:21</span></span>

My soul, &c. - This second instance of David's tenderness wrought more
upon Saul than the former. He owns himself melted and quite overcome by
David's kindness to him. My soul was precious in thine eyes, which I
thought had been odious. He acknowledges he had done very ill to
persecute him: I have acted against God's law, I have sinned: and
against my own interest, I have played the fool, in pursuing him as an
enemy, who was indeed one of my best friends. And herein I have erred
exceedingly, have wronged both thee and myself. Nothing can be more full
and ingenuous than this confession: God surely now touched his heart.
And he promises to persecute him no more: nor does it appear that he
ever attempted it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 26:25</span></span>

Blessed, &c. - So strong was his conviction now, that he could not
forbear blessing him, foretelling his success, applauding David, and
condemning himself, even in the hearing of his own soldiers. And this,
it seems, was their last interview. After this they saw each other no
more.
