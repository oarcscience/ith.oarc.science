<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch2 31:1</A></FONT></span></p>Manasseh - By the special impulse and direction of God's spirit. And he knew Hoshea contented himself with the worship of the calves, and did not practise that great idolatry which his predecessors had used, and therefore would patiently suffer the breaking of the images of Baal, and the things belonging to them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#002">2 Chronicles 31:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">ch2 31:2</A></FONT></span></p>The tents - Within the gates of the house of the Lord: which is here called tents, because the host of the Lord, the priests and Levites, encamped there.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">ch2 31:3</A></FONT></span></p>Of his substance - Which had hitherto been taken out of the treasures of the temple, but that he might ease the people in their present poverty, which his predecessor had brought upon them, and engage them to a more chearful attendance upon God's service, he took the burden upon himself. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004">2 Chronicles 31:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">ch2 31:4</A></FONT></span></p>Encouraged - Freed them from worldly cares and distractions, and enabled to give up themselves entirely to the serious study of God's law, and to the instruction, and direction, and quickening of the people.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">ch2 31:5</A></FONT></span></p>Came abroad - As Soon as the king extended that command to all the parts of his kingdom, which, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#004">Ch2 31:4</A>, was confined to them that dwelt in Jerusalem. Honey - Or, dates, as the Hebrew writers generally, understand this word, which were given to them, because of the sweetness of their taste in some sort resembling honey. For the law requires no tithes, but of the fruits of trees, or of the earth, or of beasts. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#006">2 Chronicles 31:6</A></p>

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#008">2 Chronicles 31:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">ch2 31:8</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed the Lord - Both for giving such plentiful provisions to his land and for giving his people such liberal hearts. And they praised the people for their forwardness and faithfulness in it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#009">2 Chronicles 31:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">ch2 31:9</A></FONT></span></p>Questioned - How it came to pass that no more of their provision was spent and that there yet remained such great heaps of it. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#014">2 Chronicles 31:14</A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">ch2 31:18</A></FONT></span></p>For, &amp;c. - This is alleged as a reason why their wives and children were provided for out of the holy things, because they sequestered themselves from worldly affairs, by which they might otherwise have provided for their families.
