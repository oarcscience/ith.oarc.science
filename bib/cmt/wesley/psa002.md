### [Psalms Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 2:1</span></span>

Heathen - Who did so against David, [Sa2
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006.md), [Sa2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017.md); [Ch1
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#008.md), and against Christ, [Luk
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032.md); [Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md), &c.

[Psalms 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 2:2</span></span>

The kings - Herod, and Pilate and others with or after them. Earth - So
called in way of contempt and to shew their madness in opposing the God
of heaven. Set - The word denotes the combination of their counsels and
forces. Anointed - Against the king whom God hath chosen and exalted.

[Psalms 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 2:3</span></span>

And cast - The same thing expressed with more emphasis. Let us not only
break off their yoke and the cords by which it is fastened upon us, but
let us cast them far away.

[Psalms 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 2:4</span></span>

Sitteth - As the king of the whole world. Heavens - As an evidence both
of God's clear and certain knowledge of all things that are done below,
and of his sovereign and irresistible power. Laugh - Shall despise them
and all their crafty devices.

[Psalms 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 2:6</span></span>

Yet - Notwithstanding all their artifices and combinations. My king -
Who ruleth in my stead, and according to my will, and for my glory. Zion
- Over my church and people. Zion strictly taken, was an hill on the
north part of Jerusalem, where there was a strong fort, called the city
of David, but in a more large sense it is put for the city of Jerusalem,
for the temple of Jerusalem, built upon the hill of Moriah, which was
either a part of mount Sion, or adjoining to it; for the church of the
Jews, and for the Christian church.

[Psalms 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 2:7</span></span>

The decree - The will and appointment of God concerning this. My sin -
Which tho' it may in some sort be said to, or of David, yet much more
properly belongs to Christ, who is commonly known by this title both in
the Old and New Testament, and to whom this title is expressly
appropriated by the holy ghost, who is the best interpreter of his own
words, [Act 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md); [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md). This day - This may be understood
either, Of his eternal generation. This day, from all eternity, which is
well described by this day, because in eternity there is no succession,
no \[yesterday,\] no \[tomorrow,\] but it is all as one continued day or
moment without change or flux; or, Of the manifestation of Christ's
eternal son - ship in time; which was done both in his birth and life,
when his being the son of God was demonstrated by the testimony of the
angel, [Luk 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md), and of God the
Father, [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md), [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md), and by his own words and works;
and in his resurrection, which seems to be here mainly intended, of
which day this very place is expounded, [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md). When Christ was in a most
solemn manner declared to be the son of God with power, [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md).

[Psalms 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 2:8</span></span>

Earth - Not only the Jewish nation, but the whole world.

[Psalms 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 2:9</span></span>

Them - Those that will not quietly submit to thee, shall be crushed and
destroyed by thee. This was in part fulfilled, when the Jews who
persisted in unbelief, were destroyed by the Romans power: And in the
destruction of the Pagan power, when the Christian religion came to be
established. But it will not be compleatly fulfilled, 'till all opposing
power and principality be put down.

[Psalms 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 2:10</span></span>

Now - While you have time for repentance and submission.

[Psalms 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 2:11</span></span>

Fear - With an awful sense of his great and glorious majesty. Rejoice -
Do not esteem his yoke your dishonour and grievance; but rejoice in this
inestimable grace and benefit. Trembling - This is added to warn them of
taking heed that they do not turn this grace of God into wantonness.

[Psalms 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 2:12</span></span>

Kiss - In token of your subjection and adoration; whereof this was a
sign among the eastern nations. The son - The son of God. Ye perish - Be
taken out of the way by death or destruction. Wrath - The least degree
of his anger is terrible.
