### [2 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md)

[2 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo2 1:1</span></span>

The elder - An appellation suited to a familiar letter, but upon a
weighty subject. To the elect - That is, Christian. Kuria is undoubtedly
a proper name, both here and in [Jo2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005.md); for it was not then usual to
apply the title of lady to any but the Roman empress; neither would such
a manner of speaking have been suitable to the simplicity and dignity of
the apostle. Whom - Both her and her children. I love in the truth -
With unfeigned and holy love.

[2 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo2 1:2</span></span>

For the truth's sake, which abideth in us - As a living principle of
faith and holiness.

[2 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo2 1:3</span></span>

Grace takes away guilt; mercy, misery: peace implies the abiding in
grace and mercy. It includes the testimony of God's Spirit, both that we
are his children, and that all our ways are acceptable to him. This is
the very foretaste of heaven itself, where it is perfected. In truth and
love - Or, faith and love, as St. Paul speaks. Faith and truth are here
synonymous terms.

[2 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo2 1:4</span></span>

I found of thy children - Probably in their aunt's house, [Jo2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#013.md). Walking in the truth - In faith
and love.

[2 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo2 1:5</span></span>

That which we had from the beginning - Of our Lord's ministry. Indeed it
was, in some sense, from the beginning of the world. That we may love
one another - More abundantly.

[2 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo2 1:6</span></span>

And this is the proof of true love, universal obedience built on the
love of God. This - Love. Is the great commandment which ye have heard
from the beginning - Of our preaching.

[2 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo2 1:7</span></span>

Carefully keep what ye have heard from the beginning, for many seducers
are entered into the world, who confess not Jesus Christ that came in
the flesh - Who disbelieve either his prophetic, or priestly, or kingly
office. Whosoever does this is the seducer - From God. And the
antichrist - Fighting against Christ.

[2 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo2 1:8</span></span>

That we lose not the things which we have wrought - Which every apostate
does. But receive a full reward - Having fully employed all our talents
to the glory of him that gave them. Here again the apostle modestly
transfers it to himself.

[2 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo2 1:9</span></span>

Receive this as a certain rule: Whosoever transgresseth - Any law of
God. Hath not God - For his Father and his God. He that abideth in the
doctrine of Christ - Believing and obeying it. He hath both the Father
and the Son - For his God.

[2 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo2 1:10</span></span>

If any came to you - Either as a teacher or a brother. And bring not
this doctrine - That is, advance anything contrary to it. Receive him
not into your house - As either a teacher or a brother - Neither bid him
God speed - Give him no encouragement therein.

[2 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo2 1:11</span></span>

For he that biddeth him God speed - That gives him any encouragement, is
accessory to his evil deeds.

[2 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo2 1:12</span></span>

Having many things to write, I was not minded to write now - Only of
these, which were then peculiarly needful.

[2 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo2 1:13</span></span>

The children of thy elect or Christian sister - Absent, if not dead,
when the apostle wrote this.
