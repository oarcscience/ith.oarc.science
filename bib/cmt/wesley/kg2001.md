### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 1:1</span></span>

Moab - This had been subdued by David, as Edom was; and upon the
division of his kingdom, Moab was adjoined to that of Israel, and Edom
to that of Judah, each to that kingdom upon which it bordered. But when
the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were weak and forsaken by God, they
took that opportunity to revolt from them; Moab here, and Edom a little
after.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 1:2</span></span>

Chamber - In which, the lattess might be left to convey light into the
lower room. But the words may be rendered, through the battlements (or
through the lattess in the battlements) of the roof of the house. Where,
standing and looking through, and leaning upon this lattess, it broke,
and he fell down into the court or garden. Baal - zebub - Properly, the
god of flies; an idol so called, because it was supposed to deliver
those people from flies; Jupiter and Hercules were called by a like name
among the Grecians. And it is evident, both from sacred and prophane
histories, That the idol - gods, did sometimes through God's permission,
give the answers; though they were generally observed, even by the
Heathens themselves, to be dark and doubtful.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 1:3</span></span>

And say - Dost thou not cast contempt on the God of Israel, as if he
were either ignorant of the event of thy disease, or unable to give thee
relief; and as if Baal - zebub had more skill and power than he?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 1:5</span></span>

Why, &c. - Before you have been at Ekron: which he knew by their quick
return.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 1:8</span></span>

An hairy man - His garment was rough and hairy, such as were worn by
eminent persons in Greece, in ancient times; and were the proper habit
of the prophets. Girdle - As John the baptist also had. That by his very
outward habit, he might represent Elijah, in whose spirit and power he
came.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 1:9</span></span>

Man of God - So he calls him by way of scorn. Come - The king commands
thee to come to him: which if thou refuseth, I am to carry thee by
force.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 1:10</span></span>

Let fire, &c. - Elijah did this, not to secure himself, he could have
done that some other way: nor to revenge himself, for it was not his own
cause that he acted in: but to prove his mission, and to reveal the
wrath of God from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 1:11</span></span>

And said - He discovers more petulancy than the former; and shews, how
little he was moved by the former example.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 1:13</span></span>

Besought - Expressing both reverence to his person, and a dread of God's
judgments. There is nothing to be got by contending with God: if we
would prevail with him, it must be by supplication. And those are wise
who learn submission from the fatal consequences of obstinacy in others.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 1:16</span></span>

He said - To his very face. Nor durst the king lay hands upon him, being
daunted with the prophet's presence, and confidence; and affrighted by
the late dreadful evidence of his power with God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 1:17</span></span>

Jehoram - His brother. The son of Jehoshaphat - Jehoshaphat, in his
seventeenth year, when he went to Ahab, and with him to Ramoth - Gilead,
appointed his son Jehoram his vice - roy, and (in case of his death) his
successor. In the second year from that time, when Jehoram was thus made
vice - king in his father's stead; this Jehoram, Ahab's son, began to
reign: and in the fifth year of the reign of this Jehoram son of Ahab,
which was about the twenty - fourth year of Jehoshaphat's reign, Jehoram
son of Jehoshaphat was made king of Judah, together with his father.
