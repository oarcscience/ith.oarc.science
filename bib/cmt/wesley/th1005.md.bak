### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

But of the precise times when this shall be.

[1 Thessalonians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 5:2</span></span>

For this in general ye do know; and ye can and need know no more.

[1 Thessalonians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 5:3</span></span>

When they - The men of the world say.

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

Ye are not in darkness - Sleeping secure in sin.

[1 Thessalonians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 5:6</span></span>

Awake, and keep awake - Being awakened, let us have all our spiritual
senses about us.

[1 Thessalonians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 5:7</span></span>

They usually sleep and are drunken in the night - These things do not
love the light.

[1 Thessalonians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 5:9</span></span>

God hath not appointed us to wrath - As he hath the obstinately
impenitent.

[1 Thessalonians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 5:10</span></span>

Whether we wake or sleep - Be alive or dead at his coming.

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

Know them that, Labour among you: Are over you in the Lord: Admonish
you. Know - See, mark, take knowledge of them and their work. Sometimes
the same person may both labour, that is, preach; be over, or govern;
and admonish the flock by particular application to each: sometimes two
or more different persons, according as God variously dispenses his
gifts. But O, what a misery is it when a man undertakes this whole work
without either gifts or graces for any part of it! Why, then, will he
undertake it? for pay? What! will he sell both his own soul and all the
souls of the flock? What words can describe such a wretch as this? And
yet even this may be "an honourable man!"

[1 Thessalonians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 5:13</span></span>

Esteem them very highly - Literally, more than abundantly, in love - The
inexpressible sympathy that is between true pastors and their flock is
intimated, not only here, but also in divers other places of this
epistle. See [Th1 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007.md). For their
work's sake - The principal ground of their vast regard for them. But
how are we to esteem them who do not work at all?

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

Warn the disorderly - Them that stand, as it were, out of their rank in
the spiritual warfare. Some such were even in that church. The feeble -
minded - Literally, them of little soul; such as have no spiritual
courage.

[1 Thessalonians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 5:15</span></span>

See that none - Watch over both yourselves and each other. Follow that
which is good - Do it resolutely and perseveringly.

[1 Thessalonians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 5:16</span></span>

Rejoice evermore - In uninterrupted happiness in God. Pray without
ceasing - Which is the fruit of always rejoicing in the Lord. In
everything give thanks - Which is the fruit of both the former. This is
Christian perfection. Farther than this we cannot go; and we need not
stop short of it. Our Lord has purchased joy, as well as righteousness,
for us. It is the very design of the gospel that, being saved from
guilt, we should be happy in the love of Christ. Prayer may be said to
be the breath of our spiritual life. He that lives cannot possibly cease
breathing. So much as we really enjoy of the presence of God, so much
prayer and praise do we offer up without ceasing; else our rejoicing is
but delusion. Thanksgiving is inseparable from true prayer: it is almost
essentially connected with it. He that always prays is ever giving
praise, whether in ease or pain, both for prosperity and for the
greatest adversity. He blesses God for all things, looks on them as
coming from him, and receives them only for his sake; not choosing nor
refusing, liking nor disliking, anything, but only as it is agreeable or
disagreeable to his perfect will.

[1 Thessalonians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 5:18</span></span>

For this - That you should thus rejoice, pray, give thanks. Is the will
of God - Always good, always pointing at our salvation.

[1 Thessalonians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 5:19</span></span>

Quench not the Spirit - Wherever it is, it burns; it flames in holy
love, in joy, prayer, thanksgiving. O quench it not, damp it not in
yourself or others, either by neglecting to do good, or by doing evil!

[1 Thessalonians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">th1 5:20</span></span>

Despise not prophesyings - That is, preaching; for the apostle is not
here speaking of extraordinary gifts. It seems, one means of grace is
put for all; and whoever despises any of these, under whatever pretence,
will surely (though perhaps gradually and almost insensibly) quench the
Spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">th1 5:21</span></span>

Meantime, prove all things - Which any preacher recommends. (He speaks
of practice, not of doctrines.) Try every advice by the touchstone of
scripture, and hold fast that which is good - Zealously, resolutely,
diligently practise it, in spite of all opposition.

[1 Thessalonians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">th1 5:22</span></span>

And be equally zealous and careful to abstain from all appearance of
evil - Observe, those who "heap to themselves teachers, having itching
ears," under pretence of proving all things, have no countenance or
excuse from this scripture.

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

And may the God of peace sanctify you - By the peace he works in you,
which is a great means of sanctification. Wholly - The word signifies
wholly and perfectly; every part and all that concerns you; all that is
of or about you. And may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and
the body - Just before he said you; now he denominates them from their
spiritual state. The spirit - [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008.md); wishing that it may be preserved
whole and entire: then from their natural state, the soul and the body;
(for these two make up the whole nature of man, [Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028);.md) wishing it may be preserved
blameless till the coming of Christ. To explain this a little further:
of the three here mentioned, only the two last are the natural
constituent parts of man. The first is adventitious, and the
supernatural gift of God, to be found in Christians only. That man
cannot possibly consist of three parts, appears hence: The soul is
either matter or not matter: there is no medium. But if it is matter, it
is part of the body: if not matter, it coincides with the Spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">th1 5:24</span></span>

Who also will do it - Unless you quench the Spirit.

[1 Thessalonians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">th1 5:27</span></span>

I charge you by the Lord - Christ, to whom proper divine worship is here
paid. That this epistle - The first he wrote. Be read to all the
brethren - That is, in all the churches. They might have concealed it
out of modesty, had not this been so solemnly enjoined: but what Paul
commands under so strong an adjuration, Rome forbids under pain of
excommunication.
