------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Job Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#001.md)

[Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 23:2</span></span>

To - day - Even at this time, notwithstanding all your pretended
consolations. Stroke - The hand or stroke of God upon me. Groaning -
Doth exceed my complaints.

[Job 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 23:3</span></span>

O - I desire nothing more than his acquaintance and presence; but alas,
he hides his face from me. Seat - To his throne or judgment - seat to
plead my cause before him.

[Job 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 23:5</span></span>

Know - If he should discover to me any secret sins, for which he
contendeth with me, I would humble myself before him, and accept of the
punishment of mine iniquity.

[Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 23:6</span></span>

No - He would not use his power against me, but for me; by enabling me
to plead my cause, and giving sentence according to that clemency, which
he uses towards his children.

[Job 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 23:7</span></span>

There - At that throne of grace, where God lays aside his majesty, and
judges according to his wonted clemency. Dispute - Humbly propounding
the grounds of their confidence. So - Upon such a fair and equal
hearing. Delivered - From the damnatory sentence of God. This and some
such expressions of Job cannot be excused from irreverence towards God,
for which God afterwards reproves him, and Job abhorreth himself.

[Job 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 23:8</span></span>

Is not - As a judge to hear and determine my causes, otherwise he knew
God was essentially present in all places.

[Job 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 23:10</span></span>

Gold - Which comes out of the furnace pure from all dross.

[Job 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 23:11</span></span>

Steps - The steps or paths which God hath appointed men to walk in.

[Job 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 23:14</span></span>

Performeth - Those calamities which he hath allotted to me. And - There
are many such examples of God's proceeding with men.

[Job 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 23:16</span></span>

Soft - He hath bruised, and broken, or melted it, so that I have no
spirit in me.

[Job 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 23:17</span></span>

Because - God did not cut me off by death. Before - These miseries came
upon me. Covered - By hiding me in the grave.
