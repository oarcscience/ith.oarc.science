### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 5:5</span></span>

Go to, &c. - It was very natural for a king to suppose, that the king of
Israel could do more than any of his subjects.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 5:10</span></span>

Elisha sent - Which he did, partly, to exercise Naaman's faith and
obedience: partly, for the honour of his religion, that it might appear
he sought not his own glory and profit, but only God's honour, and the
good of men.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 5:11</span></span>

Was wroth - Supposing himself despised by the prophet.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 5:12</span></span>

Are not, &c. - Is there not as great a virtue in them to this purpose?
But he should have considered, that the cure was not to be wrought by
the water, but by the power of God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 5:13</span></span>

My father - Or, our father. So they call him, to shew their reverence
and affection to him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 5:16</span></span>

He refused - Not that he thought it unlawful to receive presents, which
he did receive from others, but because of the special circumstances of
the case; this being much for the honour of God that the Syrians should
see the generous piety, and kindness of his ministers and servants, and
how much they despised all that worldly wealth and glory, which the
prophets of the Gentiles so greedily sought after.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 5:17</span></span>

Two mules burden of earth - So he seems to farm the money which he
brought with him, to express how little value he now set upon it. Ten
talents (above three thousand five hundred pounds) in silver, with six
thousand pieces of gold, (beside ten changes of raiment) were a burden
for several mules. Shall I not give this to thy servant, Gehazi, if thou
thyself will accept of nothing? This seems a more probable
interpretation than the common one, that he wanted to build an altar
therewith. For what altar could be built of the earth which two mules
could carry into Syria? Unless they were as large and as strong as
Elephants.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 5:18</span></span>

Rimmon - A Syrian idol, called here by the LXX, Remman, and [Act
7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043), Remphan. My hand - Or, arm, upon
which, the king leaned, either for state, or for support.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 5:20</span></span>

Gehazi - One would expect Elisha's servant should have been a saint: but
we find him far otherwise. The best men, the best ministers, have often
had those about them, that were their grief and shame. This Syrian - A
stranger, and one of that nation who are the implacable enemies of God's
people. As the Lord - He swears, that he might have some pretence for
the action to which he had bound himself by his oath; not considering,
that to swear to do any wicked action, is so far from excusing it, that
it makes it much worse.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 5:23</span></span>

Urged him - Who at first refused it upon a pretence of modesty.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 5:26</span></span>

Olive yards, &c. - Which Gehazi intended to purchase with this money:
and therefore the prophet names them, to inform him, that he exactly
knew, not only his outward actions, but even his most secret intentions.
What a folly is it, to presume upon sin in hopes of secrecy? When thou
goest aside into any bye - path, doth not thy own conscience go with
thee? Nay, doth not the eye of God go with thee? What then avails the
absence of human witnesses?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 5:27</span></span>

For ever - That is, for some generations; as that word is often used and
as may be thought by comparing this with [Exo
20:55](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#055). (?) White - Which is the worst
kind of leprosy, and noted by physicians to be incurable. Those who get
money by any way displeasing to God, make a dear purchase. What was
Gehazi profited by his two talents, when he lost his health, if not his
soul, forever?
