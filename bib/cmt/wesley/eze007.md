<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 7:12</span></span>

Mourn - Men usually part with their estates grieving that they must
transmit their right to others; but let them now think how little a
while they could have kept them, and how little time they shall keep
them who have bought them.

[Ezekiel 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#013)

There is not a man going to the war. Wrath - That displeasure which
takes away their courage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 7:15</span></span>

iniquity itself.

Baldness - Either by pulling off the hair amidst their sorrows, or
cutting it off in token of mourning.

[Ezekiel 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 7:19</span></span>

Cast - That they may be the lighter to fly. Removed - Carried away into
Babylon. Not satisfy - They shall afford them no comfort. Stumbling -
block - This silver and gold they coveted immeasurably, and abused to
pride, luxury, idolatry and oppression; this that they stumbled at and
fell into sin, now they stumble at and fall into the deepest misery.

[Ezekiel 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 7:20</span></span>

The beauty - The temple, and all that pertained to it, which was the
beauty and glory of that nation. He set - God commanded it should be
beautiful and magnificent. Images - Their idols. Far from them - I have
sent them far from the temple.

[Ezekiel 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 7:21</span></span>

It - My temple.

[Ezekiel 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022)

Turn - Either from the Jews, or from the Chaldeans, neither relieving
the one nor restraining the other. Secret place - The temple, and the
holy of holies. Robbers - The soldiers.

[Ezekiel 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 7:24</span></span>

The pomp - The magnificence and glory, wherein they boasted; or the
temple that the Jews gloried in.

[Ezekiel 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 7:26</span></span>

Seek - But in vain. The priest - He shall have no words either of
counsel or comfort to say to them. Ancients - Nor shall their senators
know what to advise.

[Ezekiel 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 7:27</span></span>

The king - Zedekiah. The prince - Every magistrate. Troubled - Hang
down, and melt away. What can men contrive or do for themselves, when
God is departed from them? All must needs be in tears, all in trouble,
when God comes to judge them according to their deserts, and so make
them know, that he is the Lord, to whom vengeance belongeth.
