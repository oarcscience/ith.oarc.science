### [Psalms Chapter 129](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 129:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 129:1</span></span>

From my youth - From the time that I was a people.

[Psalms 129:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 129:4</span></span>

Righteous - Faithful or merciful. The cords - Wherewith the plow was
drawn. By these cords he understands all their plots and endeavours.

[Psalms 129:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 129:6</span></span>

House - tops - Which there were flat. Which - Having no deep root, never
comes to maturity. And so all their designs shall be abortive.

[Psalms 129:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa129.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 129:8</span></span>

The blessing - Which was an usual salutation given by passengers to
reapers: so the meaning is, it never continues 'till the harvest comes.
