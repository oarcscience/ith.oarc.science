### [Nehemiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#001)

[Nehemiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 4:2</span></span>

In a day - Do they intend to begin, and finish the work, all in one day?
For if they spend any long time about it, they cannot think that we will
suffer them to do it. The stones - Will they pick up their broken stones
out of the ruins, and patch them together. Burnt - Which stones were
burnt, and broken, by the Chaldeans when they took the city.

[Nehemiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 4:4</span></span>

A prey - Give them for a prey to their enemies, and let these carry them
into the land of captivity.

[Nehemiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 4:5</span></span>

Cover not - Let their wickedness be in thy sight, so as to bring down
judgments upon them, that either they may be reformed, or others may be
warned by their example. God is said to cover or hide sin when he
forbears to punish it. Provoked thee - They have not only provoked us
builders, but thee also.

[Nehemiah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">neh 4:6</span></span>

The half - Unto half its height.

[Nehemiah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 4:10</span></span>

Judah - The Jews now dwelling in Judah, some of them being partly
terrified by their enemies, and partly wearied with continual labour.
Rubbish - More than we are able suddenly to remove. Not able - Being
forced to spend our time in removing the rubbish, and therefore we must
desist for a season.

[Nehemiah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 4:12</span></span>

By them - Or, among them: whereby they came to the knowledge of their
counsels. Tho' these had not zeal enough to help in the work, yet they
had some concern for their brethren. Ten tribes - Very often, a certain
number for an uncertain. Be upon you - They will invade you every way,
by which we can come to you, or you to us; therefore keep watches on
every side.

[Nehemiah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 4:13</span></span>

Behind - Within the walls where they were not yet raised to their due
height, and therefore most liable to the enemies assault. Higher - Upon
the tops of the walls where they were finished, and the towers which
were built here and there upon the wall; whence they might shoot arrows,
or throw stones.

[Nehemiah 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 4:14</span></span>

Looked - He looked up, engaged God for him, and put himself and his
cause under the Divine protection. That was his way, and should be ours:
all his cares, all his griefs, all his fears he spread before God. Great
and terrible - You think your enemies are great and terrible. But what
are they in comparison of God? Especially in opposition to him?

[Nehemiah 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 4:16</span></span>

From that time forth - Lest our enemies should repeat their enterprize.
My servants - Of my domestick servants, and of my guards. Held, &c. -
All their weapons: they stood in their arms prepared for battle. Were
behind - To encourage them in their work, sometimes to assist with their
own hands: and to direct and command them in case of an assault. Judah -
The Jews who were upon the wall.

[Nehemiah 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 4:17</span></span>

A Weapon - This is to be taken figuratively; being a proverbial speech,
as when they say of a man pretending kindness, he carries bread in one
hand, and a stone in another. Thus must we work out our salvation, with
the weapons of our warfare in our hands. For in every duty we must
expect opposition from our spiritual enemies.

[Nehemiah 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 4:18</span></span>

Sounded - To call the people together, when, and where it was necessary.

[Nehemiah 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">neh 4:23</span></span>

Washing - When they were to wash and cleanse themselves from some
impurity, which might befal them or their garments.
