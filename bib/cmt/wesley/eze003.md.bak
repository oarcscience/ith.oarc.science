### [Ezekiel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 3:1</span></span>

Eat - This was done in a vision. Findeth - In the hand which was sent to
him.

[Ezekiel 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 3:3</span></span>

Belly - The mouth is the proper instrument of eating, but when meat is
digested, the belly is said to eat. Fill thy bowels - This denotes the
fulness of the measure wherewith we should read, meditate, and digest
the word of God. Honey - It was sweet to receive things by revelation
from God, and so to converse with God. And usually the first part of the
ministerial work is pleasant.

[Ezekiel 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 3:4</span></span>

Speak - What things I shall shew thee, and in what words I shall declare
them to thee.

[Ezekiel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 3:6</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 3:8</span></span>

I have - I have given thee, constancy, and manly carriage. The more
impudent wicked people are in their opposition to religion, the more
openly and resolutely should God's people appear in the practice and
defence of it.

[Ezekiel 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 3:11</span></span>

[Ezekiel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 3:14</span></span>

Spirit - Caught him up into the air. Took - Carried me to the place
where the captive Jews were crowded together. Bitterness - Not at all
pleased with my work. He went in the heat of his spirit; because of the
discouragements he foresaw he should meet with. But the hand of the Lord
was strong upon him, not only to compel him to the work, but to fit him
for it.

[Ezekiel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 3:15</span></span>

Tel - abib - A part of Mesopotamia, which was shut up within Chebar
westward, and Saocora eastward. By - On that part of the river Chebar,
which runs west - ward of Tel - abib. Where - Where I found them sitting

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 3:23</span></span>

As the glory - We are not now to expect such visions. But we have a
favour done us nothing inferior, if we by faith behold the glory of the
Lord, so as to be changed into the same image. And this honour have all
his saints.
