### [Psalms Chapter 139](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001)

[Psalms 139:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 139:2</span></span>

Afar off - Thou knowest what my thoughts will be in such and such
circumstances, long before I know it, yea from all eternity.

[Psalms 139:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 139:3</span></span>

Compassest - Thou discernest every step I take. It is a metaphor from
soldiers besieging their enemies, and setting watches round about them.

[Psalms 139:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 139:5</span></span>

Beset me - With thy all - seeing providence. And laid - Thou keepest me,
as it were with a strong hand, in thy sight and under thy power.

[Psalms 139:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 139:6</span></span>

I cannot - Apprehend in what manner thou dost so presently know all
things.

[Psalms 139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 139:8</span></span>

Hell - If I could hide myself in the lowest parts of the earth.

[Psalms 139:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 139:9</span></span>

The wings - If I should flee from east to west: for the sea being the
western border of Canaan, is often put for the west in scripture. And
wings are poetically ascribed to the morning here, as they are elsewhere
to the sun, and to the winds.

[Psalms 139:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 139:16</span></span>

Imperfect - When I was first conceived. Book - In thy counsel and
providence, by which thou didst contrive and effect this great work,
according to that model which thou hadst appointed.

[Psalms 139:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 139:17</span></span>

Thoughts - Thy counsels on my behalf. Thou didst not only form me at
first, but ever since my conception and birth, thy thoughts have been
employed for me.

[Psalms 139:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 139:18</span></span>

Them - Thy wonderful counsels and works on my behalf come constantly
into my mind.

[Psalms 139:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 139:22</span></span>

Perfect hatred - See the difference between the Jewish and the Christian
spirit!
