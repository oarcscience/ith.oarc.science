### [Psalms Chapter 99](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001)

[Psalms 99:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 99:1</span></span>

People - Such as are enemies to God and his people. Sitteth - Upon the
ark. He is present with his people. Earth - The people of the earth.
Moved - With fear and trembling.

[Psalms 99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 99:3</span></span>

Them - All people.

[Psalms 99:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 99:4</span></span>

Judgment - Though his dominion be absolute, and his power irresistible,
yet he manages it with righteousness. The king's strength is by a known
Hebraism put for the strong, or powerful king. Equity - In all thy
proceedings.

[Psalms 99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 99:5</span></span>

Foot - stool - Before the ark, which is so called, [Ch1

pledge of God's presence.

[Psalms 99:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#006)

Moses - Moses before the institution of the priesthood executed that
office, [Exo 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006). That call - Who
used frequently and solemnly to intercede with God on the behalf of the
people.

[Psalms 99:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 99:7</span></span>

Spake - To some of them: to Moses and Aaron, [Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024), [Exo
33:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#009); [Sa1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009), &c.

[Psalms 99:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 99:8</span></span>

Them - The intercessors before mentioned. Forgavest - The people for
whom they prayed, so far as not to inflict that total destruction upon
them which they deserved;
