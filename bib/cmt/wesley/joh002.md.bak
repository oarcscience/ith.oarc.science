### [John Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

[John 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 2:1</span></span>

And the third day - After he had said this. In Cana of Galilee - There
were two other towns of the same name, one in the tribe of Ephraim, the
other in Caelosyria.

[John 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 2:2</span></span>

Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage - Christ does not
take away human society, but sanctifies it. Water might have quenched
thirst; yet our Lord allows wine; especially at a festival solemnity.
Such was his facility in drawing his disciples at first, who were
afterward to go through rougher ways.

[John 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 2:3</span></span>

And wine falling short - How many days the solemnity had lasted, and on
which day our Lord came, or how many disciples might follow him, does
not appear. His mother saith to him, They have not wine - Either she
might mean, supply them by miracle; or, Go away, that others may go
also, before the want appears.

[John 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 2:4</span></span>

Jesus saith to her, Woman - So our Lord speaks also, [Joh
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026.md). It is probable this was the
constant appellation which he used to her. He regarded his Father above
all, not knowing even his mother after the flesh. What is it to me and
thee? A mild reproof of her inordinate concern and untimely interposal.
Mine hour is not yet come - The time of my working this miracle, or of
my going away. May we not learn hence, if his mother was rebuked for
attempting to direct him in the days of his flesh, how absurd it is to
address her as if she had a right to command him, on the throne of his
glory? Likewise how indecent it is for us to direct his supreme wisdom,
as to the time or manner in which he shall appear for us in any of the
exigencies of life!

[John 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 2:5</span></span>

His mother saith to the servants - Gathering from his answer he was
about to do something extraordinary.

[John 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 2:6</span></span>

The purifying of the Jews - Who purified themselves by frequent washings
particularly before eating.

[John 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 2:9</span></span>

The governor of the feast - The bridegroom generally procured some
friend to order all things at the entertainment.

[John 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 2:10</span></span>

And saith - St. John barely relates the words he spoke, which does not
imply his approving them. When they have well drunk - does not mean any
more than toward the close of the entertainment.

[John 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 2:11</span></span>

And his disciples believed - More steadfastly.

[John 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 2:14</span></span>

Oxen, and sheep, and doves - Used for sacrifice: And the changers of
money - Those who changed foreign money for that which was current at
Jerusalem, for the convenience of them that came from distant countries.

[John 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 2:15</span></span>

Having made a scourge of rushes - (Which were strewed on the ground,) he
drove all out of the temple, (that is, the court of it,) both the sheep
and the oxen - Though it does not appear that he struck even them; and
much less, any of the men. But a terror from God, it is evident, fell
upon them.

[John 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 2:17</span></span>

[Psa 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md).

[John 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 2:18</span></span>

Then answered the Jews - Either some of those whom he had just driven
out, or their friends: What sign showest thou? - So they require a
miracle, to confirm a miracle!

[John 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 2:19</span></span>

This temple - Doubtless pointing, while he spoke, to his body, the
temple and habitation of the Godhead.

[John 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 2:20</span></span>

Forty and six years - Just so many years before the time of this
conversation, Herod the Great had begun his most magnificent reparation
of the temple, (one part after another,) which he continued all his
life, and which was now going on, and was continued thirty - six years
longer, till within six or seven years of the destruction of the state,
city, and temple by the Romans.

[John 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 2:22</span></span>

They believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said -
Concerning his resurrection.

[John 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 2:23</span></span>

Many believed - That he was a teacher sent from God.

[John 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 2:24</span></span>

He did not trust himself to them - Let us learn hence not rashly to put
ourselves into the power of others. Let us study a wise and happy medium
between universal suspiciousness and that easiness which would make us
the property of every pretender to kindness and respect.

[John 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 2:25</span></span>

He - To whom all things are naked, knew what was in man - Namely, a
desperately deceitful heart.
