### [Luke Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

[Luke 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 20:1</span></span>

[Luke 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 20:9</span></span>

A long time - It was a long time from the entrance of the Israelites
into Canaan to the birth of Christ. [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md); [Mar
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md).

[Luke 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 20:16</span></span>

He will destroy these husbandmen - Probably he pointed to the scribes,
chief priests, and elders: who allowed, he will miserably destroy those
wicked men, [Mat 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md); but could not
bear that this should be applied to themselves. They might also mean,
God forbid that we should be guilty of such a crime as your parable
seems to charge us with, namely, rejecting and killing the heir. Our
Saviour answers, But yet will ye do it, as is prophesied of you.

[Luke 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 20:17</span></span>

He looked on them - To sharpen their attention. [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md).

[Luke 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 20:20</span></span>

Just men - Men of a tender conscience. To take hold of his discourse -
If he answered as they hoped he would. [Mat
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016.md); [Mar
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#012.md).

[Luke 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 20:21</span></span>

Thou speakest - In private, and teachest - In public.

[Luke 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 20:24</span></span>

Show me a penny - A Roman penny, which was the money that was usually
paid on that occasion.

[Luke 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 20:26</span></span>

They could not take hold of his words before the people - As they did
afterward before the sanhedrim, in the absence of the people, [Luk
22:67](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#067.md), &c.

[Luke 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 20:27</span></span>

[Mat 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md); [Mar
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md).

[Luke 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 20:28</span></span>

[Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md).

[Luke 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 20:34</span></span>

The children of this world - The inhabitants of earth, marry and are
given in marriage - As being all subject to the law of mortality; so
that the species is in need of being continually repaired.

[Luke 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 20:35</span></span>

But they who obtain that world - Which they enter into, before the
resurrection of the dead.

[Luke 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 20:36</span></span>

They are the children of God - In a more eminent sense when they rise
again.

[Luke 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 20:37</span></span>

That the dead are raised, even Moses, as well as the other prophets
showed, when he calleth - That is, when he recites the words which God
spoke of himself, I am the God of Abraham, [Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md). It cannot properly be said,
that God is the God of any who are totally perished. [Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md).

[Luke 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 20:38</span></span>

He is not a God of the dead, or, there is no God of the dead - That is,
tho term God implies such a relation, as cannot possibly subsist between
him and the dead; who in the Sadducees' sense are extinguished spirits;
who could neither worship him, nor receive good from him. So that all
live to him - All who have him for their God, live to and enjoy him.
This sentence is not an argument for what went before; but the
proposition which was to be proved. And the consequence is apparently
just. For as all the faithful are the children of Abraham, and the
Divine promise of being a God to him and his seed is entailed upon them,
it implies their continued existence and happiness in a future state as
much as Abraham's. And as the body is an essential part of man, it
implies both his resurrection and theirs; and so overthrows the entire
scheme of the Sadducean doctrine.

[Luke 20:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 20:40</span></span>

They durst not ask him any question - The Sadducees durst not. One of
the scribes did, presently after.

[Luke 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 20:41</span></span>

12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md).

[Luke 20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 20:42</span></span>

[Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md).

[Luke 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 20:46</span></span>

[Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md).
