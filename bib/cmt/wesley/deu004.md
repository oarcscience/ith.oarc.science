------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Deuteronomy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 4:1</span></span>

The statutes - The laws which concern the worship and service of God.
The judgments - The laws concerning your duties to men. So these two
comprehend both tables, and the whole law of God.

[Deuteronomy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 4:6</span></span>

In the sight of the nations - For though the generality of Heathens in
the latter ages, did through inveterate prejudices condemn the laws of
the Hebrews, yet it is certain, the wisest Heathens did highly approve
of them, so that they made use of divers of them, and translated them
into their own laws and constitutions; and Moses, the giver of these
laws, hath been mentioned with great honour for his wisdom and learning
by many of them. And particularly the old Heathen oracle expressly said,
that the Chaldeans or Hebrews, who worshipped the uncreated God, were
the only wise men.

[Deuteronomy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 4:7</span></span>

So nigh - By glorious miracles, by the pledges of his special presence,
by the operations of his grace, and particularly by his readiness to
hear our prayers, and to give us those succours which we call upon him
for.

[Deuteronomy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 4:8</span></span>

So righteous - Whereby he implies that the true greatness of a nation
doth not consist in pomp or power, or largeness of empire, as commonly
men think, but in the righteousness of its laws.

[Deuteronomy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 4:10</span></span>

Thou stoodest - Some of them stood there in their own persons, though
then they were but young, the rest in the loins of their parents.

[Deuteronomy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 4:11</span></span>

The midst of heaven - Flaming up into the air, which is often called
heaven.

[Deuteronomy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 4:12</span></span>

No similitude - No resemblance or representation of God, whereby either
his essence, or properties, or actions were represented, such as were
usual among the Heathens.

[Deuteronomy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 4:14</span></span>

Statutes and judgments - The ceremonial and judicial laws which are here
distinguished from the moral, or the ten commandments.

[Deuteronomy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 4:15</span></span>

In Horeb - God, who in other places and times did appear in a similitude
in the fashion of a man, now in this most solemn appearance, when he
comes to give eternal laws for the direction of the Israelites in the
worship of God, and in their duty to men, purposely avoids all such
representations, to shew that he abhors all worship of images, or of
himself by images of what kind soever, because he is the invisible God,
and cannot be represented by any visible image.

[Deuteronomy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 4:16</span></span>

Lest ye corrupt yourselves - Your ways, by worshipping God in a corrupt
manner.

[Deuteronomy 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 4:19</span></span>

Driven - Strongly inclined. Which the Lord hath divided unto all nations
- Which are not Gods, but creatures, made not for the worship, but for
the use of men; yea, of the meanest and most barbarous people under
heaven, and therefore cannot without great absurdity be worshipped,
especially by you who are so much advanced above other nations in wisdom
and knowledge, and in this, that you are my peculiar people.

[Deuteronomy 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 4:24</span></span>

A consuming fire - A just and terrible God, who, notwithstanding his
special relation to thee, will severely punish thee, if thou provoke
him. A jealous God - Who being espoused to thee, will be highly incensed
against thee, (if thou follow after other lovers, or commit whoredom
with idols) and will bear no rival or partner.

[Deuteronomy 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 4:28</span></span>

Ye shall serve Gods - You shall be compelled by men, and given up by me
to idolatry. So that very thing which was your choice, shall be your
punishment: it being just and usual for God to punish one sin by giving
men up to another.

[Deuteronomy 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 4:29</span></span>

If from thence thou seek the Lord - Whatever place we are in, we may
from thence seek him. There is no part of the earth which has a gulf
fixt between it and heaven.

[Deuteronomy 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">deu 4:30</span></span>

In the latter days - In succeeding ages.

[Deuteronomy 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">deu 4:32</span></span>

The one side of heaven - That is, of the earth under heaven. Ask all the
inhabitants of the world.

[Deuteronomy 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">deu 4:33</span></span>

And live - And was not overwhelmed and consumed by such a glorious
appearance.

[Deuteronomy 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 4:34</span></span>

By temptations - Temptations is the general title, which is explained by
the following particulars, signs, and wonders, &c. which are called
temptations, because they were trials both to the Egyptians and
Israelites, whether they would be induced to believe and obey God or no.
By terrors - Raised in the minds of the Egyptians, or, by terrible
things done among them.

[Deuteronomy 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 4:37</span></span>

In his sight - Keeping his eye fixed upon him, as the father doth on his
beloved child.

[Deuteronomy 4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">deu 4:44</span></span>

This is the law - More punctually expressed in the following chapter, to
which these words are a preface.
