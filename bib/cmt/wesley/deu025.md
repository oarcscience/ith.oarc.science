### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 25:1</span></span>

Justify - Acquit him from guilt and false accusations, and free him from
punishment.

[Deuteronomy 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 25:2</span></span>

Beaten - Which the Jews say was the case of all those crimes which the
law commands to be punished, without expressing the kind or degree of
punishment. Before his face - That the punishment may be duly inflicted,
without excess or defect. And from this no person's rank or quality
exempted him, if he was a delinquent.

[Deuteronomy 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 25:3</span></span>

Forty stripes - It seems not superstition, but prudent caution, when the
Jews would not exceed thirty - nine stripes, lest through mistake or
forgetfulness they should go beyond their bounds, which they were
commanded to keep. Should seem vile - Should be made contemptible to his
brethren, either by this cruel usage of him, as if he were a brute
beast: or by the deformity or infirmity of body which excessive beating
might produce.

[Deuteronomy 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 25:4</span></span>

He treadeth out the corn - Which they did in those parts, either
immediately by their hoofs on by drawing carts or other instruments over
the corn. Hereby God taught them humanity, even to their beasts that
served them, and much more to their servants or other men who laboured
for them, especially to their ministers, [Co1
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009).

[Deuteronomy 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 25:5</span></span>

Together - In the same town, or at least country. For if the next
brother had removed his habitation into remote parts, on were carried
thither into captivity, then the wife of the dead had her liberty to
marry the next kinsman that lived in the same place with her. One - Any
of them, for the words are general, and the reason of the law was to
keep up the distinction of tribes and families, that so the Messiah
might be discovered by the family from which he was appointed to
proceed; and also of inheritances, which were divided among all the
brethren, the first - born having only a double portion. A stranger - To
one of another family.

[Deuteronomy 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 25:6</span></span>

That his name be not put out - That a family be not lost. So this was a
provision that the number of their families might not be diminished.

[Deuteronomy 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 25:9</span></span>

Loose his shoe - As a sign of his resignation of all his right to the
woman, and to her husband's inheritance: for as the shoe was a sign of
one's power and right, [Psa 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008), [Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009), so the parting with the shoe
was a token of the alienation of such right; and as a note of infamy, to
signify that by this disingenuous action he was unworthy to be amongst
free - men, and fit to be reduced to the condition of the meanest
servants, who used to go barefoot, [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002), [Isa
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#004).

[Deuteronomy 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 25:10</span></span>

His name - That is, his person, and his posterity also. So it was a
lasting blot.

[Deuteronomy 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 25:13</span></span>

A great and a small - The great to buy with, the small for selling.

[Deuteronomy 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 25:17</span></span>

Out of Egypt - Which circumstance greatly aggravates their sin, that
they should do thus to a people, who had been long exercised with sore
afflictions, to whom pity was due by the laws of nature and humanity,
and for whose rescue God had in so glorious a manner appeared, which
they could not be ignorant of. So this was barbarousness to Israel, and
setting the great Jehovah at defiance.
