### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 25:1</span></span>

Doubtless when Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and abode there
so long, he saw and heard glorious things, but they were things which
were not lawful or possible to utter; and therefore, in the records he
kept of the transactions there, he saith nothing to satisfy curiosity,
but writes that only which he was to speak to the children of Israel.
Probably there never was any house or temple built for sacred uses,
before this tabernacle was erected by Moses. In this God kept his court,
as Israel's king, and it was intended for a sign or token of his
presence, that while they had that in the midst of them they might never
again ask, Is the Lord among us or not? And because in the wilderness
they dwelt in tents, even this royal palace was ordered to be a
tabernacle too, that it might move with them. And these holy places made
with hands were the figures of the true, [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md). The gospel - church is the true
tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man, [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md). The body of Christ, in and by
which he made atonement, was the greater and more perfect tabernacle,
[Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md). The Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us, as in a tabernacle.

[Exodus 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 25:2</span></span>

Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering - This
offering was to be given willingly, and with the heart. It was not
prescribed to them what or how much they must give, but it was left to
their generosity, that they might shew their good - will to the house of
God, and the offices thereof.

[Exodus 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 25:4</span></span>

Blue, and purple, and scarlet - Materials of those colours.

[Exodus 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 25:5</span></span>

Shittim - wood - A kind of wood growing in Egypt and the deserts of
Arabia, very durable and precious.

[Exodus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 25:8</span></span>

A sanctuary - A place of public and solemn worship; that I may dwell
among them. Not by my essence, which is everywhere; but by my grace and
glorious operations.

[Exodus 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 25:9</span></span>

According to all that I shew thee - God shewed him an exact plan of it
in little, which he must conform to in all points. And God did not only
shew him the model, but gave him also particular directions how to frame
the tabernacle, according to that model, in all the parts of it. When
Moses was to describe the creation of the world, tho' it be such a
stately and curious fabrick, yet he gave a very short and general
account of it; but when he comes to describe the tabernacle, he doth it
with the greatest niceness and accuracy imaginable: for God's church and
instituted religion is more precious to him than all the rest of the
world. And the scriptures were written not to describe to us the works
of nature, (a general view of which is sufficient to lead us to the
knowledge of the Creator,) but to acquaint us with the methods of grace,
and those things which are purely matters of revelation.

[Exodus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 25:10</span></span>

The ark was a chest or coffer, in which the two tables of the law,
written with the finger of God, were to be deposited. If the Jewish
cubit was, as some learned men compute three inches longer than our half
- yard, (twenty one inches in all) this chest or cabinet was about fifty
- two inches long, thirty - one broad and thirty one deep; it was
overlaid within and without with thin plates of gold; it had a crown, or
cornish of gold round it; rings and staves to carry it with; and in it
he must put the testimony. The tables of the law are called the
testimony, because God did in them testify his will; his giving them
that law was in token of his favour to them, and their acceptance of it
was in token of their subjection to him. This law was a testimony to
them to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them
if they transgressed. The ark is called the ark of the testimony, [Exo
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#006.md), and the tabernacle, the
tabernacle of the testimony, [Num
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#011.md). The tables of the law were
carefully preserved in the ark, to teach us to make much of the word of
God, and to hide it in our inmost thoughts, as the ark was placed in the
holy of holies. It intimates likewise the care which divine providence
ever did, and ever will take to preserve the records of divine
revelation in the church, so that even in the latter days there shall be
seen in his temple the ark of his testament. See [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md).

[Exodus 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 25:17</span></span>

The mercy - seat was the covering of the ark, made exactly to fit the
dimensions of it. This propitiatory covering, as it might well be
translated, was a type of Christ the great propitiation, whose
satisfaction covers our transgressions, and comes between us and the
curse we deserve.

[Exodus 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 25:18</span></span>

The cherubim (Cherubim is the plural of Cherub, not Cherubims) were
fixed to the mercy - seat, and of a piece with it, and spread their
wings over it. It is supposed these were designed to represent the holy
angels, (who always attend the Shechinah, or divine majesty,) not by any
effigies of an angel, but some emblem of the angelical nature, probably
one or more of those four faces spoken of [Eze
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md). Whatever the faces were, they
looked one towards another, and both downwards towards the ark, while
their wings were stretched out so as to touch one another. It notes
their attendance upon the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will,
their presence in the assemblies of saints, [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md); [Co1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md), and their desire to look into
the mysteries of the gospel, which they diligently contemplate, [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md). God is said to dwell or sit
between the cherubim, on the mercy - seat, [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md), and from thence he here
promiseth for the future to meet with Moses, and to commune with him.
Thus he manifests himself, willing to keep up communion with us, by the
mediation of Christ.

[Exodus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 25:23</span></span>

This table was to stand not in the holy of holies, (nothing was in that
but the ark with its appurtenances) but in the outer part of the
tabernacle, called the sanctuary or holy place. This table was to be
always furnished with the shew - bread, or bread of faces, twelve
loaves, one for each tribe, set in two rows, six in a row. As the ark
signified God's being present with them, so the twelve loaves signified
their being presented to God. This bread was designed to be, a thankful
acknowledgment of God's goodness to them in giving them their daily
bread, a token of their communion with God; this bread on God's table
being made of the same corn as the bread on their own tables. And a type
of the spiritual provision which is made in the church, by the gospel of
Christ, for all that are made priests to our God.

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

This candlestick had many branches drawn from the main shaft, which had
not only bowls to put the oil and the kindled wick in for necessity, but
knops made in the form of a pomegranate and flowers for ornament. The
tabernacle had no windows, all its light was candle - light, which notes
the comparative darkness of that dispensation, while the sun of
righteousness was not as yet risen, nor had the day - star from on high
visited his church. Yet God left not himself without witness, nor them
without instruction; the commandment was a lamp, and the law a light,
and the prophets were branches from that lamp, which gave light in their
several ages. The church is still dark, as the tabernacle was, in
comparison with what it will be in heaven: but the word of God is the
candlestick, a light burning in a dark place.
