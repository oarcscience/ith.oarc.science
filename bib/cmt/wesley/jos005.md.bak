### [Joshua Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 5:1</span></span>

Amorites - These and the Canaanites are mentioned for all the rest, as
being the chief of them for number, and power, and courage. Westward -
This is added to distinguish them from the other Amorites, eastward from
Jordan, whom Moses had subdued. Canaanites - So the proper place of this
nation was on both sides of Jordan. The sea - The midland sea, all along
the coast of it, which was the chief seat of that people, though divers
colonies of them were come into, and settled in other places. Jordan -
Which was their bulwark on the east - side, where the Israelites were;
for it is very probable they had taken away all bridges near those
parts; and the Israelites having been so long in that neighbouring
country, and yet not making any attempt upon them, they were grown
secure; especially now, when Jordan swelled beyond its ordinary bounds;
and therefore they did not endeavour to hinder their passage. Melted -
They lost all their courage, and durst attempt nothing upon the
Israelites; not without God's special providence, that the Israelites
might quietly participate of the two great sacraments of their church,
circumcision and the passover, and thereby be prepared for their high
and hard work, and for the possession of the holy and promised land;
which would have been defiled by an uncircumcised people.

[Joshua 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 5:2</span></span>

At that time - As soon as ever they were come to Gilgal, which was on
the tenth day; and so this might be executed the eleventh day, and that
in the morning: on the thirteenth day they were sore of their wounds,
and on the fourteenth day they recovered, and at the even of that day
kept the passover. Make - Or, prepare, or make ready, as this word
sometimes used. As it was not necessary for those who had such knives
already to make others for that use; so it is not probable that such
were commanded to do so, but only to make them sharp and fit for that
work. The second time - He calleth this a second circumcision, not as if
these same persons had been circumcised before, but with respect to the
body of the people, where of one part had been circumcised before, and
the other at this time, which is called a second time, in relation to
some former time wherein they were circumcised, either, in Egypt, when
many of the people, who possibly for fear or favour of the Egyptians,
had neglected this duty, were by the command of Moses circumcised. Or at
Sinai, when they received the passover, [Num
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#005.md), which no uncircumcised person
might do.

[Joshua 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 5:3</span></span>

And circumcised - That is, he caused this to be done; and, because it
was to be done speedily, the passover approaching, it was necessary to
use many hands in it. Children of Israel - That is, such of them as were
uncircumcised. And, though it be not mentioned, it is more than
probable, that the Israelites beyond Jordan were circumcised at the same
time.

[Joshua 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 5:4</span></span>

Out of Egypt - This is to be restrained to such as were then above
twenty years old, and such as were guilty of that rebellion, Num.
14:1-25, as it is expressed below, [Jos
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md).

[Joshua 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 5:5</span></span>

Them - Either their parents, or the rulers of Israel, by Divine
permission and indulgence; because they were now on a journey, in which
case the passover also might be neglected, [Num
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010.md), [Num
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#013.md). Rather, it was a continued token
of God's displeasure against them, for their unbelief and murmuring: a
token that they should never have the benefit of that promise, whereof
circumcision was the seal.

[Joshua 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 5:6</span></span>

The people - The Hebrew word commonly signifies the Gentiles; so he
calls them, to note that they were unworthy the name of Israelites. Shew
them - That is, not give them so much as a sight of it, which he granted
to Moses, much less the possession.

[Joshua 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 5:7</span></span>

Circumcised - Which God would have done, As a testimony of God's
reconciliation to the people, and that he would not farther impute their
parents rebellion to them. Because the great impediment of circumcision
was now removed, their continued travels, and frequent and uncertain
removal. To prepare them for the approaching passover. To distinguish
them from the Canaanites, into whose land they were now come. To ratify
the covenant between God and them, whereof circumcision was a sign and
seal, to assure them that God would now make good his covenant, in
giving them this land; and to oblige them to perform all the duties to
which that covenant bound them, as soon as they came into Canaan, [Exo
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#025.md); [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md); [Num
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#002.md).

[Joshua 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 5:8</span></span>

Whole - Free from that pain and soreness which circumcision caused, it
was indeed an act of great faith, to expose themselves to so much pain
and danger too, in this place where they were hemmed in by Jordan and
their enemies.

[Joshua 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 5:9</span></span>

The reproach of Egypt - That is, uncircumcision, was both in truth, and
in the opinion of the Jews, a matter of great reproach, and although
this was a reproach common to most nations of the world, yet it is
particularly called the reproach of Egypt, either, because the other
neighbouring nations, being the children of Abraham by the concubines,
are supposed to have been circumcised, which the Egyptians at this time
were not, as may be gathered from [Exo
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#006.md), where they knew the child to be
an Hebrew by this mark. Or because they came out of Egypt, and were
esteemed to be a sort of Egyptians, [Num
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005.md), which they justly thought a
great reproach; but by their circumcision they were now distinguished
from them, and manifested to be another people. Or because many of them
lay under this reproach in Egypt, having wickedly neglected this duty
there for worldly reasons; and others of them continued in the same
shameful condition for many years in the wilderness. Gilgal - That is,
rolling.

[Joshua 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 5:10</span></span>

The passover - Which was their third passover: the first was in Egypt,
[Exo 12:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011.md), the second at mount
Sinai, [Num 9:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001.md), the third here; for
in their wilderness travels, these and all other sacrifices were
neglected, [Amo 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md). While they were
in the wilderness, they were denied the comfort of this ordinance, as a
farther token of God's displeasure. But now God comforted them again,
after the time that he had afflicted them.

[Joshua 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 5:11</span></span>

Old corn - The corn of the last year, which the inhabitants of those
parts had left in their barns, being fled into their strong cities, or
other remoter parts. The morrow - That is, on the sixteenth day; for the
passover was killed between the two evenings of the fourteenth day, and
was eaten in that evening or night, which, according to the Jewish
computation, whereby they begin their days at the evening, was a part of
the fifteenth day, all which was the feast of the passover; and so the
morrow of the sixteenth day, was the morrow after the passover, when
they were obliged to offer unto God the first sheaf, and then were
allowed to eat of the rest. Parched corn - Of that year's corn. which
was most proper for that use. Self - same day - Having an eager desire
to enjoy the fruits of the land. And this corn came very seasonably; for
after the passover, they were to keep the feast of unleavened bread,
which they could not do, when they had nothing but manna to live upon.

[Joshua 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 5:12</span></span>

The manna ceased - Which God now withheld, to shew that Manna was not an
ordinary production of nature, but an extraordinary and special gift of
God to supply their necessity. And because God would not be prodigal of
his favours, by working miracles where ordinary means were sufficient.
The morrow - That is, on the seventeenth day.

[Joshua 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 5:13</span></span>

By Jericho - Heb. In Jericho, that is, in the territory adjoining to it;
whither he went to view those parts, and discern the fittest places for
his attempt upon Jericho. A man - One in the appearance of a man. Drawn
- In readiness to fight, not, as Joshua thought, against him, but for
him and his people.

[Joshua 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 5:14</span></span>

As captain - I am the chief captain of this people, and will conduct and
assist thee and them in this great undertaking. Now this person is not a
created angel, but the son of God, who went along with the Israelites in
this expedition, as their chief and captain. And this appears, By his
acceptance of adoration here, which a created angel durst not admit of,
[Rev 22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md). Because the place was
made holy by his presence, [Jos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#015.md),
which was God's prerogative, [Exo 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005.md).
Because he is called the Lord, Heb. Jehovah, [Jos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#002.md). My Lord - I acknowledge thee for
my Lord and captain, and therefore wait for thy commands, which I am
ready to obey.

[Joshua 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 5:15</span></span>

From thy foot - In token of reverence and subjection. Holy - Consecrated
by my presence. The very same orders which God gave to Moses at the
bush, when he was sending him to bring Israel out of Egypt, he here
gives to Joshua, for the confirming his faith, that as he had been with
Moses, so he would be with him.
