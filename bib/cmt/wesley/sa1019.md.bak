### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 19:4</span></span>

Spake good - Which he could not do without hazard to himself. Herein
therefore he performed the duty of a true friend, and of a valiant man.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 19:6</span></span>

As the Lord, &c. - And without all doubt, he intended what he said,
feeling a real change in himself for the present. "God," says Mr. Henry,
"inclined the heart of Saul to hearken to the voice of Jonathan."

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 19:8</span></span>

And David, &c. - So David continues his good service, tho' it was ill
requited. They who are ill paid for doing good, yet must not be weary of
well doing, remembering how bountiful a benefactor God is, even to the
evil and unthankful.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 19:9</span></span>

The evil spirit - David's successes against the Philistines revived his
envy, and the devil watched the opportunity, as he had done before.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 19:13</span></span>

Goats hair - Or, put great goats hair upon his bolster; upon the head
and face of the image, which lay upon his bolster, that it might have
some kind of resemblance of David's head and hair, at least in a sick
man's bed, where there useth to be but a glimmering light. Covered it -
Upon pretence of his being sick, and needing some such covering.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 19:18</span></span>

To Samuel - Both for comfort and direction in his distress; and for
safety, supposing that Saul would be ashamed to execute his bloody
designs in the presence of so venerable a person as Samuel.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 19:20</span></span>

Over them - To instruct and direct them in those holy exercises. For
though they prophesied by Divine inspiration, yet they were both to
prepare themselves for it before hand, and to make good improvement of
it afterwards, in both which they needed Samuel's counsel and
assistance. And whereas some might falsely pretend to those raptures; or
the devil might transform himself into an angel of light, Samuel's
presence and judgment was necessary to prevent and to detect such
impostures. Besides, Samuel would by his present conjunction with them
in those holy exercises, encourage them, and stir up others to the
coveting of those gifts, and to the performance of such religious
duties. Prophesied - Being inspired by God as Balaam was; that being
wrapt up into such an extasy, their minds might be wholly taken off from
their design of seizing David.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 19:23</span></span>

The spirit - It came upon him in the way; whereas it came not upon his
messengers 'till they came to the place. Hereby God would convince Saul
of the vanity of his designs against David, and that in them he fought
against God himself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 19:24</span></span>

Lay down - Heb. fell, down upon the earth; for his mind being in an
extasy, he had not the use of his senses. God so ordering it, that David
might have an opportunity to escape. Naked - That is, stript of his
upper garments, as the word naked is often used; and it is here repeated
to signify how long he lay in that posture. Day and night - So God kept
him as it were in chains, 'till David was got out of his reach. Is Saul
- The same proverb which was used before, is here revived, as an
evidence of God's wonderful care over David; he made Saul in some sort a
prophet, that he mightst make David a king.
