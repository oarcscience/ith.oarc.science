### [Ezra Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 6:1</span></span>

A decree - To search the rolls in Babylon, where search was first made;
but not finding the edict there, they searched in Achmetha, or Ecbatana,
and found it.

[Ezra 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ezr 6:2</span></span>

Achmetha - The royal city of the Medes and Persians.

[Ezra 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 6:3</span></span>

Cubits - Those proportions differ from those of Solomon's temple, which
was but thirty cubits high, only the porch was a hundred and twenty
cubits high, and but twenty cubits in breadth. Either therefore
Solomon's cubits were sacred cubits, which were larger than the other,
and these but common cubits. Or, the sixty cubits of height are meant
only for the porch. And the word rendered breadth, may be rendered the
extension or the length of it; it being improbable that the king should
give orders about the breadth, and none about the length of it.

[Ezra 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ezr 6:12</span></span>

Destroy - Tho' this temple was at length most justly destroyed by the
righteous hand of God, yet perhaps the Romans, who were the instruments
of that destruction, felt the effects of this curse. For that empire
sensibly declined ever after, 'till it was wholly destroyed.

[Ezra 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 6:14</span></span>

Through the prophesying - This is a seasonable intimation that this
great and unexpected success was not to be ascribed to chance, or to the
kindness or good humour of Darius, but unto God only, who by his
prophets had required and encouraged them to proceed in the work, and by
his mighty power disposed Darius's heart to such kind and noble
purposes.

[Ezra 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 6:21</span></span>

Children of Israel - Probably some out of each of the twelve tribes.

[Ezra 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ezr 6:22</span></span>

Joyful - He had given them both cause to rejoice, and hearts to rejoice.
God is the fountain whence all the streams of true joy flow. Of Assyria
- Of the king of Persia, who was now king of Assyria also, here so
called emphatically, to note the great power and goodness of God in
turning the hearts of these great monarchs, whose predecessors had been
the chief persecutors and oppressors of God's people.
