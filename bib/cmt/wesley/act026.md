### [Acts Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001)

[Acts 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 26:1</span></span>

And Paul stretching forth his hand - Chained as it was: a decent
expression of his own earnestness, and proper to engage the attention of
his hearers; answered for himself - Not only refuting the accusations of
the Jews, but enlarging upon the faith of the Gospel.

[Acts 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 26:2</span></span>

King Agrippa - There is a peculiar force in thus addressing a person by
name. Agrippa felt this.

[Acts 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 26:3</span></span>

Who art accurately acquainted - Which Festus was not; with the customs -
In practical matters; and questions - In speculative. This word Festus
had used in the absence of Paul, [Act
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019), who, by the Divine leading,
repeats and explains it. Agrippa had had peculiar advantages for an
accurate knowledge of the Jewish customs and questions, from his
education under his father Herod, and his long abode at Jerusalem.
Nothing can be imagined more suitable or more graceful, than this whole
discourse of Paul before Agrippa; in which the seriousness of the
Christian, the boldness of the apostle, and the politeness of the
gentleman and the scholar, appear in a most beautiful contrast, or
rather a most happy union.

[Acts 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 26:4</span></span>

From my youth, which was from the beginning - That is, which was from
the beginning of my youth.

[Acts 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 26:5</span></span>

If they would testify - But they would not, for they well knew what
weight his former life must add to his present testimony.

[Acts 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 26:6</span></span>

And now - [Act 26:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006) are in a kind of
parenthesis, and show that what the Pharisees rightly taught concerning
the resurrection, Paul likewise asserted at this day. [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009)is connected with [Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005). For Pharisaism impelled him to
persecute. I stand in judgment for the hope of the promise - Of the
resurrection. So it was in effect. For unless Christ had risen, there
could have been no resurrection of the dead. And it was chiefly for
testifying the resurrection of Christ, that the Jews still persecuted
him.

[Acts 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 26:7</span></span>

Our twelve tribes - For a great part of the ten tribes also had at
various times returned from the east to their own country, [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001); [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001). Worshipping continually night and
day - That is, this is what they aim at in all their public and private
worship.

[Acts 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 26:8</span></span>

Is it judged by you an incredible thing - It was by Festus, [Act
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#019), to whom Paul answers as if he
had heard him discourse.

[Acts 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 26:9</span></span>

I thought - When I was a Pharisee: that I ought to do many things -
Which he now enumerates.

[Acts 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 26:10</span></span>

I shut up many of the saints - Men not only innocent, but good, just,
holy. I gave my vote against them - That is, I joined with those who
condemned them. Perhaps the chief priests did also give him power to
vote on these occasions.

[Acts 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 26:11</span></span>

I compelled them - That is, some of them; to blaspheme - This is the
most dreadful of all! Repent, ye enemies of the Gospel. If Spira, who
was compelled, suffered so terribly, what will become of those who
compel, like Saul, but do not repent like him.

[Acts 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 26:12</span></span>

[Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002).

[Acts 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 26:13</span></span>

O King - Most seasonably, in the height of the narration, does he thus
fix the king's attention. Above the brightness of the sun - And no
marvel. For what is the brightness of this created sun, to the Sun of
righteousness, the brightness of the Father's glory?

[Acts 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 26:14</span></span>

In the Hebrew tongue - St. Paul was not now speaking in Hebrew: when he
was, [Act 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#007), he did not add, In the
Hebrew tongue. Christ used this tongue both on earth and from heaven.

[Acts 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 26:17</span></span>

Delivering thee from the people - The Jews and the Gentiles, to whom,
both Jews and Gentiles, I now send thee - Paul gives them to know, that
the liberty he enjoys even in bonds, was promised to him, as well as his
preaching to the Gentiles. I, denotes the authority of the sender. Now,
the time whence his mission was dated. For his apostleship, as well as
his conversion, commenced at this moment.

[Acts 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 26:18</span></span>

To open - He opens them, who sends Paul; and he does it by Paul who is
sent; their eyes - Both of the Jews and Gentiles: that they may turn -
Through the power of the Almighty, from the spiritual darkness wherein
they were involved, to the light of Divine knowledge and holiness, and
from the power of Satan, who now holds them in sin, guilt, and misery,
to the love and happy service of God: that they may receive through
faith - (He seems to place the same blessings in a fuller light,)
pardon, holiness, and glory.

[Acts 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 26:19</span></span>

From that time - Having received power to obey, I was not disobedient -
I did obey, I used that power, [Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016). So that even this grace whereby
St Paul was influenced was not irresistible.

[Acts 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 26:20</span></span>

I declared - From that hour to this, both to Jew and Gentile, that they
should repent - This repentance, we may observe, is previous both to
inward and outward holiness.

[Acts 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 26:21</span></span>

For these things - The apostle now applies all that he had said.

[Acts 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 26:22</span></span>

Having obtained help from God - When all other help failed, God sent the
Romans from the castle, and so fulfilled the promise he had made, [Act
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017).

[Acts 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 26:24</span></span>

Festus said, Paul, thou art beside thyself - To talk of men's rising
from the dead! And of a Jew's enlightening not only his own nation, but
tho polite and learned Greeks and Romans! Nay, Festus, it is thou that
art beside thyself. That strikest quite wide of the mark. And no wonder:
he saw that nature did not act in Paul; but the grace that acted in him
he did not see. And therefore he took all this ardour which animated the
apostle for a mere start of learned phrensy.

[Acts 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 26:25</span></span>

I am not mad, most excellent Festus - The style properly belonging to a
Roman propretor. How inexpressibly beautiful is this reply! How strong!
yet how decent and respectful! Mad men seldom call men by their names,
and titles of honour. Thus also St. Paul refutes the charge. But utter
the words of truth (confirmed in the next verse) and sobriety - The very
reverse of madness. And both these remain, even when the men of God act
with the utmost vehemence.

[Acts 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 26:26</span></span>

For the king knoweth of these things - St. Paul having refuted Festus,
pursues his purpose, returning naturally, and as it were, step by step,
from Festus to Agrippa. To whom I speak with freedom - This freedom was
probably one circumstance which Festus accounted madness.

[Acts 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 26:27</span></span>

King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? - He that believes these,
believes Paul, yea, and Christ. The apostle now comes close to his
heart. What did Agrippa feel when he heard this? I know that thou
believest! - Here Paul lays so fast hold on the king that he can scarce
make any resistance.

[Acts 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 26:28</span></span>

Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian! - See here, Festus altogether a heathen, Paul alogether a
Christian, Agrippa halting between both. Poor Agrippa! But almost
persuaded! So near the mark, and yet fall short! Another step, and thou
art within the vail. Reader, stop not with Agrippa; but go on with Paul.

[Acts 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 26:29</span></span>

I would to God - Agrippa had spoke of being a Christian, as a thing
wholly in his own power. Paul gently corrects this mistake; intimating,
it is the gift and the work of God; that all that hear me - It was
modesty in St. Paul, not to apply directly to them all; yet he looks
upon them and observes them; were such as I am - Christians indeed; full
of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. He speaks from a
full sense of his own happiness, and an overflowing love to all.

[Acts 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 26:30</span></span>

And as he said this, the king rose up - An unspeakably precious moment
to Agrippa. Whether he duly improved it or no, we shall see in that day.

[Acts 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 26:31</span></span>

This man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds - They speak of his
whole life, not of one action only. And could ye learn nothing more than
this from that discourse? A favourable judgment of such a preacher, is
not all that God requires.
