### [Leviticus Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 12:1</span></span>

From uncleanness contracted by the touching or eating of external
things, he now comes to that uncleanness which ariseth from ourselves.

[Leviticus 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 12:2</span></span>

Seven days - Not for any filthiness which was either in the conception,
or in bringing forth, but to signify the universal and deep pollution of
man's nature, even from the birth, and from the conception. Seven days
or thereabouts, nature is employed in the purgation of most women. Her
infirmity - Her monthly infirmity. And it may note an agreement
therewith not only in the time, [Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md), but in the degree of
uncleanness.

[Leviticus 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 12:4</span></span>

In the blood of her purifying - In her polluted and separated estate;
for the word blood or bloods signifies both guilt, and uncleanness, as
here and elsewhere. And it is called the blood of her purifying, because
by the expulsion or purgation of that blood, which is done by degrees,
she is purified. No hallowed thing - She shall not eat any part of the
peace - offerings which she or her husband offered, which otherwise she
might have done; and, if she be a priest's wife, she shall not eat any
of the tythes or first fruits, or part of the hallowed meats, which at
other times she together with her husband might eat.

[Leviticus 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 12:5</span></span>

Threescore and six days - The time in both particulars is double to the
former, not so much from natural causes, as to put an honour upon the
sacrament of circumcision, which being administered to the males, did
put an end to that pollution sooner than otherwise had been.

[Leviticus 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 12:6</span></span>

For a son or a daughter - For the birth of a son, or of a daughter: but
the purification was for herself, as appears from the following verses.
A sin - offering - Because of her ceremonial uncleanness, which required
a ceremonial expiation.

[Leviticus 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 12:8</span></span>

The morality of this law obliges women who have received mercies from
God in child - bearing, with all thankfulness to acknowledge his
goodness to them, owning themselves unworthy of it, and (which is the
best purification) to continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with
sobriety.
