### [Joshua Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)

[Joshua 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 19:1</span></span>

Within the inheritance of Judah - This was so ordered by God's
providence, partly to fulfil that threatning that he would divide and
scatter this tribe in Israel, [Gen
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007), which was hereby done in part,
because they had no distinct lot, but were as inmates to Judah; partly,
because now upon the more exact survey of the land, it appeared, that
the part given to Judah did far exceed the proportion which they needed,
or which the other tribes could expect. And this was the least of the
tribes, [Num 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#014), and therefore
fittest to be put within another tribe.

[Joshua 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 19:11</span></span>

Toward the sea - The lot of this tribe was washed by the midland sea on
the west, and by the sea of Tiberias on the east, answering Jacob's
prophecy, Zebulun shall be an haven of ships; trading ships on the great
sea, and fishing ships on the sea of Galilee. Before Jokneam - Supposed
to be Kishon.

[Joshua 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 19:15</span></span>

Beth - lehem - Not that where Christ was born, which was in Judah, but
another. Twelve cities - There are more numbered here, but the rest
either were not cities properly so called, or were not within this
tribe, but only bordering upon it, and belonging to other tribes.

[Joshua 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 19:18</span></span>

Jezreel - The royal city, [Kg1 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#001).
This tribe, because it lay between Benjamin on the south, and Zebulun on
the north, is not here described by its borders, which were the same
with theirs; but by some of its cities.

[Joshua 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 19:26</span></span>

Carmel west - ward - Or, Carmel by the sea, to distinguish it from
Carmel in the tribe of Judah. This was a place of eminent fruitfulness,
agreeable to the prophecy concerning Asher, [Gen
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020).

[Joshua 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 19:27</span></span>

Cubal - A city so called. Left hand - That is, on the north, which, when
men look towards the east, as is usual, is on their left hand.

[Joshua 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 19:28</span></span>

Kenah - Namely, Kenah the greater, in the upper Galilee; not Kenah the
less, which was in the lower Galilee. Zidon - Called great for its
antiquity, and riches, and glory. The city either was not given to the
Israelites, or at least was never possessed by them; not without a
singular providence of God, that they might not by the opportunity of so
good a port, be engaged in much commerce with other nations; from which,
together with wealth, that great corrupter of mankind, they might
contract their errors and vices.

[Joshua 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 19:29</span></span>

To Ramah - From the north southward. To Tyre - Exclusively, for this
city was no part of the land given them. But this was not the same city
we read of afterwards. For that was built on an island, this on the
continent. Probably into these strong holds Tyre and Sidon, many of the
Canaanites fled, when Joshua invaded them.

[Joshua 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 19:30</span></span>

Twenty two cities - Here are more named, but some of them were not
within this tribe, but only bordering places.

[Joshua 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 19:33</span></span>

Their coast - Their northern border drawn from west to east, as appears,
because when this coast is described and brought to its end, the coast
is said to turn from the east westward, [Jos
19:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#034). The out - goings - The end of
that coast.

[Joshua 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 19:35</span></span>

Cinnereth - Whence the lake of Cinnereth or Genesareth received its
name.

[Joshua 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">jos 19:41</span></span>

Of their inheritance - Which is here described only by its cities, not
its borders, which are in part the same with Judah's, and their
inheritance is in good part taken out of Judah's too large portion; as
appears from divers of the cities here mentioned, which are also
reckoned in Judah's portion.

[Joshua 19:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">jos 19:47</span></span>

Went up to fight - This was done after Joshua's death, and seems to be
here inserted, that all the chief places where the Danites dwelt, tho'
far distant, might be mentioned together; and to give an account of this
strange accident, why they removed from their appointed portion to so
remote a place; which may be this, that being much molested by their bad
neighbours, they thought fit to go to some place remote from them, which
also they were in a manner constrained to do, because otherwise they
must have taken some part of the portions of other tribes, whereas now
going to the very utmost northern point of the land, they took that
which did not belong to any other tribe.

[Joshua 19:49](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">jos 19:49</span></span>

The children of Israel - That is, they are said to give it, because the
whole land was given to Joshua, and Eleazar, and the princes, as joint
trustees, acting in the name, and for the good of the people: so that
even Joshua could take nothing without their gift.

[Joshua 19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jos 19:50</span></span>

The word of The Lord - As God had promised, or commanded; either
formerly, or at this time by Eleazar. He built - That is, repaired and
enlarged it, in which sense Nebuchadnezzar is said to have built
Babylon, [Dan 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030).
