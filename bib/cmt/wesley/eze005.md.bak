### [Ezekiel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 5:1</span></span>

Take - Thus foretel the mourning, reproach, and deformity that are
coming, for all this is signified by shaving the head and beard.

[Ezekiel 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 5:2</span></span>

A third part - Described on the tile, [Eze
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md), a type of what should be done in
Jerusalem. The days - When the three hundred and ninety days of thy
lying against the portrayed city shall be ended. With a knife - To
signify them that fall by the sword. Scatter - To typify them that fell
to the Chaldeans, or fled to Egypt, or other countries.

[Ezekiel 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 5:3</span></span>

Take - Of the last third. Bind - As men tied up in the skirt of their
garment what they would not lose: to signify the small remnant.

[Ezekiel 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 5:4</span></span>

Of them - Out of that little remnant. In the fire - For their sin
against God, their discontents at their state, and conspiracies against
their governor, another fire shall break out which shall devour the
most, and be near consuming all the houses of Israel.

[Ezekiel 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 5:5</span></span>

This is Jerusalem - This portrayed city, is typically Jerusalem. The
midst - Jerusalem was set in the midst of the nations, to be as the
heart in the body, to invigorate the dead world with a divine life, as
well as to enlighten the dark world with a divine light.

[Ezekiel 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 5:6</span></span>

More - More than the heathen.

[Ezekiel 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 5:7</span></span>

Multiplied - In idols, superstitions, and wickedness. Neither - You have
exceeded them in superstition and idolatry, and fallen short of them in
moral virtues.

[Ezekiel 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 5:9</span></span>

Not done - Though the old world perished by water, and Sodom by fire,
yet neither one or other was so lingering a death.

[Ezekiel 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 5:10</span></span>

Scatter - This was verified when they were fetched away, who were left
at the departure of the besiegers, and when the very small remnant with
Johanan fled into Egypt.

[Ezekiel 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 5:11</span></span>

Sanctuary - My temple. Detestable things - Thy idols.

[Ezekiel 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 5:13</span></span>

Comforted - In executing my vengeance. In my zeal - For my own glory.

[Ezekiel 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 5:15</span></span>

Taunt - A very proverb among them. Instruction - Sinners shall learn by
thy miseries, what they may expect from me.

[Ezekiel 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 5:17</span></span>

Bereave thee - Of your children, friends, and your own life. Pestilence
and blood - Thy land shall be the common road for pestilence and blood.
Tho' this prophecy was to be accomplished presently, in the destruction
of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; yet it may well be supposed to look
forward, to the final destruction of it by the Romans, when God made a
full end of the Jewish nation, and caused his fury to rest upon them.
