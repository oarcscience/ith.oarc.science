### [1 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 10:1</span></span>

The men of Israel fled, &c. - Thus princes sin and the people suffer for
it. No doubt there was enough in them to deserve it. But that which
divine justice had chiefly an eye to, was the sin of Saul. Great men
should in an especial manner, take heed of provoking God's wrath. For if
they kindle that fire, they know not how many may be consumed by it for
their sakes.

[1 Chronicles 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 10:6</span></span>

His house - All his children, then present with him, namely, his three
sons, for Ishbosheth and Mephiboshieth were not slain.

[1 Chronicles 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 10:10</span></span>

Temple of Dagon - If we give not God the glory of our successes, even
Philistines will rise up in judgment with us and condemn us. Shall Dagon
have so great a place in their triumphs, and the true God be forgotten
in ours?

[1 Chronicles 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 10:12</span></span>

Seven days - Every day 'till evening, after the manner of the Jewish
fasts.

[1 Chronicles 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 10:13</span></span>

The word - Against God's express command: which is a great aggravation
of any sin. Familiar spirit - Which also was contrary to a manifest
command, [Lev 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031).

[1 Chronicles 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 10:14</span></span>

Enquired not - He did in some sort, but not in a right manner, not
humbly and penitently, not diligently and importunately, not patiently
and perseveringly. Nor 'till he was brought to the last extremity. And
then it was too late.
