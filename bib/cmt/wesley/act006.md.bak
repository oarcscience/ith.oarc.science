### [Acts Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)

[Acts 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 6:1</span></span>

There arose a murmuring - Here was the first breach made on those who
were before of one heart and of one soul. Partiality crept in unawares
on some; and murmuring on others. Ah Lord! how short a time did pure,
genuine, undefiled Christianity remain in the world! O the depth! How
unsearchable are thy counsels! Marvellous are thy ways, O King of
saints! The Hellenists were Jews born out of Palestine. They were so
called, because they used the Greek as their in other tongue. In this
partiality of the Hebrews, and murmuring of the Hellenists, were the
needs of a general persecution sown. Did God ever, in any age or
country, withdraw his restraining providence, and let loose the world
upon the Christians, till there was a cause among themselves? Is not an
open, general persecution, always both penal and medicinal? A punishment
of those that will not accept of milder reproofs, as well as a medicine
to heal their sickness? And at the same time a means both of purifying
and strengthening those whose heart is still right with God.

[Acts 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 6:2</span></span>

It is not right that we should leave the word of God and serve tables -
In the first Church, the primary business of apostles, evangelists, and
bishops, was to preach the word of God; the secondary, to take a kind of
paternal care (the Church being then like a family,) for the food,
especially of the poor, the strangers, and the widows. Afterward, the
deacons of both sexes were constituted for this latter business. And
whatever time they had to spare from this, they employed in works of
spiritual mercy. But their proper office was, to take care of the poor.
And when some of them afterward preached the Gospel, they did this not
by virtue of their deaconship, but of another commission, that of
evangelists, which they probably received, not before, but after they
were appointed deacons. And it is not unlikely that others were chosen
deacons, or stewards, in their room, when any of these commenced
evangelists.

[Acts 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 6:3</span></span>

Of good report - That there may be no room to suspect them of partiality
or injustice. Full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom - For it is not a light
matter to dispense even the temporal goods of the Church. To do even
this well, a large measure both of the gifts and grace of God is
requisite. Whom we will set over this business - It would have been
happy for the Church, had its ordinary ministers in every age taken the
same care to act in concert with the people committed to their charge,
which the apostles themselves, extraordinary as their office was, did on
this and other occasions.

[Acts 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 6:4</span></span>

We will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word -
This is doubtless the proper business of a Christian bishop: to speak to
God in prayer; to men in preaching his word, as an ambassador for
Christ.

[Acts 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 6:5</span></span>

And they chose - It seems seven Hellenists, as their names show. And
Nicholas a proselyte - To whom the proselytes would the more readily
apply.

[Acts 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 6:7</span></span>

And the word of God grew - The hinderances being removed.

[Acts 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 6:9</span></span>

There arose certain of the synagogue which is called - It was one and
the same synagogue which consisted of these several nations. Saul of
Cilicia was doubtless a member of it; whence it is not at all
improbable, that Gamaliel presided over it. Libertines - So they were
styled, whose fathers were once slaves, and afterward made free. This
was the ease of many Jews who had been taken captive by the Romans.

[Acts 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 6:14</span></span>

We have heard him say - So they might. But yet the consequence they drew
would not follow.

[Acts 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 6:15</span></span>

As the face of an angel - Covered with supernatural lustre. They
reckoned his preaching of Jesus to be the Christ was destroying Moses
and the law; and God bears witness to him, with the same glory as he did
to Moses, when he gave the law by him.
