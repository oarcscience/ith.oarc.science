### [1 Corinthians Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 14:1</span></span>

Follow after love - With zeal, vigour, courage, patience; else you can
neither attain nor keep it. And - In their place, as subservient to
this. Desire spiritual gifts; but especially that ye may prophesy - The
word here does not mean foretelling things to come; but rather opening
and applying the scripture.

[1 Corinthians 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 14:2</span></span>

He that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaks, in effect, not to men, but
to God - Who alone understands him.

[1 Corinthians 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 14:4</span></span>

Edifieth himself - Only, on the most favourable supposition. The church
- The whole congregation.

[1 Corinthians 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 14:5</span></span>

Greater - That is, more useful. By this alone are we to estimate all our
gifts and talents.

[1 Corinthians 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 14:6</span></span>

Revelation - Of some gospel mystery. Knowledge - Explaining the ancient
types and prophecies. Prophecy - Foretelling some future event. Doctrine
- To regulate your tempers and lives. Perhaps this may be the sense of
these obscure words.

[1 Corinthians 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 14:7</span></span>

How shall it be known what is piped or harped - What music can be made,
or what end answered?

[1 Corinthians 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 14:8</span></span>

Who will prepare himself for the battle - Unless he understand what the
trumpet sounds? suppose a retreat or a march.

[1 Corinthians 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 14:9</span></span>

Unless ye utter by the tongue - Which is miraculously given you. Words
easy to be understood - By your hearers. Ye will speak to the air - A
proverbial expression. Will utterly lose your labour.

[1 Corinthians 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 14:11</span></span>

I shall be a barbarian to him - Shall seem to talk unintelligible
gibberish.

[1 Corinthians 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 14:13</span></span>

That he may be able to interpret - Which was a distinct gift.

[1 Corinthians 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 14:14</span></span>

If I pray in an unknown tongue - The apostle, as he did at [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006.md), transfers it to himself. My
spirit prayeth - By the power of the Spirit I understand the words
myself. But my understanding is unfruitful - The knowledge I have is no
benefit to others.

[1 Corinthians 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 14:15</span></span>

I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the understanding also
- I will use my own understanding, as well as the power of the Spirit. I
will not act so absurdly, as to utter in a congregation what can edify
none but myself.

[1 Corinthians 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 14:16</span></span>

Otherwise how shall he that filleth the place of a private person - That
is, any private hearer. Say Amen - Assenting and confirming your words,
as it was even then usual for the whole congregation to do.

[1 Corinthians 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 14:19</span></span>

With my understanding - In a rational manner; so as not only to
understand myself, but to be understood by others.

[1 Corinthians 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 14:20</span></span>

Be not children in understanding - This is an admirable stroke of true
oratory! to bring down the height of their spirits, by representing that
wherein they prided themselves most, as mere folly and childishness. In
wickedness be ye infants - Have all the innocence of that tender age.
But in understanding be ye grown men - Knowing religion was not designed
to destroy any of our natural faculties, but to exalt and improve them,
our reason in particular.

[1 Corinthians 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 14:21</span></span>

It is written in the Law - The word here, as frequently, means the Old
Testament. In foreign tongues will I speak to this people - And so he
did. He spake terribly to them by the Babylonians, when they had set at
nought what he had spoken by the prophets, who used their own language.
These words received a farther accomplishment on the day of pentecost.
[Isa 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 14:22</span></span>

Tongues are intended for a sign to unbelievers - To engage their
attention, and convince them the message is of God. Whereas prophecy is
not so much for unbelievers, as for the confirmation of them that
already believe.

[1 Corinthians 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 14:23</span></span>

Yet - Sometimes prophecy is of more use, even to unbelievers, than
speaking with tongues. For instance: If the whole church be met together
- On some extraordinary occasion. It is probable, in so large a city,
they ordinarily met in several places. And there come in ignorant
persons - Men of learning might have understood the tongues in which
they spoke. It is observable, St. Paul says here, ignorant persons or
unbelievers; but in the next verse, an unbeliever or an ignorant person.
Several bad men met together hinder each other by evil discourse. Single
persons are more easily gained.

[1 Corinthians 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 14:24</span></span>

He is convicted by all - who speak in their turns, and speak to the
heart of the hearers. He is judged by all - Every one says something to
which his conscience bears witness.

[1 Corinthians 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 14:25</span></span>

The secrets of his heart are made manifest - Laid open, clearly
described; in a manner which to him is most astonishing and utterly
unaccountable. How many instances of it are seen at this day! So does
God still point his word.

[1 Corinthians 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 14:26</span></span>

What a thing is it, brethren - This was another disorder among them.
Every one hath a psalm - That is, at the same time one begins to sing a
psalm; another to deliver a doctrine; another to speak in an unknown
tongue; another to declare what has been revealed to him; another to
interpret what the former is speaking; every one probably gathering a
little company about him, just as they did in the schools of the
philosophers. Let all be done to edification - So as to profit the
hearers.

[1 Corinthians 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 14:27</span></span>

By two or three at most - Let not above two or three speak at one
meeting. And that by course - That is, one after another. And let one
interpret - Either himself, [Co1
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#013.md); or, if he have not the gift,
some other, into the vulgar tongue. It seems, the gift of tongues was an
instantaneous knowledge of a tongue till then unknown, which he that
received it could afterwards speak when he thought fit, without any new
miracle.

[1 Corinthians 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 14:28</span></span>

Let him speak - That tongue, if he find it profitable to himself in his
private devotions.

[1 Corinthians 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 14:29</span></span>

Let two or three of the prophets - Not more, at one meeting. Speak - One
after another, expounding the scripture.

[1 Corinthians 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 14:31</span></span>

All - Who have that gift. That all may learn - Both by speaking and by
hearing.

[1 Corinthians 14:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 14:32</span></span>

For the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets - But what
enthusiast considers this? The impulses of the Holy Spirit, even in men
really inspired, so suit themselves to their rational faculties, as not
to divest them of the government of themselves, like the heathen priests
under their diabolical possession. Evil spirits threw their prophets
into such ungovernable ecstasies, as forced them to speak and act like
madmen. But the Spirit of God left his prophets the clear use of their
judgment, when, and how long, it was fit for them to speak, and never
hurried them into any improprieties either as to the matter, manner, or
time of their speaking.

[1 Corinthians 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 14:34</span></span>

Let your women be silent in the churches - Unless they are under an
extraordinary impulse of the Spirit. For, in other cases, it is not
permitted them to speak - By way of teaching in public assemblies. But
to be in subjection - To the man whose proper office it is to lead and
to instruct the congregation. [Gen
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md).

[1 Corinthians 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">co1 14:35</span></span>

And even if they desire to learn anything - Still they are not to speak
in public, but to ask their own husbands at home - That is the place,
and those the persons to inquire of.

[1 Corinthians 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">co1 14:36</span></span>

Are ye of Corinth either the first or the only Christians? If not,
conform herein to the custom of all the churches.

[1 Corinthians 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">co1 14:37</span></span>

Or spiritual - Endowed with any extraordinary gift of the Spirit. Let
him - Prove it, by acknowledging that I now write by the Spirit.

[1 Corinthians 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">co1 14:38</span></span>

Let him be ignorant - Be it at his own peril.

[1 Corinthians 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">co1 14:39</span></span>

Therefore - To sum up the whole.

[1 Corinthians 14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">co1 14:40</span></span>

Decently - By every individual. In order - By the whole church.
