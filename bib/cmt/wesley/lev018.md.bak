### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 18:2</span></span>

Your God - Your sovereign, and lawgiver. This is often repeated because
the things here forbidden were practised and allowed by the gentiles, to
whose custom he opposes divine authority and their obligation to obey
his commands.

[Leviticus 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 18:3</span></span>

Egypt and Canaan - These two nations he mentions, because their
habitation and conversation among them made their evil example in the
following matters more dangerous. But under them he includes all other
nations.

[Leviticus 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 18:4</span></span>

My judgments - Though you do not see the particular reason of some of
them, and though they be contrary to the laws and usages of the other
nations.

[Leviticus 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 18:5</span></span>

He shall live in them - Not only happily here, but eternally hereafter.
This is added as a powerful argument why they should follow God's
commands, rather than mens examples, because their life and happiness
depend upon it. And though in strictness, and according to the covenant
of works they could not challenge life for so doing, except their
obedience was universal, perfect, constant and perpetual, and therefore
no man since the fall could be justified by the law, yet by the covenant
of grace this life is promised to all that obey God's commands
sincerely.

[Leviticus 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 18:6</span></span>

To uncover their nakedness - I think Mr. Free has made it highly
probable, that this phrase does not mean marriage, but fornication,
throughout this chapter. So it unquestionably means in the twentieth
chapter.

[Leviticus 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 18:16</span></span>

Thy brother's wife - God afterwards commanded, that in one case, a man
should marry his brother's widow.

[Leviticus 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 18:18</span></span>

Thou shalt not take a wife to her sister - Perhaps this text doth not
simply forbid the taking one wife to another, but the doing it in such a
manner or for such an end, that he may vex or punish, or revenge himself
of the former; which probably was a common motive amongst that
hardhearted people to do so.

[Leviticus 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 18:19</span></span>

As long as she is set apart - No not to thy own wife. This was not only
a ceremonial pollution, but an immorality also, whence it is put amongst
gross sins, [Eze 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md). And therefore
it is now unlawful under the gospel.

[Leviticus 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 18:21</span></span>

Pass through fire - This was done, either by burning them in the fire,
or by making them pass between two great fires, which was a kind of
consecration of them to that God. Moloch - Called also Milcom, was an
idol chiefly of the Ammonites. He seems to be the Saturn of the
heathens, to whom especially children and men were sacrificed. This is
mentioned, because the neighbours of Israel were most infected with this
idolatry, and therefore they are particularly cautioned against it,
though under this one instance all other idols and acts, or kinds of
idolatry, are manifestly comprehended and forbidden.

[Leviticus 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lev 18:25</span></span>

I visit - I am about to visit, that is, to punish.

[Leviticus 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 18:26</span></span>

Nor any stranger - In nation or religion, of what kind soever. For
though they might not force them to submit to their religion, yet they
might restrain them from the publick contempt of the Jewish laws, and
from the violation of natural laws, which, besides the offence against
God and nature, were matters of evil example to the Israelites
themselves.

[Leviticus 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 18:29</span></span>

Cut off - This phrase therefore of cutting off, is to be understood
variously, either of ecclesiastical, or civil punishment, according to
the differing natures of the offences for which it is inflicted.
