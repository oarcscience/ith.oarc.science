### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 5:1</span></span>

For judgment - God's controversy is with you all. A snare - You, O
priests and princes, have ensnared the people by your examples. Mizpah -
By idolatries acted at Mizpah, a part of Libanus. On Tabor - Here, as in
Mizpah, idolatry catched men as birds are taken in a net.

[Hosea 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 5:2</span></span>

The revolters - All those that have cast off the law of God. Profound -
Dig deep to hide their counsels, and to slay the innocent. Though I -
Hosea.

[Hosea 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 5:5</span></span>

Doth testify - Is an evident witness against him.

[Hosea 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 5:6</span></span>

To seek the Lord - The Jewish doctors tell us, that under Hosea, Israel
had liberty of bringing their sacrifices to Jerusalem. Shall not find
him - God will not be found of them. Hath withdrawn himself - For their
impenitency.

[Hosea 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 5:7</span></span>

Have begotten - They have trained up their children in the same
idolatry. A month - Possibly it may refer to Shallum's short time of
usurpation, which lasted but a month; the Assyrians shall make a speedy
conquest over you. With their portions - With all their substance.

[Hosea 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 5:8</span></span>

Blow ye - Ye watchmen, sound the alarm, the enemy cometh. After thee, O
Benjamin - After thy cries. After thee, O Beth - aven, let Benjamin also
cry aloud: for they shall also fall for their sin.

[Hosea 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 5:9</span></span>

Ephraim - The whole kingdom of the ten tribes. Rebuke - When Salmaneser
shall besiege, sack and captivate all thy cities, rebuked for their
sins. Of Israel - To the house of Israel openly. Made known - By my
prophets.

[Hosea 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 5:10</span></span>

The bound - The ancient bounds which limited every one, and prevented
the encroaching of covetous men. Like water - Like an overflowing flood.

[Hosea 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 5:11</span></span>

Ephraim - The ten tribes are by seditions, civil wars, unjust sentences,
and bloody conspiracies eaten up already. After the commandment - To
forbear going to the temple, and to worship the calves at Dan and
Bethel, as Jeroboam the son of Nebat commanded.

[Hosea 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 5:12</span></span>

A moth - Moths leisurely eat up our clothes; so God was then, and had
been, from Jeroboam's death, weakening the ten tribes. As rottenness -
Secretly consuming them.

[Hosea 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 5:13</span></span>

His sickness - Weakness, like a consumption, threatening death. Then
went - Made application. The Assyrian - Particularly to Israel or Pul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 5:14</span></span>

Will tear - Divine vengeance by the Assyrians, shall be as a lion
tearing his prey.
