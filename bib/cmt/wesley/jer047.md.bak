### [Jeremiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 47:1</span></span>

Before - In the time of the Philistines prosperity.

[Jeremiah 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 47:4</span></span>

The day - Which God hath set, and appointed for their ruin. Caphtor -
Tyre and Sidon were neighbours to the Philistines, and so were often
called to their help. The Philistines and Caphtorim were related, for
their first progenitors, Philistim and Caphtorim, were both the sons of
Mizriam the son of Ham, one of the sons of Noah.

[Jeremiah 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 47:5</span></span>

The remnant - Those who lived in the valleys near Ashkelon. But thyself
- Why will you afflict yourselves, when all your mourning will do you no
good.

[Jeremiah 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 47:6</span></span>

O thou sword - Perhaps they are the words of the prophet, lamenting the
havock which he made among the Philistines by the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 47:7</span></span>

How - God lets the prophet know that he had given this sword its
commission, and therefore it could not stop 'till Ashkelon and the
people on the sea - shore were destroyed by it.
