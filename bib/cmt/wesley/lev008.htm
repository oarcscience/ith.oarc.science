<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#003">Leviticus 8:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">lev 8:3</A></FONT></span></p>All the congregation - The elders who represented all, and as many of the people as would, and could get thither, that all might be witnesses both of Aaron's commission from God, and of his work and business. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#012">Leviticus 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">lev 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>He poured - In a plentiful manner, as appears from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#002">Psa 133:2</A>, whereas other persons and things were only sprinkled with it: because his unction was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. A measure of the same anointing is given to all believers. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#014">Leviticus 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">lev 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>The bullock - There were indeed seven bullocks to be offered at his consecration, one every day; but here he mentions only one, because he here describes only the work of the first day. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#017">Leviticus 8:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">lev 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>His hide - Which in the offerings for the people was not burnt, but given to the priest. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#018">Leviticus 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">lev 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>He brought the ram - Hereby they gave to God the glory of this great honour which was put upon them: and also signified the devoting themselves and all their service to God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#019">Leviticus 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">lev 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>He - Either Moses, as in the following clause, or some other person by his appointment; which may be the reason why he is not named here, as he is to the sprinkling of the blood, which was an action more proper to the priest, and more essential to the sacrifice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029">Leviticus 8:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">lev 8:29</A></FONT></span></p>Moses's part - Who at this time administering the priest's office was to receive the priest's wages. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#031">Leviticus 8:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">lev 8:31</A></FONT></span></p>The flesh - That which was left of the ram, and particularly the breast, which was said to be Moses's part, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#029">Lev 8:29</A>, and by him was given to Aaron, that he and his sons might eat of it, in token that they and only they should have the right to do so for the future. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033">Leviticus 8:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">lev 8:33</A></FONT></span></p>Seven days - In each of which the same ceremonies were to be repeated, and other rites to be performed. He - Either God or Moses; for the words may be spoken by Moses, either in God's name or in his own; Moses speaking of himself in the third person, which is very common in scripture. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#036">Leviticus 8:36</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">lev 8:36</A></FONT></span></p>So Aaron and his sons did all things - And thus the covenant of life and peace, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005">Mal 2:5</A>, was made with them. But after all the ceremonies used in their consecration, one point was reserved for the honour of Christ's priesthood. They were made priests without an oath; but Christ with an oath, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021">Heb 7:21</A>. For neither these priests, nor their priesthood was to continue. But His is a perpetual and unchangeable priesthood.
