### [Daniel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 6:2</span></span>

Daniel was first - Belshazzar's promise to Daniel was, that he should be
the third ruler in the kingdom, [Dan
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#007.md), [Dan
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#016.md), [Dan
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#029.md). The first was general of the
army, the second president of the palace, the third of the land and
provinces.

[Daniel 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 6:4</span></span>

Concerning the kingdom - And so to have made him guilty of treason, or
other high misdemeanors, in the king's business.

[Daniel 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 6:10</span></span>

Toward Jerusalem - The temple was the place where the Lord placed his
name, and promised to appear, and accept his people, all being a type of
Christ, through whom only sinners are accepted. As he did aforetime - He
did not abate his prayers for the king's command, nor did he break the
law purposely, because he did no more than he was wont to do in serving
his God.

[Daniel 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 6:14</span></span>

Displeased with himself - For having made that foolish decree. To
deliver him - To find out some way of delivering him.

[Daniel 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 6:20</span></span>

Able to deliver - What he doubted of, we are sure of, that the servants
of the living God, have a master who is able to deliver them and bear
them out in his service.

[Daniel 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 6:22</span></span>

His angel - The same that was with the three children in the fiery
furnace, whose presence made even the lion's den a strong - hold, his
palace, his paradise. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures!
See the care God takes of his faithful servants, especially when they
are called to suffer for him! See how ready the angels are to minister
to the heirs of salvation!

[Daniel 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 6:25</span></span>

In all the earth - In all that great empire. It is usual with the Turk,
Tartar, Chinese, to arrogate the same universality.
