### [Daniel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)

[Daniel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 9:1</span></span>

In the first year of Darius - That is, immediately after the overthrow
of the kingdom of Babylon, which was the year of the Jews deliverance
from captivity. Of the Medes - This Darius was not Darius the Persian,
under whom the temple was built, as some have asserted, to invalidate
the credibility of this book; but Darius the Mede, who lived in the time
of Daniel.

[Daniel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 9:2</span></span>

By books - By the sacred books.

[Daniel 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 9:12</span></span>

Judged us - Whose duty it was to govern the people, and to judge their
causes; wherein if there was a failure, it was a sin, and judgment upon
the people, and upon the rulers and judges themselves also. Upon
Jerusalem - A place privileged many ways above all others, and punished
above all others.

[Daniel 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 9:14</span></span>

The Lord watched - God's watching denotes the fit ways that he always
takes to punish sinners.

[Daniel 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 9:17</span></span>

For the Lord's sake - For the sake of the Messiah: to whom the title
Lord is frequently given in the Old Testament.

[Daniel 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 9:21</span></span>

About the time - The time of the evening sacrifice was a solemn and set
time of devotion. Tho' the altar was in ruins, and there was no oblation
offered upon it, yet the pious Jews were daily thoughtful of the time
when it should have been offered, and hoped that their prayer would be
set forth before God as incense, and the lifting up of their hands, as
the evening sacrifice. This was peculiarly a type of that great
sacrifice, which Christ was to offer: and it was in virtue of that
sacrifice, that Daniel's prayer was accepted, when he prayed for the
Lord's sake.

[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

Seventy weeks - These weeks are weeks of days, and these days are so
many years. To finish the transgression - The angel discovers first the
disease in three several words, which contain all sorts of sin, which
the Messiah should free us from by his full redemption. He shews the
cure of this disease in three words. To finish transgression. To make an
end of sin. To make reconciliation: all which words are very expressive
in the original, and signify to pardon, to blot out, to destroy. To
bring in everlasting righteousness - To bring in justification by the
free grace of God in Christ, and sanctification by his spirit: called
everlasting, because Christ is eternal, and so are the acceptance and
holiness purchased for us. Christ brings this in, By his merit. By his
gospel declaring it. By faith applying, and sealing it by the Holy
Ghost. To seal up - To abrogate the former dispensation of the law, and
to ratify the gospel covenant. To anoint - This alludes to his name
Messiah and Christ, both which signify anointed. Christ was anointed at
his first conception, and personal union, [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035). In his baptism, [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017), to his three offices by the holy
Ghost, King, [Mat 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002). Prophet, [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001). Priest, [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004).

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

From the going forth - From the publication of the edict, whether of
Cyrus or Darius, to restore and to build it.

[Daniel 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 9:26</span></span>

And after - After the seven and the sixty two that followed them. Not
for himself - But for our sakes, and for our salvation. And the people -
The Romans under the conduct of Titus. Determined - God hath decreed to
destroy that place and people, by the miseries and desolations of war.

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

He shall confirm - Christ confirmed the new covenant, By the testimony
of angels, of John baptist, of the wise men, of the saints then living,
of Moses and Elias. By his preaching. By signs and wonders. By his holy
life. By his resurrection and ascension. By his death and blood
shedding. Shall cause the sacrifice to cease - All the Jewish rites, and
Levitical worship. By his death he abrogated, and put an end to this
laborious service, for ever. And that determined - That spirit of
slumber, which God has determined to pour on the desolate nation, 'till
the time draws near, when all Israel shall be saved.
