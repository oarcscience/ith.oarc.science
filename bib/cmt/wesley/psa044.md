### [Psalms Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001)

[Psalms 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 44:4</span></span>

My king - The whole people speak as one man, being united in one body.

[Psalms 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 44:11</span></span>

Scattered - Those who were not slain are carried into captivity, and
dispersed in several places.

[Psalms 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 44:16</span></span>

Avenger - Who executeth both God's and his own vengeance upon me.

[Psalms 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 44:17</span></span>

Yet - Although we cannot excuse ourselves from many other sins, yet
through thy grace we have kept ourselves from apostacy and idolatry,
notwithstanding all examples and provocations.

[Psalms 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 44:18</span></span>

Turned - From thy worship to idols.

[Psalms 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 44:19</span></span>

Broken us - By inflicting upon us one breach after another, thou hast at
last brought us to this pass. The place - A place extremely desolate,
such as dragons love, [Isa 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021),
and therefore full of horror, and danger. Covered us - With deadly
horrors and miseries.

[Psalms 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 44:22</span></span>

Yea - Because we are constant in thy worship, which they abhor.

[Psalms 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 44:25</span></span>

Our soul - Our persons. Our belly - We are not only thrown down to the
earth, but we lie there like dead carcases.
