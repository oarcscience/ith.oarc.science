[Jeremiah 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 9:7</span></span>

Try them - By melting them, I will bring upon them, the fire of the
Chaldean war, that shall purge away those deceits in which they trust,
that the remnant may be purified. For how - I have tried all other
means.

[Jeremiah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 9:10</span></span>

Wailing - The prophet having taken up a lamentation for the slaughter of
the people, now re - assumes it for the desolation of the whole land.
The mountains shall not be able to secure them, nor the valleys to feed
them.

[Jeremiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 9:12</span></span>

Who is - Is there not a wise man among you, that will search into the
cause of all these threatened judgments.

[Jeremiah 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 9:16</span></span>

A sword - But I will follow them with the sword, 'till they be
destroyed, such of them as were appointed for destruction; for
otherwise, they were not all consumed, a full end was not to be made.

[Jeremiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 9:17</span></span>

Women - Who were hired to tear their hair, and beat their breasts, with
other mourning postures, a foolish custom which has obtained in most
ages and countries. Cunning - Such as are most skilful in it.

[Jeremiah 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 9:20</span></span>

Every one - It denotes how large and universal the mourning shall be.

[Jeremiah 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 9:21</span></span>

Death - The unavoidableness of the ruin is expressed metaphorically,
alluding to the storming of a city, wherein there is no respect had to
sex, youth, or age.

[Jeremiah 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 9:22</span></span>

As the handful - They shall be no more regarded than a few scattered
ears that drop out of the reapers hand, which either lie on the ground
and are eaten by birds, or trod to dirt by beasts. None - None shall
have so much respect to them, as to afford burial.

[Jeremiah 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 9:24</span></span>

Knoweth - Whether we make any curious distinction between understanding
God, as if that be more speculative, whereby we rightly apprehend his
nature; and knowing God, as if that be more practical, as directing the
conversation, we need not here enquire; yet certainly both center in
this, that we so know and understand God as to trust in him, and depend
on him alone in all conditions. Exercise - Kindness, as it relates to
his own people; judgment, in punishing the wicked; righteousness, as he
deals justly and uprightly with both.
