### [Numbers Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 7:1</span></span>

On the day - It seems day is for time, and on the day, for about the
time. For all the princes did not offer these things upon one and the
same day, but on several days, as here it follows. And so this chapter
comes in its proper place, and those things were done in the second
month of the second year after the tabernacle and altar, and all other
instruments thereof were anointed, as is here expressed; and after the
Levites were separated to the service of the tabernacle, and appointed
to their several works, which was done about a month after the
tabernacle was erected, and after the numbering of the people, Num.
1:2-49, when the princes here employed in the offerings were first
constituted; and after the disposal of the tribes about the tabernacle,
the order of which is here observed in the time of their offerings.

[Numbers 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 7:2</span></span>

Offered - In the manner and days hereafter mentioned.

[Numbers 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 7:3</span></span>

Waggons - For the more convenient and safe carriage of such things as
were most cumbersome.

[Numbers 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 7:5</span></span>

According to his service - More or fewer, as the nature of their service
and of the things to be carried required.

[Numbers 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 7:9</span></span>

Upon their shoulders - Because of the greater worth and holiness of the
things which they carried.

[Numbers 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 7:10</span></span>

The altar - Of burnt - offerings, and incense too, as appears from the
matter of their offerings. Not for the first dedication of them, for it
is apparent they were dedicated or consecrated before this time by Moses
and Aaron: but for a farther dedication of them, these being the first
offerings that were made for any particular persons or tribes. In the
day - That is, about the time, as soon as it was anointed.

[Numbers 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 7:11</span></span>

On his day - And in this offering they followed the order of their camp,
and not of their birth.

[Numbers 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 7:13</span></span>

Charger - A large dish or platter; to be employed about the altar of
burnt - offering, or in the court; not in the sanctuary, for all its
vessels were of gold.

[Numbers 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 7:17</span></span>

Peace - offerings - Which are more numerous because the princes and
priests, and some of the people made a feast before the Lord out of
them.

[Numbers 7:87](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#087.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_087">num 7:87</span></span>

Their meal - offering - Which was not mentioned before, because it was
sufficiently understood from the law which required it.

[Numbers 7:88](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#088.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_088">num 7:88</span></span>

After it was anointed - Which words are very conveniently added to
explain in what sense he had so oft said, that this was done in the day
when it was anointed, namely, not exactly, but in a latitude, a little
after that it was anointed.

[Numbers 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_089">num 7:89</span></span>

To speak with him - To consult God upon occasion. The mercy - seat -
Which Moses standing without the veil could easily hear. And this seems
to be added in this place, to shew that when men had done their part,
God was not wanting in the performance of his part, and promise. God's
speaking thus to Moses by an audible voice, as if he had been cloathed
with a body, was an earnest of the incarnation of the Son of God, when
in the fulness of time the Word should be made flesh, and speak in the
language of the sons of men. That he who spake to Moses was the Eternal
Word, was the belief of many of the ancients. For all God's communion
with man is by his Son, who is the same yesterday, to - day and for
ever.
