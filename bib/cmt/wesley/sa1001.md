### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 1:1</span></span>

Ramathaim - zophim - Called Ramah, [Sa1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019.md). Eparathite - That is, one of
Bethlehem - judah, by his birth and habitation, though by his original a
Levite.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 1:2</span></span>

Two wives - As many had in those ages, tho' it was a transgression of
the original institution of marriage. And it is probable that he took
his second wife, namely, Peninnah, because Hannah was barren.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 1:3</span></span>

Yearly - At the three solemn feasts, when he, together with all other
males were obliged to go to worship God in the place appointed; and at
other times, when he as a Levite, was to go thither in his course. To
sacrifice - Not in his own person, which the Levites could not do, but
by the priests. Were there - Or, were the priests of the Lord there,
under their father Eli, who is generally conceived to have been the high
- priest, but being very old and infirm, his sons ministered in his
stead. This is the first time in scripture, that God is called the Lord
of hosts or Armies. Probably Samuel was the first who used this title of
God, for the comfort of Israel, at the time when their armies were few
and feeble, and those of their enemies many and mighty.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 1:4</span></span>

Portions - Out of the sacrifice of his peace - offerings, the greatest
part whereof fell to the offerer, and was eaten by him, and his friends
or guests, before the Lord. And out of this he gave them all portions,
as the master of the feast used to do to the guests.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 1:5</span></span>

Shut up her womb - Yet Elkanah did not withdraw his love from her. To
abate out just love to any relation, for the sake of any infirmity which
they cannot help, is to add affliction to the afflicted.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 1:6</span></span>

Her adversary - Peninnah: so her envy or jealousy made her though so
nearly related.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 1:7</span></span>

When she went - This circumstance is noted as the occasion of the
contention, because at such times they were forced to more society with
one another, by the way, and in their lodgings; whereas at home they had
distinct apartments, where they might be asunder; and then her husband's
extraordinary love and kindness was shewed to Hannah, whereby Peninnah
was the more exasperated; then also Hannah prayed earnestly for a child,
which hitherto she had done in vain; and this possibly she reproached
her with. Did not eat - Being overwhelmed with grief, and therefore
unfit to eat of the sacred food. Which they were not to eat in their
mourning.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 1:8</span></span>

Ten sons - Oughtest thou not to value my hearty love to thee, more than
the having of as many sons as Penninah hath? She would willingly change
conditions with thee.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 1:9</span></span>

A seat - Or, throne; for it is manifest it was raised higher than
ordinary, [Sa1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018.md). Here he might
sit, either as the judge; or rather as high - priest, to hear and answer
such as came to him for advice, and to inspect and direct the worship of
God. Temple - That is, of the tabernacle, which is frequently so called.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 1:10</span></span>

Bitterness - That is, oppressed with grief. Prayed unto the Lord - They
had newly offered their peace - offerings, to obtain the favour of God,
and in token of their communion with him, they had feasted upon the
sacrifice: and now it was proper to put up her prayer, in virtue of the
sacrifice. For the peace - offerings typified Christ's mediation, as
well as the sin - offerings: since by this not only atonement is made
for sin, but an answer to our prayers obtained.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 1:11</span></span>

Give him - That is, consecrate him to God's service in his temple. No
razor - That is, he shall be a perpetual Nazarite.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 1:12</span></span>

Continued - Heb. multiplied to pray. By which it appears that she said
much more than is here expressed. And the like you are to judge of the
prayers and sermons of other holy persons recorded in scripture, which
gives us only the sum and substance of them. This consideration may help
us much to understand some passages of the bible.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 1:13</span></span>

Drunken - Because of the multitude of her words, and those motions of
her face and body, which the vehemency of her passion, and the fervency
in prayer occasioned.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 1:16</span></span>

Count not, &c. - Thus when we are unjustly censured, we should endeavour
not only to clear ourselves, but to satisfy our brethren, by giving them
a just and true account of that which they misapprehended.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 1:18</span></span>

Find grace - That favourable opinion and gracious prayer which thou hast
expressed on my behalf, be pleased to continue towards me. Sad - Her
heart being cheared by the priest's comfortable words, and especially by
God's spirit setting them home upon her, and assuring her that both his
and her prayers should be heard, it quickly appeared in her countenance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 1:19</span></span>

Remembered - Manifested his remembrance of her by the effect.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 1:20</span></span>

Samuel - That is, Asked of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 1:21</span></span>

His house - Hannah only and her child excepted. His vow - By which it
appears, though it was not expressed before, that he heard and consented
to her vow, and that he added a vow of his own, if God answered his
prayers.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 1:22</span></span>

Weaned - Not only from the breast, but also from the mother's knee and
care, and from childish food; 'till the child be something grown up, and
fit to do some service in the tabernacle: for it seems that as soon as
he was brought up he worshipped God, [Sa1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#028.md), and presently after ministered
to Eli, [Sa1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 1:23</span></span>

His word - His matter or thing; the business concerning the child, what
thou hast vowed concerning him, that be may grow up, and be accepted and
employed by God in his Service.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 1:24</span></span>

Three bullocks - One for a burnt - offering, the second for a sin -
offering, and the third for a peace offering; all these sorts being
expedient for this work and time. Flour - For the meal - offerings
belonging to the principal sacrifices, which to each bullock were three
tenth - deals, or three tenth parts of an ephah, and so nine parts of
the ephah were spent, and the tenth part was given to the priest. Wine -
For drink - offerings.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 1:25</span></span>

A bullock - The three bullocks mentioned [Sa1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#024.md), the singular number being put
for the plural, which is frequent.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">sa1 1:26</span></span>

Soul liveth - As surely as thou livest. Which asseveration seems
necessary, because this was some years after it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">sa1 1:28</span></span>

Lent him - But not with a purpose to require him again. Whatever we give
to God, may upon this account be said to be lent to him, that tho' we
may not recall it, yet he will certainly repay it, to our unspeakable
advantage. He worshipped - Not Eli, but young Samuel, who is spoken of
in this and the foregoing verse, and who was capable of worshipping God
in some sort, at least with external adoration.
