### [Job Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#001.md)

[Job 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 35:2</span></span>

Thou saidst - Not that Job said this in express terms, but he said those
things from which this might seem to follow, as that God had punished
him more than he deserved.

[Job 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 35:3</span></span>

Thou saidst - Another imputation upon God. Unto thee - Unto me; such
changes of persons being frequent in the Hebrew language. What profit,
&c. - God does not reward so much as I deserve. But it was not fair to
charge this upon Job, which he had neither directly nor indirectly
affirmed.

[Job 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 35:5</span></span>

Clouds, &c. - They are far above us, and God is far above them. How much
then is he out of the reach either of our sins or our services?

[Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 35:9</span></span>

Cry - Thus one man's wickedness may hurt another.

[Job 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 35:10</span></span>

None - Few or none of the great numbers of oppressed persons. God - They
cry out to men, but they seek not God, and therefore if God do not hear
their cries it is not unjust. Maker - Who alone made me, and who only
can deliver me. Who when our condition is ever so dark and sad, can turn
our darkness into light, can quickly put a new song in our mouth, a
thanksgiving unto our God.

[Job 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 35:11</span></span>

Who - This is an aggravation of mens neglect of God in their misery. God
hath given men, what he hath denied to beasts, wisdom to know God and
themselves. Therefore they are inexcusable, for not using that wisdom,
by calling on God in the time of trouble.

[Job 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 35:12</span></span>

Because - God doth not answer their cries, because they are both evil,
wicked and impenitent, and proud, unhumbled for those sins for which God
brought these miseries upon them.

[Job 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 35:13</span></span>

Vanity - Vain persons, that have no wisdom or piety in them.

[Job 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 35:14</span></span>

See him - Thou canst not understand his dealings with thee. Here Elihu
answers another objection of Job's: and tells him that though God may
for a season delay to answer, yet he will certainly do him right.
Judgment - Justice is at his tribunal, and in all his ways and
administrations. Trust - Instead of murmuring, repent of what is past,
humble thyself under God's hand, wait patiently in his way, 'till
deliverance come; for it will certainly come if thou dost not hinder it.

[Job 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 35:15</span></span>

Because - Because Job doth not acknowledge God's justice and his own
sins. He - God. Anger - Hath laid grievous afflictions upon him. He -
Job is not sensible of it, so as to be humbled under God's hand.
