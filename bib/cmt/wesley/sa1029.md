### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 29:2</span></span>

With Achish - As the life - guard of Achish. Achish being, as it seems,
the general of the army.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 29:3</span></span>

The princes - The Lords of the other eminent cities, who were
confederate with him in this expedition. These days or years - That is,
did I say days? I might have said years. He hath now been with me a full
year and four months, [Sa1 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#007), and
he was with me some years ago, [Sa1
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010), and since their time hath been
known to me. And it is not improbable, but David, after his escape from
thence, might hold some correspondence with Achish, as finding him to be
a man of a more generous temper than the rest of the Philistines, and
supposing that he might have need of him for a refuge, in case Saul
continued to seek his life. Since he fell - Revolted, or left his own
king to turn to me.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 29:4</span></span>

Make this fellow - Herein the wise and gracious providence of God
appeared, both in helping him out of these difficulties, out of which no
human wit could have extricated him, but he must have been, an
ungrateful person either to the one or the other side, and moreover in
giving him the happy opportunity of recovering his own, and his all from
the Amalekites, which had been irrecoverably lost, if he had gone into
this battle. And the kindness of God to David was the greater, because
it had been most just for God to have left David in those distresses
into which his own sinful counsel had brought him. These men - That is,
of these our soldiers, they speak according to the rules of true policy;
for by this very course, great enemies have sometimes been reconciled
together.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 29:8</span></span>

David said &c. - This was deep dissimulation and flattery, no way to be
justified. None knows, how strong a temptation they are in to compliment
and dissemble, which they are in who attend great men.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 29:9</span></span>

Angel of God - In whom nothing is blame - worthy. The Heathens
acknowledged good spirits, which also they worshipped as an inferior
sort of deities, who were messengers and ministers to the supreme God;
Achish had learned the title of angels, from the Israelites his
neighbours, and especially from David's conversation.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 29:11</span></span>

Rose up early - David did not then know, how necessary this was, for the
relief of his own city. But God knew it well, and sent him thither
accordingly. On how many occasions may he say, What I do thou knowest
not now; but thou shalt know hereafter?
