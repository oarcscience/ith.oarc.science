### [Romans Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

[Romans 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 7:1</span></span>

The apostle continues the comparison between the former and the present
state of a believer, and at the same time endeavours to wean the Jewish
believers from their fondness for the Mosaic law. I speak to them that
know the law - To the Jews chiefly here. As long - So long, and no
longer. As it liveth - The law is here spoken of, by a common figure, as
a person, to which, as to an husband, life and death are ascribed. But
he speaks indifferently of the law being dead to us, or we to it, the
sense being the same.

[Romans 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 7:2</span></span>

She is freed from the law of her husband - From that law which gave him
a peculiar property in her.

[Romans 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 7:4</span></span>

Thus ye also - Are now as free from the Mosaic law as an husband is,
when his wife is dead. By the body of Christ - Offered up; that is, by
the merits of his death, that law expiring with him.

[Romans 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 7:5</span></span>

When ye were in the flesh - Carnally minded, in a state of nature;
before we believed in Christ. Our sins which were by the law -
Accidentally occasioned, or irritated thereby. Wrought in our members -
Spread themselves all over the whole man.

[Romans 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 7:6</span></span>

Being dead to that whereby we were held - To our old husband, the law.
That we might serve in newness of spirit - In a new, spiritual manner.
And not in the oldness of the letter - Not in a bare literal, external
way, as we did before.

[Romans 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 7:7</span></span>

What shall we say then - This is a kind of a digression, to the
beginning of the next chapter, wherein the apostle, in order to show in
the most lively manner the weakness and inefficacy of the law, changes
the person and speaks as of himself, concerning the misery of one under
the law. This St. Paul frequently does, when he is not speaking of his
own person, but only assuming another character, [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md), [Co1
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030.md), [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md). The character here assumed is
that of a man, first ignorant of the law, then under it and sincerely,
but ineffectually, striving to serve God. To have spoken this of
himself, or any true believer, would have been foreign to the whole
scope of his discourse; nay, utterly contrary thereto, as well as to
what is expressly asserted, [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md).
Is the law sin - Sinful in itself, or a promoter of sin. I had not known
lust - That is, evil desire. I had not known it to be a sin; nay,
perhaps I should not have known that any such desire was in me: it did
not appear, till it was stirred up by the prohibition.

[Romans 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 7:8</span></span>

But sin - My inbred corruption. Taking occasion by the commandment -
Forbidding, but not subduing it, was only fretted, and wrought in me so
much the more all manner of evil desire. For while I was without the
knowledge of the law, sin was dead - Neither so apparent, nor so active;
nor was I under the least apprehensions of any danger from it.

[Romans 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 7:9</span></span>

And I was once alive without the law - Without the close application of
it. I had much life, wisdom, virtue, strength: so I thought. But when
the commandment - That is, the law, a part put for the whole; but this
expression particularly intimates its compulsive force, which restrains,
enjoins, urges, forbids, threatens. Came - In its spiritual meaning, to
my heart, with the power of God. Sin revived, and I died - My inbred sin
took fire, and all my virtue and strength died away; and I then saw
myself to be dead in sin, and liable to death eternal.

[Romans 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 7:10</span></span>

The commandment which was intended for life - Doubtless it was
originally intended by God as a grand means of preserving and increasing
spiritual life, and leading to life everlasting.

[Romans 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 7:11</span></span>

Deceived me - While I expected life by the law, sin came upon me
unawares and slew all my hopes.

[Romans 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 7:12</span></span>

The commandment - That is, every branch of the law. Is holy, and just,
and good - It springs from, and partakes of, the holy nature of God; it
is every way just and right in itself; it is designed wholly for the
good of man.

[Romans 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 7:13</span></span>

Was then that which is good made the cause of evil to me; yea, of death,
which is the greatest of evil? Not so. But it was sin, which was made
death to me, inasmuch as it wrought death in me even by that which is
good - By the good law. So that sin by the commandment became exceeding
sinful - The consequence of which was, that inbred sin, thus driving
furiously in spite of the commandment, became exceeding sinful; the
guilt thereof being greatly aggravated.

[Romans 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 7:14</span></span>

I am carnal - St. Paul, having compared together the past and present
state of believers, that "in the flesh," [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md), and that "in the spirit," [Rom
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md), in answering two objections, (Is
then the law sin? [Rom 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md), and, Is
the law death? [Rom 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013),.md) interweaves
the whole process of a man reasoning, groaning, striving, and escaping
from the legal to the evangelical state. This he does from [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md), to the end of this chapter. Sold
under sin - Totally enslaved; slaves bought with money were absolutely
at their master's disposal.

[Romans 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 7:16</span></span>

It is good - This single word implies all the three that were used
before, [Rom 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md), "holy, just, and
good."

[Romans 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 7:17</span></span>

It is no more I that can properly be said to do it, but rather sin that
dwelleth in me - That makes, as it were, another person, and tyrannizes
over me.

[Romans 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 7:18</span></span>

In my flesh - The flesh here signifies the whole man as he is by nature.

[Romans 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 7:21</span></span>

I find then a law - An inward constraining power, flowing from the
dictate of corrupt nature.

[Romans 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 7:22</span></span>

For I delight in the law of God - This is more than "I consent to," [Rom
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016.md). The day of liberty draws near.
The inward man - Called the mind, [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md), [Rom
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025.md).

[Romans 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 7:23</span></span>

But I see another law in my members - Another inward constraining power
of evil inclinations and bodily appetites. Warring against the law of my
mind - The dictate of my mind, which delights in the law of God. And
captivating me - In spite of all my resistance

[Romans 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 7:24</span></span>

Wretched man that I am - The struggle is now come to the height; and the
man, finding there is no help in himself, begins almost unawares to
pray, Who shall deliver me? He then seeks and looks for deliverance,
till God in Christ appears to answer his question. The word which we
translate deliver, implies force. And indeed without this there can be
no deliverance. The body of this death - That is, this body of death;
this mass of sin, leading to death eternal, and cleaving as close to me
as my body to my soul. We may observe, the deliverance is not wrought
yet.

[Romans 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 7:25</span></span>

I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord - That is, God will deliver me
through Christ. But the apostle, as his frequent manner is, beautifully
interweaves his assertion with thanksgiving;' the hymn of praise
answering in a manner to the voice of sorrow, "Wretched man that I am!"
So then - He here sums up the whole, and concludes what he began, [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md). I myself - Or rather that I, the
person whom I am personating, till this deliverance is wrought. Serve
the law of God with my mind - My reason and conscience declare for God.
But with my flesh the law of sin - But my corrupt passions and appetites
still rebel. The man is now utterly weary of his bondage, and upon the
brink of liberty.
