### [2 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

[2 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 2:1</span></span>

In grief - Either on account of the particular offender, or of the
church in general.

[2 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 2:2</span></span>

For if I grieve you, who is he that cheereth me, but he that is grieved
by me - That is, I cannot be comforted myself till his grief is removed.

[2 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 2:3</span></span>

And I wrote thus to you - I wrote to you before in this determination,
not to come to you in grief.

[2 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 2:4</span></span>

From much anguish I wrote to you, not so much that ye might be grieved,
as that ye might know by my faithful admonition my abundant love toward
you.

[2 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 2:5</span></span>

He hath grieved me but in part - Who still rejoice over the greater part
of you. Otherwise I might burden you all.

[2 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 2:6</span></span>

Sufficient for such an one - With what a remarkable tenderness does St.
Paul treat this offender! He never once mentions his name. Nor does he
here so much as mention his crime. By many - Not only by the rulers of
the church: the whole congregation acquiesced in the sentence.

[2 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 2:10</span></span>

To whom ye forgive - He makes no question of their complying with his
direction. Anything - So mildly does he speak even of that heinous sin,
after it was repented of. In the person of Christ - By the authority
wherewith he has invested me.

[2 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 2:11</span></span>

Lest Satan - To whom he had been delivered, and who sought to destroy
not only his flesh, but his soul also. Get an advantage over us - For
the loss of one soul is a common loss.

[2 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 2:12</span></span>

Now when I came to Troas - It seems, in that passage from Asia to
Macedonia, of which a short account is given, [Act
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001). Even though a door was opened
to me - That is, there was free liberty to speak, and many were willing
to hear: yet,

[2 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 2:13</span></span>

I had no rest in my spirit - From an earnest desire to know how my
letter had been received. Because I did not find Titus - In his return
from you. So I went forth into Macedonia - Where being much nearer, I
might more easily be informed concerning you. The apostle resumes the
thread of his discourse, [Co2 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002),
interposing an admirable digression concerning what he had done and
suffered elsewhere, the profit of which he by this means derives to the
Corinthians also; and as a prelude to his apology against the false
apostles.

[2 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 2:14</span></span>

To triumph, implies not only victory, but an open manifestation of it.
And as in triumphal processions, especially in the east, incense and
perfumes were burned near the conqueror, the apostle beautifully alludes
to this circumstance in the following verse: as likewise to the
different effects which strong perfumes have upon different persons;
some of whom they revive, while they throw others into the most violent
disorders.

[2 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 2:15</span></span>

For we - The preachers of the gospel. Are to God a sweet odour of Christ
- God is well - pleased with this perfume diffused by us, both in them
that believe and are saved, treated of, [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002); and in them that obstinately
disbelieve and, consequently, perish, treated of, [Co2
4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003).

[2 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 2:16</span></span>

And who is sufficient for these things - No man living, but by the power
of God's Spirit.

[2 Corinthians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 2:17</span></span>

For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God - Like those
vintners (so the Greek word implies) who mix their wines with baser
liquors. But as of sincerity - Without any mixture. But as from God -
This rises higher still; transmitting his pure word, not our own. In the
sight of God - Whom we regard as always present, and noting every word
of our tongue. Speak we - The tongue is ours, but the power is God's. In
Christ - Words which he gives, approves, and blesses.
