### [Matthew Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 4:1</span></span>

Then - After this glorious evidence of his Father's love, he was
completely armed for the combat. Thus after the clearest light and the
strongest consolation, let us expect the sharpest temptations. By the
Spirit - Probably through a strong inward impulse. [Mar
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012.md); [Luk
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 4:2</span></span>

Having fasted - Whereby doubtless he received more abundant spiritual
strength from God. Forty days and forty nights - As did Moses, the giver
of the law, and Elijah, the great restorer of it. He was afterward
hungry - And so prepared for the first temptation.

[Matthew 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 4:3</span></span>

Coming to him - In a visible form; probably in a human shape, as one
that desired to inquire farther into the evidences of his being the
Messiah.

[Matthew 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 4:4</span></span>

It is written - Thus Christ answered, and thus we may answer all the
suggestions of the devil. By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
of God - That is, by whatever God commands to sustain him. Therefore it
is not needful I should work a miracle to procure bread, without any
intimation of my Father's will. [Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md).

[Matthew 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 4:5</span></span>

The holy city - So Jerusalem was commonly called, being the place God
had peculiarly chosen for himself. On the battlement of the temple -
Probably over the king's gallery, which was of such a prodigious height,
that no one could look down from the top of it without making himself
giddy.

[Matthew 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 4:6</span></span>

In their hands - That is, with great care. [Psa
91:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md).

[Matthew 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 4:7</span></span>

Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God - By requiring farther evidence of
what he hath already made sufficiently plain. [Deu
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016.md).

[Matthew 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 4:8</span></span>

Showeth him all the kingdoms of the world - In a kind of visionary
representation.

[Matthew 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 4:9</span></span>

If thou wilt fall down and worship me - Here Satan clearly shows who he
was. Accordingly Christ answering this suggestion, calls him by his own
name, which he had not done before.

[Matthew 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 4:10</span></span>

Get thee hence, Satan - Not, get thee behind me, that is, into thy
proper place; as he said on a quite different occasion to Peter,
speaking what was not expedient. [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 4:11</span></span>

Angels came and waited upon him - Both to supply him with food, and to
congratulate his victory.

[Matthew 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 4:12</span></span>

He retired into Galilee - This journey was not immediately after his
temptation. He first went from Judea into Galilee, [Joh
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043.md); [Joh
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001.md). Then into Judea again, and
celebrated the passover at Jerusalem, [Joh
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#013.md). He baptized in Judea while John
was baptizing at Enon, [Joh 3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#022.md).
All this time John was at liberty, [Joh
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#024.md). But the Pharisees being
offended, [Joh 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md); and John put in
prison, he then took this journey into Galilee. [Mar
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 4:13</span></span>

Leaving Nazareth - Namely, when they had wholly rejected his word, and
even attempted to kill him, [Luk 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 4:15</span></span>

Galilee of the Gentiles - That part of Galilee which lay beyond Jordan
was so called, because it was in a great measure inhabited by Gentiles,
that is, heathens. [Isa 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 4:16</span></span>

Here is a beautiful gradation, first, they walked, then they sat in
darkness, and lastly, in the region of the shadow of death.

[Matthew 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 4:17</span></span>

From that time Jesus began to preach - He had preached before, both to
Jews and Samaritans, [Joh 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#041.md), [Joh
4:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#045.md). But from this time begin his
solemn stated preaching. Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand -
Although it is the peculiar business of Christ to establish the kingdom
of heaven in the hearts of men, yet it is observable, he begins his
preaching in the same words with John the Baptist: because the
repentance which John taught still was, and ever will be, the necessary
preparation for that inward kingdom. But that phrase is not only used
with regard to individuals in whom it is to be established, but also
with regard to the Christian Church, the whole body of believers. In the
former sense it is opposed to repentance; in the latter the Mosaic
dispensation.

[Matthew 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 4:18</span></span>

[Mar 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#016.md); [Luk
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 4:23</span></span>

The Gospel of the kingdom - The Gospel, that is, the joyous message, is
the proper name of our religion: as will be amply verified in all who
earnestly and perseveringly embrace it.

[Matthew 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 4:24</span></span>

Through all Syria - The whole province, of which the Jewish country was
only a small part. And demoniacs - Men possessed with devils: and
lunatics, and paralytics - Men ill of the palsy, whose cases were of all
others most deplorable and most helpless.

[Matthew 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 4:25</span></span>

Decapolis - A tract of land on the east side of the sea of Galilee, in
which were ten cities near each other.
