### [Hosea Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 12:1</span></span>

Feedeth on wind - It is a proverbial speech; denoting his supporting
himself with hopes, as unfit to sustain him as the wind is to feed us.
Increaseth lies - By making new leagues, and fortifying himself with
them, against the menaces of God by his prophets. Desolation - Which
will only hasten and increase his desolation. Oil - Not common oil for
trade, but rich and precious oils, to procure friendship there too.

[Hosea 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 12:2</span></span>

Jacob - Ephraim and Judah are of Jacob, both have corrupted themselves,
and therefore I will proceed against both.

[Hosea 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 12:3</span></span>

He - Jacob. Took his brother - The design of mentioning this is to mind
them of that goodness which God shewed them in their father Jacob. His
strength - This strength was not of nature, but of grace. Strength
received of God was well employed betimes; in it he wrestled for and
obtained the blessing.

[Hosea 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 12:4</span></span>

The angel - Called [Hos 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md), God; and
[Hos 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005.md), Jehovah, Lord of hosts. He
was no created angel, but the Messiah; eternal God by nature and
essence, angel by office, and voluntary undertaking. He wept - He prayed
with tears from a sense of his own unworthiness, and with earnestness
for the mercy he desired. He - God. Him - Jacob full of weariness,
fears, and solicitude on his journey to Laban. He - God. With us - Being
then in Jacob's loins.

[Hosea 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 12:5</span></span>

The Lord God of hosts - He that appeared and spake, who promised the
blessing and commanded the reformation at Beth - el was Jehovah, the
eternal and unchangeable God; who can perform his promise, and execute
his threat, who is a most terrible enemy, and most desirable friend. The
Lord - Jehovah, repeated for confirmation. His memorial - By this he
will be known.

[Hosea 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 12:6</span></span>

Turn - Repent, leave idols and all sins. He worshipped God alone, do you
so; he cast idols out of his family, do you so too; be Jacob's children
herein. Mercy - Shew kindness to all who need it. Judgment - Wrong none;
but with justice in dealings, in judicatures; and public offices, render
to every one their due. Wait on thy God - In public worship and private
duties serve and trust God alone: let not idols have either sacrifice,
prayer, praise, or trust from you; and let your hope and worship, be for
ever continued.

[Hosea 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 12:7</span></span>

A merchant - Ephraim is so far from being as Jacob, that you may account
him a Canaanite, a subtle merchant.

[Hosea 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 12:8</span></span>

I am rich - Whatever is said, yet I get what I aim at. They shall find -
Yet he hugs himself in the apprehension of close carriage of his
affairs, so that no great crime can be found in him: none, that is sin,
that is any great enormity.

[Hosea 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 12:9</span></span>

From Egypt - From the time I brought thee out of it. In tabernacles - I
have given thee all these blessings and comforts, expressed proverbially
in allusion to the joy which they had at the feast of tabernacles.

[Hosea 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 12:10</span></span>

Spoken - To warn them of their danger.

[Hosea 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 12:11</span></span>

In Gilead - Tiglah Pileser had formerly took Gilead among other towns,
leading the inhabitants captive. By this the prophet minds the
Ephraimites what they must expect, and doth it in this pungent question,
Is there iniquity in Gilead? Is it there only? Be it, Gilead was all
iniquity; Gilgal is no better. They - They that come up to Gilgal to
sacrifice, are idolaters. In the furrows - They are for number like
heaps of stones, gathered out of plowed land and laid in furrows.

[Hosea 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 12:12</span></span>

Fled - For fear of Esau.

[Hosea 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 12:13</span></span>

A prophet - By Moses. Israel - Your forefathers. Preserved - In the
wilderness. The aim of the prophet seems to be this, to prevent their
vain pride, and boasting of their ancestors.

[Hosea 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 12:14</span></span>

His blood - He shall bear the punishment of all his blood; his murders
of the innocent, and his own guilt too. His reproach - Which Ephraim
hath cast upon the prophets, the worshippers of God, and on God;
preferring idols before him. His Lord - God who is Lord of all.
