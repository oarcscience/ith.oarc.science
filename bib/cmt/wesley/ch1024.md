By lot - That the disposal thereof might be of the Lord, and so all

Henry, but it might be still used in faith, in parallel cases, as an
instituted ordinance. Of God - Or rather, of the things of God, that is,
of all persons ministering in the sanctuary, and of all holy
ministrations done in it, and of all other matters of the Lord, as they

Ithamar, so successively, 'till all the families of Ithamar had received
their lots. And afterwards all the lots came forth to the rest of
