### [1 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 12:2</span></span>

Even - Of Saul's own tribe: who were moved hereto by God's spirit, by
the conscience of their duty to David; and by their observation of God's
departure from Saul, and of his special presence with David.

[1 Chronicles 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 12:4</span></span>

[1 Chronicles 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 12:17</span></span>

The God of our fathers - He calls God, the God of our fathers, both his
fathers and theirs; thus he minds them, not to deal ill with him; for
they were both descendents from the same patriarchs, and servants of the
same God. And thus he encourages himself to believe, that God would
right him, if he was abused. For he was the God of his fathers;
therefore a blessing was entailed upon him: and a God to all Israel in
particular, as well as a Judge to all the earth.

[1 Chronicles 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 12:18</span></span>

The Spirit - Not only saving graces, but other heroical and generous
motions are ascribed to God's spirit, which here stirred up in him a
more that ordinary greatness of mind and resolution.

[1 Chronicles 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 12:20</span></span>

As - As he returned from the camp of the Philistines to Ziklag.

[1 Chronicles 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 12:21</span></span>

Against - Against the Amalekites who had taken and burnt Ziklag, whom
David and his six hundred men were now pursuing.

[1 Chronicles 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 12:22</span></span>

That time - While he was at Ziklag, and in his march to Hebron, and
principally at Hebron. Like - Innumerable, like the stars or angels,
both which are called God's hosts.

[1 Chronicles 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#024)

Six thousand, &c. - Who came hither in the name of their brethren; for
that whole tribe stuck to David.

[1 Chronicles 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 12:27</span></span>

Jehoida - Not the high - priest, for that was Abiathar, [Sa1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006), but one of eminent place under
him.

[1 Chronicles 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#029)

[1 Chronicles 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 12:31</span></span>

Manasseh - Which was within Jordan: for of the other half beyond Jordan
he speaks, [Ch1 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#037). By name - Who
were not ashamed publickly to own David by putting their names to some
paper presented to them for that purpose.

[1 Chronicles 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 12:32</span></span>

The times - They understood public affairs, the temper of the nation,
and the tendencies of the present events. And they shewed their wisdom
at this time; for as they had adhered to Saul while he lived, as knowing
the time was not yet come for David to take possession of the kingdom:
and as they could not join David, while Abner lived, and had the command
of the other tribes wherewith they were encompassed, so as soon as he
was dead, and they had opportunity to declare themselves, they owned
David for their king.

[1 Chronicles 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 12:33</span></span>

Double heart - They were sincerely loyal, and did not dissemble with
David, pretending to be for him, while in their hearts they favoured
Saul's family. And none had any separate interests, but all were for the
public good.
