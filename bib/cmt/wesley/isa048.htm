<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 48:7</A></FONT></span></p>Created - Revealed to thee by me; brought to light, as things are by creation. Not - Heb. not from thence, not from these ancient times when other things were revealed to thee. Or - Heb. and (or, or, as this particle is frequently used) before this day.

Thine ear - Thou didst not hear, I did not reveal these things unto thee: for so this phrase of opening the ear is understood, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#015">Sa1 9:15</A>. I knew - I knew all these cautions were necessary to cure thine infidelity. Called - Justly, thou wast indeed such.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 48:9</A></FONT></span></p>For my sake - I will spare thee, and deliver thee out of captivity, not for thy sake, but merely for my own sake, and for the vindication of my name, that I may be praised for my power, faithfulness, and goodness.

Silver - Which is kept in the furnace so long 'till all the dross be purged away, I will not deal so rigorously with thee; for then I should wholly consume thee.
