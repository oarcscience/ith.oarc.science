### [Mark Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)

[Mark 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 10:1</span></span>

He cometh thence - From Galilee. [Mat
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md).

[Mark 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 10:2</span></span>

[Mat 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md); [Mat
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md); [Luk

[Mark 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 10:4</span></span>

[Deu 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md).

[Mark 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 10:6</span></span>

From the beginning of the creation - Therefore Moses in the first of
Genesis gives us an account of things from the beginning of the
creation. Does it not clearly follow, that there was no creation
previous to that which Moses describes? God made them male and female -
Therefore Adam did not at first contain both sexes in himself: but God
made Adam, when first created, male only; and Eve female only. And this
man and woman he joined together, in a state of innocence, as husband
and wife.

[Mark 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 10:7</span></span>

[Gen 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md).

[Mark 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 10:11</span></span>

All polygamy is here totally condemned.

[Mark 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 10:13</span></span>

[Mat 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013.md).

[Mark 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 10:14</span></span>

Jesus seeing it was much displeased - At their blaming those who were
not blame worthy: and endeavouring to hinder the children from receiving
a blessing. Of such is the kingdom of God - The members of the kingdom
which I am come to set up in the world are such as these, as well as
grown persons, of a child - like temper.

[Mark 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 10:15</span></span>

Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child - As
totally disclaiming all worthiness and fitness, as if he were but a week
old.

[Mark 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 10:17</span></span>

[Mat 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md); [Luk
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018.md).

[Mark 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 10:20</span></span>

He answering, said to him, Master - He stands reproved now, and drops
the epithet good.

[Mark 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 10:21</span></span>

Jesus looking upon him - And looking into his heart, loved him -
Doubtless for the dawnings of good which he saw in him: and said to him
- Out of tender love, One thing thou lackest - The love of God, without
which all religion is a dead carcass. In order to this, throw away what
is to thee the grand hinderance of it. Give up thy great idol, riches.
Go, sell whatsoever thou hast.

[Mark 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 10:24</span></span>

Jesus saith to them, Children - See how he softens the harsh truth, by
the manner of delivering it! And yet without retracting or abating one
tittle: How hard is it for them that trust in riches - Either for
defence, or happiness, or deliverance from the thousand dangers that
life is continually exposed to. That these cannot enter into God's
glorious kingdom, is clear and undeniable: but it is easier for a camel
to go through a needle's eye, than for a man to have riches, and not
trust in them. Therefore, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom.

[Mark 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 10:28</span></span>

Lo, we have left all - Though the young man would not.

[Mark 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 10:30</span></span>

He shall receive a hundred fold, houses, &c. - Not in the same kind: for
it will generally be with persecutions: but in value: a hundred fold
more happiness than any or all of these did or could afford. But let it
be observed, none is entitled to this happiness, but he that will accept
it with persecutions.

[Mark 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 10:32</span></span>

They were in the way to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them: and they
were amazed - At his courage and intrepidity, considering the treatment
which he had himself told them he should meet with there: and as they
followed, they were afraid - Both for him and themselves: nevertheless
he judged it best to prepare them, by telling them more particularly
what was to ensue. [Mat 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md); [Luk
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031.md).

[Mark 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 10:35</span></span>

Saying - By their mother. It was she, not they that uttered the words.
[Mat 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020.md).

[Mark 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 10:38</span></span>

Ye know not what ye ask - Ye know not that ye ask for sufferings, which
must needs pave the way to glory. The cup - Of inward; the baptism - Of
outward sufferings. Our Lord was filled with sufferings within, and
covered with them without.

[Mark 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 10:40</span></span>

Save to them for whom it is prepared - Them who by patient continuance
in well doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality. For these
only eternal life is prepared. To these, only he will give it in that
day; and to every man his own reward, according to his own labour.

[Mark 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 10:45</span></span>

A ransom for many - Even for as many souls as needed such a ransom, [Co2
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md).

[Mark 10:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mar 10:46</span></span>

[Mat 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#029.md); [Luk
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#035.md).

[Mark 10:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mar 10:50</span></span>

Casting away his garment - Through joy and eagerness.
