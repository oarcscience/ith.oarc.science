### [Philippians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 1:1</span></span>

Servants - St. Paul, writing familiarly to the Philippians, does not
style himself an apostle. And under the common title of servants, he
tenderly and modestly joins with himself his son Timotheus, who had come
to Philippi not long after St. Paul had received him, [Act
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md), [Act
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md). To all the saints - The
apostolic epistles were sent more directly to the churches, than to the
pastors of them. With the bishops and deacons - The former properly took
care of the internal state, the latter, of the externals, of the church,
[Ti1 3:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md); although these were not
wholly confined to the one, neither those to the other. The word bishops
here includes all the presbyters at Philippi, as well as the ruling
presbyters: the names bishop and presbyter, or elder, being
promiscuously used in the first ages.

[Philippians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 1:4</span></span>

With joy - After the epistle to the Ephesians, wherein love reigns,
follows this, wherein there is perpetual mention of joy. "The fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy." And joy peculiarly enlivens prayer. The sum of
the whole epistle is, I rejoice. Rejoice ye.

[Philippians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 1:5</span></span>

The sense is, I thank God for your fellowship with us in all the
blessings of the gospel, which I have done from the first day of your
receiving it until now.

[Philippians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 1:6</span></span>

Being persuaded - The grounds of which persuasion are set down in the
following verse. That he who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect
it until the day of Christ - That he who having justified, hath begun to
sanctify you, will carry on this work, till it issue in glory.

[Philippians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 1:7</span></span>

As it is right for me to think this of you all - Why? He does not say,
"Because of an eternal decree;" or, "Because a saint must persevere;"
but, because I have you in my heart, who were all partakers of my grace
- That is, because ye were all (for which I have you in my heart, I bear
you the most grateful and tender affection) partakers of my grace - That
is, sharers in the afflictions which God vouchsafed me as a grace or
favour, [Phi 1:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md); both in my
bonds, and when I was called forth to answer for myself, and to confirm
the gospel. It is not improbable that, after they had endured that great
trial of affliction, God had sealed them unto full victory, of which the
apostle had a prophetic sight.

[Philippians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 1:8</span></span>

I long for you with the bowels of Jesus Christ - In Paul, not Paul
lives, but Jesus Christ. Therefore he longs for them with the bowels,
the tenderness, not of Paul, but of Jesus Christ.

[Philippians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 1:9</span></span>

And this I pray, that your love - Which they had already shown. May
abound yet more and more - The fire which burned in the apostle never
says, It is enough. In knowledge and in all spiritual sense - Which is
the ground of all spiritual knowledge. We must be inwardly sensible of
divine peace, joy, love; otherwise, we cannot know what they are.

[Philippians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 1:10</span></span>

That ye may try - By that spiritual sense. The things that are excellent
- Not only good, but the very best; the superior excellence of which is
hardly discerned, but by the adult Christian. That ye may be inwardly
sincere - Having a single eye to the very best things, and a pure heart.
And outwardly without offence - Holy, unblamable in all things.

[Philippians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 1:11</span></span>

Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus
Christ, to the glory and praise of God - Here are three properties of
that sincerity which is acceptable to God: It must bear fruits, the
fruits of righteousness, all inward and outward holiness, all good
tempers, words, and works; and that so abundantly, that we may be filled
with them. The branch and the fruits must derive both their virtue and
their very being from the all - supporting, all - supplying root, Jesus
Christ. As all these flow from the grace of Christ, so they must issue
in the glory and praise of God.

[Philippians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 1:12</span></span>

The things concerning me - My sufferings. Have fallen out rather to the
furtherance, than, as you feared, the hinderance, of the gospel.

[Philippians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 1:13</span></span>

My bonds in Christ - Endured for his sake. Have been made manifest -
Much taken notice of. In the whole palace - Of the Roman emperor.

[Philippians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 1:14</span></span>

And many - Who were before afraid. Trusting in the Lord through my bonds
- When they observed my constancy, and safety not withstanding, are more
bold.

[Philippians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 1:15</span></span>

Some indeed preach Christ out of contention - Envying St. Paul's
success, and striving to hurt him thereby. Not sincerely - From a real
desire to glorify God. But supposing - Though they were disappointed. To
add more affliction to my bonds - By enraging the Romans against me.

[Philippians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 1:17</span></span>

But the others out of love - To Christ and me. Knowing - Not barely,
supposing. That I am set - Literally, I lie; yet still going forward in
his work. He remained at Rome as an ambassador in a place where he is
employed on an important embassy.

[Philippians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 1:18</span></span>

In pretence - Under colour of propagating the gospel. In truth - With a
real design so to do.

[Philippians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 1:19</span></span>

This shall turn to my salvation - Shall procure me an higher degree of
glory. Through your prayer - Obtaining for me a larger supply of the
Spirit.

[Philippians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 1:20</span></span>

As always - Since my call to the apostleship. In my body - however it
may he disposed of. How that might be, he did not yet know. For the
apostles did not know all things; particularly in things pertaining to
themselves, they had room to exercise faith and patience.

[Philippians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 1:21</span></span>

To me to live is Christ - To know, to love, to follow Christ, is my
life, my glory, my joy.

[Philippians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 1:22</span></span>

Here he begins to treat of the former clause of the preceding verse. Of
the latter he treats, [Phi 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md). But
if I am to live is the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour - This is
the fruit of my living longer, that I can labour more. Glorious labour!
desirable fruit! in this view, long life is indeed a blessing. And what
I should choose I know not - That is, if it were left to my choice.

[Philippians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 1:23</span></span>

To depart - Out of bonds, flesh, the world. And to be with Christ - In a
nearer and fuller union. It is better to depart; it is far better to be
with Christ.

[Philippians 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 1:25</span></span>

I know - By a prophetic notice given him while he was writing this. That
I shall continue some time longer with you - And doubtless he did see
them after this confinement.

[Philippians 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 1:27</span></span>

Only - Be careful for this, and nothing else. Stand fast in one spirit -
With the most perfect unanimity. Striving together - With united
strength and endeavours. For the faith of the gospel - For all the
blessings revealed and promised therein.

[Philippians 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">phi 1:28</span></span>

Which - Namely, their being adversaries to the word of God, and to you
the messengers of God. Is an evident token - That they are in the high
road to perdition; and you, in the way of salvation.

[Philippians 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 1:29</span></span>

For to you it is given - As a special token of God's love, and of your
being in the way of salvation.

[Philippians 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 1:30</span></span>

Having the same kind of conflict with your adversaries, which ye saw in
me - When I was with you, [Act 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#012.md),
[Act 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019.md), &c.
