### [Psalms Chapter 120](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 120:4</span></span>

Arrows - The wrath and vengeance of the mighty God, which in scripture
is often compared to arrows, and here to coals of juniper, which burn
very fiercely and retain their heat for a long time.

[Psalms 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 120:5</span></span>

Mesech - Mesech and Kedar are two sorts of people often mentioned in
scripture, and reckoned amongst the barbarous nations. But their names
are here to be understood metaphorically. And so he explains himself in
the next verse.
