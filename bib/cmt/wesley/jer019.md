### [Jeremiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 19:4</span></span>

This place - Either this city, or this valley, which they had turned to
an use quite contrary to the end for which God gave it them.

[Jeremiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 19:5</span></span>

To burn - This and the following verse, contain another great sin of
this people, with the punishment which God proportions to it. The sin in
the general was idolatry, but a most barbarous species of it, mentioned
also [Jer 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031), [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035), where it is said, they made
their sons and their daughters pass thro' the fire to Molech; the place
where they did it is called Tophet, [Jer
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006), of which also mention is made,
[Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033). Baal and Molech, signify
the same thing; Baal signifies a Lord, Molech a King. Both Baal and
Molech seem common names to all idols.

[Jeremiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 19:7</span></span>

In this place - In this place, among others, I will make void all the
counsels that the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, have
taken to escape my righteous judgments.

[Jeremiah 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 19:12</span></span>

As Tophet - That is, a place of slaughter and burials.

[Jeremiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 19:14</span></span>

Then - Jeremiah had now dispatched the errand upon which God had sent
him to Tophet, coming back by God's direction, he stands in the court,
which was common to all people, where the most might hear.
