### [Titus Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

[Titus 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 3:1</span></span>

Remind them - All the Cretan Christians. To be subject - Passively, not
resisting. To principalities - Supreme. And powers - Subordinate
governors. And to obey - Them actively, so far as conscience permits.

[Titus 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 3:2</span></span>

To speak evil - Neither of them nor any man. Not to be quarrelsome - To
assault none. To be gentle - When assaulted. Toward all men - Even those
who are such as we were.

[Titus 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 3:3</span></span>

For we - And as God hath dealt with us, so ought we to deal with our
neighbour. Were without understanding - Wholly ignorant of God. And
disobedient - When he was declared to us.

[Titus 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 3:4</span></span>

When the love of God appeared - By the light of his Spirit to our inmost
soul.

[Titus 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 3:5</span></span>

Not by works - In this important passage the apostle presents us with a
delightful view of our redemption. Herein we have, The cause of it; not
our works or righteousness, but "the kindness and love of God our
Saviour." The effects; which are, Justification; "being justified,"
pardoned and accepted through the alone merits of Christ, not from any
desert in us, but according to his own mercy, "by his grace," his free,
unmerited goodness. Sanctification, expressed by the laver of
regeneration, (that is, baptism, the thing signified, as well as the
outward sign,) and the renewal of the Holy Ghost; which purifies the
soul, as water cleanses the body, and renews it in the whole image of
God. The consummation of all; - that we might become heirs of eternal
life, and live now in the joyful hope of it.

[Titus 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 3:8</span></span>

Be careful to excel in good works - Though the apostle does not lay
these for the foundation, yet he brings them in at their proper place,
and then mentions them, not slightly, but as affairs of great
importance. He desires that all believers should be careful - Have their
thoughts upon them: use their best contrivance, their utmost endeavours,
not barely to practise, but to excel, to be eminent and distinguished in
them: because, though they are not the ground of our reconciliation with
God, yet they are amiable and honourable to the Christian profession.
And profitable to men - Means of increasing the everlasting happiness
both of ourselves and others.

[Titus 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 3:10</span></span>

An heretic (after a first and second admonition) reject - Avoid, leave
to himself. This is the only place, in the whole scripture, where this
word heretic occurs; and here it evidently means, a man that obstinately
persists in contending about "foolish questions," and thereby occasions
strife and animosities, schisms and parties in the church. This, and
this alone, is an heretic in the scripture sense; and his punishment
likewise is here fixed. Shun, avoid him, leave him to himself. As for
the Popish sense, "A man that errs in fundamentals," although it crept,
with many other things, early into the church, yet it has no shadow of
foundation either in the Old or New Testament.

[Titus 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 3:11</span></span>

Such an one is perverted - In his heart, at least. And sinneth, being
self - condemned - Being convinced in his own conscience that he acts
wrong.

[Titus 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 3:12</span></span>

When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus - To succeed thee in thy office.
Titus was properly an evangelist, who, according to the nature of that
office, had no fixed residence; but presided over other elders, wherever
he travelled from place to place, assisting each of the apostles
according to the measure of his abilities. Come to me to Nicopolis -
Very probably not the Nicopolis in Macedonia, as the vulgar subscription
asserts: (indeed, none of those subscriptions at the end of St. Paul's
epistles are of any authority:) rather it was a town of the same name
which lay upon the sea - coast of Epirus. For I have determined to
winter there - Hence it appears, he was not there yet; if so, he would
have said, to winter here. Consequently, this letter was not written
from thence.

[Titus 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 3:13</span></span>

Send forward Zenas the lawyer - Either a Roman lawyer or an expounder of
the Jewish law.

[Titus 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 3:14</span></span>

And let ours - All our brethren at Crete. Learn - Both by thy admonition
and example. Perhaps they had not before assisted Zenas and Apollos as
they ought to have done.
