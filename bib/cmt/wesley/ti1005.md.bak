### [1 Timothy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 5:1</span></span>

Rebuke not - Considering your own youth, with such a severity as would
otherwise be proper.

[1 Timothy 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 5:3</span></span>

Honour - That is, maintain out of the public stock.

[1 Timothy 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 5:4</span></span>

Let these learn to requite their parents - For all their former care,
trouble, and expense.

[1 Timothy 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 5:5</span></span>

Widows indeed - Who have no near relations to provide for them; and who
are wholly devoted to God. Desolate - Having neither children, nor
grandchildren to relieve her.

[1 Timothy 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 5:6</span></span>

She that liveth in pleasure - Delicately, voluptuously, in elegant,
regular sensuality, though not in the use of any such pleasures as are
unlawful in themselves.

[1 Timothy 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 5:7</span></span>

That they - That is, the widows.

[1 Timothy 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 5:8</span></span>

If any provide not - Food and raiment. For his own - Mother and
grandmother, being desolate widows. He hath - Virtually. Denied the
faith - Which does not destroy, but perfect, natural duties. What has
this to do with heaping up money for our children, for which it is often
so impertinently alleged? But all men have their reasons for laying up
money. One will go to hell for fear of want; another acts like a
heathen, lest he should be worse than an infidel.

[1 Timothy 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 5:9</span></span>

Let not a widow be chosen - Into the number of deaconesses, who attended
sick women or travelling preachers. Under threescore - Afterwards they
were admitted at forty, if they were eminent for holiness. Having been
the wife of one husband - That is, having lived in lawful marriage,
whether with one or more persons successively.

[1 Timothy 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 5:10</span></span>

If she hath washed the feet of the saints - Has been ready to do the
meanest offices for them.

[1 Timothy 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 5:11</span></span>

Refuse - Do not choose. For when they are waxed wanton against Christ -
To whose more immediate service they had addicted themselves. They want
to marry - And not with a single eye to the glory of God; and so
withdraw themselves from that entire service of the church to which they
were before engaged.

[1 Timothy 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 5:12</span></span>

They have rejected their first faith - Have deserted their trust in God,
and have acted contrary to the first conviction, namely, that wholly to
devote themselves to his service was the most excellent way. When we
first receive power to believe, does not the Spirit of God generally
point out what are the most excellent things; and at the same time, give
us an holy resolution to walk in the highest degree of Christian
severity? And how unwise are we ever to sink into anything below it!

[1 Timothy 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 5:14</span></span>

I counsel therefore the younger women - Widows or virgins, such as are
not disposed to live single. To marry, to bear children, to guide the
family - Then will they have sufficient employment of their own. And
give no occasion of reproach to the adversary - Whether Jew or heathen.

[1 Timothy 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 5:15</span></span>

Some - Widows. Have turned aside after Satan - Who has drawn them from
Christ.

[1 Timothy 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 5:17</span></span>

Let the elders that rule well - Who approve themselves faithful stewards
of all that is committed to their charge. Be counted worthy of double
honour - A more abundant provision, seeing that such will employ it all
to the glory of God. As it was the most laborious and disinterested men
who were put into these offices, so whatever any one had to bestow, in
his life or death, was generally lodged in their hands for the poor. By
this means the churchmen became very rich in after ages, but as the
design of the donors was something else, there is the highest reason why
it should be disposed of according to their pious intent. Especially
those - Of them. Who labour - Diligently and painfully. In the word and
teaching - In teaching the word.

[1 Timothy 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 5:18</span></span>

[Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md)

[1 Timothy 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti1 5:19</span></span>

Against an elder - Or presbyter. Do not even receive an accusation,
unless by two or three witnesses - By the Mosaic law, a private person
might be cited (though not condemned) on the testimony of one witness;
but St. Paul forbids an elder to be even cited on such evidence, his
reputation being of more importance than that of others.

[1 Timothy 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 5:20</span></span>

Those - Elders. That sin - Scandalously, and are duly convicted. Rebuke
before all - The church.

[1 Timothy 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti1 5:21</span></span>

I charge thee before God - Referring to the last judgment, in which we
shall stand before God and Christ, with his elect, that is, holy,
angels, who are the witnesses of our conversation. The apostle looks
through his own labours, and even through time itself, and seems to
stand as one already in eternity. That thou observe these things without
prejudging - Passing no sentence till the cause is fully heard. Or
partiality - For or against any one.

[1 Timothy 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti1 5:22</span></span>

Lay hands suddenly on no man - That is, appoint no man to church offices
without full trial and examination; else thou wilt be accessary to, and
accountable for, his misbehaviour in his office. Keep thy self pure -
From the blood of all men.

[1 Timothy 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti1 5:24</span></span>

Some men's sins are manifest beforehand - Before any strict inquiry be
made. Going before to judgment - So that you may immediately judge them
unworthy of any spiritual office. And some they - Their sins. Follow
after - More covertly.

[1 Timothy 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ti1 5:25</span></span>

They that are otherwise - Not so manifest. Cannot be long hid - From thy
knowledge. On this account, also, be not hasty in laying on of hands.
