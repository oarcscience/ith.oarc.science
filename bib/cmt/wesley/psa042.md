### [Psalms Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001)

[Psalms 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 42:1</span></span>

Panteth - After the enjoyment of thee in thy sanctuary.

[Psalms 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 42:2</span></span>

Thirsteth - Not after vain useless idols, but after the only true and
living God. Appear - In the place of his special presence and publick
worship.

[Psalms 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 42:4</span></span>

Remember - My banishment from God's presence, and mine enemies triumphs.
In me - I breathe out my sorrows and complaints to God within my own
breast. The multitudes - Israelites, who went thither in great numbers.
Holy - day - Or that kept the feast, the three solemn festival
solemnities, which they kept holy unto the Lord.

[Psalms 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 42:5</span></span>

For - Heb. for the salvations of his face, for those supports,
deliverances and comforts which I doubt not I shall enjoy both in his
presence and sanctuary, and from his presence, and the light of his
countenance.

[Psalms 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 42:6</span></span>

Therefore - Therefore that I may revive my drooping spirits. Remember -
I will consider thy infinite mercy and power, and faithfulness. Mizar -
From all the parts of the land, to which I shall be driven; whether from
the parts beyond Jordan on the east: or mount Hermon, which was in the
northern parts.

[Psalms 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 42:7</span></span>

Deep - One affliction comes immediately after another, as if it were
called for by the former. A metaphor taken from violent and successive
showers of rain; which frequently come down from heaven, as it were at
the noise, or call of God's water spouts.

[Psalms 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 42:8</span></span>

Command - Will effectually confer upon me. Loving - kindness - His
blessings, the effects of his loving - kindness.

[Psalms 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 42:10</span></span>

As - As a sword, which cutteth the very bones, so painful are their
reproaches.
