### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 48:15</span></span>

A profane place - A common, not consecrated place.

[Ezekiel 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 48:16</span></span>

The measures thereof - The extent and proportions of the city, a square
of four thousand five hundred shall be taken out of the middle of the
twenty five thousand or the ground - plat of the city. So it shall be an
equilateral square, every side exactly the same, north, south, east, and
west, four thousand five hundred apiece, by which measures the whole
content is visible eighteen thousand cubits not reeds.

[Ezekiel 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 48:18</span></span>

For food - For the maintenance of the city - officers.

[Ezekiel 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 48:20</span></span>

The possession - The land assigned for the city.

[Ezekiel 48:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 48:28</span></span>

To the river - The river of Egypt.

[Ezekiel 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 48:35</span></span>

Eighteen thousand cubits - About five miles in compass. From that day -
From the day of the Lord's restoring this people, and rebuilding their
city, and their thankful, holy, and pure worshipping of God there, from
that day it shall be said of Jerusalem. The Lord is there - The Lord who
as his name alone is Jehovah, so is the only true God, faithful to his
promise, rich in mercy, glorious in majesty, righteous in his judgments,
wise and holy in his government, whose presence makes us happy, whose
withdrawing from us leaves us to misery. This God will by his favour and
presence, bring the confluence of all good to persons, families, and
cities; this God will be there to dwell, govern, defend, prosper, and
crown. Such is to be the case of earthly Jerusalem, such shall be for
ever the case of the heavenly Jerusalem. Such is the case of every true
believer, who may, wherever he is, in his way of duty, still write
Jehovah - Shammah, My God is here. And 'tis best to be where he is 'till
he bring us within the gates of the glorious city, where inconceivable
light and love from the immediate presence of God, give every one an
eternal demonstration that God is here: to him be glory for ever.
