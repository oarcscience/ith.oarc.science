### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md)

[Acts 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 9:1</span></span>

[Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md), &c; [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md), &c.

[Acts 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 9:2</span></span>

Bound - By the connivance, if not authority, of the governor, under
Aretas the king. See [Act 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md), [Act
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024.md).

[Acts 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 9:3</span></span>

And suddenly - When God suddenly and vehemently attacks a sinner, it is
the highest act of mercy. So Saul, when his rage was come to the height,
is taught not to breathe slaughter. And what was wanting in time to
confirm him in his discipleship, is compensated by the inexpressible
terror he sustained. By his also the suddenly constituted apostle was
guarded against the grand snare into which novices are apt to fall.

[Acts 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 9:4</span></span>

He heard a voice - Severe, yet full of grace.

[Acts 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 9:5</span></span>

To kick against the goads - is a Syriac proverb, expressing an attempt
that brings nothing but pain.

[Acts 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 9:6</span></span>

It shall be told thee - So God himself sends Saul to be taught by a man,
as the angel does Cornelius, [Act
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#005.md). Admirable condescension! that
the Lord deals with us by men, like ourselves.

[Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 9:7</span></span>

The men - stood - Having risen before Saul; for they also fell to the
ground, [Act 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014.md). It is probable
they all journeyed on foot. Hearing the noise - But not an articulate
voice. And seeing the light, but not Jesus himself, [Act
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#013.md), &c.

[Acts 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 9:9</span></span>

And he was three days - An important season! So long he seems to have
been in the pangs of the new birth. Without sight - By scales growing
over his eyes, to intimate to him the blindness of the state he had been
in, to impress him with a deeper sense of the almighty power of Christ,
and to turn his thoughts inward, while he was less capable of conversing
with outward objects. This was likewise a manifest token to others, of
what had happened to him in his journey, and ought to have humbled and
convinced those bigoted Jews, to whom he had been sent from the
sanhedrim.

[Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 9:11</span></span>

Behold he is praying - He was shown thus to Ananias.

[Acts 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 9:12</span></span>

A man called Ananias - His name also was revealed to Saul.

[Acts 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 9:13</span></span>

But he answered - How natural it is to reason against God.

[Acts 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 9:14</span></span>

All that call on thy name - That is, all Christians.

[Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 9:15</span></span>

He is a chosen vessel to bear my name - That is, to testify of me. It is
undeniable, that some men are unconditionally chosen or elected, to do
some works for God

[Acts 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 9:16</span></span>

For I - Do thou as thou art commanded. I will take care of the rest;
will show him - In fact, through the whole course of his ministry. How
great things he must suffer - So far will he be now from persecuting
others.

[Acts 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 9:17</span></span>

The Lord hath sent me - Ananias does not tell Saul all which Christ had
said concerning him. It was not expedient that he should know yet to how
great a dignity he was called.

[Acts 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 9:24</span></span>

They guarded the gates day and night - That is, the governor did, at
their request, [Co2 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032.md).

[Acts 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 9:26</span></span>

And coming to Jerusalem - Three years after, [Gal
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md). These three years St. Paul
passes over, [Act 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md), likewise.

[Acts 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 9:27</span></span>

To the apostles - Peter and James, [Gal
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md). And declared - He who has
been an enemy to the truth ought not to be trusted till he gives proof
that he is changed.

[Acts 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 9:31</span></span>

Then the Church - The whole body of Christian believers, had peace -
Their bitterest persecutor being converted. And being built up - In
holy, loving faith, continually increasing, and walking in - That is,
speaking and acting only from this principle, the fear of God and the
comfort of the Holy Ghost - An excellent mixture of inward and outward
peace, tempered with filial fear.

[Acts 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 9:35</span></span>

Lydda was a large town, one day's journey from Jerusalem. It stood in
the plain or valley of Sharon, which extended from Cesarea to Joppa, and
was noted for its fruitfulness.

[Acts 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 9:36</span></span>

Tabitha, which is by interpretation Dorcas - She was probably a
Hellenist Jew, known among the Hebrews by the Syriac name Tabitha, while
the Greeks called her in their own language, Dorcas. They are both words
of the same import, and signify a roe or fawn.

[Acts 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 9:38</span></span>

The disciples sent to him - Probably none of those at Joppa had the gift
of miracles. Nor is it certain that they expected a miracle from him.

[Acts 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 9:39</span></span>

While she was with the in - That is, before she died.

[Acts 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 9:40</span></span>

Peter having put them all out - That he might have the better
opportunity of wrestling with God in prayer, said, Tabitha, arise. And
she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up - Who can imagine the
surprise of Dorcas, when called back to life? Or of her friends, when
they saw her alive? For the sake of themselves, and of the poor, there
was cause of rejoicing, and much more, for such a confirmation of the
Gospel. Yet to herself it was matter of resignation, not joy, to be
called back to these scenes of vanity: but doubtless, her remaining days
were still more zealously spent in the service of her Saviour and her
God. Thus was a richer treasure laid up for her in heaven, and she
afterward returned to a more exceeding weight of glory, than that from
which so astonishing a providence had recalled her for a season.
