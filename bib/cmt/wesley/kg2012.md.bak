### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 12:3</span></span>

Burnt incense - To the true God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004.md)

And Jehoash said, &c. - Remembering that he owed his preservation and
restoration to the temple, and that he was made by God the guardian of
his temple, he now takes care to repair it. Dedicated things - The money
which had been either formerly or lately vowed or dedicated to the
service of God and of his house. That is brought - Or rather, that shall
be brought: for though the people might vow to bring it thither in
convenient time, yet it is not likely they would bring much money
thither in the tyrannical and idolatrous reign of Athaliah. The money -
The half shekel, which was paid for every one that was numbered from
twenty years old and upward. Is set at - Heb. the money of souls, or
persons according to his taxing, the money which every man that had
vowed his person to God, paid according to the rate which the priest put
upon him. That cometh - All that shall be freely offered.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#015.md)

Faithfully - For they perceived by many experiments that they were
faithful.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 12:20</span></span>

And slew Joash - We are told, in the Chronicles, that his murdering the
prophet, Jehoiada's son, was the provocation. In this, how unrighteous
so ever they were, yet the Lord was righteous. And this was not the only
time, that he let even kings know, it was at their peril, if they
touched his anointed, or did his prophets any harm. Thus fell Joash, who
began in the spirit, and ended in the flesh. And indeed God usually sets
marks of his displeasure upon apostates, even in this life.
