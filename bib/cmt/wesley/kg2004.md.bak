### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 4:1</span></span>

Prophets - Who, though they were wholly devoted to sacred employment,
were not excluded from marriage, any more than the priests and Levites.
Fear the Lord - His poverty therefore was not procured by his idleness,
or prodigality; but by his piety, because he would not comply with the
king's way of worship, and therefore lost all worldly advantages.
Bondmen - Either, to use them as his slaves, or to sell them to others,
according to the law.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 4:2</span></span>

What shall I - How shall I relieve thee, who am myself poor?

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 4:7</span></span>

Unto her son - To one of them: for she had two, [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md). The oil stayed - To teach us,
that we should not waste any of his good creatures; and that God would
not work miracles unnecessarily. We are never straiten'd in God, and in
his power and bounty, and the riches of his grace. All our straitness is
in ourselves. It is our faith that fails, not his promise. Were there
more vessels, there is enough in God to fill them, enough for all,
enough for each.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

Great - For estate, or birth and quality.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 4:9</span></span>

This is - A prophet, and that of eminent holiness: by our kindness to
whom, we shall procure a blessing to ourselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 4:10</span></span>

On the wall - That he may be free from the noise of family business, and
enjoy that privacy, which, I perceive, he desireth for his prayers and
meditations. A bed, &c. - He will not be troublesome or chargeable to
us: he cares not for rich furniture or costly entertainment, and is
content with bare necessaries.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 4:12</span></span>

She stood - The relation seems to be a little perplexed, but may be thus
conceived. It is in this verse recorded in the general, that the prophet
sent Gehazi to call her, and that she came to him upon that call: then
follows a particular description of the whole business, with all the
circumstances, first, of the message with which Gehazi was sent when he
went to call her, and of her answer to that message, [Kg2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md), and of Gehazi's conjecture
thereupon, [Kg2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#014.md), and then of her
coming to the prophet at his call: which is there repeated to make way
for the following passages.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 4:13</span></span>

I dwell - I live among my kindred and friends; nor have I any cause to
seek relief from higher powers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 4:14</span></span>

He said - Hast thou observed any thing which she wants or desires? For
the prophet kept himself much in his chamber, whilst Gehazi went more
freely about the house, as his occasions led him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 4:16</span></span>

Do not lie - Do not delude me with vain hopes. She could not believe it
for joy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 4:17</span></span>

Time of life - See note on [Gen 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 4:21</span></span>

Bed of the man of God - Being apt to believe, he that so soon took away
what he had given, would restore what he had taken away. By this faith
women received their dead raised to life. In this faith she makes no
preparation for the burial of her child, but for his resurrection.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 4:23</span></span>

New moon, &c. - Which were the usual times in which they resorted to the
prophets for instruction. It shall be well - My going will not be
troublesome to him, nor prejudicial to thee or me.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 4:26</span></span>

It is - So it was in some respects, because it was the will of a wise
and good God, and therefore best for her. When God calls away our
dearest relations by death, it becomes us to say, it is well both with
us and them. It is well, for all is well that God doth: all is well with
them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven. And all is well with us
that stay behind, if by the affliction we are furthered in our way
thither.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 4:27</span></span>

The feet - She fell at his feet and touched them, as a most humble and
earnest supplicant. Withal, she intimated, what she durst not presume to
express in words, that she desired him to go along with her. Let her
alone - Disturb her not, for this gesture is a sign of some
extraordinary grief. Hid it - Whereby he signifies, that what he knew or
did, was not by any virtue inherent in himself, but from God, who
revealed to him only what and when he pleased.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg2 4:28</span></span>

She said - This child was not given to me upon my immoderate desire, for
which I might have justly been thus chastised, but was freely promised
by thee in God's name, and from his special favour. Deceive me - With
vain hopes of a comfort that I should never have. And I had been much
happier if I had never had it, than to lose it so quickly.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 4:29</span></span>

Gird up - Tie up thy long garments about thy loins for expedition. If
thou meet, &c. - Make no delay nor stop by the way, neither by words nor
actions.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 4:30</span></span>

Will not leave thee - Until thou goest home with me. For she had no
great confidence in Gehazi, nor was her faith so strong as to think that
the prophet could work so great a miracle at this distance.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 4:31</span></span>

Neither voice - Neither speech, nor sense, nor any sign of life, in the
child. This disappointment might proceed from hence, that Elisha having
changed his mind, and yielded to her importunity to go with her, did
alter his course, and not join his fervent prayers with Gehazi's action.
Not awaked - Not revived.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 4:33</span></span>

Shut the door - Upon himself and the dead child, that he might pray to
God without distraction, and might more freely use those means which he
thought fit.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 4:34</span></span>

And put - One part upon another successively; for the disproportion of
the bodies would not permit it to be done together. Grew warm - Not by
any external heat, which could not be transmitted to the child's body by
such slight touches of the prophet's body; but from a principle of life,
which was already infused into the child, and by degrees enlivened all
the parts of his body.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 4:35</span></span>

He walked - He changeth his postures for his own necessary refreshment,
and walked to and fro, exercising his mind in prayer to God. And went -
Repeating his former actions, to teach us not to be discouraged in our
prayers, if we be not speedily answered. Opened his eyes - So the work
begun in the former verse is here perfected. Although miracles were for
the most part done in an instant, yet sometimes they were done by
degrees.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg2 4:36</span></span>

Unto him - To the door.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">kg2 4:40</span></span>

Death - That is, some deadly thing.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">kg2 4:41</span></span>

Into the pot - Together with the pottage which they had taken out of it.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:42](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">kg2 4:42</span></span>

First fruits - Which were the priests due, [Num
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012.md), but these, and probably the
rest of the priests dues, were usually brought by the pious Israelites,
according to their ability and opportunity, to the Lord's prophets,
because they were not permitted to carry them to Jerusalem.
