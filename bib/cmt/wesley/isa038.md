### [Isaiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 38:13</span></span>

I reckon - When I could not rest all the night even 'till morning, my
thoughts were presaging that God would instantly break me to pieces, and
the like thoughts followed me from morning 'till evening.

[Isaiah 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 38:16</span></span>

By these - By thy promises, and thy performance of them; therefore it is
not strange, that one word of God hath brought me back from the jaws of
death.

[Isaiah 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 38:18</span></span>

Praise - The dead are not capable of glorifying thy name among men upon
earth. They cannot expect nor receive the accomplishment of thy promised
goodness in the land of the living.

[Isaiah 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 38:20</span></span>

Was ready - Was a present help.
