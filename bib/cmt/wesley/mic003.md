### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

[Micah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 3:1</span></span>

Is it not for you - Ought not you to understand, and conform to, the
just laws of your God. You princes, magistrates, and ruling officers,
ought of all men to know and do right.

[Micah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 3:2</span></span>

The good - Ye who hate not only to do good, but the good which is done,
and those that do it. The evil - Chuse, and delight in, both evil works
and evil workers. Who pluck it off - Ye who use the flock as cruelly as
the shepherd, who instead of shearing the fleece, would pluck off the
skin and flesh.

[Micah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 3:3</span></span>

The flesh - Ye who devour the goods, and livelihood of your brethren.
Break their bones - An allusion to wolves, bears, or lions, which devour
the flesh, and break the bones of the defenceless lambs.

[Micah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 3:4</span></span>

Then - When these miseries come upon them.

[Micah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 3:5</span></span>

That bite - When they are furnished with gifts, and well fed. Prepare
war - They do them all the mischief they can.

[Micah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 3:6</span></span>

Night - Heavy calamities. A vision - You shall no more pretend to have a
vision, or dare to foretell any thing. And the sun - The hand of God
shall be against them, making their sorrows the more dreadful, as
darkness by the sun going down at noon.

[Micah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 3:7</span></span>

The seers - So called by the deceived people. Cover their lips -
Mourners did thus, [Eze 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017), [Eze
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022). So these shall mourn and pine
in their shame. No answer - Because the answer they had formerly,
pretended to be from God, now appears not to have been from him.

[Micah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 3:8</span></span>

Power - Courage, and vivacity. Of judgment - To discern times and
seasons, right from wrong. Might - Resolution.

[Micah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 3:10</span></span>

They - The heads and great ones enlarge, beautify, and fortify, the
house in Zion, particularly the temple and the royal palace. Blood -
With wealth, which they made themselves masters of by violence, taking
away the life of the owners.

[Micah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 3:11</span></span>

Lean - Pretend to trust in him. Among us - As our God and our shield.

[Micah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 3:12</span></span>

For your sake - Because of your sins. The mountain - The mountain, on
which the temple stood. This is that passage, which is quoted, [Jer
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018), which Hezekiah and his princes
took well: yea, they repented and so the execution of it did not come in
their days.
