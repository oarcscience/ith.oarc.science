### [Leviticus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 4:1</span></span>

The Lord spake unto Moses - The laws contained in the three first
chapters, seem to have been delivered to Moses at one time. Here begin
the laws of another day, which God delivered from between the Cherubim.

[Leviticus 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 4:2</span></span>

If a soul sin - This must necessarily be understood of more than common
daily infirmities; for if every such sin had required an offering, it
had not been possible either for most sinners to bear such a charge, or
for the altar to receive so many sacrifices, or for the priests to
manage so infinite a work. And for ordinary sins, they were ceremonially
expiated by the daily offering, and by that on the great day of
atonement, [Lev 16:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#030.md). Through
ignorance - Or, error, either not knowing his act to be sinful, as
appears by comparing [Lev 4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), or
not considering it, but falling into sin thro' the power of some sudden
passion or temptation, as the Hebrew word signifies, [Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067.md). Things which ought not to be
done - The words may be rendered, in or about every, or any of the
commandments of the Lord which should not be done; or, which concern
things that should not be done, namely, in any negative commands. (And
there is great reason why a sacrifice should be more necessary for
these, than for other sins, because affirmative precepts do not so
strictly and constantly bind men as the negative do.) Then he shall
offer according to his quality, which is here to be understood out of
the following verses.

[Leviticus 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 4:3</span></span>

If the priest - That is, the high - priest, who only was anointed after
the first time. His anointing is mentioned, because he was not compleat
high - priest 'till he was anointed. Do sin - Either in doctrine or
practice, which it is here supposed he may do. And this is noted as a
character of imperfection in the priesthood of the law, whereby the
Israelites were directed to expect another and better high - priest,
even one who is holy, harmless, and separate from sinners, [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md). According to the sin of the
people - In the same manner as any of the people do; which implies that
God expected more circumspection from him, than from the people. But the
words may be rendered, to the sin or guilt of the people, which may be
mentioned as an aggrevation of his sin, that by it he commonly brings
sin, and guilt, and punishment upon the people, who are infected or
scandalized by his example. A young bullock - The same sacrifice which
was offered for all the people, to shew how much his sin was aggravated
by his quality. Sin - offering - Heb. sin, which word is oft taken in
that sense.

[Leviticus 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 4:4</span></span>

On the head - To testify both his acknowledgment of his sin, and faith
in God's promise for the expiation of his sins through Christ, whom that
sacrifice typified. Kill the bullock - By one of the priests, whom he
should cause to do it.

[Leviticus 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 4:5</span></span>

To the tabernacle - Into the tabernacle; which was not required nor
allowed in any other sacrifice, possibly to shew the greatness of the
high - priest's sin, which needed more than ordinary diligence in him,
and favour from God to expiate it.

[Leviticus 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 4:6</span></span>

Seven times - A number much used in scripture, as a number of
perfection; and here prescribed, either to shew that his sins needed
more then ordinary purgation, and more exercise of his faith and
repentance, both which graces he was obliged to join with that
ceremonial rite. Before the veil - The second veil dividing between the
holy of holies, which is generally called the veil of the sanctuary.

[Leviticus 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 4:7</span></span>

All the blood - All the rest; for part was disposed elsewhere.

[Leviticus 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 4:12</span></span>

The whole bullock - So no part of this was to be eaten by the priests,
as it was in other sin - offerings. The reason is plain, because the
offerer might not eat of his own sin - offering, and the priest was the
offerer in this case, as also in the sin - offering for the whole
congregation below, of which the priest himself was a member. Shall be
carried forth - Not himself, which would have defiled him, but by
another whom he shall appoint for that work. Without the camp - To
signify either, The abominable nature of sin, especially in high and
holy persons, or when it overspreads a whole people. Or, The removing of
the guilt or punishment of that sin from the people. Or, That Christ
should suffer without the camp or gate. Where the ashes are - For the
ashes, though at first they were thrown down near the altar, [Lev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#016.md), yet afterwards they, together
with the filth of the sacrifices, were carried into a certain place
without the camp.

[Leviticus 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 4:13</span></span>

The whole congregation - The body of the people, or the greater part of
them, their rulers concurring with them.

[Leviticus 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 4:14</span></span>

A bullock - But if the sin of the congregation was only the omission of
some ceremonial duty, a kid of the goats was to be offered, [Num
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#024.md).

[Leviticus 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 4:15</span></span>

The elders - Who here acted in the name of all the people, who could not
possibly perform this act in their own persons.

[Leviticus 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 4:17</span></span>

And sprinkle it - It was not to be poured out there, but sprinkled only;
for the cleansing virtue of the blood of Christ was sufficiently
represented by sprinkling. It was sprinkled seven times: seven is a
number of perfection; because God made the world in six days, and rested
the seventh. This signified the perfect satisfaction Christ made, and
the compleat cleansing of our souls thereby.

[Leviticus 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 4:18</span></span>

The altar - Of incense: Which is before the Lord - That is, before the
holy of holies, where the Lord was in a more special manner present.

[Leviticus 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lev 4:20</span></span>

For a sin - offering - That is, for the priest's sin - offering, called
the first bullock, [Lev 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#021.md).

[Leviticus 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 4:24</span></span>

The burnt - offering - So called by way of eminency, to wit, the daily
burnt - offering. It is a sin - offering - And therefore to be killed
where the burnt - offering is killed; whereby it is distinguished from
the peace - offering, which were killed elsewhere.

[Leviticus 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 4:26</span></span>

It shall be forgiven - Both judicially, as to all ecclesiastical
censures or civil punishment; and really, upon condition of repentance
and faith in the Messiah to come.

[Leviticus 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 4:28</span></span>

A female - Which here was sufficient, because the sin of one of those
was less than the sin of the ruler, for whom a male was required.

[Leviticus 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 4:33</span></span>

He shall slay it - Not by himself, but by the hands of the priest.

[Leviticus 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lev 4:35</span></span>

Burn them - The fat; but he useth the plural number, because the fat was
of several kinds, as we saw [Lev
4:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#008.md), Heb. upon the offerings,
together with them, or after them; because the burnt - offerings were to
have the first place.
