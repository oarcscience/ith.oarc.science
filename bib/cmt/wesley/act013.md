### [Acts Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001)

[Acts 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 13:1</span></span>

Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod - His foster brother, now
freed from the temptations of a court.

[Acts 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 13:2</span></span>

Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them -
This was not ordaining them. St. Paul was ordained long before, and that
not of men, neither by man: it was only inducting him to the province
for which our Lord had appointed him from the beginning, and which was
now revealed to the prophets and teachers. In consequence of this they
fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, a rite which was used not
in ordination only, but in blessing, and on many other occasions.

[Acts 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 13:3</span></span>

Then having fasted - Again. Thus they did also, [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023).

[Acts 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 13:5</span></span>

In the synagogues - Using all opportunities that offered.

[Acts 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 13:6</span></span>

Paphos was on the western, Salamis on the eastern part of the island.

[Acts 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 13:7</span></span>

The proconsul - The Roman governor of Cyprus, a prudent man - And
therefore not overswayed by Elymas, but desirous to inquire farther.

[Acts 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 13:9</span></span>

Then Saul, who was also called Paul - It is not improbable, that coming
now among the Romans, they would naturally adapt his name to their own
language, and so called him Paul instead of Saul. Perhaps the family of
the proconsul might be the first who addressed to or spoke of him by
this name. And from this time, being the apostle of the Gentiles, he
himself used the name which was more familiar to them.

[Acts 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 13:10</span></span>

O full of all guile - As a false prophet, and all mischief - As a
magician. Thou son of the devil - A title well suited to a magician; and
one who not only was himself unrighteous, but laboured to keep others
from all goodness. Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord? - Even now thou hast heard the truth of the Gospel.

[Acts 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 13:11</span></span>

And immediately a mist - Or dimness within, and darkness without, fell
upon him.

[Acts 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 13:12</span></span>

Being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord - Confirmed by such a
miracle.

[Acts 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 13:13</span></span>

John withdrawing from them returned - Tired with the fatigue, or
shrinking from danger.

[Acts 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 13:14</span></span>

Antioch in Pisidia - Different from the Antioch mentioned [Act
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001).

[Acts 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 13:15</span></span>

And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the chief of the
synagogue sent to them - The law was read over once every year, a
portion of it every Sabbath: to which was added a lesson taken out of
the prophets. After this was over, any one might speak to the people, on
any subject he thought convenient. Yet it was a circumstance of decency
which Paul and Barnabas would hardly omit, to acquaint the rulers with
their desire of doing it: probably by some message before the service
began.

[Acts 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 13:16</span></span>

Ye that fear God - Whether proselytes or heathens.

[Acts 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 13:17</span></span>

The God - By such a commemoration of God's favours to their fathers, at
once their minds were conciliated to the speaker, they were convinced of
their duty to God, and invited to believe his promise, and the
accomplishment of it. [Act 13:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#017),
contain the whole sum of the Old Testament. Of this people - Paul here
chiefly addresses himself to those whom he styles, Ye that fear God: he
speaks of Israel first; and [Act
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#026), speaks more directly to the
Israelites themselves. Chose - And this exalted the people; not any
merit or goodness of their own, [Eze
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005). Our fathers - Abraham and his
posterity. [Isa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002).

[Acts 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 13:18</span></span>

[Deu 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#031).

[Acts 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 13:19</span></span>

Seven nations - Enumerated [Deu 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001);
about four hundred and fifty years - That is, from the choice of the
fathers to the dividing of the land; it was about four hundred and fifty
years.

[Acts 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 13:21</span></span>

He gave them Saul forty years - Including the time wherein Samuel judged
Israel.

[Acts 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 13:22</span></span>

Having removed him - Hence they might understand that the dispensations
of God admit of various changes. I have found David, a man after my own
heart - This expression is to be taken in a limited sense. David was
such at that time, but not at all times. And he was so, in that respect,
as he performed all God's will, in the particulars there mentioned: But
he was not a man after God's own heart, in other respects, wherein he
performed his own will. In the matter of Uriah, for instance, he was as
far from being a man after God's own heart as Saul himself was. It is
therefore a very gross, as well as dangerous mistake, to suppose this is
the character of David in every part of his behaviour. We must beware of
this, unless we would recommend adultery and murder as things after
God's own heart. [Sa1 16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012).

[Acts 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 13:24</span></span>

John having first preached - He mentions this, as a thing already known
to them. And so doubtless it was. For it gave so loud an alarm to the
whole Jewish nation, as could not but be heard of in foreign countries,
at least as remote as Pisidia.

[Acts 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 13:25</span></span>

His course - His work was quickly finished, and might therefore well be
termed a course or race. [Luk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016).

[Acts 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 13:27</span></span>

For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers - He here anticipates
a strong objection, "Why did not they at Jerusalem, and especially their
rulers, believe?" They know not him, because they understood not those
very prophets whom they read or heard continually. Their very condemning
him, innocent as he was, proves that they understood not the prophecies
concerning him.

[Acts 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 13:29</span></span>

They fulfilled all things that were written of him - So far could they
go, but no farther.

[Acts 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 13:31</span></span>

He was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to
Jerusalem - This last journey both presupposes all the rest, and was the
most important of all.

[Acts 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 13:33</span></span>

Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee - It is true, he was the
Son of God from eternity. The meaning therefore is, I have this day
declared thee to be my Son. As St. Paul elsewhere, declared to be the
Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead, [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004). And it is with peculiar propriety
and beauty that God is said to have begotten him, on the day when he
raised him from the dead, as he seemed then to be born out of the earth
anew. [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).

[Acts 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 13:34</span></span>

No more to return to corruption - That is, to die no more. I will give
you the sure mercies of David - The blessings promised to David in
Christ. These are sure, certain, firm, solid, to every true believer in
him. And hence the resurrection of Christ necessarily follows; for
without this, those blessings could not be given. [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003).

[Acts 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 13:35</span></span>

He saith - David in the name of the Messiah. [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).

[Acts 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 13:36</span></span>

David, having served the will of God in his generation, fell asleep - So
his service extended not itself beyond the bounds of the common age of
man: but the service of the Messiah to all generations, as his kingdom
to all ages. Served the will of God - Why art thou here thou who art yet
in the world? Is it not that thou also mayest serve the will of God? Art
thou serving it now? Doing all his will? And was added to his fathers -
Not only in body. This expression refers to the soul also, and supposes
the immortality of it.

[Acts 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 13:39</span></span>

Every one that believeth is justified from all things - Has the actual
forgiveness of all his sins, at the very time of his believing; from
which ye could not be justified - Not only ye cannot now; but ye never
could. For it afforded no expiation for presumptuous sins. By the law of
Moses - The whole Mosaic institution! The division of the law into moral
and ceremonial was not so common among the Jews, as it is among us. Nor
does the apostle here consider it at all: but Moses and Christ are
opposed to each other.

[Acts 13:40](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 13:40</span></span>

Beware - A weighty and seasonable admonition. No reproof is as yet added
to it.

[Acts 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 13:41</span></span>

I work a work which ye will in nowise believe - This was originally
spoken to those, who would not believe that God would ever deliver them
from the power of the Chaldeans. But it is applicable to any who will
not believe the promises, or the works of God. [Hab
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005).

[Acts 13:42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 13:42</span></span>

When the Jews were going out - Probably many of them, not bearing to
hear him, went out before he had done. The Sabbath between - So the Jews
call to this day the Sabbath between the first day of the month Tisri
(on which the civil year begins) and the tenth of the same month, which
is the solemn day of expiation.

[Acts 13:43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 13:43</span></span>

Who speaking to them - More familiarly, persuaded them to continue - For
trials were at hand, in the grace of God - That is, to adhere to the
Gospel or Christian faith.

[Acts 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">act 13:46</span></span>

Then Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said - Those who hinder others
must be publicly reproved. It was necessary - Though ye are not worthy:
he shows that he had not preached to them, from any confidence of their
believing, but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life -
They indeed judged none but themselves worthy of it. Yet their rejecting
of the Gospel was the same as saying, "We are unworthy of eternal life."
Behold! - A thing now present! An astonishing revolution! We turn to the
Gentiles - Not that they left off preaching to the Jews in other places.
But they now determined to lose no more time at Antioch on their
ungrateful countrymen, but to employ themselves wholly in doing what
they could for the conversion of the Gentiles there.

[Acts 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 13:47</span></span>

For so hath the Lord commanded us - By sending us forth, and giving us
an opportunity of fulfilling what he had foretold. I have set thee - The
Father speaks to Christ. [Isa 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006).

[Acts 13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 13:48</span></span>

As many as were ordained to eternal life - St. Luke does not say fore -
ordained. He is not speaking of what was done from eternity, but of what
was then done, through the preaching of the Gospel. He is describing
that ordination, and that only, which was at the very time of hearing
it. During this sermon those believed, says the apostle, to whom God
then gave power to believe. It is as if he had said, "They believed,
whose hearts the Lord opened;" as he expresses it in a clearly parallel
place, speaking of the same kind of ordination, [Act
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014), &c. It is observable, the
original word is not once used in Scripture to express eternal
predestination of any kind. The sum is, all those and those only, who
were now ordained, now believed. Not that God rejected the rest: it was
his will that they also should have been saved: but they thrust
salvation from them. Nor were they who then believed constrained to
believe. But grace was then first copiously offered them. And they did
not thrust it away, so that a great multitude even of Gentiles were
converted. In a word, the expression properly implies, a present
operation of Divine grace working faith in the hearers.
