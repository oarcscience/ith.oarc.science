### [Exodus Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 14:2</span></span>

They were got to the edge of the wilderness, [Exo
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#020.md), and one stage or two would have
brought them to Horeb, the place appointed for their serving God, but
instead of going forward, they are ordered to turn short off, on the
right - hand from Canaan, and to march towards the Red - sea. When they
were at Etham, there was no sea in their way to obstruct their passage;
but God himself orders them into straits, which might give them an
assurance, that when his purposes were served, he would bring them out
of those straits. Before Pi - hahiroth - Or the straits of Hiroth, two
great mountains, between which they marched. Migdol and Baal - zephon
were cities of Egypt and probably garrison'd.

[Exodus 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 14:3</span></span>

They are entangled - Inclosed with mountains, and garrisons, and
deserts.

[Exodus 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 14:5</span></span>

And it was told the king that the people fled - He either forgot, or
would not own that they had departed with his consent; and therefore was
willing it should be represented to him as a revolt from their
allegiance.

[Exodus 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 14:7</span></span>

Captains over every one of them - Or rather over all of them;
distributing the command of them to his several Captains.

[Exodus 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 14:8</span></span>

With an high hand - Boldly, resolutely.

[Exodus 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 14:9</span></span>

Chariots and horsemen - It should seem he took no foot with him, because
the king's business required haste.

[Exodus 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 14:10</span></span>

They were sore afraid - They knew the strength of the enemy, and their
own weakness; numerous indeed they were, but all foot, unarmed,
undisciplined, dispirited, by long servitude, and now pent up, so that
they could not escape. On one hand was Pi - hahiroth, a range of craggy
rocks unpassable; on the other hand were Migdol and Baal - zephon, forts
upon the frontiers of Egypt; before them was the sea, behind them were
the Egyptians; so that there was no way open for them but upwards, and
thence their deliverance came.

[Exodus 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 14:13</span></span>

Moses answered not these fools according to their folly: Instead of
chiding he comforts them, and with an admirable pretence of mind, not
disheartened either by the threatenings of Egypt, or the tremblings of
Israel, stills their murmuring, Fear ye not, It is our duty, when we
cannot get out of our troubles, yet to get above our fears, so that they
may only serve to quicken our prayers and endeavours, but may not
prevail to silence our faith and hope. Stand still, and think not to
save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and
observe them; Compose yourselves, by an entire confidence in God, into a
peaceful prospect of the great salvation God is now about to work for
you. Hold your peace, you need not so much as give a shout against the
enemy: the work shall be done without any concurrence of yours. In times
of great difficulty, it is our wisdom to keep our spirits calm, quiet,
and sedate, for then we are in the best frame both to do our own work,
and to consider the work of God.

[Exodus 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 14:15</span></span>

Wherefore criest thou unto me - Moses though he was assured of a good
issue, yet did not neglect prayer. We read not of one word he said in
prayer, but he lifted up his heart to God, and God well understood, and
took notice of. Moses's silent prayer prevailed more with God, than
Israel's loud out - cries. But is God displeased with Moses for praying?
No, he asks this question, Wherefore criest thou unto me? Wherefore
shouldst thou press thy petition any farther, when it is already
granted? Moses has something else to do besides praying, he is to
command the hosts of Israel. Speak to them that they go forward - Some
think Moses had prayed not so much for their deliverance, he was assured
of that; as for the pardon of their murmurings, and God's ordering them
to go forward, was an intimation of the pardon. Moses bid them stand
still and expect orders from God: and now orders are given. They thought
they must have been directed either to the right hand, or to the left;
no, saith God, speak to them to go forward, directly to the sea - side;
as if there had lain a fleet of transport ships ready for them to embark
in. Let the children of Israel go as far as they can upon dry ground,
and then God will divide the sea. The same power could have congealed
the waters for them to pass over, but infinite wisdom chose rather to
divide the waters for them to pass through, for that way of salvation is
always pitched upon which is most humbling.

[Exodus 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 14:19</span></span>

The angel of God - Whose ministry was made use of in the pillar of cloud
and fire, went from before the camp of Israel, where they did not now
need a guide; there was no danger of missing their way through the sea,
and came behind them, where now they needed a guard, the Egyptians being
just ready to seize the hindmost of them. There it was of use to the
Israelites, not only to protect them, but to light them through the sea;
and at the same time it confounded the Egyptians, so that they lost
sight of their prey, just when they were ready to lay hands on it. The
word and providence of God have a black and dark side towards sin and
sinners, but a bright and pleasant side towards those that are
Israelites indeed.

[Exodus 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 14:21</span></span>

We have here the history of that work of wonder which is so often
mentioned both in the Old and New Testament. An instance of God's
almighty power in dividing the sea, and opening a passage through the
waters. It was a bay, or gulf, or arm of the sea, two or three leagues
over. The God of nature has not tied himself to its laws, but when he
pleases dispenseth with them, and then the fire doth not burn, nor the
water flow. They went through the sea to the opposite shore; they walked
upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the pillar of cloud being
their rereward, the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and
on their left. Moses and Aaron it is likely ventured first, into this
untrodden path, and then all Israel after them; and this march through
the paths of the great waters would make their march afterwards through
the wilderness less formidable. This march through the sea was in the
night, and not a moon - shine night, for it was seven days after the
full moon, so that they had no light but what they had from the pillar
of fire. This made it the more awful, but where God leads us, he will
light us; while we follow his conduct we shall not want his comforts.

[Exodus 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 14:23</span></span>

And the Egyptians went in after them into the midst of the sea - They
thought, why might they not venture where Israel did? They were more
advantageously provided with chariots and horses, while the Israelites
were on foot.

[Exodus 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 14:24</span></span>

The Lord - Called the angel before, looked - With indignation, upon the
Egyptians, and troubled the Egyptians - With terrible winds and
lightnings and thunders, [Exo 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#010.md),
[Psa 77:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#018.md). Also with terror of
mind.

[Exodus 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 14:25</span></span>

They had driven furiously, but now they drove heavily, and found
themselves embarrassed at every step; the way grew deep, their hearts
grew sad, their wheels dropt off, and the axle - trees failed. They had
been flying upon the back of Israel as the hawk upon the dove; but now
they cried, Let us flee from the face of Israel.

[Exodus 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 14:26</span></span>

And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea - And
give a signal to the waters to close again, as before upon the word of
command they had opened to the right and the left. He did so, and
immediately the waters returned to their place, and overwhelmed all the
host of the Egyptians. Pharaoh and his servants, that had hardened one
another in sin, now fell together, and not one escaped. An ancient
tradition saith, That Pharaoh's magicians Jannes and Jambres perished
with the rest. Now God got him honour upon Pharaoh, a rebel to God, and
a slave to his own barbarous passions; perfectly lost to humanity,
virtue, and all true honour; here be lies buried in the deep, a
perpetual monument of divine justice: here he went down to the pit,
though he was the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

[Exodus 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 14:28</span></span>

After them - That is, after the Israelites.

[Exodus 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 14:30</span></span>

And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore - The Egyptians were
very curious in preserving the bodies of their great men, but here the
utmost contempt is poured upon all the grandees of Egypt; see how they
lie heaps upon heaps, as dung upon the face of the earth.

[Exodus 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 14:31</span></span>

And Israel feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his servant Moses
- Now they were ashamed of their distrusts and murmurings; and in the
mind they were in, they would never again despair of help from heaven;
no not in the greatest straits! They would never again quarrel with
Moses; nor talk of returning to Egypt. How well were it for us, if we
were, always in as good a frame, as we are in sometimes!
