### [Isaiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

Now - I will record it to he a witness for God, and against you, as
Moses did his song, [Deu 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019.md), [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md). To - To the Lord of the
vineyard. Of my beloved - Not devised by me, but inspired by God.
Vineyard - His church. Hill - Hills being places most commodious for
vines.

[Isaiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 5:2</span></span>

He gathered - He removed all hindrances, and gave them all the means of
fruitfulness. A tower - For the residence of the keepers.

[Isaiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 5:6</span></span>

Nor digged - Vine - dressers use to dig up and open the earth about the
roots of the vines. The meaning is, I will remove my ministers, who used
great care and diligence to make you fruitful. Thorns - I will give you
up to your own lusts. No rain - I will deprive you of all my blessings.

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

Pleasant - In whom God formerly delighted. A cry - From the oppressed,
crying to men for help, and to God for vengeance.

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

Alone - That they alone may be the lords and owners, and all others only
their tenants and servants.

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

In mine ears - I heard God speak what I am about to utter.

[Isaiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 5:10</span></span>

One bath - Of wine. The bath contained about eight gallons. Thus an acre
did not yield one gallon. An ephah - Which was of the same quantity with
the bath, only the bath was the measure of liquid things, the ephah of
dry things; and a ephah was the tenth part of an homer. So instead of
the increase which that fruitful land commonly yielded, they should
loose nine parts of their seed.

[Isaiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 5:12</span></span>

The harp - They give up themselves wholly to luxury. The work - What God
hath lately done, and is yet doing, and about to do among them; his
grievous judgments, partly inflicted, and partly threatened, which
required another course of life.

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

No knowledge - No serious consideration of God's works, and of their own
duty and danger. Honourable men - Who thought themselves quite out of
the reach of famine.

[Isaiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 5:14</span></span>

And he - That spends all his days in mirth and jollity.

[Isaiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md)

The mighty - All of them, both high and low, shall be brought to
destruction.

[Isaiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 5:16</span></span>

Exalted - By the execution of this just judgment. Sanctified - Shall
appear to be an holy God, by his righteous judgments.

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

Then - When God shall have finished that work of judgment. The lambs -
The poor and harmless people, who shall be left in the land when the
rich are carried into captivity. Manner - Or, by their fold, as this
word is manifestly used, [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md),
the only place of scripture, except this, in which this word is found.
Waste places - The lands left by their owners. Fat ones - Of the rich
and great men. Strangers - The poor Israelites, who were left to be vine
- dressers and husbandmen, [Kg2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md),
who are called strangers, because they were so, in reference to that
hand, not being the proper owners of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 5:18</span></span>

That draw - That are not only drawn to sin by the allurements of the
world; but are active and illustrious in drawing sin to themselves.
Cords - Or, with cords of lying, as the last word frequently signifies,
with vain and deceitful arguments and pretences, whereby sinners
generally draw themselves to sin. A rope - With all their might, as
beasts commonly do that draw carts with ropes.

[Isaiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 5:19</span></span>

Let him - God, in whose name thou and other prophets are always
threatening us. This was the plain language of their actions; they lived
as if they were of this opinion. The Holy One - They scornfully repeated
the title usually given by the prophets to God.

[Isaiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 5:20</span></span>

Rottenness - They shall be like a tree which not only withers in its
branches, but dies and rots at the roots, therefore is past recovery.
Dust - Shall be resolved into dust, and yield no fruit.

[Isaiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 5:26</span></span>

An ensign - To call them together for his service. From far - To the
Chaldeans; for even Babylon is called a far country, [Isa
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003.md). And he saith nations, because
the Chaldean army was made up of several nations. Will hiss - Or, will
whistle unto, or for them: will gather them together by his word. as
shepherds gather their sheep. He intimates how easily and speedily God
can do this work. From the ends - Which is not to be understood
strictly, but with a latitude, from very remote places.

the length or stonyness and ruggedness of the way. Whirlwind - For the
swiftness of their march, and for the force and violence of their
chariots in battle.

Roar - Which signifies both their cruelty, and their eagerness to devour
the prey.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">isa 5:30</span></span>
