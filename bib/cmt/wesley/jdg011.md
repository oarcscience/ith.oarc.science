### [Judges Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

[Judges 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 11:1</span></span>

Gileadite - So called, either from his father Gilead, or from the
mountain, or city of Gilead, the place of his birth. Son of a harlot -
That is, a bastard. And though such were not ordinarily to enter into
the congregation of the Lord, [Deu
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#002.md). Yet God can dispense with his
own laws, and hath sometimes done honour to base - born persons, so far,
that some of them were admitted to be the progenitors of the Lord Jesus
Christ. And Gilead - One of the children of that ancient Gilead, [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md).

[Judges 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 11:3</span></span>

Of Tob - The name either of the land, or of the man who was the owner or
ruler of it. This place was in, or near Gilead, as appears by the speedy
intercourse which here was between Jephthah and the Israelites. Vain men
- Idle persons, who desired rather to get their living by spoil and
rapine, than by honest labour. These evil persons Jephthah managed well,
employing them against the enemies of God, and of Israel, that bordered
upon them; and particularly upon parties of the Ammonites, which made
the Israelites more forward to chuse him for their chieftain in this
war. Went out - When he made excursions and attempts upon the enemy.

[Judges 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 11:4</span></span>

Made war - The Ammonites had vexed and oppressed them eighteen years,
and now the Israelites begin to make opposition, they commence a war
against them.

[Judges 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 11:5</span></span>

Went - By direction from God, who both qualified him for, and called him
to the office of a judge, otherwise they might not have chosen a
bastard.

[Judges 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 11:7</span></span>

Expel me - And deprive me of all share in my father's goods, which,
though a bastard, was due to me. This expulsion of him was the act of
his brethren; but he here ascribes it to the elders of Gilead; either
because some of them were among these elders, as is very probable from
the dignity of this family; or because this act, though desired by his
brethren, was executed by the decree of the elders, to whom the
determination of all controversies about inheritance belonged; and
therefore it was their faults they did not protect him from the injuries
of his brethren.

[Judges 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 11:8</span></span>

Therefore - Being sensible that we have done thee injury, we come now to
make thee full reparation.

[Judges 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 11:9</span></span>

If, &c. - If you recall me from this place where I am now settled, to
the place whence I was expelled. Shall I, &c. - Will you really make
good this promise? Jephthah was so solicitous in this case, either from
his zeal for the public good, which required that he should be so; or
from the law of self - preservation, that he might secure himself from
his brethren; whose ill - will he had experienced, and whose injuries he
could not prevent, if, after he had served their ends, he had been
reduced to his private capacity.

[Judges 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 11:10</span></span>

The Lord be witness - The Lord be an hearer: so the Hebrew word is.
Whatever we speak it concerns us to remember, that God is an hearer!

[Judges 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 11:11</span></span>

All his words - Or, all his matters, the whole business. Before the Lord
- That is, before the public congregation, wherewith God was usually,
and then especially present.

[Judges 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 11:12</span></span>

Messengers - That is, ambassadors, to prevent blood - shed, that so the
Israelites might be acquitted before God and men, from all the sad
consequences of this war; herein he shewed great prudence, and no less
piety. What hast thou, &c. - What reasonable cause hast thou for this
invasion? In my land - He speaks this in the name of all the people.

[Judges 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 11:13</span></span>

My land - That is, this land of Gilead, which was mine, but unjustly
taken from me, by Sihon and Og, the kings of the Ammonites; and the
injury perpetuated by Israel's detaining it from me. This land, before
the conquests of Sihon and Og, belonged partly to the Ammonites, and
partly to the Moabites. And indeed, Moab and Ammon did for the most part
join their interests and their forces.

[Judges 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 11:16</span></span>

The Red - sea - Unto which they came three times; once, [Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md), again, a little after their
passage over it, and a third time, long after, when they came to Ezion
Geber, which was upon the shore of the Red - Sea, from whence they went
to Kadesh; of this time he speaks here.

[Judges 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 11:17</span></span>

Abode - Peaceably, and did not revenge their unkindness as they could
have done.

[Judges 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 11:19</span></span>

My place - That is, unto the land of Canaan, which God hath given me.

[Judges 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 11:20</span></span>

Sihon fought - So Sihon was the aggressor, and the Israelites were
forced to fight in their own defence.

[Judges 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 11:22</span></span>

The coasts - Or, borders; together with all the land included within
those borders. Wilderness - Namely, the desert of Arabia.

[Judges 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 11:23</span></span>

So the Lord - God, the sovereign Lord of all lands, hath given us this
land; this he adds, as a farther and convincing reason; because
otherwise it might have been alledged against the former argument, that
they could gain no more right to that land from Sihon, than Sihon
himself had.

[Judges 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 11:24</span></span>

Wilt not thou - He speaks according to their absurd opinion: the
Ammonites and Moabites got their land by conquest of the old
inhabitants, whom they cast out; and this success, though given them by
the true God, for Lot's sake, [Deu
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#009.md), [Deu
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019.md), they impiously ascribe to their
god Chemosh, whose gift they owned to be a sufficient title.

[Judges 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 11:25</span></span>

Than Balak - Art thou wiser than he? Or hast thou more right than he
had? Balak, though he plotted against Israel, in defence of his own
land, which he feared they would invade and conquer, yet never contended
with them about the restitution of those lands which Sihon took from him
or his predecessors.

[Judges 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 11:26</span></span>

Three hundred years - Not precisely, but about that time, either from
their coming out of Egypt; or, from their first conquest of those lands.
He urges prescription, which is by all men reckoned a just title, and it
is fit it should be so for the good of the world, because otherwise the
door would be opened both to kings, and to private persons, for infinite
contentions and confusions.

[Judges 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 11:27</span></span>

I have not - I have done thee no wrong. Be judge - Let him determine
this controversy by the success of this day and war.

[Judges 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 11:29</span></span>

Spirit came - Indued him with a more than ordinary courage and
resolution. Manasseh - That is, Bashan, which the half tribe of Manasseh
beyond Jordan inhabited. Mizpeh of Gilead - So called to distinguish it
from other cities of the same name, having gathered what forces he
suddenly could, he came hither to the borders of the Ammonites.

[Judges 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jdg 11:33</span></span>

Minnith - A place not far from Rabbah, the chief city of the Ammonites.
Subdued before Israel - It does not appear, that he offered to take
possession of the country. Tho' the attempt of others to wrong us, will
justify us in the defence of our own right, yet it will not authorize us
to do them wrong.

[Judges 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jdg 11:34</span></span>

His daughter - In concert with other virgins, as the manner was.

[Judges 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jdg 11:35</span></span>

Trouble me - Before this, I was troubled by my brethren; and since, by
the Ammonites; and now most of all, tho' but occasionally, by thee.
Opened my mouth - That is, I have vowed. Cannot go back - That is, not
retract my vow; I am indispensably obliged to perform it.

[Judges 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jdg 11:36</span></span>

Do to me - Do not for my sake make thyself a transgressor; I freely give
my consent to thy vow.

[Judges 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jdg 11:37</span></span>

Mountains - Which she chose as a solitary place, and therefore fittest
for lamentation. Bewail - That I shall die childless, which was esteemed
both a curse and a disgrace for the Israelites, because such were
excluded from that great privilege of increasing the holy seed, and
contributing to the birth of the Messiah.

[Judges 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jdg 11:39</span></span>

Did with her - Jephthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but only devoted
to perpetual virginity. This appears, From [Jdg
11:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037.md), where we read, that she
bewailed not her death, which had been the chief cause of lamentation,
if that had been vowed, but her virginity: From this [Jdg
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#039.md), where, after he had said, that
he did with her according to his vow; he adds, by way of declaration of
the matter of that vow, and she knew no man. It is probably conceived,
that the Greeks, who used to steal sacred histories, and turn them into
fables, had from this history their relation of Iphigenia (which may be
put for Jephtigenia) sacrificed by her father Agamemnon, which is
described by many of the same circumstances wherewith this is
accompanied.

[Judges 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">jdg 11:40</span></span>

The daughter of Jephthah - It is really astonishing, that the general
stream of commentators, should take it for granted, that Jephthah
murdered his daughter! But, says Mr. Henry, "We do not find any law,
usage or custom, in all the Old Testament, which doth in the least
intimate, that a single life was any branch or article of religion." And
do we find any law, usage or custom there, which doth in the least
intimate, that cutting the throat of an only child, was any branch or
article of religion? If only a dog had met Jephthah, would he have
offered up that for a burnt - offering? No: because God had expressly
forbidden this. And had he not expressly forbidden murder? But Mr. Poole
thinks the story of Agamemnon's offering up Iphigenia took its rise from
this. Probably it did. But then let it be observed, Iphigenia was not
murdered. Tradition said, that Diana sent an hind in her stead, and took
the maid to live in the woods with her.
