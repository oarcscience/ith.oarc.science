Jakeh - Who lived either in Solomon's time, or rather afterwards, and
was famous in his generation for wisdom and piety. The prophecy - The
prophetical instruction; for as the prophets were public preachers as
well as foretellers of things to come, so their sermons, no less than
their predictions, are commonly called their prophecies. And Ucal - Two
friends and co - temporaries of Agur, who desired his instructions.

[Proverbs 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#002.md)

ignorance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 30:3</span></span>

Who - What mere man? None at all. Ascended - To learn the mind of God
who dwells there. Descended - To teach men below what he had learned
above. No man can fully know and teach us these things unless he hath
been in heaven, and sent down from thence to the earth for that end. In
his fists - To hold them in, or let them out at his pleasure? And none
but he who made and governs all creatures, can know and teach these
things. The waters - Those above the clouds, and those below, the sea
which God keeps as it were within doors, and the water which he shuts up
in the bowels of the earth. The earth - The whole earth from one end to
another, which God upholdeth in the air, by the word of his power. If -
If thou thinkest there be any man who can do these things, produce his
name; or if he be dead, the name of any of his posterity.

should serve him. Lest I take - Use false oaths either to vindicate
myself when I am suspected, or to gratify others, as poor men frequently
do.
