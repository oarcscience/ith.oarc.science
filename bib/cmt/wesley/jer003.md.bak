I am married - I am in covenant with you, and this covenant
notwithstanding all your unfaithfulness, I am ready to renew with you.
Family - This word is taken frequently for a country or nation, and this
may partly respect the fewness of those that will return. But chiefly it
respects God's exact care of them, that being now married to them, there
shall not be one in a city, or two in a country or tribe, but he will
find them out. Zion - The ten tribes did never return into their own
land, therefore this must be understood of a spiritual going up to Zion,
when all Israel shall be saved, [Rom

That whole worship with all the rites and ceremonies belonging to it
shall cease, Christ being come, who was the substance of what the ark,
and all other rites shadowed. Covenant - Called also the ark of the
testimony, because the two tables of the law, which were the testimony,
or witness of the covenant were in it. Any more - It shall be no more in
use; neither shall men trouble their thoughts about it, or mention it.

be the place of God's residence, where by his spirit he will rule and

church. Neither - Both Jews and Gentiles shall now conform themselves to
the will of God.
