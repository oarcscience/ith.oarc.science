### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 13:3</span></span>

Blew - That is, he sent messengers to tell them all what Jonathan had
done, and how the Philistines were enraged at it, and therefore what
necessity there was of gathering themselves together for their own
defence.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 13:4</span></span>

Saul - Perhaps contrary to some treaty.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 13:5</span></span>

Thirty thousand chariots, &c. - Most of them, we may suppose, carriages
for their baggage, not chariots of war, tho' all their allies were
joined with them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 13:6</span></span>

Strait - Notwithstanding their former presumption that if they had a
king, they should be free from all such straits. And hereby God intended
to teach them the vanity of confidence in men; and that they did not one
jot less need the help of God now, than they did when they had no king.
And probably they were the more discouraged, because they did not find
Samuel with Saul. Sooner or later men will be made to see, that God and
his prophets are their best friends.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 13:7</span></span>

All the people - That is, all that were left.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

Seven days - Not seven compleat days; for the last day was not finished.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 13:11</span></span>

Camest not - That is, when the seventh day was come, and a good part of
it past, whence I concluded thou wouldst not come that day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 13:12</span></span>

Supplication - Thence it appears, that sacrifices were accompanied with
solemn prayers. Forced myself - I did it against my own mind and
inclination.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 13:13</span></span>

For ever - The phrase, for ever, in scripture often signifies only a
long time. So this had been abundantly verified, if the kingdom had been
enjoyed by Saul, and by his son, and by his son's son; after whom the
kingdom might have come to Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 13:14</span></span>

A man - That is, such a man as will fulfil all the desires of his heart,
and not oppose them, as thou dost. Commanded - That is, hath appointed,
as the word command is sometimes used: but though God threatened but
Saul with the loss of his kingdom for his sin; yet it is not improbable,
there was a tacit condition implied, to wit, if he did not repent of
this; and of all his sins; for the full, and final, and peremptory
sentence of Saul's rejection, is plainly ascribed to another cause, [Sa1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011.md), [Sa1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023.md), [Sa1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#026.md), [Sa1
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#028.md), and 'till that second
offence, neither the spirit of the Lord departed from him, nor was David
anointed in his stead. "But was it not hard, to punish so little a sin
so severely?" It was not little: disobedience to an express command,
tho' in a small matter, is a great provocation. And indeed, there is no
little sin, because there is no little god to sin against. In general,
what to men seems a small offence, to him who knows the heart may appear
a heinous crime. We are taught hereby, how necessary it is, that we wait
on our God continually. For Saul is sentenced to lose his kingdom for
want of two or three hours patience.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 13:20</span></span>

Philistines - Not to the land of the Philistines, but to the stations
and garrisons which the Philistines retained in several parts of
Israel's land, though Samuel's authority had so far over - awed them,
that they durst not give the Israelites much disturbance. In these,
therefore, the Philistines kept all the smiths; and here they allowed
them the exercise of their art for the uses following.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 13:22</span></span>

Sword - It seems restrained to the six hundred that were with Saul and
Jonathan; for there were no doubt a considerable number of swords and
spears among the Israelites, but they generally hid them, as now they
did their persons, from the Philistines. And the Philistines had not yet
attained to so great a power over them, as wholly to disarm them, but
thought it sufficient to prevent the making of new arms; knowing that
the old ones would shortly be decayed, and useless. There were likewise
other arms more common in those times and places, than swords and
spears; to wit, bows and arrows, and slings and stones.
