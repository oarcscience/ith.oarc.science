### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 1:1</span></span>

Old - Being in the end of his seventieth year. No heat - Which is not
strange in a person who had been exercised with so many hardships in
war, and with such tormenting cares, and fears, and sorrows, for his own
sins (as divers of his Psalms witness) and for the sins and miseries of
his children and people. Besides, this might be from the nature of his
bodily distemper.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 1:2</span></span>

Servants - His physicians. Virgin - Whose natural heat is fresh and
wholesome, and not impaired with bearing or breeding of children. The
same counsel doth Galen give for the cure of some cold and dry
distempers. Stand - That is, minister unto him, or wait upon him, in his
sickness, as occasion requires. Lie in his bosom - As his wife: for that
she was so, may appear by divers arguments. First, otherwise this had
been a wicked course; which therefore neither his servants durst have
prescribed, nor would David have used, especially being now in a dying
condition. Secondly, it appears from this phrase of lying in his bosom,
which is everywhere in scripture mentioned as the privilege of a wife.
Thirdly, this made Adonijah's crime in desiring her to wife, so heinous
in Solomon's account, because he saw, that by marrying the king's wife
he designed to revive his pretence to the kingdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 1:4</span></span>

Knew her not - Which is mentioned to note the continuance and progress
of the king's malady.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 1:5</span></span>

Then - Upon notice of the desperateness of the king's disease, and the
approach of his death. Exalted - Entertained high thoughts and designs.
I will - As the right of the kingdom is mine, [Kg1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#006.md), so I will now take possession of
it. Prepared - As Absalom had done upon the like occasion, [Sa2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#001.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 1:6</span></span>

Displeased him - This is noted as David's great error, and the occasion
of Adonijah's presumption. Saying - He neither restrained him from, nor
reproved him for his miscarriages: which David well knew was a great
sin. Goodly man - This was a second ground of his confidence, because
his great comeliness made him amiable in the peoples eyes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 1:7</span></span>

They helped - Either because they thought the right of the crown was
his: or to secure and advance their own interest. It seems God left them
to themselves, to correct them for former miscarriages, with a rod of
their own making.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 1:10</span></span>

Called not - Because he knew they favoured Solomon his competitor.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 1:11</span></span>

Nathan spake - Being prompted to it both by his piety in fulfilling the
will of God declared to him, concerning Solomon's succession, [Sa2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md), and by his prudence, knowing
that Adonijah hated him for being the principal instrument of Solomon's
advancement. Bathsheba - Who being retired and private in her apartment,
was ignorant of what was done abroad: and, who was likely to be most
zealous in the cause, and most prevalent with David.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 1:26</span></span>

But me - Whom he knew to be acquainted with thy mind, and with the mind
of God in this matter: and therefore his neglect of me herein gives me
cause to suspect that this is done without thy privity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 1:27</span></span>

Shewed thy servant - Who, having been an instrument in delivering God's
message to thee concerning thy successor, might reasonably expect that
if the king had changed his mind, thou wouldest have acquainted me with
it, as being both a prophet os the Lord, and one whom thou hast always
found faithful to thee.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 1:28</span></span>

Call Bathsheba - Who, upon Nathan's approach to the king had modestly
withdrawn.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 1:29</span></span>

Out of all distress - The words contain a grateful acknowledgement of
the goodness of God to him, in bringing him safe through the many
difficulties, which had lain in his way, and which he now mentions to
the glory of God, (as Jacob when he lay a dying) thus setting to his
seal, from his own experience that the Lord redeemeth the souls of his
servants.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 1:31</span></span>

Live for ever - Though I desire thy oath may be kept, and the right of
succession confirmed to my son, yet I am far from thirsting after thy
death, and would rather rejoice, if it were possible for thee to live
and enjoy the crown for ever.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 1:33</span></span>

My mule - As a token that the royal dignity is transferred upon Solomon,
and that by my consent. Gihon - A river near Jerusalem, on the west
side. Adonijah was inaugurated on the east side. This place David chose,
either, as remote from Adonijah and his company, that so the people
might be there without fear of tumults or bloodshed; or, to shew that
Solomon was chosen king in opposition to Adonijah: or, because this was
a place of great resort, and fit to receive and display that numerous
company, which he knew would follow Solomon thither.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 1:34</span></span>

Anoint - As they used to do where there was any thing new or
extraordinary in the succession. And this unction signified both the
designation of the persons to the office, and the gifts and graces which
were necessary for their office, and which, they, seeking them sincerely
from God, might expect to receive.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg1 1:35</span></span>

My stead - My deputy and vice - king whilst I live, and absolutely king
when I die. And Judah - This is added, lest the men of Judah, who were
in a special manner invited by Adonijah, [Kg1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#009.md), might think themselves exempted
from his jurisdiction.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">kg1 1:47</span></span>

Bowed himself - Adoring God for this great mercy, and thereby declaring
his hearty consent to this action.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">kg1 1:48</span></span>

Blessed, &c. - It is a great satisfaction to good men, when they are
going out of the world, to see their children rising up in their stead,
to serve God and their generation: and especially to see peace upon
Israel, and the establishment of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">kg1 1:51</span></span>

His servants - He owns Solomon as his king, and himself as his servant
and subject; and being sensible of his guilt, and of the jealousy which
kings have of their competitors, could not be satisfied without
Solomon's oath.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">kg1 1:53</span></span>

Go to thine house - Lead a private life, without noise and numerous
attendants, and meddle not with the affairs of the kingdom.
