<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#002">Psalms 144:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">psa 144:2</A></FONT></span></p>Subdued - Who hath disposed my peoples hearts to receive and obey me as their king. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#005">Psalms 144:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">psa 144:5</A></FONT></span></p>Come - To help me. Smoke - As Sinai did at thy glorious appearance, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018">Exo 19:18</A>. This is a figurative and poetical description of God's coming to take vengeance upon his enemies. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007">Psalms 144:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">psa 144:7</A></FONT></span></p>Strange children - Either of the Heathen nations: or of the rebellious Israelites.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 144:8</A></FONT></span></p>Vanity - Vain brags and threatenings which shall come to nothing. Falsehood - Deceiving themselves, by being unable to do what they designed; and others, by not giving them that help which they promised. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#012">Psalms 144:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 144:12</A></FONT></span></p>That - This mercy I beg not only for my own sake, but for the sake of thy people, that they may enjoy those blessings which thou hast promised them; and particularly, that our sons, who are the strength and hopes of a nation, may be like plants, flourishing and growing in height and strength, as plants do in their youth; for when they grow old, they wither and decay. Cornerstone - Strong and beautiful. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#014">Psalms 144:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">psa 144:14</A></FONT></span></p>Breaking in - Of enemies invading the land, or assaulting our cities, and making breaches in their walls. Going out - Of our people, either out of the cities to fight with an invading enemy: or out of the land into captivity.
