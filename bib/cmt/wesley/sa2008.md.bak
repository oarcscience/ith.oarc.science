### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 8:1</span></span>

And David took - Gath and her towns, as it is expressed in the parallel
place, [Ch1 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001.md). Which are called
Metheg - ammah, or the bridle of Ammah, Gath was situate in the mountain
of Ammah; and because this being the chief city of the Philistines, and
having a king, which none of the rest had, was the bridle which had
hitherto kept the Israelites in subjection.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 8:2</span></span>

Moab - For although the king of Moab, out of hatred to Saul, gave
protection to his parents, [Sa1
22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#003.md), yet the Moabites were
perpetual and sworn enemies to the Israelites, who therefore were
forbidden to admit them into the congregation of the Lord. And though
God commanded them in their march to Canaan, to spare the Moabites, yet
afterwards they proved fierce enemies to God and his people, and thereby
provoked God to alter his carriage towards them. Measured them - That
is, having conquered the land, he made an estimate of it, and
distributed the towns and people into three parts. Casting down -
Overthrowing their towns, and utterly destroying their people in manner
following. And now that prophecy, [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md), was accomplished.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 8:3</span></span>

As he went - David, remembering the grant which God had made to his
people of all the land as far as Euphrates, and having subdued his
neighbouring enemies, went to recover his rights, and stablish his
dominion as far as Euphrates.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 8:4</span></span>

Seven hundred - Or, seven hundred companies of horsemen, that is, in all
seven thousand; as it is [Ch1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#004.md),
there being ten in each company, and each ten having a ruler or captain.
Houghed - - That is, cut the sinews of their legs, that they might be
useless for war.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 8:5</span></span>

Of Damascus - That is, who were subject to Damascus, the chief city of
Syria.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 8:7</span></span>

On the servants - Or rather, which were with the servants, that is,
committed to their custody, as being kept in the king's armoury: for it
is not probable they carried them into the field.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 8:8</span></span>

From Betah, &c. - In [Ch1 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#008.md), it is,
from Tibhath, and from Chun. Either therefore the same cities were
called by several names, as is usual, the one by the Hebrews, the other
by the Syrians, or those were two other cities, and so the brass was
taken out of these four cities.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 8:14</span></span>

The Lord preserved, &c. - All David's victories were typical of the
success of the gospel over the kingdom of Satan, in which the Son of
David rode forth, conquering and to conquer, and will reign 'till he has
brought down all opposing rule, principality and power.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 8:16</span></span>

Recorder - The treasurer, who examined all the accounts, and kept
records of them.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 8:17</span></span>

Scribe - Or, secretary of state.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 8:18</span></span>

Cherethites, &c. - The Cherethites and Pelethites were undoubtedly
soldiers, and such as were eminent for their valour and fidelity. Most
probable they were the king's guards, which consisted of these two
bands, who might be distinguished either by their several weapons, or by
the differing time or manner of their service. They are supposed to be
thus called either, first, from their office, which was upon the king's
command to cut off or punish offenders, and to preserve the king's
person, as their names in the Hebrew tongue may seem to imply. Or,
secondly, from some country, or place to which they had relation. As for
the Cherithites, it is certain they were ether a branch of the
Philistines, or a people neighbouring to them, and so might the
Pelethites be too, though that be not related in scripture. And these
Israelites and soldiers of David might be so called, either because they
went and lived with David when he dwelt in those parts or, for some
notable exploit against, or victory over these people.
