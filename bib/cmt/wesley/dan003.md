### [Daniel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 3:1</span></span>

Made an image - Perhaps he did this, that he might seem no ways inclined
to the Jews, or their religion, whereof the Chaldeans might be jealous,
seeing he had owned their God to be greatest, and had preferred Daniel
and his friends to great honours.

[Daniel 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 3:4</span></span>

Nations and languages - Proclamation was made therefore in several
languages.

[Daniel 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 3:16</span></span>

We are not careful - Heb. We care not: there is no need of any answer in
this case for it is in vain for us to debate the matter; the king is
resolved to have his will of us, and we are resolved on the contrary.

[Daniel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 3:18</span></span>

But if not - It was therefore all one to them, which way God would
honour himself; they were resolved to suffer rather than sin, and leave
the cause to God. Indeed if God be for us, we need not fear what man can
do unto us. Let him do his worst. God will deliver us either from death,
or in death.

[Daniel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 3:20</span></span>

To bind - What did he think these three men would have refused? Or that
their God would defend them from his power, or that if he had, his
mighty men could have prevailed? None of all this was the case; for God
purposed to shew his power when the king did his worst, and in the thing
wherein he dealt proudly, to be above him.

[Daniel 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 3:23</span></span>

Fell down - All this is exprest with emphasis, to make the power of God
more glorious in their preservation; for that shame that slew the
executioners, might much more easily have killed them, even before they
fell down.

[Daniel 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 3:25</span></span>

No hurt - See how the God of nature can when he pleases control the
powers of nature! The Son of God - Probably he had heard David speak of
him. Jesus Christ, the Angel of the covenant, did sometimes appear
before his incarnation. Those who suffer for Christ, have his gracious
presence with them in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, even
in the valley of the shadow of death, and therefore need fear no evil.

[Daniel 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 3:26</span></span>

And spake - With a milder tone than before, God having abated the fire
of his fury. Now he could at once acknowledge the true God to be the
most high above all gods, and the three worthies to be his faithful
servants.
