### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

Sheba - Of that part of Arabia, called Shabaea, which was at great
distance from Jerusalem, bordering upon the Southern Sea; for there,
much more than in Ethiopia, were the commodities which she brought, [Kg1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002), [Kg1
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010). Name of the Lord - That is,
concerning God; the name of God being often put for God; concerning his
deep knowledge in the things of God. For it is very probable she had, as
had divers other Heathens, some knowledge of the true God, and an
earnest desire to know more concerning him. Questions - Concerning
natural, and civil, and especially, Divine things.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 10:2</span></span>

All her heart - Of all the doubts and difficulties wherewith her mind
was perplexed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 10:4</span></span>

House - Or, the houses, the temple and the king's house, in both which
there were evidences of singular wisdom.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 10:5</span></span>

Sitting - The order and manner in which his courtiers, or other subjects
(who all were his servants in a general sense) sat down at meals, at
several tables in his court. Attendance - Upon the king, both at his
table, and in his court; and when he went abroad to the temple or other
places. Apparel - Both the costliness of it, and especially the
agreeableness of it to their several places and offices. Went up - From
his own palace. See [Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018), but
the ancients, and some others, translate the words thus, and the burnt -
offerings which he offered up in the house of the Lord; under which, is
the chief, all other sacrifices are understood: when she saw the manner
of his offering sacrifices to the Lord; which doubtless she would not
neglect to see; and in the ordering of which she might discern many
characters of excellent wisdom, especially when she had so excellent an
interpreter as Solomon was, to inform her of the reasons of all the
circumstances of that service. No spirit - She was astonished, and could
scarcely determine whether she really saw these things, or whether it
was only a pleasant dream.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 10:8</span></span>

Happy, &c. - With much more reason may we say this of Christ's servants:
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be always praising
thee.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

Six hundred, &c. - Which amounts to about three millions of our money.
And this gold did not come from Ophir in India, or Tharshish; but from
Arabia and Ethiopia, which then were replenished with gold, though
exhausted by the insatiable avarice of succeeding Ages.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 10:15</span></span>

Merchant - men - Heb. of the searchers; either merchants, who use to
search out commodities: or, the gatherers of the king's revenues, who
used to search narrowly into all wares, that the king might not be
defrauded of his rights. Spice - merchants - Or rather, of the merchants
in general, as the word is often used. So this and the former particular
contain both the branches of the king's revenue, what he had from the
land, and what he had from the merchants and traders. Kings - Of those
parts of Arabia which were next to Canaan, which were either conquered
by David, or submitted to pay tribute to Solomon. But we must not think
all these to be kings of large dominions; many of them were only
governors of cities, and the territories belonging to them, such as were
formerly in Canaan, and were anciently called kings. The country - Or,
of the land; the land of Arabia: whereof some parts were so far
conquered, that he had governors of his own over them, who were each of
them to take care of the king's revenue in his jurisdiction; and part
only so far, that they still had kings of their own, but such as were
tributaries to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 10:16</span></span>

Targets - For pomp and magnificence, and to be carried before him, by
his guard, when he went abroad. The Roman magistrates had rods and axes
carried before them, in token of their power to correct the bad: but
Solomon shields and targets, to shew he took more pleasure in his power
to defend and protect the good.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 10:17</span></span>

Shields - Smaller than targets.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 10:19</span></span>

Round - Made like the half of a circle.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 10:21</span></span>

Nothing - Comparatively. Such hyperbolical expressions are frequent both
in scripture and other authors. But if gold in abundance, would make
silver seem so despicable, shall not wisdom and grace, and the
foretastes of heaven, make gold seem much more so?

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 10:22</span></span>

Tharshish - Ships that went to Tharshish. For Tharshish was the name of
a place upon the sea, famous for its traffick with merchants, and it was
a place very remote from Judea, as appears from the three years usually
spent in that voyage. But whether it was Spain, where in those times
there was abundance of gold and silver, as Strabo and others affirm; or,
some place in the Indies, it is needless to determine.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 10:24</span></span>

All the earth - That is, all the kings of the earth, (as it is expressed
[Ch2 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#023),) namely of those parts of
the earth.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 10:28</span></span>

Horses, &c. - The two chief commodities of Egypt. Price - Solomon
received them from Pharaoh at a price agreed between them, and gave this
privilege to his merchants, for a tribute to be paid out of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 10:29</span></span>

Chariot - This is not to be understood of the chariots and horses
themselves, but for the lading of chariots and horses, which consisting
of fine linen and silk, were of great value: and the king's custom,
together with the charges of the journey, amounted to these sums.
Hittites - A people dwelling principally in the northern and eastern
parts of Canaan, [Jos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004), whom the
Israelites, contrary to their duty, suffered to live amongst them, [Jdg
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#005), who afterwards grew numerous and
potent, and, it may be, sent out colonies (after the manner of the
ancient times) into some parts of Syria and Arabia. And possibly, these
kings of the Hittites may be some of those kings of Arabia, [Kg1
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#015).
