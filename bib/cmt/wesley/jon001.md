### [Jonah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001)

[Jonah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 1:5</span></span>

Into the sides - ln some cabin or other, whither he went before the
storm arose.

[Jonah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 1:6</span></span>

Will think upon us - With pity and favour.

[Jonah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 1:7</span></span>

Cast lots - "Lots are an appeal to heaven in doubtful cases, and
therefore not to be used but where the matter is undeterminable in any
other way."

[Jonah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 1:8</span></span>

Tell us - What hast thou done, for which God is so angry with thee, and
with us for thy sake?

[Jonah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 1:9</span></span>

I fear - I worship and serve the true God; the eternal and almighty God,
who made and ruleth the heavens.

[Jonah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jon 1:13</span></span>

Rowed hard - They were willing to be at any labour to save him.

[Jonah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jon 1:14</span></span>

Unto the Lord - Now they all cry to Jonah's God, to Jehovah. And said -
Let us not perish for taking away his life. Hast done - Sending the
tempest, arresting the prophet by it, detecting him by lot, sentencing
him by his own mouth, and confirming the condemning sentence by the
continuance of the storm.

[Jonah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jon 1:16</span></span>

Feared the Lord - Perhaps as Jonah's casting over - board was a type of
Christ's death, so the effect it had upon the mariners might be a type
of the conversion of the Heathen from idols unto God. Made vows -
Probably they vowed, they would ever worship him whom Jonah preached,
the Creator of heaven and earth.

[Jonah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jon 1:17</span></span>

A great fish - The Hebrew word is, numbered, has appointed him for
Jonah's receiver and deliverer. God has the command of all his
creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his
people.

[Jonah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 1:2</span></span>

That great city - It is said to have been one hundred and fifty furlongs
in length, that is eighteen miles and three quarters, and eleven miles
and one quarter in breadth.

[Jonah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 1:3</span></span>

From the presence - From the place where God usually had shewed himself
present, by revealing his word and will to his prophets. Perhaps he
might think God would not put him upon this work, when he was got into a
strange country.
