### [Psalms Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 59:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 59:4</span></span>

Run - To and fro, to receive Saul's commands, and to execute them with
all speed.

[Psalms 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 59:5</span></span>

The God - A God in covenant with all true Israelites, whom thou hast
promised to protect and bless. The heathen - Or, these heathens, who
though they are Israelites by birth; yet in their dispositions they are
mere Heathens. Be not - For indeed thou canst not according to thy word,
be merciful to such incorrigible offenders.

[Psalms 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 59:6</span></span>

Return - Watching for me: which they did at this time all the night
long, [Sa1 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011.md). A dog - When he is
pursuing his prey. Go round - When they did not find him in his own
house, they sought for him in other parts of the city.

[Psalms 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 59:7</span></span>

Pour out - Sharp and bitter word's, abundantly and vehemently, as a
fountain doth waters, as this word signifies. Swords - Words as keen and
mischievous as swords. For who - David doth not hear us, and God either
doth not hear, or not regard what we say.

[Psalms 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 59:10</span></span>

Prevent - Thou wilt help me sooner than I expect.

[Psalms 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 59:11</span></span>

My people - Over whom thou hast appointed me to be governor in due time.
Forget - Their former danger, and thy glorious mercy in delivering them.
Scatter - Let them wander from place to place, that they may carry the
tokens of thy justice, and their own shame to all places.

[Psalms 59:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 59:12</span></span>

Pride - For their proud and insolent speeches against thee. Lying - For
their execrations and lying reports, which they have spread concerning
me.

[Psalms 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 59:13</span></span>

Not be - In the land of the living any more.
