### [1 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 4:1</span></span>

The sons - The posterity: for only Pharez was his immediate son. But
they are all mentioned here only to shew Shobal's descent from Judah.

[1 Chronicles 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 4:9</span></span>

Honourably - For courage, and for fervent piety. She records this, that
it might be a memorandum to herself, to be thankful to God as long as
she lived, for bringing her through that sorrow: and a memorandum to
him, that she bore him into a vale of tears, in which he might expect
few days and full of trouble. And the sorrow in his name might serve to
put a seriousness upon his spirit.

[1 Chronicles 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 4:10</span></span>

Called - When he was undertaking some great and dangerous service.
Enlarge - Drive out these Canaanites, whom thou hast commanded us to
root out. Grieve - That it may not oppress and overcome me: more is
understood than is expressed. He useth this expression in allusion to
his name, which signifies grief. And God granted, &c. - Prospered him
remarkably in his undertakings, in his studies, in his worldly business,
and in his conflicts with the Canaanites.

[1 Chronicles 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 4:12</span></span>

Rechab - From these are sprung the present inhabitants of Rechab, a town
not elsewhere mentioned.

[1 Chronicles 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 4:14</span></span>

Father - Of the inhabitants of the valley.

[1 Chronicles 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 4:21</span></span>

Shelah - Having treated of the posterity of Judah by Pharez, and by
Zara, he now comes to his progeny by Shelah.

[1 Chronicles 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 4:22</span></span>

Had dominion - Which they ruled in the name and for the use of the kings
of Judah, to whom Moab was subject from David's time. Ancient things -
The sense is those blessed times are long since past. Our ancestors had
the dominion over the Heathen, but their degenerate posterity are slaves
in Chaldea, were they are employed as potters or gardeners, or in other
servile works.

[1 Chronicles 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 4:23</span></span>

There are - He seems to oppose their present servitude to their former
glory, and to shew their mean spirits that had rather tarry among the
Heathen to do their drudgery, than return to Jerusalem to serve God and
enjoy their freedom. The king - Of Babylon: esteeming it a greater
honour to serve that earthly monarch in the meanest employments, than to
serve the king of kings in his temple.

[1 Chronicles 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 4:27</span></span>

Of Judah - The tribe of Simeon did not increase proportionably to the
tribe of Judah in which they dwelt; as appears by those two catalogues,
[Num 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#022.md), [Num
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#014.md), which is to be ascribed to
God's curse upon them, delivered by the mouth of holy Jacob, [Gen
49:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md), and signified by Moses's
neglect of them when he blessed all the other tribes.

[1 Chronicles 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 4:31</span></span>

Their cities - Several of these cities though given to Simeon by Joshua,
yet through the sloth or cowardice of that tribe, were not taken from
the Philistines, until David's time, who took some of them; and, the
Simeonites having justly forfeited their right to them by their neglect,
gave them to his own tribe. For it is evident concerning Ziklag, one of
them, that it was in the Philistines hands in David's time, and by them
given to him, and by him annexed to the tribe of Judah, [Sa1
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006.md).

[1 Chronicles 4:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 4:40</span></span>

Fat pasture, &c. - Those who thus dwelt (as we do) in a fruitful
country, and whose land is wide and quiet and peaceable, have reason to
own themselves indebted to that God, who appoints the bounds of our
habitation. Of Ham - The Canaanites, who descended from Ham. And
accordingly these words contain a reason, why they went and possessed
this place, because it was not in the hands of their brethren of Judah,
but in the possession of that people which they had authority to expel.
