### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001)

[Ezra 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ezr 8:3</span></span>

Males - Though the males only be expressed yet doubtless they carried
the women along with them, as they did the little ones.

[Ezra 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ezr 8:13</span></span>

Whose names are, &c. - It seems the rest came before; so that now all
the sons of that family returned.

[Ezra 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ezr 8:15</span></span>

Of Levi - None who were simple Levites, and not the priests. And
therefore the Levites mentioned, [Ezr
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#007), by anticipation were not yet come
to him.

[Ezra 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ezr 8:18</span></span>

By the good hand - If where ministers have been wanting, the vacancies
are well supplied, let us ascribe it to the good hand of God, qualifying
them for the service, inclining them to it, and opening a door for them.

[Ezra 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ezr 8:21</span></span>

A fast - For public mercies. Publick prayers must be made, that all who
are to share in the comfort, may share in the requests for it. Afflict
ourselves - For our sins; and so be qualified for the pardon of them.
When we are entering on any new condition of life, our care should be to
bring into it none of the guilt of the sins of our former condition.
When we are in any imminent danger, let us make our peace with God, and
then nothing can hurt us. Right way - A safe and prosperous journey;
such a way and course as might be best for us.

[Ezra 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ezr 8:23</span></span>

Intreated - He gave us an assurance of his gracious answer to our
request.

[Ezra 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ezr 8:35</span></span>

Sin offering - For it is the atonement that secures every mercy to us,
which will not be truly comfortable, unless iniquity be taken away, and
our peace made with God. They offer twelve bullocks, twelve he - goats,
and ninety six rams, (eight times twelve) signifying the union of the
two kingdoms. They did not any longer go two tribes one way, and ten
tribes another; but all the twelve met by their representatives at the
same altar.
