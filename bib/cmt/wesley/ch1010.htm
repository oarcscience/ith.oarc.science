<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">ch1 10:1</A></FONT></span></p>The men of Israel fled, &amp;c. - Thus princes sin and the people suffer for it. No doubt there was enough in them to deserve it. But that which divine justice had chiefly an eye to, was the sin of Saul. Great men should in an especial manner, take heed of provoking God's wrath. For if they kindle that fire, they know not how many may be consumed by it for their sakes.

Shall Dagon have so great a place in their triumphs, and the true God be forgotten in ours?

Nor 'till he was brought to the last extremity. And then it was too late.
