### [1 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 9:1</span></span>

Am I not free? am I not an apostle? - That is, Have not I the liberty of
a common Christian? yea, that of an apostle? He vindicates his
apostleship, [Co1 9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md): his
apostolical liberty, [Co1 9:4-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004.md). Have
I not seen Jesus Christ? - Without this he could not have been one of
those first grand witnesses. Are not ye my work in the Lord - A full
evidence that God hath sent me? And yet some, it seems, objected to his
being an apostle, because he had not asserted his privilege in demanding
and receiving such maintenance from the churches as was due to that
office.

[1 Corinthians 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 9:2</span></span>

Ye are the seal of my apostleship - Who have received not only faith by
my mouth, but all the gifts of the Spirit by my hands.

[1 Corinthians 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 9:3</span></span>

My answer to them who examine me - Concerning my apostleship. Is this -
Which I have now given.

[1 Corinthians 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 9:4</span></span>

Have we not power - I and my fellowlabourers. To eat and to drink - At
the expense of those among whom we labour.

[1 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 9:5</span></span>

Have we not power to lead about with us a sister, a wife - And to demand
sustenance for her also? As well as the other apostles - Who therefore,
it is plain, did this. And Peter - Hence we learn, That St. Peter
continued to live with his wife after he became an apostle: That he had
no rights as an apostle which were not common to St. Paul.

[1 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 9:6</span></span>

To forbear working - With our hands.

[1 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 9:8</span></span>

Do I speak as a man - Barely on the authority of human reason? Does not
God also say, in effect, the same thing? The ox that treadeth out the
corn - This was the custom in Judea, and many eastern nations. In
several of them it is retained still. And at this day, horses tread out
the corn in some parts of Germany.

[1 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 9:9</span></span>

Doth God - In this direction. Take care for oxen - Only? Hath he not a
farther meaning? And so undoubtedly he hath in all the other Mosaic laws
of this kind.

[1 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 9:10</span></span>

He who ploweth ought to plow in hope - Of reaping. This seems to be a
proverbial expression. And he that thresheth in hope - Ought not to be
disappointed, ought to eat the fruit of his labours. And ought they who
labour in God's husbandry. [Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md)

[1 Corinthians 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 9:11</span></span>

Is it a great matter if we shall reap as much of your carnal things - As
is needful for our sustenance? Do you give us things of greater value
than those you receive from us?

[1 Corinthians 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 9:12</span></span>

If others - Whether true or false apostles. Partake of this power - Have
a right to be maintained. Do not we rather - On account of our having
laboured so much more? Lest we should give any hinderance to the gospel
- By giving an occasion of cavil or reproach.

[1 Corinthians 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 9:14</span></span>

[Mat 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)

[1 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 9:15</span></span>

It were better for me to die than - To give occasion to them that seek
occasion against me, [Co2 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 9:17</span></span>

Willingly - He seems to mean, without receiving anything. St. Paul here
speaks in a manner peculiar to himself. Another might have preached
willingly, and yet have received a maintenance from the Corinthians. But
if he had received anything from them, he would have termed it preaching
unwillingly. And so, in the next verse, another might have used that
power without abusing it. But his own using it at all, he would have
termed abusing it. A dispensation is intrusted to me - Therefore I dare
not refrain.

[1 Corinthians 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 9:18</span></span>

What then is my reward - That circumstance in my conduct for which I
expect a peculiar reward from my great Master? That I abuse not - Make
not an unseasonable use of my power which I have in preaching the
gospel.

[1 Corinthians 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 9:19</span></span>

I made myself the servant of all - I acted with as self - denying a
regard to their interest, and as much caution not to offend them, as if
I had been literally their servant or slave. Where is the preacher of
the gospel who treads in the same steps?

[1 Corinthians 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 9:20</span></span>

To the Jews I became as a Jew - Conforming myself in all things to their
manner of thinking and living, so far as; I could with innocence. To
them that are under the law - Who apprehend themselves to be still bound
by the Mosaic law. As under the law - Observing it myself, while I am
among them. Not that he declared this to be necessary, or refused to
converse with those who did not observe it. This was the very thing
which he condemned in St. Peter, [Gal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#014.md).

[1 Corinthians 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 9:21</span></span>

To them that are without the law - The heathens. As without the law -
Neglecting its ceremonies. Being not without the law to God - But as
much as ever under its moral precepts. Under the law to Christ - And in
this sense all Christians will be under the law for ever.

[1 Corinthians 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 9:22</span></span>

I became as weak - As if I had been scrupulous too. I became all things
to all men - Accommodating myself to all, so far as I could consistent
with truth and sincerity.

[1 Corinthians 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 9:24</span></span>

Know ye not that - In those famous games which are kept at the isthmus,
near your city. They who run in the foot race all run, though but one
receiveth the prize - How much greater encouragement have you to run;
since ye may all receive the prize of your high calling!

[1 Corinthians 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 9:25</span></span>

And every one that there contendeth is temperate in all things - To an
almost incredible degree; using the most rigorous self denial in food,
sleep, and every other sensual indulgence. A corruptible crown - A
garland of leaves, which must soon wither. The moderns only have
discovered that it is "legal" to do all this and more for an eternal
crown than they did for a corruptible!

[1 Corinthians 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 9:26</span></span>

I so run, not as uncertainly - I look straight to the goal; I run
straight toward it. I cast away every weight, regard not any that stand
by. I fight not as one that beateth the air - This is a proverbial
expression for a man's missing his blow, and spending his strength, not
on his enemy, but on empty air.

[1 Corinthians 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 9:27</span></span>

But I keep under my body - By all kinds of self denial. And bring it
into subjection - To my spirit and to God. The words are strongly
figurative, and signify the mortification of the body of sin, "by an
allusion to the natural bodies of those who were bruised or subdued in
combat. Lest by any means after having preached - The Greek word means,
after having discharged the office of an herald, (still carrying on the
allusion,) whose office it was to proclaim the conditions, and to
display the prizes. I myself should become a reprobate - Disapproved by
the Judge, and so falling short of the prize. This single text may give
us a just notion of the scriptural doctrine of election and reprobation;
and clearly shows us, that particular persons are not in holy writ
represented as elected absolutely and unconditionally to eternal life,
or predestinated absolutely and unconditionally to eternal death; but
that believers in general are elected to enjoy the Christian privileges
on earth; which if they abuse, those very elect persons will become
reprobate. St. Paul was certainly an elect person, if ever there was
one; and yet he declares it was possible he himself might become a
reprobate. Nay, he actually would have become such, if he had not thus
kept his body under, even though he had been so long an elect person, a
Christian, and an apostle.
