### [2 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 5:1</span></span>

Our earthly house - Which is only a tabernacle, or tent, not designed
for a lasting habitation.

[2 Corinthians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 5:2</span></span>

Desiring to be clothed upon - This body, which is now covered with flesh
and blood, with the glorious house which is from heaven. Instead of
flesh and blood, which cannot enter heaven, the rising body will be
clothed or covered with what is analogous thereto, but incorruptible and
immortal. Macarius speaks largely of this.

[2 Corinthians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 5:3</span></span>

If being clothed - That is, with the image of God, while we are in the
body. We shall not be found naked - Of the wedding garment.

[2 Corinthians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 5:4</span></span>

We groan being burdened - The apostle speaks with exact propriety. A
burden naturally expresses groans. And we are here burdened with
numberless afflictions, infirmities, temptations. Not that we would be
unclothed - Not that we desire to remain without a body. Faith does not
understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has
given. But clothed upon - With the glorious, immortal, incorruptible,
spiritual body. That what is mortal - This present mortal body. May be
swallowed up of life - Covered with that which lives for ever.

[2 Corinthians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 5:5</span></span>

Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing - This longing for
immortality. Is God - For none but God, none less than the Almighty,
could have wrought this in us.

[2 Corinthians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 5:6</span></span>

Therefore we behave undauntedly - But most of all when we have death in
view; knowing that our greatest happiness lies beyond the grave.

[2 Corinthians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 5:7</span></span>

For we cannot clearly see him in this life, wherein we walk by faith
only: an evidence, indeed, that necessarily implies a kind of "seeing
him who is invisible;" yet as far beneath what we shall have in
eternity, as it is above that of bare, unassisted reason.

[2 Corinthians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 5:8</span></span>

Present with the Lord - This demonstrates that the happiness of the
saints is not deferred till the resurrection.

[2 Corinthians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 5:9</span></span>

Therefore we are ambitious - The only ambition which has place in a
Christian. Whether present - In the body. Or absent - From it.

[2 Corinthians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 5:10</span></span>

For we all - Apostles as well as other men, whether now present in the
body, or absent from it. Must appear - Openly, without covering, where
all hidden things will be revealed; probably the sins, even of the
faithful, which were forgiven long before. For many of their good works,
as their repentance, their revenge against sin, cannot other wise
appear. But this will be done at their own desire, without grief, and
without shame. According to what he hath done in the body, whether good
or evil - In the body he did either good or evil; in the body he is
recompensed accordingly.

[2 Corinthians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 5:11</span></span>

Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we the more earnestly persuade
men to seek his favour; and as God knoweth this, so, I trust, ye know it
in your own consciences.

[2 Corinthians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 5:12</span></span>

We do not say this, as if we thought there was any need of again
recommending ourselves to you, but to give you an occasion of rejoicing
and praising God, and to furnish you with an answer to those false
apostles who glory in appearance, but not in heart, being condemned by
their own conscience.

[2 Corinthians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 5:13</span></span>

For if we are transported beyond ourselves - Or at least, appear so to
others, treated of, [Co2 5:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md),
speaking or writing with uncommon vehemence. It is to God - He
understands (if men do not) the emotion which himself inspires. If we be
sober - Treated of, [Co2 6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001.md). If I
proceed in a more calm, sedate manner. It is for your sakes - Even good
men bear this, rather than the other method, in their teachers. But
these must obey God, whoever is offended by it.

[2 Corinthians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 5:14</span></span>

For the love of Christ - To us, and our love to him. Constraineth us -
Both to the one and the other; beareth us on with such a strong, steady,
prevailing influence, as winds and tides exert when they waft the vessel
to its destined harbour. While we thus judge, that if Christ died for
all, then are all, even the best of men, naturally dead - In a state of
spiritual death, and liable to death eternal. For had any man been
otherwise, Christ had not needed to have died for him.

[2 Corinthians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 5:15</span></span>

And that he died for all - That all might be saved. That they who live -
That all who live upon the earth. Should not henceforth - From the
moment they know him. Live unto themselves - Seek their own honour,
profit, pleasure. But unto him - In all righteousness and true holiness.

[2 Corinthians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 5:16</span></span>

So that we from this time - That we knew the love of Christ. Know no one
- Neither ourselves, nor you, neither the rest of the apostles, [Gal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006.md), nor any other person. After the
flesh - According to his former state, country, descent, nobility,
riches, power, wisdom. We fear not the great. We regard not the rich or
wise. We account not the least less than ourselves. We consider all,
only in order to save all. Who is he that thus knows no one after the
flesh? ln what land do these Christians live? Yea, if we have known even
Christ after the flesh - So as to love him barely with a natural love,
so as to glory in having conversed with him on earth, so as to expect
only temporal benefits from him.

[2 Corinthians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 5:17</span></span>

Therefore if any one be in Christ - A true believer in him. There is a
new creation - Only the power that makes a world can make a Christian.
And when he is so created, the old things are passed away - Of their own
accord, even as snow in spring. Behold - The present, visible,
undeniable change! All things are become new - He has new life, new
senses, new faculties, new affections, new appetites, new ideas and
conceptions. His whole tenor of action and conversation is new, and he
lives, as it were, in a new world. God, men, the whole creation, heaven,
earth, and all therein, appear in a new light, and stand related to him
in a new manner, since he was created anew in Christ Jesus.

[2 Corinthians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 5:18</span></span>

And all these new things are from God, considered under this very
notion, as reconciling us - The world, [Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md), to himself.

[2 Corinthians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 5:19</span></span>

Namely - The sum of which is, God - The whole Godhead, but more
eminently God the Father. Was in Christ, reconciling the world - Which
was before at enmity with God. To himself - So taking away that enmity,
which could no otherwise be removed than by the blood of the Son of God.

[2 Corinthians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 5:20</span></span>

Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ - we beseech you in Christ's
stead - Herein the apostle might appear to some "transported beyond
himself." In general he uses a more calm, sedate kind of exhortation, as
in the beginning of the next chapter. What unparalleled condescension
and divinely tender mercies are displayed in this verse! Did the judge
ever beseech a condemned criminal to accept of pardon? Does the creditor
ever beseech a ruined debtor to receive an acquittance in full? Yet our
almighty Lord, and our eternal Judge, not only vouchsafes to offer these
blessings, but invites us, entreats us, and, with the most tender
importunity, solicits us, not to reject them.

[2 Corinthians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 5:21</span></span>

He made him a sin offering, who knew no sin - A commendation peculiar to
Christ. For us - Who knew no righteousness, who were inwardly and
outwardly nothing but sin; who must have been consumed by the divine
justice, had not this atonement been made for our sins. That we might be
made the righteousness of God through him - Might through him be
invested wi th that righteousness, first imputed to us, then implanted
in us, which is in every sense the righteousness of God.
