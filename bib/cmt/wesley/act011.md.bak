### [Acts Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#001.md)

[Acts 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 11:4</span></span>

Peter laid all things before them - So he did not take it ill to be
questioned, nor desire to be treated as infallible. And he answers the
more mildly because it related to a point which he had not readily
believed himself.

[Acts 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 11:5</span></span>

Being in a trance - Which suspends the use of the outward senses.

[Acts 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 11:14</span></span>

Saved - With the full Christian salvation, in this world and the world
to come.

[Acts 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 11:17</span></span>

To us, when we believed - The sense is, because we believed, not because
we were circumcised, was the Holy Ghost given to us. What was I - A mere
instrument in God's hand. They had inquired only concerning his eating
with the Gentiles. He satisfies them likewise concerning his baptizing
them, and shows that he had done right in going to Cornelius, not only
by the command of God, but also by the event, the descent of the Holy
Ghost. And who are we that we should withstand God? Particularly by
laying down rules of Christian communion which exclude any whom he has
admitted into the Church of the first born, from worshipping God
together. O that all Church governors would consider how bold an
usurpation this is on the authority of the supreme Lord of the Church! O
that the sin of thus withstanding God may not be laid to the charge of
those, who perhaps with a good intention, but in an over fondness for
their own forms, have done it, and are continually doing it.

[Acts 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 11:18</span></span>

They glorified God - Being thoroughly satisfied. Repentance unto life -
True repentance is a change from spiritual death to spiritual life, and
leads to life everlasting.

[Acts 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 11:19</span></span>

They who had been dispersed - St. Luke here resumes the thread of his
narration, in the very words wherewith he broke it off, [Act
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#006.md). As far as Phenicia to the north,
Cyprus to the west, and Antioch to the east.

[Acts 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 11:20</span></span>

Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene - Who were more accustomed to
converse with the Gentiles. Who coming into Antioch - Then the capital
of Syria, and, next to Rome and Alexandria, the most considerable city
of the empire. Spake to the Greeks - As the Greeks were the most
celebrated of the Gentile nations near Judea, the Jews called all the
Gentiles by that name. Here we have the first account of the preaching
the Gospel to the idolatrous Gentiles. All those to whom it had been
preached before, did at least worship one God, the God of Israel.

[Acts 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 11:21</span></span>

And the hand of the Lord - That is, the power of his Spirit.

[Acts 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 11:26</span></span>

And the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch - Here it was
that they first received this standing appellation. They were before
termed Nazarenes and Galileans.

[Acts 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 11:28</span></span>

Agabus rising up - In the congregation. All the world - The word
frequently signifies all the Roman empire. And so it is doubtless to be
taken here.

[Acts 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 11:29</span></span>

Then - Understanding the distress they would otherwise be in on that
account, the disciples determined to send relief to the brethren in
Judea - Who herein received a manifest proof of the reality of their
conversion.

[Acts 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 11:30</span></span>

Sending it to the elders - Who gave it to the deacons, to be distributed
by them, as every one had need.
