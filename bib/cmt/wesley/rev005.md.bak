### [Revelation Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 5:1</span></span>

And I saw - This is a continuation of the same narrative. In the right
hand - The emblem of his all - ruling power. He held it openly, in order
to give it to him that was worthy. It is scarce needful to observe, that
there is not in heaven any real book of parchment or paper or that
Christ does not really stand there, in the shape of a lion or of a lamb.
Neither is there on earth any monstrous beast with seven heads and ten
horns. But as there is upon earth something which, in its kind, answers
such a representation; so there are in heaven divine counsels and
transactions answerable to these figurative expressions. All this was
represented to St. John at Patmos, in one day, by way of vision. But the
accomplishment of it extends from that time throughout all ages.
Writings serve to inform us of distant and of future things. And hence
things which are yet to come are figuratively said to be "written in
God's book;" so were at that time the contents of this weighty prophecy.
But the book was sealed. Now comes the opening and accomplishing also of
the great things that are, as it were, the letters of it. A book written
within and without - That is, no part of it blank, full of matter.
Sealed with seven seals - According to the seven principal parts
contained in it, one on the outside of each. The usual books of the
ancients were not like ours, but were volumes or long pieces of
parchment, rolled upon a long stick, as we frequently roll silks. Such
was this represented, which was sealed with seven seals. Not as if the
apostle saw all the seals at once; for there were seven volumes wrapped
up one within another, each of which was sealed: so that upon opening
and unrolling the first, the second appeared to be sealed up till that
was opened, and so on to the seventh. The book and its seals represent
all power in heaven and earth given to Christ. A copy of this book is
contained in the following chapters. By "the trumpets," contained under
the seventh seal, the kingdom of the world is shaken, that it may at
length become the kingdom of Christ. By "the vials," under the seventh
trumpet, the power of the beast, and whatsoever is connected with it, is
broken. This sum of all we should have continually before our eyes: so
the whole Revelation flows in its natural order.

[Revelation 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 5:2</span></span>

And I saw a strong angel - This proclamation to every creature was too
great for a man to make, and yet not becoming the Lamb himself. It was
therefore made by an angel, and one of uncommon eminence.

[Revelation 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 5:3</span></span>

And none - No creature; no, not Mary herself. In heaven, or in earth,
neither under the earth - That is, none in the universe. For these are
the three great regions into which the whole creation is divided. Was
able to open the book - To declare the counsels of God. Nor to look
thereon - So as to understand any part of it.

[Revelation 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 5:4</span></span>

And I wept much - A weeping which sprung from greatness of mind. The
tenderness of heart which he always had appeared more clearly now he was
out of his own power. The Revelation was not written without tears;
neither without tears will it be understood. How far are they from the
temper of St. John who inquire after anything rather than the contents
of this book! yea, who applaud their own clemency if they excuse those
that do inquire into them!

[Revelation 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 5:5</span></span>

And one of the elders - Probably one of those who rose with Christ, and
afterwards ascended into heaven. Perhaps one of the patriarchs. Some
think it was Jacob, from whose prophecy the name of Lion is given him,
[Gen 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md). The Lion of the tribe of
Judah - The victorious prince who is, like a lion, able to tear all his
enemies in pieces. The root of David - As God, the root and source of
David's family, [Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md). Hath prevailed to open the book
- Hath overcome all obstructions, and obtained the honour to disclose
the divine counsels.

[Revelation 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 5:6</span></span>

And I saw - First, Christ in or on the midst of the throne; secondly,
the four living creatures making the inner circle round him; and,
thirdly, the four and twenty elders making a larger circle round him and
them. Standing - He lieth no more; he no more falls on his face; the
days of his weakness and mourning are ended. He is now in a posture of
readiness to execute all his offices of prophet, priest, and king. As if
he had been slain - Doubtless with the prints of the wounds which he
once received. And because he was slain, he is worthy to open the book,
[Rev 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), to the joy of his own
people, and the terror of his enemies. Having seven horns - As a king,
the emblem of perfect strength. And seven eyes - The emblem of perfect
knowledge and wisdom. By these he accomplishes what is contained in the
book, namely, by his almighty and all - wise Spirit. To these seven
horns and seven eyes answer the seven seals and the sevenfold song of
praise, [Rev 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md). In Zechariah,
likewise, [Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md), [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md), mention is made of "the seven
eyes of the Lord, which go forth over all the earth." Which - Both the
horns and the eyes. Are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the
earth - For the effectual working of the Spirit of God goes through the
whole creation; and that in the natural, as well as spiritual, world.
For could mere matter act or move? Could it gravitate or attract? Just
as much as it can think or speak.

[Revelation 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 5:7</span></span>

And he came - Here was "Ask of me," [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md), fulfilled in the most glorious
manner. And took - it is one state of exaltation that reaches from our
Lord's ascension to his coming in glory. Yet this state admits of
various degrees. At his ascension, "angels, and principalities, and
powers were subjected to him." Ten days after, he received from the
Father and sent the Holy Ghost. And now he took the book out of the
right hand of him that sat upon the throne - who gave it him as a signal
of his delivering to him all power in heaven and earth. He received it,
in token of his being both able and willing to fulfil all that was
written therein.

[Revelation 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 5:8</span></span>

And when he took the book, the four living creatures fell down - Now is
homage done to the Lamb by every creature. These, together with the
elders, make the beginning; and afterward, [Rev
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014.md), the conclusion. They are
together surrounded with a multitude of angels, [Rev
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md), and together sing the new song,
as they had before praised God together, [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md), &c. Having every one - The
elders, not the living creatures. An harp - Which was one of the chief
instruments used for thanksgiving in the temple service: a fit emblem of
the melody of their hearts. And golden phials - Cups or censers. Full of
incense, which are the prayers of the saints - Not of the elders
themselves, but of the other saints still upon earth, whose prayers were
thus emblematically represented in heaven.

[Revelation 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 5:9</span></span>

And they sing a new song - One which neither they nor any other had sung
before. Thou hast redeemed us - So the living creatures also were of the
number of the redeemed. This does not so much refer to the act of
redemption, which was long before, as to the fruit of it; and so more
directly to those who had finished their course, "who were redeemed from
the earth," [Rev 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), out of every
tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation - That is, out of all mankind.

[Revelation 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 5:10</span></span>

And hast made them - The redeemed. So they speak of themselves also in
the third person, out of deep self - abasement. They shall reign over
the earth - The new earth: herewith agree the golden crowns of the
elders. The reign of the saints in general follows, under the trumpet of
the seventh angel; particularly after the first resurrection, as also in
eternity, [Rev 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md); [Rev
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005.md); [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md); [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md).

[Revelation 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 5:11</span></span>

And I saw - The many angels. And heard - The voice and the number of
them. Round about the elders - So forming the third circle. It is
remarkable, that men are represented through this whole vision as nearer
to God than any of the angels. And the number of them was - At least two
hundred millions, and two millions over. And yet these were but a part
of the holy angels. Afterward, [Rev
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011.md), St. John heard them all.

[Revelation 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 5:12</span></span>

Worthy is the Lamb - The elders said, [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), "Worthy art thou." They were more
nearly allied to him than the angels. To receive the power, &c. - This
sevenfold applause answers the seven seals, of which the four former
describe all visible, the latter all invisible, things, made subject to
the Lamb. And every one of these seven words bears a resemblance to the
seal which it answers.

[Revelation 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 5:13</span></span>

And every creature - In the whole universe, good or bad. In the heaven,
on the earth, under the earth, on the sea - With these four regions of
the world, agrees the fourfold word of praise. What is in heaven, says
blessing; what is on earth, honour; what is under the earth, glory: what
is on the sea, strength; is unto him. This praise from all creatures
begins before the opening of the first seal; but it continues from that
time to eternity, according to the capacity of each. His enemies must
acknowledge his glory; but those in heaven say, Blessed be God and the
Lamb.

This royal manifesto is, as it were, a proclamation, showing how Christ
fulfils all things, and "every knee bows to him," not only on earth, but
also in heaven, and under the earth. This book exhausts all things, [Co1
15:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md), and is suitable to an heart
enlarged as the sand of the sea. It inspires the attentive and
intelligent reader with such a magnanimity, that he accounts nothing in
this world great; no, not the whole frame of visible nature, compared to
the immense greatness of what he is here called to behold, yea, and in
part, to inherit.

St. John has in view, through the whole following vision, what he has
been now describing, namely, the four living creatures, the elders, the
angels, and all creatures, looking together at the opening of the seven
seals.
