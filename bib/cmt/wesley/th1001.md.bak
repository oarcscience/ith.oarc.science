### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 1:1</span></span>

Paul - In this epistle St. Paul neither uses the title of an apostle,
nor any other, as writing to pious and simple - hearted men, with the
utmost familiarity. There is a peculiar sweetness in this epistle,
unmixed with any sharpness or reproof: those evils which the apostles
afterward reproved having not yet crept into the church.

[1 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 1:3</span></span>

Remembering in the sight of God - That is, praising him for it. Your
work of faith - Your active, ever - working faith. And labour of love -
Love continually labouring for the bodies or souls of men. They who do
not thus labour, do not love. Faith works, love labours, hope patiently
suffers all things.

[1 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 1:4</span></span>

Knowing your election - Which is through faith, by these plain proofs.

[1 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 1:5</span></span>

With power - Piercing the very heart with a sense of sin and deeply
convincing you of your want of a Saviour from guilt, misery, and eternal
ruin. With the Holy Ghost - Bearing an outward testimony, by miracles,
to the truth of what we preached, and you felt: also by his descent
through laying on of hands. With much assurance - Literally, with full
assurance, and much of it: the Spirit bearing witness by shedding the
love of God abroad in your hearts, which is the highest testimony that
can be given. And these signs, if not the miraculous gifts, always
attend the preaching of the gospel, unless it be in vain: neither are
the extraordinary operations of the Holy Ghost ever wholly withheld,
where the gospel is preached with power, and men are alive to God. For
your sake - Seeking your advantage, not our own.

[1 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 1:6</span></span>

Though in much affliction, yet with much joy.

[1 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 1:8</span></span>

For from you the word sounded forth - (Thessalonica being a city of
great commerce.) Being echoed, as it were, from you. And your conversion
was divulged far beyond Macedonia and Achaia. So that we need not speak
anything - Concerning it.

[1 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 1:9</span></span>

For they themselves - The people wherever we come.

[1 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 1:10</span></span>

Whom he hath raised from the dead - In proof of his future coming to
judgment. Who delivereth us - He redeemed us once; he delivers us
continually; and will deliver all that believe from the wrath, the
eternal vengeance, which will then come upon the ungodly.
