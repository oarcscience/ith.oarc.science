### [Ezra Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md)

[Ezra 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ezr 7:1</span></span>

Artaxerxes - The same of whom he speaks, [Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014.md). The son - His grand - son. Here
are divers persons omitted for brevity sake, which may be supplied out
of 1Ch. 6:1-11:47. Ezra was not himself the high priest; but he was
nearly related to him.

[Ezra 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ezr 7:6</span></span>

Went - With the king's consent and commission. Scribe - A learned and
expert doctor. The Jews say, he collected and collated all the copies of
the law, and published an accurate edition of it, with all the books
that were given by Divine inspiration, and so made up the canon of the
Old Testament. Moses in Egypt, and Ezra in Babylon, were wonderfully
fitted for eminent service to the church. According, &c. - By the favour
of God so disposing the heart of the king.

[Ezra 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ezr 7:10</span></span>

To teach - The order of things in this verse is very observable; first
he endeavours to understand God's law and word, and that not for
curiosity or ostentation, but in order to practice: next he consciously
practises what he did understand, which made his doctrine much more
effectual: and then he earnestly desires and labours to instruct others,
that they also might know and do it.

[Ezra 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ezr 7:11</span></span>

Words - The phrase seems emphatical, noting that he explained both the
words and the things: for the Jews in the land of their captivity had in
a great measure lost both the language, and the knowledge of God's
commands, and therefore Ezra and his companions instructed them in both.

[Ezra 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ezr 7:14</span></span>

According, &c. - To make inquiry into all abuses and deviations from
your law, and to redress them. Which - Which is now and always in thine
hand, being the matter of thy daily study.

[Ezra 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ezr 7:16</span></span>

Find - Procure, as that word is used, [Gen
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md), [Gen
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012.md); [Psa
84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003.md). Whatsoever thou canst get of my
subjects by way of free gift. The people - Of Israel.

[Ezra 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ezr 7:25</span></span>

The wisdom - Which God hath put into thy heart, and which appears in the
works of thy hand. All that professed the Jewish religion, were to be
under the jurisdiction of these judges.

[Ezra 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ezr 7:26</span></span>

Let judgment - What could David himself, as king, have done more, for
the honour of God, and the furtherance of religion?

[Ezra 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ezr 7:27</span></span>

Blessed, &c. - Ezra cannot proceed in his story, without inserting this
thankful acknowledgment of God's goodness to him and the people.

[Ezra 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ezr 7:28</span></span>

As the hand, &c. - If God gives us his hand, we are bold and chearful:
if he withdraws it, we are weak as water. Whatever service we are
enabled to do for God and our generation, God must have all the glory of
it.
