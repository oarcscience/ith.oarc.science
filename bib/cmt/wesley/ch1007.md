### [1 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

Three - They were ten, [Gen 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#025), and
five of them are named, [Ch1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001), but
here only three are mentioned, either because these were most eminent;
or because the other families are now extinct.

[1 Chronicles 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 7:7</span></span>

Heads - Each of them head of that family to which he belonged. For it
may seem by comparing this with [Ch1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#003), &c. that these were not the
immediate sons of Belah, but his Grand - children descended each from a
several father.

[1 Chronicles 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 7:14</span></span>

She - His wife; his concubine is here opposed to her.

[1 Chronicles 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 7:15</span></span>

Second - Of the second son or grandson of Machir; for so Zelophehad was.
Had daughters - Only daughters, and no sons.

[1 Chronicles 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 7:17</span></span>

These - Ashriel and Zelophehad, named [Ch1
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014), the relative being here
referred to the remoter antecedent; as is frequent in the Hebrew.

[1 Chronicles 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 7:18</span></span>

His - Gilead's sister. Mahalah - Understand, and Shemida, out of the
next verse.

[1 Chronicles 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 7:21</span></span>

Slew - This history is not recorded else where in scripture, but it is
in the ancient Hebrew writers. The Philistines (one of whose cities Gath
was) and the Egyptians were next neighbours; and in those ancient times
it was usual for such to make inroads one into another's country, and to
carry thence what prey they could take. And as the Philistines had
probably made such inroads formerly into Egypt, and particularly into
the land of Goshen, which was the utmost part of Egypt bordering upon
the Philistines land; so the Israelites might requite them in the like
kind: and particularly the children of Ephraim, to their own loss. And
this seems to have happened a little before the Egyptian persecution,
and before the reign of that new king mentioned [Exo
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008). And this clause, that were born
in that land, may be added emphatically, as the motive which made them
more resolute in their fight with the Ephraimites, because they fought
in, and for their own land, wherein all their wealth and concerns lay.

[1 Chronicles 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 7:23</span></span>

Bare a son - Thus the breach was in some measure repaired, by the
addition of another son in his old age. When God thus restores comfort
to his mourners, he makes glad according to the days wherein he
afflicted, setting the mercies over against the crosses, we ought to
observe the kindness of his providence. Yet the joy that a man was born
into his family could not make him forget his grief. For he gives a
melancholy name to his son, Beriah, that is, in trouble: for he was born
when the family was in mourning. It is good to have in remembrance the
affliction and the misery which are past, that our souls may be humbled
within us.
