### [Exodus Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 32:1</span></span>

Up, make us gods which shall go before us. They were weary of waiting
for the promised land. They thought themselves detained too long at
mount Sinai. They had a God that stayed with them, but they must have a
God to go before them to the land flowing with milk and honey. They were
weary of waiting for the return of Moses: As for this Moses, the man
that brought us up out of Egypt, we know not what is become of him -
Observe how slightly they speak of his person, this Moses: And how
suspiciously of his delay, we know not what is become of him. And they
were weary of waiting for a divine institution of religious worship
among them, so they would have a worship of their own invention,
probably such as they had seen among the Egyptians. They say, make us
gods which shall go before us. Gods! How many would they have? Is not
one sufficient? And what good would gods of their own making do them?
They must have such Gods to go before them as could not go themselves
farther than they were carried!

[Exodus 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 32:2</span></span>

And Aaron said break off the golden ear - rings - We do not find that he
said one word to discountenance their proposal. Some suppose, that when
Aaron bid them break off their ear - rings, he did it with design to
crush the proposal, believing that, though their covetousness would have
let them do it, yet their pride would not have suffered them to part
with them.

[Exodus 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 32:3</span></span>

And all the people brake off their ear - rings - Which Aaron melted
down, and, having a mold prepared, poured the melted gold into it, and
then produced it in the shape of an ox or calf, giving it some finishing
strokes with a graving tool.

[Exodus 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 32:5</span></span>

And Aaron built an altar before it, and proclaimed a feast - A feast of
dedication; yet he calls it a feast to Jehovah; for, as brutish as they
were, they did not design to terminate their adoration in the image; but
they made it for a representation of the true God, whom they intended to
worship in and through this image. And yet this did not excuse them from
gross idolatry, no more than it will excuse the Papists, whose plea it
is, that they do not worship the image, but God by the image; so making
themselves just such idolaters as the worshippers of the golden calf,
whose feast was a feast to Jehovah, and proclaimed to be so, that the
most ignorant and unthinking might not mistake it.

[Exodus 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 32:6</span></span>

And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered sacrifice to this new
made deity. And the people sat down to eat and drink of the remainder of
what was sacrificed, and then rose up to play - To play the fool, to
play the wanton. It was strange that any of the people, especially so
great a number of them, should do such a thing. Had they not, but the
other day, in this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking
to them out of the midst of the fire, Thou shalt not make to thyself any
graven image? - Yet They made a calf in Horeb, the very place where the
law was given It was especially strange that Aaron should be so deeply
concerned, should make the calf and proclaim the feast! Is this Aaron
the saint of the Lord! Is this he that had not only seen, but had been
employed in summoning the plagues of Egypt, and the judgments executed
upon the gods of the Egyptians? What! And yet himself copying out the
abandoned idolatries of Egypt? How true is it, that the law made them
priests which had infirmity, and needed first to offer for their own
sins?

[Exodus 32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 32:8</span></span>

They have turned aside quickly - Quickly after the law was given them,
and they had promised to obey it; quickly after God had done such great
things for them, and declared his kind intentions to do greater.

[Exodus 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 32:9</span></span>

It is a stiff - necked people - Unapt to come under the yoke of the
divine law, averse to all good, and prone to evil, obstinate to the
methods of cure.

[Exodus 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 32:10</span></span>

Let me alone - What did Moses, or what could he do, to hinder God from
consuming them? When God resolves to abandon a people, and the decree is
gone forth, no intercession can prevent it. But God would thus express
the greatness of his displeasure, after the manner of men, who would
have none to interceed for those they resolve to be severe with. Thus
also he would put an honour upon prayer, intimating, that nothing but
the intercession of Moses could save them from ruin, that he might be a
type of Christ, by whose mediation alone God would reconcile the world
unto himself.

[Exodus 32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 32:11</span></span>

And Moses besought the Lord his God - If God would not be called the God
of Israel, yet he hoped he might address him as his own God. Now Moses
is standing in the gap to turn away the wrath of God. [Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023.md). He took the hint which God
gave him when he said, Let me alone, which, though it seemed to forbid
his interceding, did really encourage it, by shewing what power the
prayer of faith hath with God.

[Exodus 32:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 32:12</span></span>

Turn from thy fierce wrath - Not as if he thought God were not justly
angry, but he begs that he would not be so greatly angry as to consume
them. Let mercy rejoice against judgment; repent of this evil - Change
the sentence of destruction into that of correction, against thy people
which thou broughtest up out of Egypt - For whom thou hast done so great
things? Wherefore should the Egyptians say, For mischief did he bring
them out - Israel is dear to Moses, as his kindred, as his charge; but
it is the glory of God that he is most concerned for. If Israel could
perish without any reproach to God's name, Moses could persuade himself
to sit down contented; but he cannot bear to hear God reflected on; and
therefore this he insists upon, Lord, What will the Egyptians say? They
will say, God was either weak, and could not, or fickle, and would not
compleat the salvation he begun.

[Exodus 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 32:13</span></span>

Remember Abraham - Lord, if Israel be cut off, what will become of the
promise?

[Exodus 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 32:14</span></span>

And the Lord repented of the evil he thought to do - Though he designed
to punish them, yet he would not ruin them. See here, the power of
prayer, God suffers himself to be prevailed with by humble believing
importunity. And see the compassion of God towards poor sinners, and how
ready he is to forgive.

[Exodus 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 32:15</span></span>

On both their sides - Some on one table and some on the other, so that
they were folded together like a book, to be deposited in the ark.

[Exodus 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 32:16</span></span>

The writing of God - Very probably the first writing in the world.

[Exodus 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 32:19</span></span>

He saw the calf, and the dancing, and his anger waxed hot - It is no
breach of the law of meekness to shew our displeasure at wickedness.
Those are angry and sin not, that are angry at sin only. Moses shewed
himself angry, both by breaking the tables, and burning the calf, that
he might by these expressions of a strong passion awaken the people to a
sense of the greatness of their sin. He broke the tables before their
eyes, as it is [Deu 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#017.md), that the
sight of it might fill them with confusion when they saw what blessings
they had lost. The greatest sign of God's displeasure against any people
is his taking his law from them.

[Exodus 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 32:20</span></span>

He burnt the calf - Melted it down, and then filed it to dust; and that
the powder to which it was reduced might he taken notice of throughout
the camp, he strawed it upon the water which they all drank of. That it
might appear that an idol is nothing in the world, he reduced this to
atoms, that it might be as near nothing as could be.

[Exodus 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 32:21</span></span>

What did this people unto thee - He takes it for granted that it must
needs be something more than ordinary that prevailed with Aaron to do
such a thing? Did they overcome thee by importunity, and hadst thou so
little resolution as to yield to popular clamour! Did they threaten to
stone thee, and couldest not thou have opposed God's threatenings to
theirs?

[Exodus 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 32:23</span></span>

They said, make us Gods - It is natural to us to endeavour thus to
transfer our guilt. He likewise extenuates his own share in the sin, as
if he had only bid them break off their gold, intending but to make a
hasty essay for the present, and childishly insinuates that when he cast
the gold into the fire, it came out either by accident, or by the magic
art of some of the mixt multitude (as the Jewish writers dream) in this
shape. This was all Aaron had to say for himself, and he had better have
said nothing, for his defence did but aggravate his offence; and yet as
sin did abound, grace did much more abound.

[Exodus 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 32:25</span></span>

The people were naked - Stript of their armour, and liable to insults.

[Exodus 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 32:26</span></span>

Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, the place of judgment; and
said, Who is on the Lord's side? - The idolaters had set up the golden
calf for their standard, and now Moses sets up his in opposition to
them.

[Exodus 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">exo 32:27</span></span>

Slay every man his brother - That is, Slay all those that you know to
have been active for the making and worshipping of the golden calf,
though they were your nearest relations or dearest friends. Yet it
should seem they were to slay those only whom they found abroad in the
street of the camp; for it might be hoped that those who were retired
into their tents were ashamed of what they had done.

[Exodus 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 32:28</span></span>

And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men -
Probably these were but few in comparison with the many that were
guilty; but these were the men that headed the rebellion, and were
therefore picked out to be made examples of; for terror to others.

[Exodus 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 32:31</span></span>

Oh, this people have sinned a great sin - God had first told him of it,
[Exo 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md), and now he tells God of it
by way of lamentation. He doth not call them God's people, he knew they
were unworthy to be called so, but this people. This treacherous
ungrateful people, they have made them gods of gold.

[Exodus 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">exo 32:32</span></span>

If not - If the decree be gone forth, and there is no remedy but they
must be ruined, blot me, I pray thee out of the book which thou hast
written - That is, out of the book of life. If all Israel must perish, I
am content to perish with them. This expression may be illustrated from
[Rom 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md). For I could wish myself to
be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren's sake. Does this imply no
more than not enjoying Canaan? Not that Moses absolutely desired this,
but only comparatively expresses his vehement zeal for God's glory, and
love to his people, signifying, that the very thought of their
destruction, and the dishonour of God, was so intolerable to him, that
he rather wishes, if it were possible, that God would accept of him, as
a sacrifice in their stead, and by his utter destruction, prevent so
great a mischief.

[Exodus 32:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 32:33</span></span>

Whosoever hath sinned, him will I blot out of my book - The soul that
sins shall die, and not the innocent for the guilty.

[Exodus 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">exo 32:34</span></span>

My angel shall go before them - Some created angel that was employed in
the common services of his kingdom, which intimated that they were not
to expect any thing for the future to be done for them out of the common
road of providence. When I visit - Hereafter he shall see cause to
punish them for other sins, I will visit for this among the rest. From
hence the Jews have a saying, that from hence - forward no judgment fell
upon Israel, but there was in it an ounce of the powder of the golden
calf.

[Exodus 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 32:35</span></span>

And the Lord plagued the people - Probably by the pestilence, or some
other infectious disease. Thus Moses prevailed for a mitigation of the
punishment, but could not wholly turn away the wrath of God.
