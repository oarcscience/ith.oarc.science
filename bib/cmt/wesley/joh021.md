### [John Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md)

[John 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 21:2</span></span>

There were together - At home, in one house.

[John 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 21:4</span></span>

They knew not that it was Jesus - Probably their eyes were holden.

[John 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 21:6</span></span>

They were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes - This was not
only a demonstration of the power of our Lord, but a kind supply for
them and their families, and such as might be of service to them, when
they waited afterward in Jerusalem. It was likewise an emblem of the
great success which should attend them as fishers of men.

[John 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 21:7</span></span>

Peter girt on his upper coat (for he was stript of it before) -
Reverencing the presence of his Lord: and threw himself into the sea -
To swim to him immediately. The love of Christ draws men through fire
and water.

[John 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 21:12</span></span>

Come ye and dine - Our Lord needed not food. And none presumed - To ask
a needless question.

[John 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 21:14</span></span>

The third time - That he appeared to so many of the apostles together.

[John 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 21:15</span></span>

Simon, son of Jonah - The appellation Christ had given him, when be made
that glorious confession, [Mat 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md),
the remembrance of which might make him more deeply sensible of his late
denial of him whom he had so confessed. Lovest thou me? - Thrice our
Lord asks him, who had denied him thrice: more than these - Thy fellow
disciples do? - Peter thought so once, [Mat
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#033.md), but he now answers only - I
love thee, without adding more than these. Thou knowest - He had now
learnt by sad experience that Jesus knew his heart. My lambs - The
weakest and tenderest of the flock.

[John 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 21:17</span></span>

Because he said the third time - As if he did not believe him.

[John 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 21:18</span></span>

When thou art old - He lived about thirty - six years after this:
another shall gird thee - They were tied to the cross till the nails
were driven in; and shall carry thee - With the cross: whither thou
wouldest not - According to nature; to the place where the cross was set
up.

[John 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 21:19</span></span>

By what death he should glorify God - It is not only by acting, but
chiefly by suffering, that the saints glorify God. Follow me - Showing
hereby likewise what death he should die.

[John 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 21:20</span></span>

Peter turning - As he was walking after Christ. Seeth the disciple whom
Jesus loved following him - There is a peculiar spirit and tenderness in
this plain passage. Christ orders St. Peter to follow him in token of
his readiness to be crucified in his cause. St. John stays not for the
call; he rises and follows him too; but says not one word of his own
love or zeal. He chose that the action only should speak this; and even
when he records the circumstance, he tells us not what that action
meant, but with great simplicity relates the fact only. If here and
there a generous heart sees and emulates it, be it so; but he is not
solicitous that men should admire it. It was addressed to his beloved
Master, and it was enough that he understood it.

[John 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 21:22</span></span>

If I will that he tarry - Without dying, till I come - To judgment.
Certainly he did tarry, till Christ came to destroy Jerusalem. And who
can tell, when or how he died? What is that to thee? - Who art to follow
me long before.

[John 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 21:23</span></span>

The brethren - That is, the Christians. Our Lord himself taught them
that appellation, [Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md). Yet
Jesus did not say to him, that he should not die - Not expressly. And
St. John himself, at the time of writing his Gospel, seems not to have
known clearly, whether he should die or not.

[John 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 21:24</span></span>

This is the disciple who testifieth - Being still alive after he had
wrote. And we know that his testimony is true - The Church added these
words to St. John's, Gospel, as Tertius did those to St. Paul's Epistle
to the Romans, [Rom 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md).

[John 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 21:25</span></span>

If they were to be written particularly - Every fact, and all the
circumstances of it. I suppose - This expression, which softens the
hyperbole, shows that St. John wrote this verse.
