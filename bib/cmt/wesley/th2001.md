### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001)

[2 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 1:3</span></span>

It is highly observable, that the apostle wraps up his praise of men in
praise to God; giving him the glory. Your faith groweth - Probably he
had heard from them since his sending the former letter. Aboundeth -
Like water that overflows its banks, and yet increaseth still.

[2 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 1:4</span></span>

Which ye endure - "That ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom."

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 1:5</span></span>

A manifest token - This is treated of in [Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006) and following verses.

[2 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 1:6</span></span>

It is a righteous thing with God - (However men may judge) to transfer
the pressure from you to them. And it is remarkable that about this
time, at the passover, the Jews raising a tumult, a great number (some
say thirty thousand) of them were slain. St. Paul seems to allude to
this beginning of sorrows, [Th1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016),
which did not end but with their destruction.

[2 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 1:8</span></span>

Taking vengeance - Does God barely permit this, or (as "the Lord" once
"rained brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven," [Gen
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024)) does a fiery stream go forth
from him for ever? Who know not God - (The root of all wickedness and
misery) who remain in heathen ignorance. And who obey not - This refers
chiefly to the Jews, who had heard the gospel.

[2 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 1:9</span></span>

From the glory of his power - Tremble, ye stout - hearted. Everlasting
destruction - As there can be no end of their sins, (the same enmity
against God continuing,) so neither of their punishment; sin and its
punishment running parallel throughout eternity itself. They must of
necessity, therefore, be cut off from all good, and all possibility of
it. From the presence of the Lord - Wherein chiefly consists the
salvation of the righteous. What unspeakable punishment is implied even
in falling short of this, supposing that nothing more were implied in
his taking vengeance!

[2 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 1:10</span></span>

To be glorified in his saints - For the wonderful glory of Christ shall
shine in them.

[2 Thessalonians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 1:11</span></span>

All the good pleasure of his goodness - Which is no less than perfect
holiness.

[2 Thessalonians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 1:12</span></span>

That the name - The love and power of our Lord may be glorified -
Gloriously displayed in you.
