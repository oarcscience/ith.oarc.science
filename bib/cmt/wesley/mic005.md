### [Micah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

[Micah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 5:1</span></span>

Now gather thyself - Since this must be done, do it quickly. O daughter
of troops - Nineveh or Babylon. He - Sennacherib, or Nebuchadnezzar.
They - The proud, oppressive enemy. The judge - The king. Of Israel -
Not the ten tribes, though they are actually called by this name, but
the two tribes that adhered to David's family. A rod - This is a
proverbial speech, expressing the most contemptuous usage.

[Micah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 5:2</span></span>

Bethlehem - Bethlehem of Judah was called Ephratah, from the
fruitfulness of the land where it stood: the word whence it is derived
importing fruitfulness. Art thou little - If thou art the least in other
respects in this thou art honoured above them all. Ruler - King and
sovereign. In Israel - Amidst the Israel of God. Going forth - Whose
generation, as he is the Son of God, equal with his father, is eternal.

[Micah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 5:3</span></span>

He - God. Give them up - To the Chaldeans. She - The daughter of Zion,
compared here to a woman in travail, shall be delivered out of
captivity. His brethren - The brethren of the Messiah. Those of Judah
and Benjamin who were carried captive.

[Micah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 5:4</span></span>

He - The ruler, the Messiah shall stand. This posture speaks the
readiness, chearfulness, and stability of Christ, his government, and
kingdom. Feed - As a shepherd that diligently guides, preserves, and
feeds his sheep. By the strength - By his own almighty strength. Of the
name - By commission from the Father in whose name Christ came,
preached, wrought miracles, and instituted his gospel church. They - His
church made up of converted Jews and Gentiles, shall continue; the gates
of hell shall not prevail against them. For - The church is so redeemed,
and established, that Christ the Messiah might be glorified, throughout
the world.

[Micah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 5:5</span></span>

This man - The Messiah. The peace - Which is promised to the people of
God; all their deliverances are not only for his sake, but effected by
his power. Shall tread in our palaces - Which Sennacherib did in all the
cities of Judah, except Jerusalem. We - Hezekiah, and with him the
prophets and people, shall prevail with God to send deliverance. Seven
shepherds - A certain number put for an uncertain.

[Micah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 5:6</span></span>

They - The seven shepherds, and eight principal men, those great
instruments of God's revenge, and his church's deliverance. Waste the
land - So did Merodach Baladan, king of Babylon. The land of Nimrod -
The same with the land of Assyria. The entrance - The fortified
frontiers. In this manner shall he, the Messiah, deliver the Jews, his
people. The Assyrian - The type of all other enemies, to the people of
God.

[Micah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 5:7</span></span>

As a dew - This remnant wherever they are, shall multiply as the dew
that refreshes the grass, so where this remnant is, it shall be a
blessing to those about them, that use them friendly. As the showers -
God shall bless them by his immediate hand, as he alone, without the
help of man, gives dew and showers. As this was fulfilled in the type,
before the gospel was preached to all nations, so it hath been, now is,
and ever shall be fulfilled in ages to come. God's remnant shall be a
blessing to the places they live in.

[Micah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 5:8</span></span>

As a lion - For strength and courage, which the beasts of the forest
dare not oppose, and cannot resist.

[Micah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 5:9</span></span>

Thine hand - Thou people of God.

[Micah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 5:10</span></span>

I will cut off - Not in judgment, but in mercy, for there shall be no
need of them, nor shall the church of God any more rely on them. Thy
chariots - Chariots prepared for war.

[Micah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 5:11</span></span>

The cities - Cut off the occasion of fortifying their cities, thou shalt
need no other defence than what I am to thee.

[Micah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 5:12</span></span>

I will cut off - God will in mercy to his people take away these
occasions of sin.

[Micah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 5:13</span></span>

Graven images - This was verified among the Jews, who to this day hate
images for divine uses, and learnt this in their captivity.

[Micah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 5:14</span></span>

Thy groves - The groves which they abused by idolatrous worship.

[Micah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 5:15</span></span>

Have not heard - In an unprecedented manner. Christ will give his Son
either the hearts or necks of his enemies, and make them either his
friends or his footstool.
