### [Hebrews Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001)

[Hebrews 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 7:1</span></span>

The sum of this chapter is, Christ, as appears from his type,
Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself, from whom Levi
descended, has a priesthood altogether excellent, new, firm, perpetual.
[Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018), &c.

[Hebrews 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 7:2</span></span>

Being first - According to the meaning of his own name. King of
righteousness, then - According to the name of his city. King of peace -
So in him, as in Christ, righteousness and peace were joined. And so
they are in all that believe in him.

[Hebrews 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 7:3</span></span>

Without father, without mother, without pedigree - Recorded, without any
account of his descent from any ancestors of the priestly order. Having
neither beginning of days, nor end of life - Mentioned by Moses. But
being - In all these respects. Made like the Son of God - Who is really
without father, as to his human nature; without mother, as to his
divine; and in this also, without pedigree - Neither descended from any
ancestors of the priestly order. Remaineth a priest continually -
Nothing is recorded of the death or successor of Melchisedec. But Christ
alone does really remain without death, and without successor.

[Hebrews 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 7:4</span></span>

The greatness of Melchisedec is described in all the preceding and
following particulars. But the most manifest proof of it was, that
Abraham gave him tithes as to a priest of God and a superior; though he
was himself a patriarch, greater than a king, and a progenitor of many
kings.

[Hebrews 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 7:5</span></span>

The sons of Levi take tithes of their brethren - Sprung from Abraham as
well as themselves. The Levites therefore are greater than they; but the
priests are greater than the Levites, the patriarch Abraham than the
priests, and Melchisedec than him.

[Hebrews 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 7:6</span></span>

He who is not from them - The Levites Blessed - Another proof of his
superiority. Even him that had the promises - That was so highly
favoured of God. When St. Paul speaks of Christ, he says, "the promise;"
promises refer to other blessings also.

[Hebrews 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 7:7</span></span>

The less is blessed - Authoritatively, of the greater.

[Hebrews 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 7:8</span></span>

And here - In the Levitical priesthood. But there - In the case of
Melchisedec. He of whom it is testified that he liveth - Who is not
spoken of as one that died for another to succeed him; but is
represented only as living, no mention being made either of his birth or
death.

[Hebrews 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 7:9</span></span>

And even Levi, who received tithes - Not in person, but in his
successors, as it were, paid tithes - In the person of Abraham.

[Hebrews 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 7:11</span></span>

The apostle now demonstrates that the Levitical priesthood must yield to
the priesthood of Christ, because Melchisedec, after whose order he is a
priest, Is opposed to Aaron, [Heb
7:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011). Hath no end of life, [Heb
7:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015), but "remaineth a priest
continually." If now perfection were by the Levitical priesthood - If
this perfectly answered all God's designs and man's wants For under it
the people received the law - Whence some might infer, that perfection
was by that priesthood. What farther need was there, that another priest
- Of a new order, should be set up? From this single consideration it is
plain, that both the priesthood and the law, which were inseparably
connected, were now to give way to a better priesthood and more
excellent dispensation.

[Hebrews 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 7:12</span></span>

For - One of these cannot be changed without the other.

[Hebrews 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 7:13</span></span>

But the priesthood is manifestly changed from one order to another, and
from one tribe to another. For he of whom these things are spoken -
Namely, Jesus. Pertaineth to another tribe - That of Judah. Of which no
man was suffered by the law to attend on, or minister at, the altar.

[Hebrews 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 7:14</span></span>

For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah - Whatever
difficulties have arisen since, during so long a tract of time, it was
then clear beyond dispute.

[Hebrews 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 7:15</span></span>

And it is still far more evident, that - Both the priesthood and the law
are changed, because the priest now raised up is not only of another
tribe, but of a quite different order.

[Hebrews 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 7:16</span></span>

Who is made - A priest. Not after the law of a carnal commandment - Not
according to the Mosaic law, which consisted chiefly of commandments
that were carnal, compared to the spirituality of the gospel. But after
the power of an endless life - Which he has in himself, as the eternal
Son of God.

[Hebrews 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 7:18</span></span>

For there is implied in this new and everlasting priesthood, and in the
new dispensation connected therewith, a disannulling of the preceding
commandment - An abrogation of the Mosaic law. For the weakness and
unprofitableness thereof - For its insufficiency either to justify or to
sanctify.

[Hebrews 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 7:19</span></span>

For the law - Taken by itself, separate from the gospel. Made nothing
perfect - Could not perfect its votaries, either in faith or love, in
happiness or holiness. But the bringing in of a better hope - Of the
gospel dispensation, which gives us a better ground of confidence, does.
By which we draw nigh to God - Yea, so nigh as to be one spirit with
him. And this is true perfection.

[Hebrews 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 7:20</span></span>

And - The greater solemnity wherewith he was made priest, farther proves
the superior excellency of his priesthood.

[Hebrews 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 7:21</span></span>

The Lord sware and will not repent - Hence also it appears, that his is
an unchangeable priesthood.

[Hebrews 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 7:22</span></span>

Of so much better a covenant - Unchangeable, eternal. Was Jesus made a
surety - Or mediator. The word covenant frequently occurs in the
remaining part of this epistle. The original word means either a
covenant or a last will and testament. St. Paul takes it sometimes in
the former, sometimes in the latter, sense; sometimes he includes both.

[Hebrews 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 7:23</span></span>

They were many priests - One after another.

[Hebrews 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 7:24</span></span>

He continueth for ever - In life and in his priesthood. That passeth not
away - To any successor.

[Hebrews 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 7:25</span></span>

Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost - From all the guilt,
power, root, and consequence of sin. Them who come - By faith. To God
through him - As their priest. Seeing he ever liveth to make
intercession - That is, he ever lives and intercedes. He died once; he
intercedes perpetually.

[Hebrews 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 7:26</span></span>

For such an high priest suited us - Unholy, mischievous, defiled
sinners: a blessed paradox! Holy - With respect to God. Harmless - With
respect to men. Undefiled - With any sin in himself. Separated from
sinners - As well as free from sin. And so he was when he left the
world. And made - Even in his human nature. Higher than the heavens -
And all their inhabitants.

[Hebrews 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 7:27</span></span>

Who needeth not to offer up sacrifices daily - That is, on every yearly
day of expiation; for he offered once for all: not for his own sins, for
he then offered up himself "without spot to God."

[Hebrews 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 7:28</span></span>

The law maketh men high priests that have infirmity - That are both
weak, mortal, and sinful. But the oath which was since the law - Namely,
in the time of David. Maketh the son, who is consecrated for ever - Who
being now free, both from sin and death, from natural and moral
infirmity, remaineth a priest for ever.
