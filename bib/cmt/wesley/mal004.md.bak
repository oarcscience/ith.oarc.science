### [Malachi Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 4:1</span></span>

Cometh - Tho' it be at a distance from you, yet it is coming and will
overtake you and overwhelm you too. As an oven - The refiner's fire,
[Mal 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md), is now represented as a
fire, burning more dreadfully, as it did indeed when Jerusalem and the
temple were on fire, when the fire raged every where, but most fiercely
where the arched roofs made it double itself, and infold flames with
flames. And this may well be an emblem of the day of judgment.

[Malachi 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 4:2</span></span>

The sun of righteousness - Christ, who is fitly compared to the sun,
being the fountain of light, and vital heat to his church. And of mercy
and benignity; for the Hebrew word imports both. With healing - His
beams shall bring health and strength, with delight and joy, safety and
security. Go forth - Go out of Jerusalem, before the fatal siege. Grow
up - In strength, vigour and spiritual stature. Of the stall - Where
they are safe guarded and well ordered.

[Malachi 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 4:3</span></span>

Tread down the wicked - When believers by faith overcome the world, when
they suppress their corrupt appetites and passions, and when the God of
peace bruises Satan under their feet, then they indeed tread down the
wicked.

[Malachi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 4:4</span></span>

Remember - Now take leave of prophecy, for you shall have no more 'till
the great prophet, 'till Shiloh come, but attend ye diligently to the
law of Moses. For all Israel - So long as they should be a people and
church. Statutes and judgments - Be not partial; statutes and judgments,
that is, the whole law must you attend to, and remember it as God
requires.

[Malachi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 4:5</span></span>

Behold I will send - Though the spirit of prophecy cease for four
hundred years, yet at the expiring of those years, you shall have one
sent, as great as Elijah. Elijah - Namely John the Baptist, who came in
the spirit and power of Elijah, [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md), and therefore bears his name.
Before - That is, immediately before; so he was born six months before
Christ, and began his preaching a few years before Christ began to
exercise his publick office. The great and dreadful day of the Lord -
This literally refers to the times of vengeance upon the Jews, from the
death of Christ to the final desolation of the city and temple, and by
accommodation, to the end of the world.

[Malachi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 4:6</span></span>

And he - John the Baptist. Shall turn the heart - There were at this
time many great and unnatural divisions among the Jews, in which fathers
studied mischief to their own children. Of the children - Undutiful
children estranged from their fathers. With a curse - Which ends in
utter destruction; leaving Jerusalem a desolate heap, and a perpetual
monument of God's displeasure. Some observe, that the last word of the
Old Testament is a curse: whereas the New Testament ends with a
blessing, yea, the choicest of blessings, The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with us all! Amen.

Dec. 24, 1766.
