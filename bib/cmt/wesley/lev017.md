### [Leviticus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001)

[Leviticus 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 17:3</span></span>

That killeth - Not for common use, for such beasts might be killed by
any person or in any place but for sacrifice. In the camp, or out of the
camp - That is, anywhere.

[Leviticus 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 17:4</span></span>

The tabernacle - This was appointed in opposition to the Heathens, who
sacrificed in all places; to cut off occasions of idolatry; to prevent
the people's usurpation of the priest's office, and to signify that God
would accept of no sacrifices but through Christ and in the Church; (of
both which the tabernacle was a type.) But though men were tied to this
law, God was free to dispense with his own law, which he did sometimes
to the prophets, as [Sa1 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#009), [Sa1
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#015). He hath shed blood - He shall
be punished as a murderer. The reason is, because he shed that blood,
which, though not man's blood, yet was precious, being sacred and
appropriated to God, and typically the price by which men's lives were
ransomed.

[Leviticus 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 17:5</span></span>

They offer - The Israelites, before the building of the tabernacle, did
so, from which they are now restrained. Peace - offerings - He nameth
not these exclusively from others, as appears from the reason of the
law, and from [Lev 17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#008), but because
in these the temptation was more common in regard of their frequency,
and more powerful, because part of these belonged to the offerer, and
the pretence was more plausible, because their sanctity was of a lower
degree than others, these being only called holy, and allowed in part to
the people, whereas the others are called most holy, and were wholly
appropriated either to God, or to the priests.

[Leviticus 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 17:6</span></span>

Upon the altar - This verse contains a reason of the foregoing law,
because of God's propriety in the blood and fat, wherewith also God was
well pleased, and the people reconciled. And these two parts only are
mentioned, as the most eminent, and peculiar, though other parts also
were reserved for God.

[Leviticus 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 17:7</span></span>

Unto devils - So they did, not directly or intentionally, but by
construction and consequence, because the devil is the author of
idolatry, and is eminently served, and honoured by it. And as the
Egyptians were notorious for their idolatry, so the Israelites were
infected with their leaven, [Jos
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014), [Eze
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007), [Eze
23:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#002). A whoring - Idolatry,
especially in God's people, is commonly called whoredom, because it is a
violation of that covenant by which they were peculiarly betrothed or
married to God.

[Leviticus 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 17:10</span></span>

I will set my face - I will be an enemy to him, and execute vengeance
upon him immediately; because such persons probably would do this in
private, so that the magistrate could not know nor punish it. Write that
man undone, for ever undone, against whom God sets his face.

[Leviticus 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 17:11</span></span>

Is in the blood - Depends upon the blood, is preserved and nourished by
it. The blood maketh atonement - Typically, and in respect of the blood
of Christ which it represented, by which the atonement is really made.
So the reason is double; because this was eating up the ransom of their
own lives, which in construction was the destroying of themselves.
because it was ingratitude and irreverence towards that sacred blood of
Christ which they ought to have in continual veneration.

[Leviticus 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 17:15</span></span>

That eateth - Through ignorance or inadvertency; for if it was done
knowingly, it was more severely punished. A stranger - Who is a
proselyte to the Jewish religion: other strangers were allowed to eat
such things, [Deu 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021), out of which
the blood was either not drawn at all, or not regularly.

[Leviticus 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 17:16</span></span>

His iniquity - The punishment of it, and therefore must offer a
sacrifice for it.
