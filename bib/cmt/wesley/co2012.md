### [2 Corinthians Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 12:1</span></span>

It is not expedient - Unless on so pressing occasion. Visions are seen;
revelations, heard.

[2 Corinthians 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 12:2</span></span>

I knew a man in Christ - That is, a Christian. It is plain from [Co2
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006.md), that he means himself, though
in modesty he speaks as of a third person. Whether in the body or out of
the body I know not - It is equally possible with God to present distant
things to the imagination in the body, as if the soul were absent from
it, and present with them; or to transport both soul and body for what
time he pleases to heaven; or to transport the soul only thither for a
season, and in the mean time to preserve the body fit for its re -
entrance. But since the apostle himself did not know whether his soul
was in the body, or whether one or both were actually in heaven, it
would be vain curiosity for us to attempt determining it. The third
heaven - Where God is; far above the aerial and the starry heaven. Some
suppose it was here the apostle was let into the mystery of the future
state of the church; and received his orders to turn from the Jews and
go to the gentiles.

[2 Corinthians 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 12:3</span></span>

Yea, I knew such a man - That at another time.

[2 Corinthians 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 12:4</span></span>

He was caught up into paradise - The seat of happy spirits in their
separate state, between death and the resurrection. Things which it is
not possible for man to utter - Human language being incapable of
expressing them. Here he anticipated the joyous rest of the righteous
that die in the Lord. But this rapture did not precede, but follow
after, his being caught up to the third heaven: a strong intimation that
he must first discharge his mission, and then enter into glory. And
beyond all doubt, such a foretaste of it served to strengthen him in all
his after trials, when he could call to mind the very joy that was
prepared for him.

[2 Corinthians 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 12:5</span></span>

Of such an one I will - I might, glory; but I will not glory of myself -
As considered in myself.

[2 Corinthians 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 12:6</span></span>

For if I should resolve to glory - Referring to, I might glory of such a
glorious revelation. I should not be a fool - That is, it could not
justly be accounted folly to relate the naked truth. But I forbear - I
speak sparingly of these things, for fear any one should think too
highly of me - O where is this fear now to be found? Who is afraid of
this?

[2 Corinthians 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 12:7</span></span>

There was given me - By the wise and gracious providence of God. A thorn
in the flesh - A visitation more painful than any thorn sticking in the
flesh. A messenger or angel of Satan to buffet me - Perhaps both visibly
and invisibly; and the word in the original expresses the present, as
well as the past, time. All kinds of affliction had befallen the
apostle. Yet none of those did he deprecate. But here he speaks of one,
as above all the rest, one that macerated him with weakness, and by the
pain and ignominy of it prevented his being lifted up mere, or, at
least, not less, than the most vehement head ache could have done; which
many of the ancients say he laboured under. St. Paul seems to have had a
fresh fear of these buffetings every moment, when he so frequently
represses himself in his boasting, though it was extorted from him by
the utmost necessity.

[2 Corinthians 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 12:8</span></span>

Concerning this - He had now forgot his being lifted up. I besought the
Lord thrice - As our Lord besought his Father.

[2 Corinthians 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 12:9</span></span>

But he said to me - ln answer to my third request. My grace is
sufficient for thee - How tender a repulse! We see there may be grace
where there is the quickest sense of pain. My strength is more
illustriously displayed by the weakness of the instrument. Therefore I
will glory in my weaknesses rather than my revelations, that the
strength of Christ may rest upon me - The Greek word properly means, may
cover me all over like a tent. We ought most willingly to accept
whatever tends to this end, however contrary to flesh and blood.

[2 Corinthians 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 12:10</span></span>

Weaknesses - Whether proceeding from Satan or men. For when I am weak -
Deeply conscious of my weakness, then does the strength of Christ rest
upon me.

[2 Corinthians 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 12:11</span></span>

Though I am nothing - Of myself.

[2 Corinthians 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 12:14</span></span>

The third time - Having been disappointed twice. I seek not yours - Your
goods. But you - Your souls.

[2 Corinthians 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 12:15</span></span>

I will gladly spend - All I have. And be spent - Myself.

[2 Corinthians 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 12:16</span></span>

But some may object, though I did not burden you, though I did not take
anything of you myself, yet being crafty I caught you with guile - I did
secretly by my messengers what I would not do openly, or in person.

[2 Corinthians 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 12:17</span></span>

I answer this lying accusation by appealing to plain fact. Did I make a
gain of you by Titus - Or any other of my messengers? You know the
contrary. It should be carefully observed, that St. Paul does not allow,
but absolutely denies, that he had caught them with guile; so that the
common plea for guile, which has been often drawn from this text, is
utterly without foundation.

[2 Corinthians 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 12:18</span></span>

I desired Titus - To go to you.

[2 Corinthians 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 12:19</span></span>

Think ye that we again excuse ourselves - That I speak this for my own
sake? No. I speak all this for your sakes.

[2 Corinthians 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 12:21</span></span>

Who had sinned before - My last coming to Corinth. Uncleanness - Of
married persons. Lasciviousness - Against nature.
