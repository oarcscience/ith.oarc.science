### [Leviticus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001)

[Leviticus 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 24:2</span></span>

To cause the lamps to burn - Heb. the lamp: yet [Lev
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#004), it is the lamps: The seven lamps
made all one lamp. In allusion to which, the Blessed Spirit is
represented, [Rev 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005), by seven lamps
of fire before the throne. For there are diversities of gifts, but one
spirit.

[Leviticus 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 24:3</span></span>

Aaron - Either by himself, or by his sons, [Exo
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037).

[Leviticus 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 24:4</span></span>

The pure candlestick - So called, partly because it was made of pure
gold, partly because it was to be always kept clean.

[Leviticus 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 24:5</span></span>

Thou - By the priests or Levites, whose work it was to prepare them,
[Ch1 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032). Twelve cakes - Representing
the twelve tribes.

[Leviticus 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 24:6</span></span>

Two rows - Not one above another, but one beside another, as the
frankincense put upon each, [Lev 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007),
shews.

[Leviticus 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lev 24:7</span></span>

Pure frankincense - Unmixed and uncorrupted, or of the best sort, to be
burnt before the Lord. On the bread - And this was done every time that
the bread was changed. For a memorial - For that part which properly
belonged to God, whereas the rest belonged to the priests.

[Leviticus 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lev 24:8</span></span>

From the children of Israel - And these cakes are said to be received
from or offered by the children of Israel, bought with the money which
they contributed. By an everlasting covenant - By virtue of that compact
made between me and them, by which they were obliged to keep this
amongst other commands, and, they so doing, I am obliged to be their God
and to bless them. And this may be here called an everlasting covenant,
not only because it was to endure as long as the Jewish polity stood,
but also because this was to stand everlastingly, or continually, and
therefore the new cakes were first brought before the old were taken
away.

[Leviticus 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 24:9</span></span>

It - The old bread now to be taken away. Made by fire - The incense was
offered by fire, and that for or instead of the bread, and therefore the
bread was reputed as if it had been so offered.

[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

Whose father was an Egyptian - This circumstance seems noted, partly to
shew the danger of marriages with persons of wicked principles, and
partly by this severity against him who was a stranger by the father,
and an Israelite by the mother, to shew that God would not have this sin
go unpunished amongst his people, what - soever he was that committed
it. Went out - Out of Egypt, being one of that mixed multitude, which
came out with the Israelites, [Exo
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#032). It is probable, this was done
when the Israelites were near Sinai.

[Leviticus 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 24:11</span></span>

The name of the Lord - The words of the Lord, or of Jehovah, are
supplied out of [Lev 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016), where they
are expressed; here they are omitted perhaps for the aggravation of his
crime. He blasphemed the name so called by way of eminency; that name
which is above every name; that name which a man should in some sort
tremble to mention; which is not to be named without cause or without
reverence. And cursed - Not the Israelite only, but his God also, as
appears from [Lev 24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015). And they
brought him - Either the people who heard him, or the inferior
magistrate, to whom he was first brought.

[Leviticus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 24:12</span></span>

That the mind of the Lord might be shewed - For God had only said in
general, that he would not hold such guiltless, that is, he would punish
them, but had not declared how he would have them punished by men.

[Leviticus 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 24:14</span></span>

Lay their hands upon his head - Whereby they gave public testimony that
they heard this person speak such words, and did in their own and all
the peoples names, demand justice to be executed upon him, that by this
sacrifice God might be appeased, and his judgments turned away from the
people, upon whom they would certainly fall if he were unpunished. Stone
him - The same punishment which was before appointed for those who
cursed their parents.

[Leviticus 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 24:15</span></span>

Whosoever curseth his God - Speaketh of him reproachfully. Shall bear
his sin - That is, the punishment of it; shall not go unpunished.

[Leviticus 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 24:16</span></span>

He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord - This is a repetition of the
same sin in other words, which is common. As this law is laid down in
general terms, [Lev 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#015), so both the
sin and the punishment are particularly expressed, [Lev
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016). All the congregation - To shew
their zeal for God, and to beget in them the greater dread and
abhorrence of blasphemy.

[Leviticus 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 24:17</span></span>

He that killeth - This law is repeated here, to prevent the mischievous
effects of men's striving together, which as here it caused blasphemy,
so it might in others lead to murder.

[Leviticus 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 24:22</span></span>

One law - That is, in matters of common right, but not as to church
privileges.

[Leviticus 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 24:23</span></span>

Stone him with stones - This blasphemer was the first that died by the
law of Moses. Stephen the first that died for the gospel, died by the
abuse of the law. The martyr and the malefactor suffered the same death;
but how vast the difference between them.
