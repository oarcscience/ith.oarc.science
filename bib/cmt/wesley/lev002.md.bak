### [Leviticus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 2:1</span></span>

A meal - offering - (Not meat - offering, an ancient false print, which
has run thro' many editions of our bible.) This was of two kinds, the
one joined with other offerings, [Num
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#004.md), [Num
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#007.md), [Num
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#010.md), which was prescribed, together
with the measure or proportion of it: the other, of which this place
speaks, was left to the offerer's good will both for the thing, and for
the quantity. And the matter for this offering was things without life,
as meal, corn, or cakes. Now this sort of sacrifices were appointed,
because these are things of greatest necessity and benefit to man, and
therefore it is meet that God should be served with them, and owned and
praised as the giver of them. In condescension to the poor, that they
might not want an offering for God, and to shew that God would accept
even the meanest services, when offered with a sincere mind. These were
necessary provisions for the feast which was to be presented to God, and
for the use of the priests, who were to attend upon these holy
ministrations. He shall pour oil - This may note the graces of the Holy
Ghost, which are compared to oil, and anointing with it, [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md), and which are necessary to make
any offering acceptable to God. Frankincense - Manifestly designed
Christ's satisfaction and intercession, which is compared to a sweet
odour, [Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md).

[Leviticus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 2:2</span></span>

He shall take - That priest to whom he brought it, and who is appointed
to offer it. The memorial - That part thus selected and offered; which
is called a memorial, either to the offerer, who by offering this part
is minded, that the whole of that he brought, and of all which he hath
of that kind, is God's to whom this part was paid as an acknowledgment.
Or to God, whom (to speak after the manner of men) this did put in mind
of his gracious covenant and promises of favour, and acceptance of the
offerer and his offering. A sweet savour unto the Lord - And so are our
spiritual offerings, which are made by the fire of holy love,
particularly that of almsgiving. With such sacrifices God is well -
pleased.

[Leviticus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 2:3</span></span>

Sons - To be eaten by them, [Lev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#016.md).
Most holy - Or such as were to be eaten only by the priests, and that
only in the holy place near the altar.

[Leviticus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 2:4</span></span>

In the oven - Made in the sanctuary for that use.

[Leviticus 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lev 2:6</span></span>

In pieces - Because part of it was offered to God, and part given to the
priests.

[Leviticus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 2:11</span></span>

No leaven - Namely, in that which is offered of free - will; for in
other offerings it might be used, [Lev
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#013.md), [Lev
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017.md). This was forbidden, partly to
mind them of their deliverance out of Egypt, when they were forced thro'
haste to bring away their meal or dough (which was the matter of this
oblation) unleavened; partly to signify what Christ would be, and what
they should be, pure and free from all error in the faith and worship of
God, and from all hypocrisy, and malice or wickedness, all which are
signified by leaven. Nor any honey - Either, because it hath the same
effect with leaven in paste or dough, making it sour, and swelling. Or,
in opposition to the sacrifices of the Gentiles, in which the use of
honey was most frequent. Or, to teach us, that God's worship is not to
be governed by men's fancies and appetites but by God's will.

[Leviticus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lev 2:12</span></span>

Ye may offer them - Or either of them, leaven or honey. They shall not
be burnt - But reserved for the priests.

[Leviticus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 2:13</span></span>

Salt - To signify that incorruption of mind, and sincerity of grace,
which in scripture is signified by salt, [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049.md), [Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006.md), and which is necessary in all
them that would offer an acceptable offering to God. Or in testimony of
that communion which they had with God in these exercises of worship;
salt being the great symbol of friendship in all nations is called,
either, because it represented the perpetuity of God's covenant with
them, which is designed by salt, [Num
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019.md), [Ch2
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#005.md). Or, because it was so
particularly required as a condition of their covenant with God; this
being made absolutely necessary in all their offerings; and as the
neglect of sacrifices was a breach of covenant on their part, so also
was the neglect of salt in their sacrifices.

[Leviticus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 2:14</span></span>

First - fruits - Of thine own free - will; for there were other first -
fruits, and that of several sorts, which were prescribed, and the time,
quality, and proportion of them appointed by God.

[Leviticus 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 2:16</span></span>

Made by fire - The fire denotes that fervency of spirit, which ought to
be in all our religious services. Holy love is the fire, by which all
our offerings must be made: else they are not of a sweet savour to God.
