### [Numbers Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001)

[Numbers 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 22:1</span></span>

The plains of Moab - Which still retained their ancient title, though
they had been taken away from the Moabites by Sihon, and from him by the
Israelites. By Jericho - That is, over against Jericho.

[Numbers 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 22:3</span></span>

Sore afraid - As it was foretold both in general of all nations, [Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025), and particularly concerning
Moab, [Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015).

[Numbers 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 22:4</span></span>

The elders - Called the kings of Midian, [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008), and princes of Midian, [Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021), who though divided into their
kingdoms yet were now united upon the approach of the Israelites their
common enemy, and being, as it seems, a potent and crafty people, and
neighbours to the Moabites, these seek confederacy with them. We read of
Midianites near mount Sinai, Exod. 2, and 3, which seem to have been a
colony of this people, that went out to seek new quarters, as the manner
of those times was, but the body of that people were seated in those
parts. Lick up - That is, consume and utterly destroy, in which sense
the fire is said to lick up the water and sacrifices, [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038). All that are round about us -
All our people, who live in the country adjoining to each city, where
the princes reside.

[Numbers 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 22:5</span></span>

Balaam - Who is called a prophet, [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016), because God was pleased to
inspire and direct him to speak the following prophecies. Indeed many of
the Jewish writers say, that Balaam had been a great prophet, who for
the accomplishment of his predictions, and the answers of his prayers,
had been looked upon justly as a man of great interest with God. However
it is certain, that afterwards for his covetousness, God departed from
him. Beor - Or, Bosor, [Pe2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015), for
he had two names, as many others had. Pethor - A city in Mesopotamia. By
the river - By Euphrates, which is called the river, by way of eminency,
and here the river of Balaam's land or country, to wit, of Mesopotamia.

[Numbers 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 22:6</span></span>

Curse them for my sake and benefit; use thy utmost power, which thou
hast with thy Gods, to blast and ruin them. We may smite them - Thou by
thy imprecations, and I by my sword.

[Numbers 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 22:8</span></span>

This night - The night was the time when God used to reveal his mind by
dreams. The Lord - Heb. Jehovah, the true God, whom he here mentions,
either for his own greater reputation, as if he consulted not with
inferior spirits, but with the supreme God; or rather because this was
Israel's God, and the only possible way of ruining them was by engaging
their God against them: as the Romans and other Heathens, when they went
to besiege any city, used enchantments to call forth that God under
whose peculiar protection they were. Of Moab - And of Midian too.

[Numbers 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 22:9</span></span>

What men are these - He asks this that Balaam by repeating the thing in
God's presence might be convinced and ashamed of his sin and folly, in
offering his service in such a business: and for a foundation to the
following answer.

[Numbers 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 22:20</span></span>

If the men come - On this condition he was to go.

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 22:22</span></span>

Because he went - Because he went of his own accord, with the princes of
Moab, and did not wait till they came to call him, which was the sign
and condition of God's permission, but rather himself rose and called
them. The apostle describes Balaam's sin here to be, that he ran
greedily into an error for reward, [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011). For an adversary - To oppose, if
not to kill him. His servants with him - The rest of the company being
probably gone before them. For in those ancient times there was more of
simplicity, and less of ceremony, and therefore it is not strange that
Balaam came at some distance, after the rest, and attended only by his
own servants.

[Numbers 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 22:28</span></span>

Opened the mouth - Conferred upon her the power of speech and reasoning
for that time.

[Numbers 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 22:29</span></span>

Balaam said - Balaam was not much terrified with the ass's speaking,
because perhaps he was accustomed to converse with evil spirits, who
appeared to him and discoursed with him in the shape of such creatures.
Perhaps he was so blinded by passion, that he did not consider the
strangeness of the thing.

[Numbers 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">num 22:31</span></span>

On his face - In token of reverence and submission.

[Numbers 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">num 22:32</span></span>

Thy way is perverse - Springing from covetousness.

[Numbers 22:33](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">num 22:33</span></span>

I had slain thee - I had slain thee alone, and not her, therefore her
turning aside and falling down was wholly for thy benefit, not for her
own, and thy anger against her was unjust and unreasonable.

[Numbers 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 22:35</span></span>

Go with the men - I allow thee to go, upon the following terms.

[Numbers 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 22:36</span></span>

In the utmost coast - Not far from the camp of the Israelites, whom he
desired him to curse.

[Numbers 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 22:40</span></span>

The princes - Whom the king had left to attend him.

[Numbers 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 22:41</span></span>

The high places of Baal - Consecrated to the worship of Baal, that is,
of Baal Peor, who was their Baal or God. The utmost part - That is, all
that people, even to the utmost and remotest of them, as appears by
comparing this with, [Num 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013). He
hoped that the sight of such a numerous host ready to break in upon his
country would stir up his passion.
