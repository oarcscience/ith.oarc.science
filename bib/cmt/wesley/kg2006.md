### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 6:2</span></span>

Jordan - To the woods near Jordan. A beam - A piece of timber for the
building. Hence it may be gathered, that although the sons of the
prophets principally devoted themselves to religious exercises, yet they
sometimes employed themselves about manual arts.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 6:10</span></span>

Sent - Soldiers to secure the place and passage designed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 6:16</span></span>

They - Angels, unspeakably more numerous, God, infinitely more powerful.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 6:17</span></span>

He saw, &c. - Fire is both dreadful and devouring: that power which was
engaged for Elisha, could both terrify and consume the assailants.
Elijah gave a specimen of Divine justice, when he called for flames of
fire on the heads of his persecutors to consume them. Elisha gives a
specimen of Divine mercy, in heaping coals of fire on the heads of his
persecutors to melt them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 6:22</span></span>

Wouldest thou smite - It is against the laws of humanity, to kill
captives, though thou thyself hast taken them with thy own sword and
bow; which might seem to give thee some colour to destroy them; but much
more unworthy will it be in cold blood to kill these, whom not thy arms,
but God's providence hath put into thy hands. Set bread - Give them meat
and drink, which may refresh and strengthen them for their journey. This
was an action of singular piety and charity, in doing good to their
enemies, which was much to the honour of the true religion; and of no
less prudence, that hereby the hearts of the Syrians might be mollified
towards the Israelites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 6:23</span></span>

No more - For some considerable time.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 6:24</span></span>

Ben - hadad - He whom Ahab wickedly spared, now comes to requite his
kindness, and to fulfil that Divine prediction. Ben - hadad was a name
very frequent among the kings of Syria, if not common to them all.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 6:25</span></span>

Famine in Samaria - Probably the siege was so sudden, that they had no
time to lay in provisions. Pieces - Supposed to be shekels; and the
common shekel being valued at fifteen pence of English money, this
amounts to five pounds. A vast price, especially for that which had on
it so little meat, and that unwholesome and unclean. A kab - A measure
containing twenty - four eggs. Dung - This Hebrew word is of a doubtful
signification, and no where else used, probably it means a sort of
pease, which in the Arabick language (near a - kin to the Hebrew) is
called doves dung: for this was a food much in use amongst the poorer
Israelites, and was a very coarse food, and therefore fit to be joined
with the asses head: and a kab was the usual measure of all sorts of
grains and fruits of that sort.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 6:27</span></span>

Whence shall I help thee - Dost thou ask of me corn or wine, which I
want for myself? If God does not, I cannot help thee. Creatures are
helpless things without God. Every creature is all that, and only that
which God makes it to be.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 6:29</span></span>

We boiled - A dreadful judgment threatened to them in case of their
apostacy, [Deu 28:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056), in which they
were now deeply plunged.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 6:31</span></span>

God do so, &c. - Because he had encouraged them to withstand the
Syrians, by promising them help from God.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg2 6:32</span></span>

He said - Being admonished by God of his danger. This son - The genuine
son of that wicked Ahab the murderer of the Lord's prophets. This
expression may seem very harsh and unfit; nor is it to be drawn into
imitation by others: but it must be considered, that he was an
extraordinary prophet, intrusted with a power in some sort superior to
that of Joram, and had authority to control and rebuke him in the name
of the king of kings. Hold him - That he may not break in upon me, and
take away my life, before the king comes.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg2 6:33</span></span>

He said - Or, the king, who, though not here named, may be presumed to
be present, both by the prophet's prediction of his speedy coming, and
by the presence of the lord, on whose hand the king leaned, [Kg2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002). This evil - This dreadful famine,
which is now so extreme, that women are forced to eat their own
children. The Lord - Hath inflicted it, and (for ought I see) he will
not remove it. All penal evil is of the Lord, as the first cause and
sovereign judge. And this we ought to apply to particular cases: if all
evil, then this evil which we are groaning under. Whoever are the
instruments, God is the principal agent. What should I, &c. - Thou bidst
me wait upon God for help: but I perceive I may wait long enough before
deliverance comes: I am weary with waiting, I can wait no longer.
