### [Ephesians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

[Ephesians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 3:1</span></span>

For this cause - That ye may be so "built together," I am a prisoner for
you gentiles - For your advantage, and for asserting your right to these
blessings. This it was which so enraged the Jews against him.

[Ephesians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 3:2</span></span>

The dispensation of the grace of God given me in your behalf - That is,
the commission to dispense the gracious gospel; to you gentiles in
particular. This they had heard from his own mouth.

[Ephesians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 3:3</span></span>

The mystery - Of salvation by Christ alone, and that both to Jews and
gentiles. As I wrote before - Namely, [Eph
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009); the very words of which
passage he here repeats.

[Ephesians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 3:5</span></span>

Which in other - In former, ages was not so clearly or fully made known
to the sons of men - To any man, no, not to Ezekiel, so often styled,
"son of man;" nor to any of the ancient prophets. Those here spoken of
are New Testament prophets.

[Ephesians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 3:6</span></span>

That the gentiles are joint - heirs - Of God. And of the same body -
Under Christ the head. And joint - partakers of his promise - The
communion of the Holy Ghost.

[Ephesians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 3:7</span></span>

According to the gift of the grace of God - That is, the apostle - ship
which he hath graciously given me, and which he hath qualified me for.
By the effectual working of his power - In me and by me.

[Ephesians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 3:8</span></span>

Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given -
Here are the noblest strains of eloquence to paint the exceeding low
opinion the apostle had of himself, and the fulness of unfathomable
blessings which are treasured up in Christ.

[Ephesians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 3:9</span></span>

What is the fellowship of the mystery - What those mysterious blessings
are whereof all believers jointly partake. Which was, in a great
measure, hidden from eternity by God, who, to make way for the free
exercise of his love, created all things - This is the foundation of all
his dispensations.

[Ephesians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 3:10</span></span>

That the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church - By
what is done in the church, which is the theatre of the divine wisdom.

[Ephesians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 3:12</span></span>

By whom we have free access - Such as those petitioners have, who are
introduced to the royal presence by some distinguished favourite. And
boldness - Unrestrained liberty of speech, such as children use in
addressing an indulgent father, when, without fear of offending, they
disclose all their wants, and make known all their requests.

[Ephesians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 3:13</span></span>

The not fainting is your glory.

[Ephesians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 3:15</span></span>

Of whom - The Father. The whole family of angels in heaven, saints in
paradise, and believers on earth is named. Being the "children of God,"
(a more honourable title than "children of Abraham,") and depending on
him as the Father of the family.

[Ephesians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 3:16</span></span>

The riches of his glory - The immense fulness of his glorious wisdom,
power, and mercy. The inner man - The soul.

[Ephesians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 3:17</span></span>

Dwell - That is, constantly and sensibly abide.

[Ephesians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 3:18</span></span>

That being rooted and grounded - That is, deeply fixed and firmly
established, in love. Ye may comprehend - So far as an human mind is
capable. What is the breadth of the love of Christ - Embracing all
mankind. And length - From everlasting to everlasting. And depth - Not
to be fathomed by any creature. And height - Not to be reached by any
enemy.

[Ephesians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 3:19</span></span>

And to know - But the apostle corrects himself, and immediately
observes, it cannot be fully known. This only we know, that the love of
Christ surpasses all knowledge. That ye may be filled - Which is the sum
of all. With all the fulness of God - With all his light, love, wisdom,
holiness, power, and glory. A perfection far beyond a bare freedom from
sin.

[Ephesians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 3:20</span></span>

Now to him - This doxology is admirably adapted to strengthen our faith,
that we may not stagger at the great things the apostle has been praying
for, as if they were too much for God to give, or for us to expect from
him. That is able - Here is a most beautiful gradation. When he has
given us exceeding, yea, abundant blessings, still we may ask for more.
And he is able to do it. But we may think of more than we have asked. He
is able to do this also. Yea, and above all this. Above all we ask -
Above all we can think. Nay, exceedingly, abundantly above all that we
can either ask or think.

[Ephesians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 3:21</span></span>

In the church - On earth and in heaven.
