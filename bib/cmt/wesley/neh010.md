### [Nehemiah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 10:1</span></span>

Sealed - Both in their own names, and in the name of all the rest. It
may seem strange that Ezra doth not appear among them. But that might be
because he was prevented, by some sickness, or other extraordinary
impediment. It is true, we meet with Ezra after this, at the dedication
of the wall of Jerusalem, [Neh 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036.md),
and therefore he was then freed from this impediment, whatsoever it was.

[Nehemiah 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">neh 10:29</span></span>

Their nobles - The commonality agreed with the nobles in this good work,
great men never look so great, as when they encourage religion and are
examples of it: and they would by that, as much as any thing, make an
interest in the most valuable of their inferiors, who would cleave to
them closer than they can imagine. Observe their nobles are called their
brethren; for in the things of God, rich and poor, high and low meet
together. They cleave - They ratified what the others had done in their
names, declaring their assent to it.

[Nehemiah 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 10:31</span></span>

People of the land - The Heathens. On the sabbath - They that covenant
to keep all the commandments of God, must particularly covenant to keep
the sabbath holy. For the profanation of this is a sure inlet to all
manner of profaneness.
