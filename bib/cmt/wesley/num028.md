### [Numbers Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 28:2</span></span>

Command the children of Israel - God here repeats some of the former
laws about sacrifices, not without great reason, partly because they had
been generally discontinued for thirty eight years together; partly
because the generation to which the former laws had been given about
these things was wholly dead, and it was fit the new generation should
be instructed about them, as their parents were; partly to renew their
testimonies of God's grace and mercy, notwithstanding their frequent
forfeitures thereof by their rebellion: and principally because they
were now ready to enter into that land, in which they were obliged to
put these things in practice.

[Numbers 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 28:7</span></span>

In the holy place - Upon the altar of burnt offerings, which was in the
court of the priests, nigh to the entrance into the sanctuary.

[Numbers 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 28:17</span></span>

The feast - Namely, of unleavened bread.

[Numbers 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 28:23</span></span>

In the morning - And that in the evening too, as is evident from other
scriptures; but the morning - sacrifice alone is mentioned, because the
celebration of the feast began with it, and principally because this
alone was doubtful, whether this might not be omitted when so many other
sacrifices were offered in that morning, whereas there was no question
but the evening sacrifice should be offered, when there were none other
to be offered.

[Numbers 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 28:26</span></span>

The day of the first fruits - In the feast of pentecost, [Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md). Your weeks - The seven weeks
which you are to number from the passover.
