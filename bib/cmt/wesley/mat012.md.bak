### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 12:1</span></span>

His disciples plucked the ears of corn, and ate - Just what sufficed for
present necessity: dried corn was a common food among the Jews. [Mar
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md); [Luk
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 12:3</span></span>

Have ye not read what David did - And necessity was a sufficient plea
for his transgressing the law in a higher instance.

[Matthew 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 12:4</span></span>

He entered into the house of God - Into the tabernacle. The temple was
not yet built. The show bread - So they called the bread which the
priest, who served that week, put every Sabbath day on the golden table
that was in the holy place, before the Lord. The loaves were twelve in
number, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel: when the new were
brought, the stale were taken away, but were to be eaten by the priests
only. [Sa1 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 12:5</span></span>

The priests in the temple profane the Sabbath - That is, do their
ordinary work on this, as on a common day, cleansing all things, and
preparing the sacrifices. A greater than the temple - If therefore the
Sabbath must give way to the temple, much more must it give way to me.

[Matthew 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 12:7</span></span>

I will have mercy and not sacrifice - That is, when they interfere with
each other, I always prefer acts of mercy, before matters of positive
institution: yea, before all ceremonial institutions whatever; because
these being only means of religion, are suspended of course, if
circumstances occur, wherein they clash with love, which is the end of
it. [Mat 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md).

[Matthew 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 12:8</span></span>

For the Son of man - Therefore they are guiltless, were it only on this
account, that they act by my authority, and attend on me in my ministry,
as the priests attended on God in the temple: is Lord even of the
Sabbath - This certainly implies, that the Sabbath was an institution of
great and distinguished importance; it may perhaps also refer to that
signal act of authority which Christ afterward exerted over it, in
changing it from the seventh to the first day of the week. If we suppose
here is a transposition of [Mat
12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md), then [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008.md) is a proof of [Mat
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 12:9</span></span>

[Mar 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001.md); [Luk
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 12:12</span></span>

It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day - To save a beast, much more
a man.

[Matthew 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 12:18</span></span>

He shall show judgment to the heathens - That is, he shall publish the
merciful Gospel to them also: the Hebrew word signifies either mercy or
justice. [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md), &c.

[Matthew 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 12:19</span></span>

He shall not strive, nor clamour; neither shall any man hear his voice
in the streets - That is, he shall not be contentious, noisy, or
ostentatious: but gentle, quiet, and lowly. We may observe each word
rises above the other, expressing a still higher degree of humility and
gentleness.

[Matthew 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 12:20</span></span>

A bruised reed - A convinced sinner: one that is bruised with the weight
of sin: smoking flax - One that has the least good desire, the faintest
spark of grace: till he send forth judgment unto victory - That is, till
he make righteousness completely victorious over all its enemies.

[Matthew 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 12:21</span></span>

In his name - That is, in him.

[Matthew 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 12:22</span></span>

A demoniac, blind and dumb - Many undoubtedly supposed these defects to
be merely natural. But the Spirit of God saw otherwise, and gives the
true account both of the disorder and the cure. How many disorders,
seemingly natural, may even now be owing to the same cause? [Luk
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 12:23</span></span>

Is not this the son of David - That is, the Messiah.

[Matthew 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 12:24</span></span>

[Mar 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#022.md).

[Matthew 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 12:25</span></span>

Jesus knowing their thoughts - It seems they had as yet only said it in
their hearts.

[Matthew 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 12:26</span></span>

How shall his kingdom be established - Does not that subtle spirit know
thin is not the way to establish his kingdom?

[Matthew 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 12:27</span></span>

By whom do your children - That is, disciples, cast them out - It seems,
some of them really did this; although the sons of Sceva could not.
Therefore shall they be your judge - Ask them, if Satan will cast out
Satan: let even them be judges in this matter. And they shall convict
you of obstinacy and partiality, who impute that in me to Beelzebub,
which in them you impute to God. Beside, how can I rob him of his
subjects, till I have conquered him? The kingdom of God is come upon you
- Unawares; before you expected: so the word implies.

[Matthew 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 12:29</span></span>

How can one enter into the strong one's house, unless he first bind the
strong one - So Christ coming into the world, which was then eminently
the strong one's, Satan's house, first bound him, and then took his
spoils.

[Matthew 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 12:30</span></span>

He that is not with me is against me - For there are no neuters in this
war. Every one must be either with Christ or against him; either a loyal
subject or a rebel. And there are none upon earth, who neither promote
nor obstruct his kingdom. For he that does not gather souls to God,
scatters them from him.

[Matthew 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 12:31</span></span>

The blasphemy against the Spirit - How much stir has been made about
this? How many sermons, yea, volumes, have been written concerning it?
And yet there is nothing plainer in all the Bible. It is neither more
nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil,
which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost. [Mar
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#028.md); [Luk
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#010.md).

[Matthew 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 12:32</span></span>

Whosoever speaketh against the Son of man - In any other respects: It
shall be forgiven him - Upon his true repentance: But whosoever speaketh
thus against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven, neither in this
world nor in the world to come - This was a proverbial expression among
the Jews, for a thing that would never be done. It here means farther,
He shall not escape the punishment of it, either in this world, or in
the world to come. The judgment of God shall overtake him, both here and
hereafter.

[Matthew 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 12:33</span></span>

Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree corrupt
and its fruit corrupt - That is, you must allow, they are both good, or
both bad. - For if the fruit is good, so is the tree; if the fruit is
evil, so is the tree also. For the tree is known by its fruit - As if he
had said, Ye may therefore know me by my fruits. By my converting
sinners to God, you may know that God hath sent me. [Mat
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016.md); [Luk
6:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#043.md).

[Matthew 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 12:34</span></span>

In another kind likewise, the tree is known by its fruit - Namely, the
heart by the conversation.

[Matthew 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 12:36</span></span>

Ye may perhaps think, God does not so much regard your words. But I say
to you - That not for blasphemous and profane words only, but for every
idle word which men shall speak - For want of seriousness or caution;
for every discourse which is not conducive to the glory of God, they
shall give account in the day of judgment.

[Matthew 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 12:37</span></span>

For by thy words (as well as thy tempers and works) thou shalt then be
either acquitted or condemned. Your words as well as actions shall he
produced in evidence for or against you, to prove whether you was a true
believer or not. And according to that evidence you will either be
acquitted or condemned in the great day.

[Matthew 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 12:38</span></span>

We would see a sign - Else we will not believe this. [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md); [Luk
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#016.md), [Luk
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#029.md).

[Matthew 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 12:39</span></span>

An adulterous generation - Whose heart wanders from God, though they
profess him to be their husband. Such adulterers are all those who love
the world, and all who seek the friendship of it. Seeketh a sign - After
all they have had already, which were abundantly sufficient to convince
them, had not their hearts been estranged from God, and consequently
averse to the truth. The sign of Jonah - Who was herein a type of
Christ.

[Matthew 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 12:40</span></span>

Three days and three nights - It was customary with the eastern nations
to reckon any part of a natural day of twenty - four hours, for the
whole day. Accordingly they used to say a thing was done after three or
seven days, if it was done on the third or seventh day, from that which
was last mentioned. Instances of this may be seen, [Kg1
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#029.md); and in many other places. And
as the Hebrews had no word to express a natural day, they used night and
day, or day and night for it. So that to say a thing happened after
three days and three nights, was with them the very same, as to say, it
happened after three days, or on the third day. See [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md); [Est
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#001.md); [Gen
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md), [Gen
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#012.md); [Exo
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018.md); [Exo
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md). [Jon
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 12:42</span></span>

She came from the uttermost parts of the earth - That part of Arabia
from which she came was the uttermost part of the earth that way, being
bounded by the sea. [Kg1 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 12:43</span></span>

But how dreadful will be the consequence of their rejecting me? When the
unclean spirit goeth out - Not willingly, but being compelled by one
that is stronger than he. He walketh - Wanders up and down; through dry
places - Barren, dreary, desolate; or places not yet watered with the
Gospel: Seeking rest, and findeth none - How can he, while he carries
with him his own hell? And is it not the case of his children too?
Reader, is it thy case? [Luk 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024.md).

[Matthew 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 12:44</span></span>

Whence he came out - He speaks as if he had come out of his own accord:
See his pride! He findeth it empty - of God, of Christ, of his Spirit:
Swept - from love, lowliness, meekness, and all the fruits of the
Spirit: And garnished - With levity and security: so that there is
nothing to keep him out, and much to invite him in.

[Matthew 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 12:45</span></span>

Seven other spirits - That is, a great many; a certain number being put
for an uncertain: More wicked than himself - Whence it appears, that
there are degrees of wickedness among the devils themselves: They enter
in and dwell - For ever in him who is forsaken of God. So shall it be to
this wicked generation - Yea, and to apostates in all ages.

[Matthew 12:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 12:46</span></span>

His brethren - His kinsmen: they were the sons of Mary, the wife of
Cleopas, or Alpheus, his mother's sister; and came now seeking to take
him, as one beside himself, [Mar 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md).
[Mar 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#031.md); [Luk
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#019.md).

[Matthew 12:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 12:48</span></span>

And he answering, said - Our Lord's knowing why they came, sufficiently
justifies his seeming disregard of them.

[Matthew 12:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">mat 12:49</span></span>

See the highest severity, and the highest goodness! Severity to his
natural, goodness to his spiritual relations! In a manner disclaiming
the former, who opposed the will of his heavenly Father, and owning the
latter, who obeyed it.
