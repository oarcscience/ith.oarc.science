<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 33:10</span></span>

Our sins - The unpardoned guilt, and the unsupportable punishment of our
sins, in the wasting of our country, burning our city, abolishing the
publick worship of God; we shall pine away, 'tis too late to hope. How -
How can it be better with us?

[Ezekiel 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#021.md)

Opened my mouth - Not that the prophet was utterly dumb before, for he
had prophesied against many nations, only he was forbidden to say
anything of the Jews, But now the spirit moved him to speak, and
continued his motion, 'till the messenger came, and ever after.

They - Who were left behind, now come out of their holes, or returned
from neighbouring countries, or permitted by the conqueror to stay and
plant vineyards. Wastes - Places once fruitful and abounding with
people, but now, made a desolate wilderness. He inherited - Our father
had a right to all this land, when but one; we his children though
diminished, are many, and the divine goodness will surely continue to us
both right and possession. Is given - It was given by promise to us, the
seed, as well as to our progenitor; nay more, 'tis given us in
possession, whereas Abraham had not one foot of it.

find the elders of Judah, [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md), so
the disciples of the rabbis sat at their feet.
