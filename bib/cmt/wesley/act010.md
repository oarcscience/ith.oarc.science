### [Acts Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

[Acts 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 10:1</span></span>

And there was a certain man - The first fruits of the Gentiles, in
Cesarea - Where Philip had been before, [Act
8:40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040); so that the doctrine of
salvation by faith in Jesus was not unknown there. Cesarea was the seat
of the civil government, as Jerusalem was of the ecclesiastical. It is
observable, that the Gospel made its way first through the metropolitan
cities. So it first seized Jerusalem and Cesarea: afterward Philippi,
Athens, Corinth, Ephesus, Rome itself. A centurion, or captain, of that
called the Italian band - That is, troop or company.

[Acts 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 10:2</span></span>

Who gave much alms to the people - That is, to the Jews, many of whom
were at that time extremely poor.

[Acts 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 10:3</span></span>

He saw in a vision - Not in a trance, like Peter: plainly, so as to
leave one not accustomed to things of this kind no room to suspect any
imposition.

[Acts 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 10:4</span></span>

Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God - Dare
any man say, These were only splendid sins? Or that they were an
abomination before God? And yet it is certain, in the Christian sense
Cornelius was then an unbeliever. He had not then faith in Christ. So
certain it is, that every one who seeks faith in Christ, should seek it
in prayer, and doing good to all men: though in strictness what is not
exactly according to the Divine rule must stand in need of Divine favour
and indulgence.

[Acts 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 10:8</span></span>

A devout soldier - How many such attendants have our modern officers? A
devout soldier would now be looked upon as little better than a deserter
from his colours.

[Acts 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 10:10</span></span>

And he became very hungry - At the usual meal time. The symbols in
visions and trances, it is easy to observe, are generally suited to the
state of the natural faculties.

[Acts 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 10:11</span></span>

Tied at the corners - Not all in one knot, but each fastened as it were
up to heaven.

[Acts 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 10:14</span></span>

But Peter said, In nowise, Lord - When God commands a strange or
seemingly improper thing, the first objection frequently finds pardon.
But it ought not to be repeated. This doubt and delay of St. Peter had
several good effects. Hereby the will of God in this important point was
made more evident and incontestable. And Peter also, having been so slow
of belief himself, could the more easily bear the doubting of his
brethren, [Act 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#002), &c.

[Acts 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 10:15</span></span>

What God hath purified - Hath made and declared clean. Nothing but what
is clean can come down from heaven. St. Peter well remembered this
saying in the council at Jerusalem, [Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009).

[Acts 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 10:16</span></span>

This was done thrice - To make the deeper impression.

[Acts 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 10:17</span></span>

While Peter doubted in himself, behold the men - Frequently the things
which befall us within and from without at the same time, are a key to
each other. The things which thus concur and agree together, ought to be
diligently attended to.

[Acts 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 10:19</span></span>

Behold three men seek thee, arise therefore and go down, and go with
them, doubting nothing - How gradually was St. Peter prepared to receive
this new admonition of the Spirit! Thus God is went to lead on his
children by degrees, always giving them light for the present hour.

[Acts 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 10:24</span></span>

Cornelius was waiting for them - Not engaging himself in any secular
business during that solemn time, but being altogether intent on this
one thing.

[Acts 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 10:26</span></span>

I myself also am a man - And not God, who alone ought to be worshipped,
[Mat 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010). Have all his pretended
successors attended to this?

[Acts 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 10:28</span></span>

But God hath showed me - He speaks sparingly to them of his former
doubt, and his late vision.

[Acts 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 10:29</span></span>

I ask for what intent ye have sent for me? - St. Peter knew this
already. But he puts Cornelius on telling the story, both that the rest
might be informed, and Cornelius himself more impressed by the
narration: the repetition of which, even as we read it, gives a new
dignity and spirit to Peter's succeeding discourse,

[Acts 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 10:30</span></span>

Four days ago I was fasting - The first of these days he had the vision;
the second his messengers came to Joppa; on the third, St. Peter set
out; and on the fourth, came to Cesarea.

[Acts 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 10:31</span></span>

Thy prayer is heard - Doubtless he had been praying for instruction, how
to worship God in the most acceptable manner.

[Acts 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 10:33</span></span>

Now therefore we are all present before God - The language of every
truly Christian congregation.

[Acts 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 10:34</span></span>

I perceive of a truth - More clearly than ever, from such a concurrence
of circumstances. That God is not a respecter of persons - Is not
partial in his love. The words mean, in a particular sense, that he does
not confine his love to one nation; in a general, that he is loving to
every man, and willeth all men should be saved.

[Acts 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 10:35</span></span>

But in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteousness - He
that, first, reverences God, as great, wise, good, the cause, end, and
governor of all things; and secondly, from this awful regard to him, not
only avoids all known evil, but endeavours, according to the best light
he has, to do all things well; is accepted of him - Through Christ,
though he knows him not. The assertion is express, and admits of no
exception. He is in the favour of God, whether enjoying his written word
and ordinances or not. Nevertheless the addition of these is an
unspeakable blessing to those who were before in some measure accepted.
Otherwise God would never have sent an angel from heaven to direct
Cornelius to St. Peter.

[Acts 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 10:36</span></span>

This is the word which God sent - When he sent his Son into the world,
preaching - Proclaiming by him - peace between God and man, whether Jew
or Gentile, by the God - man. He is Lord of both; yea, Lord of and over
all.

[Acts 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 10:37</span></span>

Ye know the word which was published - You know the facts in general,
the meaning of which I shall now more particularly explain and confirm
to you. The baptism which John preached - To which he invited them by
his preaching, in token of their repentance. This began in Galilee,
which is near Cesarea.

[Acts 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 10:38</span></span>

How God anointed Jesus - Particularly at his baptism, thereby
inaugurating him to his office: with the Holy Ghost and with power - It
is worthy our remark, that frequently when the Holy Ghost is mentioned
there is added a word particularly adapted to the present circumstance.
So the deacons were to be full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003). Barnabas was full of the Holy
Ghost and faith, [Act 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024). The
disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost, [Act
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#052). And here, where his mighty
works are mentioned, Christ himself is said to be anointed with the Holy
Ghost and with power. For God was with him - He speaks sparingly here of
the majesty of Christ, as considering the state of his hearers.

[Acts 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">act 10:41</span></span>

Not now to all the people - As before his death; to us who did eat and
drink with him - That is, conversed familiarly and continually with him,
in the time of his ministry.

[Acts 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 10:42</span></span>

It is he who is ordained by God the Judge of the living and the dead -
Of all men, whether they are alive at his coming, or had died before it.
This was declaring to them, in the strongest terms, how entirely their
happiness depended on a timely and humble subjection to him who was to
be their final Judge.

[Acts 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 10:43</span></span>

To him give all the prophets witness - Speaking to heathens he does not
quote any in particular; that every one who believeth in him - Whether
he be Jew or Gentile; receiveth remission of sins - Though he had not
before either feared God, or worked righteousness.

[Acts 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 10:44</span></span>

The Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word - Thus were they
consecrated to God, as the first fruits of the Gentiles. And thus did
God give a clear and satisfactory evidence, that he had accepted them as
well as the Jews.

[Acts 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 10:45</span></span>

The believers of the circumcision - The believing Jews.

[Acts 10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">act 10:47</span></span>

Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have
received the Holy Ghost? - He does not say they have the baptism of the
Spirit; therefore they do not need baptism with water. But just the
contrary: if they have received the Spirit, then baptize them with
water. How easily is this question decided, if we will take the word of
God for our rule! Either men have received the Holy Ghost or not. If
they have not, Repent, saith God, and be baptized, and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Ghost. If they have, if they are already baptized
with the Holy Ghost, then who can forbid water?

[Acts 10:48](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">act 10:48</span></span>

In the name of the Lord - Which implies the Father who anointed him, and
the Spirit with which he was anointed to his office. But as the Gentiles
had before believed in God the Father, and could not but now believe in
the Holy Ghost, under whose powerful influence they were at this very
time, there was the less need of taking notice, that they were baptized
into the belief and profession of the sacred Three: though doubtless the
apostle administered the ordinances in that very form which Christ
himself had prescribed.
