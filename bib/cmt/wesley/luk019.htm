<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#001">Luke 19:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">luk 19:1</A></FONT></span></p>He passed through Jericho - So that Zaccheus must have lived near the end of the town: the tree was in the town itself. And he was rich - These words seem to refer to the discourse in the last chapter, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#024">Luk 18:24-27</A>, particularly to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#027">Luk 18:27</A>. Zaccheus is a proof, that it is possible by the power of God for even a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#002">Luke 19:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">luk 19:2</A></FONT></span></p>The chief of the publicans - What we would term, commissioner of the customs. A very honourable as well as profitable place. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#004">Luke 19:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">luk 19:4</A></FONT></span></p>And running before - With great earnestness. He climbed up - Notwithstanding his quality: desire conquering honour and shame. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005">Luke 19:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">luk 19:5</A></FONT></span></p>Jesus said, Zaccheus, make haste and come down - What a strange mixture of passions must Zaccheus have now felt, hearing one speak, as knowing both his name and his heart! 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#007">Luke 19:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">luk 19:7</A></FONT></span></p>They all murmured - All who were near: though most of them rather out of surprise than indignation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#008">Luke 19:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">luk 19:8</A></FONT></span></p>And Zaccheus stood - Showing by his posture, his deliberate, purpose and ready mind, and said, Behold, Lord, I give - I determine to do it immediately. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009">Luke 19:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">luk 19:9</A></FONT></span></p>He also is a son of Abraham - A Jew born, and as such has a right to the first offer of salvation. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010">Luke 19:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">luk 19:10</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011">Mat 18:11</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#011">Luke 19:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">luk 19:11</A></FONT></span></p>They thought the kingdom of God - A glorious temporal kingdom, would immediately appear. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012">Luke 19:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">luk 19:12</A></FONT></span></p>He went into a far country to receive a kingdom - Christ went to heaven, to receive his sovereign power as wan, even all authority in heaven and earth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014">Mat 25:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034">Mar 13:34</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013">Luke 19:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">luk 19:13</A></FONT></span></p>Trade till I come - To visit the nation, to destroy Jerusalem, to judge the world: or, in a more particular sense, to require thy soul of thee. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#014">Luke 19:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">luk 19:14</A></FONT></span></p>But his citizens - Such were those of Jerusalem, hated him, and sent an embassy after him - The word seems to imply, their sending ambassadors to a superior court, to enter their protest against his being admitted to the regal power. In such a solemn manner did the Jews protest, as it were, before God, that Christ should not reign over them: this man - So they call him in contempt. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#015">Luke 19:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">luk 19:15</A></FONT></span></p>When he was returned - In his glory. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#023">Luke 19:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">luk 19:23</A></FONT></span></p>With interest - Which does not appear to be contrary to any law of God or man. But this is no plea for usury, that is, the taking such interest as implies any degree of oppression or extortion. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#025">Luke 19:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">luk 19:25</A></FONT></span></p>They said - With admiration, not envy. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#026">Luke 19:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">luk 19:26</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029">Mat 25:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018">Luk 8:18</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#027">Luke 19:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">luk 19:27</A></FONT></span></p>He went before - The foremost of the company, showing his readiness to suffer. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029">Luke 19:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">luk 19:29</A></FONT></span></p>He drew nigh to the place where the borders of Bethphage and Bethany met, which was at the foot of the mount of Olives. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001">Mat 21:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001">Mar 11:1</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037">Luke 19:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">luk 19:37</A></FONT></span></p>The whole multitude began to praise God - Speaking at once, as it seems, from a Divine impulse, words which most of them did not understand. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038">Luke 19:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">luk 19:38</A></FONT></span></p>Peace in heaven - God being reconciled to man. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#039">Luke 19:39</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">luk 19:39</A></FONT></span></p>Rebuke thy disciples - Paying thee this immoderate honour. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040">Luke 19:40</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">luk 19:40</A></FONT></span></p>If these should hold their peace, the stones, which lie before you, would cry out - That is, God would raise up some still more unlikely instruments to declare his praise. For the power of God will not return empty. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042">Luke 19:42</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_042">luk 19:42</A></FONT></span></p>O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day - After thou hast neglected so many. Thy day - The day wherein God still offers thee his blessings. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043">Luke 19:43</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_043">luk 19:43</A></FONT></span></p>Thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee around - All this was exactly performed by Titus, the Roman general. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044">Luke 19:44</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_044">luk 19:44</A></FONT></span></p>And thy children within thee - All the Jews were at that time gathered together, it being the time of the passover. They shall not leave in thee one stone upon another - Only three towers were left standing for a time, to show the former strength and magnificence of the place. But these likewise were afterward levelled with the ground.
