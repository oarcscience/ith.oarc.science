### [John Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

[John 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 20:1</span></span>

[Mat 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md); [Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md); [Luk
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md).

[John 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 20:3</span></span>

Peter went out - Of the city.

[John 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 20:6</span></span>

Peter seeth the linen clothes lie - and the napkin folded up - The
angels who ministered to him when he rose, undoubtedly folded up the
napkin and linen clothes.

[John 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 20:8</span></span>

He saw - That the body was not there, and believed - That they had taken
it away as Mary said.

[John 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 20:9</span></span>

For as yet - They had no thought of his rising again.

[John 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 20:10</span></span>

They went home - Not seeing what they could do farther.

[John 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 20:11</span></span>

But Mary stood - With more constancy. [Mar
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md).

[John 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 20:16</span></span>

Jesus saith to her, Mary - With his usual voice and accent.

[John 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 20:17</span></span>

Touch me not - Or rather, Do not cling to me (for she held him by the
feet,) [Mat 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009.md). Detain me not now.
You will have other opportunities of conversing with me. For I am not
ascended to my Father - I have not yet left the world. But go
immediately to my brethren - Thus does he intimate in the strongest
manner the forgiveness of their fault, even without ever mentioning it.
These exquisite touches, which every where abound in the evangelical
writings, show how perfectly Christ knew our frame. I ascend - He
anticipates it in his thoughts, and so speaks of it as a thing already
present. To my Father and your Father, to my God and your God - This
uncommon expression shows that the only - begotten Son has all kind of
fellowship with God. And a fellowship with God the Father, some way
resembling his own, he bestows upon his brethren. Yet he does not say,
Our God: for no creature can be raised to an equality with him: but my
God and your God: intimating that the Father is his in a singular and
incommunicable manner; and ours through him, in such a kind as a
creature is capable of.

[John 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 20:19</span></span>

[Mar 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md); [Luk
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md).

[John 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 20:21</span></span>

Peace be unto you - This is the foundation of the mission of a true
Gospel minister, peace in his own soul, [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md). As the Father hath sent me, so
send I you - Christ was the apostle of the Father, [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md). Peter and the rest, the apostles
of Christ.

[John 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 20:22</span></span>

He breathed on them - New life and vigour, and saith, as ye receive this
breath out of my mouth, so receive ye the Spirit out of my fulness: the
Holy Ghost influencing you in a peculiar manner, to fit you for your
great embassy. This was an earnest of pentecost.

[John 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 20:23</span></span>

Whose soever sins ye remit - (According to the tenor of the Gospel, that
is, supposing them to repent and believe) they are remitted, and whose
soever sins ye retain (supposing them to remain impenitent) they are
retained. So far is plain. But here arises a difficulty. Are not the
sins of one who truly repents, and unfeignedly believes in Christ,
remitted, without sacerdotal absolution? And are not the sins of one who
does not repent or believe, retained even with it? What then does this
commission imply? Can it imply any more than, A power of declaring with
authority the Christian terms of pardon; whose sins are remitted and
whose retained? As in our daily form of absolution; and A power of
inflicting and remitting ecclesiastical censures? That is, of excluding
from, and re - admitting into, a Christian congregation.

[John 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 20:26</span></span>

After eight days - On the next Sunday.

[John 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 20:28</span></span>

And Thomas said, My Lord and my God - The disciples had said, We have
seen the Lord. Thomas now not only acknowledges him to be the Lord, as
he had done before, and to be risen, as his fellow disciples had
affirmed, but also confesses his Godhead, and that more explicitly than
any other had yet done. And all this he did without putting his hand
upon his side.

[John 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 20:30</span></span>

Jesus wrought many miracles, which are not written in this book - Of St.
John, nor indeed of the other evangelists.

[John 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 20:31</span></span>

But these things are written that ye may believe - That ye may be
confirmed in believing. Faith cometh sometimes by reading; though
ordinarily by hearing.
