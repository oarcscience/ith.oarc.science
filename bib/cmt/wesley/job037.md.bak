[Job 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 37:2</span></span>

Hear - It is probable that while Elihu was speaking it thundered, and
that tempest was begun, wherewith God ushered in his speech. And this
might occasion his return to that subject of which he had discoursed
before. Voice - The thunder is called God's voice. Because by it God
speaks to the children of men, to fear before him. Mouth - That is
produced by God's word or command, which is often signified by his
mouth.

[Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 37:3</span></span>

Directeth - His voice: which he guideth like an arrow to the mark, that
it may do that work for which he sends it.

[Job 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 37:4</span></span>

After - After the lightning, which is seen before the thunder is hard.
Them - The lightnings spoken of in the beginning of the verse.

[Job 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 37:6</span></span>

Strength - Those storms of rain which come with great force and
irresistible violence.

[Job 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 37:7</span></span>

Sealeth - By these snows and rains he drives men out of the fields, and
seals or binds up their hands from their work. That - They may seriously
contemplate on these, and other great and glorious works of God.

[Job 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 37:9</span></span>

Cold - Freezing winds.

[Job 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 37:10</span></span>

The waters - The waters which had freely spread themselves before, are
congealed and bound up in crystal fetters.

[Job 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 37:11</span></span>

Watering - The earth. They spend themselves and are exhausted watering
the earth, until they are weary. Wearieth - Them with much water, and
making them to go long journeys to water remote parts, and at last to
empty themselves there: all which things make men weary; and therefore
are here said to make the clouds weary by a common figure. Scattereth -
As for the white and lightsome clouds, he scatters and dissolves them by
the wind or sun.

[Job 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 37:12</span></span>

Turned - The clouds are carried about to this or that place. Not by
chance (though nothing seems to be more casual than the motions of the
clouds) but by his order and governance.

[Job 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 37:13</span></span>

Correction - To scourge or correct men by immoderate showers. Earth -
The whole earth, which is said to be the Lord's, [Psa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md), [Psa
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012.md), and so this may denote a
general judgment by excessive rains inflicted upon the earth, and all
its inhabitants, even the universal deluge, which came in great measure
out of the clouds. Mercy - For the benefit of mankind and for the
cooling of the air and improving the fruits of the earth.

[Job 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 37:14</span></span>

Consider - If there be so much matter of wonder in the most obvious
works of God, how wonderful must his secret counsels be?

[Job 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 37:15</span></span>

Them - The things before mentioned, the clouds, rain, snow, and other
meteors. Did God acquaint thee with his counsels in the producing and
ordering of them? His cloud - Probably the rainbow, seated in a cloud,
which may well be called God's cloud, because therein God puts his bow,
[Gen 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013.md).

[Job 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 37:16</span></span>

Balancings - How God doth as it were weigh the clouds in balances, so
that although they are full of water, yet they are kept up by the thin
air.

[Job 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 37:17</span></span>

Quieteth - The air about the earth. From the south - By the sun's coming
into the southern parts, which makes the air quiet and warm.

[Job 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 37:18</span></span>

With him - Wast thou his assistant in spreading out the sky like a
canopy over the earth? Strong - Which though it be very thin and
transparent, yet is also firm and compact and steadfast. Looking glass -
Made of brass and steel, as the manner then was. Smooth and polished,
without the least flaw. In this, as in a glass, we may behold the glory
of God and the wisdom of his handy - work.

[Job 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 37:19</span></span>

Teach us - If thou canst. Say unto him - Of these things. Order - To
maintain discourse with him, both because of the darkness of the matter,
God's counsels being a great depth; and because of the darkness of our
minds.

[Job 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 37:20</span></span>

Shall - I send a challenge to God, or a message that I am ready to
debate with him concerning his proceedings? Speak - If a man should be
so bold to enter the lists with God. Swallowed up - With the sense of
his infinite majesty.

[Job 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 37:21</span></span>

Light - The sun; which is emphatically called light, and here the bright
light: which men cannot behold or gaze on, when the sky is very clear:
and therefore it is not strange if we cannot see God, or discern his
counsels and ways. Them - The sky by driving away those clouds which
darkened it.

[Job 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 37:22</span></span>

North - From the northern winds which scatter the clouds, and clear the
sky. Elihu concludes with some short, but great sayings, concerning the
glory of God. He speaks abruptly and in haste, because it should seem,
he perceived God was approaching, and presumed he was about to take the
work into his own hands.

[Job 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 37:23</span></span>

Find - We cannot comprehend him: his power, wisdom, justice, and his
counsels proceeding from them are past our finding out. Power -
Therefore as he doth not need any unrighteous action to advance himself,
so he cannot do it, because all such things are acts of weakness.
Judgment - In the just administration of judgment, he never did, nor can
exercise that power unjustly, as Job seemed to insinuate. Afflict -
Without just cause.

[Job 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 37:24</span></span>

Fear - Fear or reverence him, and humbly submit to him, and not presume
to quarrel or dispute with him. Wise of heart - Wise in their own eyes.
