### [Psalms Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 22:1</span></span>

My God - Who art my friend and father, though now thou frownest upon me.
The repetition denotes, the depth of his distress, which made him cry so
earnestly. Forsaken - Withdrawn the light of thy countenance, the
supports and comforts of thy spirit, and filled me with the terrors of
thy wrath: this was in part verified in David, but much more fully in
Christ. Roaring - My out - cries forced from me, by my miseries.

[Psalms 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 22:3</span></span>

But thou art - Just and true in all thy ways, this he adds to strengthen
his faith, and to enforce his prayers, and prevail with God for the
honour of his holy name, to hear and help him. Inhabitest - Whom thy
people are perpetually praising.

[Psalms 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 22:6</span></span>

A worm - Neglected and despised. People - Not only of the great men, but
also of the common people. Which doth not so truly agree to David as to
Christ.

[Psalms 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 22:7</span></span>

Shoot out - They gape with their mouths, in mockery. This and the next
verse are applied to Christ, [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039.md), [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043.md).

[Psalms 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 22:12</span></span>

Bulls - Wicked and violent, and potent enemies; for such are so called,
[Eze 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md). Of Bashan - As the cattle there
bred were, and therefore fierce and furious.

[Psalms 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 22:14</span></span>

Water - My spirits are spent and gone like water which once spilt can
never be recovered; my very flesh is melted within me, and I am become
as weak as water. Bones - I am as unable to help myself, and as full of
torment, as if all my bones were disjointed. Wax - Melted, through fear
and overwhelming grief.

[Psalms 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 22:15</span></span>

Dried - I have in a manner no more moisture left in me, than is in a dry
potsherd. Cleaveth - Through excessive thirst and drought. Death - Thy
providence, delivering me into the power of mine enemies, and by thy
terrors in my soul.

[Psalms 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 22:16</span></span>

Dogs - So he calls his enemies for their insatiable greediness, and
implacable fierceness against him. Pierced - These words cannot with any
probability be applied to David, but were properly and literally
verified in Christ.

[Psalms 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 22:17</span></span>

May tell - By my being stretched out upon the cross.

[Psalms 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 22:18</span></span>

They part - This also cannot be applied to David, but was literally
fulfilled in Christ, [Mat 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035.md); [Joh
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024.md).

[Psalms 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 22:20</span></span>

Darling - Heb. my only one; his soul, which he so calls, because it was
left alone and destitute of friends and helpers.

[Psalms 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 22:21</span></span>

Heard - Answered and delivered me.

[Psalms 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 22:22</span></span>

Declare - When thou hast delivered me. Thy name - that power and
faithfulness and goodness, which thou hast manifested on my behalf.
Congregations - The same whom he calls the congregation, and the seed of
Jacob and Israel: which also does not so fitly agree to David, who never
gives this title to any, but such as were near a - kin to him, as it
does to Christ, who extends this name to all his disciples, [Mat
12:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#048.md), and to whom this very text
is applied, [Heb 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md).

[Psalms 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 22:24</span></span>

Abhorred - He did not turn away his face from it, as men do from things
which they abhor. From him - For ever: tho' he did so for a time.

[Psalms 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 22:25</span></span>

Great congregation - In the universal church, of Jews and Gentiles.

[Psalms 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 22:26</span></span>

Satisfied - This is doubtless to be understood, of those spiritual
blessings, that grace and peace, and comfort, which all believing souls
have in the sense of God's love, the pardon of their sins, and the
influences of God's spirit. Seek him - That seek his favour. Your heart
- He speaks of the same persons still, though there be a change from the
third to the second person, as is usual in these poetical books. For
ever - Your comfort shall not be short and transitory, as worldly
comforts are, but everlasting.

[Psalms 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 22:27</span></span>

The world - All nations from one end of the world to the other. So this
is an evident prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles, and a clear
proof, that this psalm immediately speaks of Christ; to whom alone, this
and divers other passages of it, belong. Remember - They shall remember
their former wickedness with grief and shame, and fear; particularly in
worshiping dead and impotent idols. They shall remember their great and
manifold obligation to God, which they had quite forgotten, his patience
in sparing them so long, in the midst of all their impieties, and in
giving his son for them: they shall remember the gracious words and
glorious works of Christ, what he did, and suffered for them; which
possibly divers of them had been eye and ear - witnesses of. The Lord -
Into the only true God, and unto Jesus Christ, to whom this name of
Jehovah is often ascribed in scripture.

[Psalms 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 22:28</span></span>

For - This is added as a reason, why the Gentiles should be converted,
because God is not only God and the Lord of the Jews, but also of the
Gentiles, and of all nations.

[Psalms 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 22:29</span></span>

Fat - Kings and princes, and the great men of the world. Shall eat -
Shall feed upon the bread of life, Christ and all his benefits. Worship
- This is added to shew what kind of eating he spoke of. Go down - That
is, all mankind, for none can escape death.

[Psalms 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 22:30</span></span>

A seed - Christ shall not want a seed or posterity, for though the
Jewish nation will generally reject him, the Gentiles shall come in
their stead. A generation - That believing seed shall be reputed both by
God and men, The generation, or people of the Lord, as the Jews formerly
were.

[Psalms 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 22:31</span></span>

They - The seed last mentioned. Come - From Judea and Jerusalem (from
whence the gospel was first to go forth) to the Gentile world, to the
several parts whereof the apostles went upon this errand. His - God's
righteousness: his wonderful grace and mercy unto mankind, in giving
them Christ and the gospel; for righteousness is often put for mercy or
kindness. Unto - Unto succeeding generations. Whereby David gives us a
key to understand this psalm, and teaches us that he speaks not here of
himself, but of things which were to be done in after - ages, even of
the spreading of the gospel among the Gentiles, in the time of the New
Testament. That he - They shall declare that this is the work of God,
and not of man.
