The day - Of vengeance, [Joe 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md),
cometh, or will soon overtake you, O sinful, unthankful! bloody! Jews.
Thy spoil - All thou hast, O, Jerusalem, shall become a prey to thine
enemy.

The valley of the mountains - A place provided of God for their safety.
O Lord my God - As if it were said, though it will, O Lord, put us into
fear; yet without such wonderful works we shall not see thy salvation;
therefore, O Lord my God come, and bring thy holy ones with thee.

waters - The quickening, saving truths of the gospel, with all its
ordinances in purity. From Jerusalem - The church of Christ, the true
Jerusalem. The former sea - Or eastern sea. The hinder sea - Or western

All the land - The whole land of Judea, a type of the whole earth, shall
be filled with the knowledge of God. As a plain - All high, uneven
places, all rocky and barren grounds, shall be changed into fruitful
vineyards. So the church of Christ shall be fruitful, humble and lovely.
Geba - The north boundary of the land. Rimmon - The south boundary of
Judea. Jerusalem - Which taken mystically, is the church of Christ, and

may be afflictions but no utter wasting of Jerusalem; the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.

That is left - That escapes the stroke. To worship - By a ceremonial
usage which shadowed out a better worship, the prophet foretells the
constant zeal of the converted Gentiles to worship the Lord. The feast
of tabernacles - One solemn festival is by a figure, put for all the
days consecrated to God for holy worship.

[Zechariah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md)

Shall there be - Written as it were on every common thing. Holiness unto
the Lord - Their persons shall bear the dedicating inscription of
holiness to the Lord, and by their study of holiness they shall make
good their motto. The pots - Which were used in the kitchens of the
temple, and were not accounted so sacred as the utensils near the
sacrifices, and altar. The bowls - Which received the blood of the
sacrifices, were esteemed more holy; so shall thy holiness in these days
exceed the holiness of those former days.

[Zechariah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 14:21</span></span>

Every pot - The utensils of private houses shall be all dedicated to
God's service. That sacrifice - So the prophet expresses all religious
affections, practice, and worship, which shall be as pleasing to God, as
were the sacrifices of his people offered up with divine warrant and
approbation. Seethe therein - That part of the sacrifice which
pertaineth to the priests, and to the offerer to feast on. The Canaanite
- Any of the accursed nation, or one who makes merchandise of religion.
But all shall know that the Lord hath the greatest pleasure in upright,
and sincere love and holiness.
