### [Acts Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001.md)

[Acts 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 17:1</span></span>

And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia - St. Luke
seems to have been left at Philippi; and to have continued in those
parts, travelling from place to place among the Churches, till St. Paul
returned thither. For here he leaves off speaking of himself as one of
St. Paul's company; neither does he resume that style, till we find them
together there, [Act 20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md). After
this he constantly uses it to the end of the history. Amphipolis and
Apollonia were cities of Macedonia.

[Acts 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 17:2</span></span>

And Paul, according to his custom - Of doing all things, as far as might
be, in a regular manner, went in to them three Sabbath days - Not
excluding the days between.

[Acts 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 17:4</span></span>

Of the principal women, not a few - Our free thinkers pique themselves
upon observing, that women are more religious than men; and this, in
compliment both to religion and good manners, they impute to the
weakness of their understandings. And indeed as far as nature can go, in
imitating religion by performing the outward acts of it, this picture of
religion may make a fairer show in women than in men, both by reason of
their more tender passions, and their modesty, which will make those
actions appear to more advantage. But in the case of true religion,
which always implies taking up the cross, especially in time of
persecution, women lie naturally under a great disadvantage, as having
less courage than men. So that their embracing the Gospel was a stronger
evidence of the power of him whose strength is perfected in weakness, as
a stronger assistance of the Holy Spirit was needful for them to
overcome their natural fearfulness.

[Acts 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 17:11</span></span>

These were more ingenuous - Or generous. To be teachable in the things
of God is true generosity of soul. The receiving the word with all
readiness of mind, and the most accurate search into the truth, are well
consistent.

[Acts 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 17:12</span></span>

Many of the - Of the Jews. And of the Grecian women - Who were followed
by their husbands.

[Acts 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 17:16</span></span>

While Paul was waiting for the - Having no design, as it seems, to
preach at Athens, but his zeal for God drew him into it unawares,
without staying till his companions came.

[Acts 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 17:18</span></span>

Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosopher - The Epicureans entirely
denied a providence, and held the world to be the effect of mere chance;
asserting sensual pleasure to be man's chief good, and that the soul and
body died together. The Stoics held, that matter was eternal; that all
things were governed by irresistible fate; that virtue was its own
sufficient reward, and vice its own sufficient punishment. It is easy to
see, how happily the apostle levels his discourse at some of the most
important errors of each, while, without expressly attacking either, he
gives a plain summary of his own religious principles. What would this
babbler say? - Such is the language of natural reason, full of, and
satisfied with itself. Yet even here St. Paul had some fruit; though
nowhere less than at Athens. And no wonder, since this city was a
seminary of philosophers, who have ever been the pest of true religion.
He seemeth to be a proclaimer - This he returns upon them at [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md); of strange gods - Such as are
not known even at Athens. Because he preached to them Jesus and the
resurrection - A god and a goddess. And as stupid as this mistake was,
it is the less to be wondered at, since the Athenians might as well
count the resurrection a deity, as shame, famine, and many others.

[Acts 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 17:19</span></span>

The Areopagus, or hill of Mars, (dedicated to Mars, the heathen god of
war,) was the place where the Athenians held their supreme court of
judicature. But it does not appear he was carried thither as a criminal.
The original number of its judges was twelve; but afterward it increased
to three hundred. These were generally men of the greatest families in
Athens, and were famed for justice and integrity.

[Acts 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 17:21</span></span>

And the strangers sojourning there - And catching the distemper of them.
Some new thing - The Greek word signifies some newer thing. New things
quickly grew cheap, and they wanted those that were newer still.

[Acts 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 17:22</span></span>

Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus - An ample theatre;
said - Giving them a lecture of natural divinity, with admirable wisdom,
acuteness, fulness, and courtesy. They inquire after new things: Paul in
his divinely philosophical discourse, begins with the first, and goes on
to the last things, both which were new things to them. He points out
the origin and the end of all things, concerning which they had so many
disputes, and equally refutes both the Epicurean and Stoic. I perceive -
With what clearness and freedom does he speak! Paul against Athens!

[Acts 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 17:23</span></span>

I found an altar - Some suppose this was set up by Socrates, to express
in a covert way his devotion to the only true God, while he derided the
plurality of the heathen gods, for which he was condemned to death: and
others, that whoever erected this altar, did it in honour to the God of
Israel, of whom there was no image, and whose name Jehovah was never
made known to the idolatrous Gentiles. Him proclaim I unto you - Thus he
fixes the wandering attention of these blind philosophers; proclaiming
to them an unknown, and yet not a new God.

[Acts 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 17:24</span></span>

God who made the world - Thus is demonstrated even to reason, the one
true, good God; absolutely different from the creatures, from every part
of the visible creation.

[Acts 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 17:25</span></span>

Neither is he served as though he needed any thing - or person - The
Greek word equally takes in both. To all - That live and breathe; - in
him we live; and breathe - In him we move. By breathing life is
continued. I breathe this moment: the next is not in my power: and all
things - For in him we are. So exactly do the parts of this discourse
answer each other.

[Acts 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 17:26</span></span>

He hath made of one blood the whole nation of men - By this expression
the apostle showed them in the most unaffected manner, that though he
was a Jew, be was not enslaved to any narrow views, but looked on all
mankind as his brethren: having determined the times - That it is God
who gave men the earth to inhabit, Paul proves from the order of times
and places, showing the highest wisdom of the Disposer, superior to all
human counsels. And the bounds of their habitation - By mountains, seas,
rivers, and the like.

[Acts 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 17:27</span></span>

If haply - The way is open; God is ready to be found. But he will lay no
force upon man; they might feel after him - This is in the midst between
seeking and finding. Feeling being the lowest and grossest of all our
senses, is fitly applied to the low knowledge of God; though he be not
far from every one of us - We need not go far to seek or find him. He is
very near us; in us. It is only perverse reason which thinks he is afar
off.

[Acts 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 17:28</span></span>

In him - Not in ourselves, we live, and move, and have our being - This
denotes his necessary, intimate, and most efficacious presence. No words
can better express the continual and necessary dependence of all created
beings, in their existence and all their operations, on the first and
almighty cause, which the truest philosophy as well as divinity teaches.
As certain also of your own poets have said - Aratus, whose words these
are, was an Athenian, who lived almost three hundred years before this
time. They are likewise to be found, with the alteration of one letter
only, in the hymn of Cleanthes to Jupiter or the supreme being, one of
the purest and finest pieces of natural religion in the whole world of
Pagan antiquity.

[Acts 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 17:29</span></span>

We ought not to think - A tender expression especially in the first per
son plural. As if he had said, Can God himself be a less noble being
than we who are his offspring? Nor does he only here deny, that these
are like God, but that they have any analogy to him at all, so as to be
capable of representing him.

[Acts 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 17:30</span></span>

The times of ignorance - What! does he object ignorance to the knowing
Athenians? Yes, and they acknowledge it by this very altar. God
overlooked - As one paraphrases, "The beams of his eye did in a manner
shoot over it." He did not appear to take notice of them, by sending
express messages to them as he did to the Jews. But now - This day, this
hour, saith Paul, puts an end to the Divine forbearance, and brings
either greater mercy or punishment. Now he commandeth all men every
where to repent - There is a dignity and grandeur in this expression,
becoming an ambassador from the King of heaven. And this universal
demand of repentance declared universal guilt in the strongest manner,
and admirably confronted the pride of the haughtiest Stoic of them all.
At the same time it bore down the idle plea of fatality. For how could
any one repent of doing what he could not but have done?

[Acts 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 17:31</span></span>

He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world - How fitly
does he speak this, in their supreme court of justice? By the man - So
he speaks, suiting himself to the capacity of his hearers. Whereof he
hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the
dead - God raising Jesus demonstrated hereby, that he was to be the
glorious Judge of all. We are by no means to imagine that this was all
which the apostle intended to have said, but the indolence of some of
his hearers and the petulancy of others cut him short.

[Acts 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 17:32</span></span>

Some mocked - Interrupting him thereby. They took offence at that which
is the principal motive of faith, from the pride of reason. And having
once stumbled at this, they rejected all the rest.

[Acts 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 17:33</span></span>

So Paul departed - Leaving his hearers divided in their judgment.

[Acts 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 17:34</span></span>

Among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite - One of the judges of that
court: on whom some spurious writings have been fathered in later ages,
by those who are fond of high sounding nonsense.
