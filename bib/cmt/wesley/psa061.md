*Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible*, by John Wesley, \[1754-65\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 61](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#001)

[Psalms 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 61:2</span></span>

The end - To which David was driven. Lead me - Convey me into some high
and secure fortress.

[Psalms 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 61:4</span></span>

I will - I shall, I doubt not, be restored to the tabernacle, and
worship thee there all my days.

[Psalms 61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 61:5</span></span>

Heritage - Thou hast granted me this singular mercy, to live in God's
land, to enjoy his presence, and to worship in his tabernacle; which is
the heritage that all that fear thee, prize and desire above all things.

[Psalms 61:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 61:6</span></span>

Prolong - The years of my life and reign. Thus he speaks because his
kingdom was not like Saul's, but established to him and his heirs; and
because Christ, his son and heir, should actually, and in his own person
possess the kingdom for ever.

[Psalms 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 61:7</span></span>

Abide - In the throne. Before God - Living and ruling as in God's
presence, serving God and worshipping him in his tabernacle. Truth - Thy
truth in giving me those mercies which thou hast promised, and thy mercy
in giving me such further blessings as I needs.
