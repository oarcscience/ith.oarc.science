The forest - More fully called the house of the forest of Lebanon, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">Kg1 7:2</A>, not because it was built in Lebanon, for it was in Jerusalem; but because it was built of the trees of Lebanon.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">isa 22:23</A></FONT></span></p>Fasten - I will establish the power in his hands. Sure place - In the strong walls, or solid timber, in the house. He shall be - By his prudent and righteous government he shall procure great glory, to all that have any relation to him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024">Isaiah 22:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">isa 22:24</A></FONT></span></p>The glory - Of his own kindred and family, who shall all depend upon him, and receive glory from him; of the house of David, which is called his father's house, because he was of the blood - royal.
