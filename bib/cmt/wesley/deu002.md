<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 2:7</span></span>

The Lord hath blessed thee - By God's blessing thou art able to buy thy
conveniences, and therefore thy theft and rapine will be inexcusable,
because without any pretence of necessity. He knoweth - Heb. He hath
known, that is, observed, or regarded with care and kindness, which that

procure what thou wantest or desirest.

this enterprize, and so dwelling together, and by degrees uniting
together by marriages, they became one people. Caphtor - Which is by the

riches of part of that country which drew others thither from places
equally remote, or for some other reason now unknown.

nations that heard of them.

more mischievous and dangerous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 2:29</span></span>

As the children of Esau did - They did permit them to pass quietly by
the borders, though not through the heart of their land, and in their
passage the people sold them meat and drink, being it seems more kind to
them than their king would have had them; and therefore they here

king, but to the people, the children of Esau.
