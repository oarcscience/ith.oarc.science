### [Titus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

[Titus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 1:1</span></span>

Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ - Titles suitable
to the person of Paul, and the office he was assigning to Titus.
According to the faith - The propagating of which is the proper business
of an apostle. A servant of God - According to the faith of the elect.
An apostle of Jesus Christ - According to the knowledge of the truth. We
serve God according to the measure of our faith: we fulfil our public
office according to the measure of our knowledge. The truth that is
after godliness - Which in every point runs parallel with and supports
the vital, spiritual worship of God; and, indeed, has no other end or
scope. These two verses contain the sum of Christianity, which Titus was
always to have in his eye. Of the elect of God - Of all real Christians

[Titus 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 1:2</span></span>

In hope of eternal life - The grand motive and encouragement of every
apostle and every servant of God. Which God promised before the world
began - To Christ, our Head.

[Titus 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 1:3</span></span>

And he hath in his own times - At sundry times; and his own times are
fittest for his own work. What creature dares ask, "Why no sooner?"
Manifested his word - Containing that promise, and the whole "truth
which is after godliness." Through the preaching wherewith I am
intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour - And who
dares exercise this office on any less authority?

[Titus 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 1:4</span></span>

My own son - Begot in the same image of God, and repaying a paternal
with a filial affection. The common faith - Common to me and all my
spiritual children.

[Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 1:5</span></span>

The things which are wanting - Which I had not time to settle myself.
Ordain elders - Appoint the most faithful, zealous men to watch over the
rest. Their character follows, [Tit
1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md). These were the elders, or
bishops, that Paul approved of; - men that had living faith, a pure
conscience, a blameless life.

[Titus 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 1:6</span></span>

The husband of one wife - Surely the Holy Ghost, by repeating this so
often, designed to leave the Romanists without excuse.

[Titus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 1:7</span></span>

As the steward of God - To whom he intrusts immortal souls. Not
selfwilled - Literally, pleasing himself; but all men "for their good to
edification." Not passionate - But mild, yielding, tender.

[Titus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 1:9</span></span>

As he hath been taught - Perhaps it might be more literally rendered,
according to the teaching, or doctrine, of the apostles; alluding to
[Act 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md).

[Titus 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 1:10</span></span>

They of the circumcision - The Jewish converts.

[Titus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 1:11</span></span>

Stopped - The word properly means, to put a bit into the mouth of an
unruly horse.

[Titus 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 1:12</span></span>

A prophet - So all poets were anciently called; but, besides, Diogenes
Laertius says that Epimenides, the Cretan poet, foretold many things.
Evil wild beasts - Fierce and savage.

[Titus 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 1:14</span></span>

Commandments of men - The Jewish or other teachers, whoever they were
that turned from the truth.

[Titus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 1:15</span></span>

To the pure - Those whose hearts are purified by faith this we allow.
All things are pure - All kinds of meat; the Mosaic distinction between
clean and unclean meats being now taken away. But to the defiled and
unbelieving nothing is pure - The apostle joins defiled and unbelieving,
to intimate that nothing can be clean without a true faith: for both the
understanding and conscience, those leading powers of the soul, are
polluted; consequently, so is the man and all he does.
