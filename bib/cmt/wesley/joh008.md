### [John Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001.md)

[John 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 8:5</span></span>

Moses hath commanded us to stone such - If they spoke accurately, this
must have been a woman, who, having been betrothed to a husband, had
been guilty of this crime before the marriage was completed; for such
only Moses commanded to be stoned. He commanded indeed that other
adulteresses should be put to death; but the manner of death was not
specified. [Deu 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md).

[John 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 8:6</span></span>

That they might have to accuse him - Either of usurping the office of a
judge, if he condemned her, or of being an enemy to the law, if he
acquitted her. Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground
- God wrote once in the Old Testament; Christ once in the New: perhaps
the words which he afterward spoke, when they continued asking him. By
this silent action, he, fixed their wandering, hurrying thoughts, in
order to awaken their consciences: and, signified that he was not then
come to condemn but to save the world.

[John 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 8:7</span></span>

He that is without sin - He that is not guilty: his own conscience being
the judge) either of the same sin, or of some nearly resembling it; let
him - as a witness, cast the first stone at her.

[John 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 8:9</span></span>

Beginning at the eldest - Or the elders. Jesus was left alone - By all
those scribes and Pharisees who proposed the question. But many others
remained, to whom our Lord directed his discourse presently after.

[John 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 8:10</span></span>

Hath no man condemned thee? - Hath no judicial sentence been passed upon
thee?

[John 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 8:11</span></span>

Neither do I condemn thee - Neither do I take upon me to pass any such
sentence. Let this deliverance lead thee to repentance.

[John 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 8:12</span></span>

He that followeth me shall in nowise walk in darkness - In ignorance,
wickedness, misery: but shall have the light of life - He that closely,
humbly, steadily follows me, shall have the Divine light continually
shining upon him, diffusing over his soul knowledge, holiness, joy, till
he is guided by it to life everlasting.

[John 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 8:13</span></span>

Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not valid - They retort
upon our Lord his own words, [Joh
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md); if I testify of myself, my
testimony is not valid. He had then added, There is another who
testifieth of me. To the same effect he replies here, [Joh
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014.md), Though I testify of myself, yet
my testimony is valid; for I am inseparably united to the Father. I know
- And from firm and certain knowledge proceeds the most unexceptionable
testimony: whence I came, and whither I go - To these two heads may be
referred all the doctrine concerning Christ. The former is treated of
[Joh 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016.md), &c, the latter [Joh
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md), &c. For I know whence I came -
That is, For I came from God, both as God and as man. And I know it,
though ye do not.

[John 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 8:15</span></span>

Ye judge after the flesh - As the flesh, that is, corrupt nature
dictates. I judge no man - Not thus; not now; not at my first coming.

[John 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 8:16</span></span>

I am not alone - No more in judging, than in testifying: but I and the
Father that sent me - His Father is in him, and he is in the Father,
[Joh 14:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md); and so the Father is no
more alone without the Son, than the Son is without the Father, [Pro
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md), [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030.md). His Father and he are not one
and another God, but one God, (though distinct persons,) and so
inseparable from each other. And though the Son came from the Father, to
assume human nature, and perform his office as the Messiah upon earth,
as God is sometimes said to come from heaven, for particular
manifestations of himself; yet Christ did not leave the Father, nor the
Father leave him, any more than God leaves heaven when he is said to
come down to the earth.

[John 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 8:17</span></span>

[Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md).

[John 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 8:19</span></span>

Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered - Showing the
perverseness of their question; and teaching that they ought first to
know the Son, if they would know the Father. Where the Father is - he
shows, [Joh 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md). Meantime he plainly
intimates that the Father and he were distinct persons, as they were two
witnesses; and yet one in essence, as the knowledge of him includes the
knowledge of the Father.

[John 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 8:23</span></span>

Ye are - Again he passes over their interruption, and proves what he
advanced, [Joh 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#021.md). Of them that are
beneath - From the earth. I am of them that are above - Here he directly
shows whence he came, even from heaven, and whither he goes.

[John 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 8:24</span></span>

If ye believe not that I AM - Here (as in [Joh
8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058).md) our Lord claims the Divine name,
I AM, [Exo 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md). But the Jews, as if
he had stopped short, and not finished the sentence, answered, Who art
thou?

[John 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 8:25</span></span>

Even what I say to you from the beginning - The same which I say to you,
as it were in one discourse, with one even tenor from the time I first
spake to you.

[John 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 8:26</span></span>

I have many things to say and to judge of you - I have much to say
concerning your inexcusable unbelief: but he that sent me is true -
Whether ye believe or no. And I speak the things which I have heard from
him - I deliver truly what he hath given me in charge.

[John 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 8:27</span></span>

They understood not - That by him that sent him he meant God the Father.
Therefore in [Joh 8:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028.md) he speaks
plainly of the Father, and again claims the Divine name, I AM.

[John 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 8:28</span></span>

When ye shall have lifted up - On the cross, ye shall know - And so many
of them did, that I AM - God over all; and that I do nothing of myself -
Being one with the Father.

[John 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 8:29</span></span>

The Father hath not left me alone - Never from the moment I came into
the world.

[John 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 8:32</span></span>

The truth - Written in your hearts by the Spirit of God, shall make you
free - From guilt, sin, misery, Satan.

[John 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 8:33</span></span>

They - The other Jews that were by, (not those that believed,) as
appears by the whole tenor of the conversation. We were never enslaved
to any man - A bold, notorious untruth. At that very time they were
enslaved to the Romans.

[John 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 8:34</span></span>

Jesus answered - Each branch of their objection, first concerning
freedom, then concerning their being Abraham's offspring, [Joh
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037.md), &c. He that committeth sin, is,
in fact, the slave of sin.

[John 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 8:35</span></span>

And the slave abideth not in the house - All sinners shall be cast out
of God's house, as the slave was out of Abraham's: but I, the Son, abide
therein for ever.

[John 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 8:36</span></span>

If I therefore make you free, ye - shall partake of the same privilege:
being made free from all guilt and sin, ye shall abide in the house of
God for ever.

[John 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 8:37</span></span>

I know that ye are Abraham's offspring - As to the other branch of your
objection, I know that, ye are Abraham's offspring, after the flesh; but
not in a spiritual sense. Ye are not followers of the faith of Abraham:
my word hath no place in your hearts.

[John 8:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 8:41</span></span>

Ye do the deeds of your father - He is not named yet. But when they
presumed to call God their Father, then he is expressly called the
devil, [Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md).

[John 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 8:42</span></span>

I proceeded forth - As God, and come - As Christ.

[John 8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 8:43</span></span>

Ye cannot - Such is your stubbornness and pride, hear - Receive, obey my
word. Not being desirous to do my will, ye cannot understand my
doctrine, [Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md).

[John 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 8:44</span></span>

He was a murderer - In inclination, from the beginning - Of his becoming
a devil; and abode not in the truth - Commencing murderer and liar at
the same time. And certainly he was a killer of men (as the Greek word
properly signifies) from the beginning of the world: for from the very
creation he designed and contrived the ruin of men. When he speaketh a
lie, he speaketh of his own - For he is the proper parent, and, as it
were, creator of it. See the origin not only of lies, but of evil in
general!

[John 8:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 8:45</span></span>

Because I speak the truth - Which liars hate.

[John 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 8:46</span></span>

Which of you convicteth me of sin? - And is not my life as unreprovable
as my doctrine? Does not my whole behaviour confirm the truth of what I
teach?

[John 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 8:47</span></span>

He that is of God - That either loves or fears him, heareth - With joy
and reverence, God's words - Which I preach.

[John 8:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 8:48</span></span>

Say we not well - Have we not just cause to say, Thou art, a Samaritan -
An enemy to our Church and nation; and hast a devil? - Art possessed by
a proud and lying spirit?

[John 8:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 8:49</span></span>

I honour my Father - I seek his honour only.

[John 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 8:50</span></span>

I seek not my own glory - That is, as I am the Messiah, I consult not my
own glory. I need not. For my Father consulteth it, and will pass
sentence on you accordingly.

[John 8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 8:51</span></span>

If a man keep my word - So will my Father consult my glory. We keep his
doctrine by believing, his promises by hoping, his command by obeying.
He shall never see death - That is, death eternal. He shall live for
ever. Hereby he proves that he was no Samaritan; for the Samaritans in
general were Sadducees.

[John 8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">joh 8:54</span></span>

If I honour myself - Referring to their words, Whom makest thou thyself?

[John 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">joh 8:56</span></span>

He saw it - By faith in types, figures, and promises; as particularly in
Melchisedec; in the appearance of Jehovah to him in the plains of Mamre,
[Gen 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md); and in the promise that in
his seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. Possibly he had
likewise a peculiar revelation either of Christ's first or second
coming.

[John 8:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 8:57</span></span>

Thou art not yet fifty years old - At the most. Perhaps the gravity of
our Lord's countenance, together with his afflictions and labours, might
make him appear older than he really was. Hast thou seen Abraham - Which
they justly supposed must have been, if Abraham had seen him.

[John 8:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 8:58</span></span>

Before Abraham was I AM - Even from everlasting to everlasting. This is
a direct answer to the objection of the Jews, and shows how much greater
he was than Abraham.

[John 8:59](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">joh 8:59</span></span>

Then they took up stones - To stone him as a blasphemer; but Jesus
concealed himself - Probably by becoming invisible; and so passed on -
With the same ease as if none had been there.
