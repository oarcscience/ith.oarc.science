### [Judges Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md)

[Judges 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 18:1</span></span>

Those days - Not long after Joshua's death. The tribe - A part of that
tribe, consisting only of six hundred men of war, with their families,
[Jdg 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#016.md), [Jdg
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#021.md). Inheritance - The lot had
fallen to them before this time, but not the actual possession, because
the Philistines and Amorites opposed them.

[Judges 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 18:2</span></span>

There - Not in the same house, but near it.

[Judges 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 18:3</span></span>

Knew - By the acquaintance which some of them formerly had with him.

[Judges 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 18:5</span></span>

Ask - By thine Ephod, and Teraphim, or images, which they knew he had,
[Jdg 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md).

[Judges 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 18:6</span></span>

Before the Lord - That is, your design is under the eye of God; that is,
under his care, protection and direction. This answer he either feigns
to gratify their humour; or, did indeed receive from the devil, who
transformed himself into an angel of light, and in God's name gave him
answers, and those not sometimes very true, which God suffered for the
trial of his people. But it is observable, his answer was, as the
devil's oracles usually were, ambiguous, and such as might have been
interpreted either way.

[Judges 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 18:7</span></span>

Manner of the Zidonians - Who living in a very strong place, and
abounding in wealth, and perceiving that the Israelites never attempted
anything against them, were grown secure and careless. Put to shame -
Or, that might rebuke or punish any thing, that is, any crime. Putting
to shame seems to be used for inflicting civil punishment, because shame
is generally the effect of it. Zidonians - Who otherwise could have
succoured them, and would have been ready to do it. No business - No
league or confederacy, nor much converse with other cities, it being in
a pleasant and plentiful soil, between the two rivulets of Jor and Dan,
not needing supplies from others, and therefore minding only their own
ease and pleasure.

[Judges 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 18:10</span></span>

Given - This they gather partly from God's promise which they supposed
they had from the Levite's mouth; and partly from his providence, which
had so disposed them, that they would be an easy prey.

[Judges 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 18:12</span></span>

Mahaneh - dan - That is, the camp of Dan.

[Judges 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 18:13</span></span>

To the house - That is, to the town in which his house was, for they
were not yet entered into it.

[Judges 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jdg 18:14</span></span>

Answered - That is, spake, the word answering being often used in
scripture of the first speaker. These houses - That is, in one of these
houses. What to do - Whether it be not expedient to take them for your
farther use.

[Judges 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 18:17</span></span>

Thither - Into the house, and that part of it, where those things were.
The gate - Whither they had drawn him forth, that they might without
noise or hindrance take them away.

[Judges 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jdg 18:18</span></span>

These - The five men.

[Judges 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 18:19</span></span>

Lay thy hand - That is, be silent. A family - Namely, a tribe, that is,
a family.

[Judges 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 18:20</span></span>

Was glad - Being wholly governed by his own interest. The midst - Both
for the greater security of such precious things, and that Micah might
not be able to come at him, to injure or upbraid him; and, it may be,
because that was the place where the ark used to be carried.

[Judges 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 18:21</span></span>

Before them - For their greater security, if Micah should pursue them.

[Judges 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 18:24</span></span>

I made - So far was he besotted with superstition and idolatry, that he
esteemed those gods, which were man's work. But he could not be so
stupid, as to think these were indeed the great Jehovah that made heaven
and earth; but only a lower sort of gods, by whom, as mediators, he
offered up his worship to the true God, as divers of the Heathen did.
What have I - I value nothing I have in comparison of what you have
taken away. Which zeal for idolatrous trash may shame multitudes that
call themselves Christians, and yet value their worldly conveniences
more than all the concerns of their own salvation. Is Micah thus fond of
his false gods? And how ought we to be affected toward the true God? Let
us reckon our communion with God our greatest gain; and the loss of God
the sorest loss. Wo unto us, if He depart! For what have we more.

[Judges 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 18:25</span></span>

Thy voice - Thy complaints and reproaches. Angry fellows - The soldiers,
who are in themselves sharp and fierce, and will soon be enflamed by thy
provoking words. Thy Life - Which, not withstanding all thy pretences,
thou dost value more than thy images.

[Judges 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 18:27</span></span>

Burnt - Not wholly, but in great measure, to make their conquest more
easy.

[Judges 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 18:28</span></span>

And they built a city - That is, rebuilt it.

[Judges 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jdg 18:29</span></span>

Of Dan - That it might be manifest, that they belonged to the tribe of
Dan, though they were seated at a great distance from them, in the most
northerly part of the land; whereas the lot of their tribe was in the
southern part of Canaan.

[Judges 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jdg 18:30</span></span>

Image - Having succeeded in their expedition according to the prediction
which, as they supposed, they had from this image, they had a great
veneration for it. The captivity - When the whole land of the ten
tribes, whereof Dan was one, was conquered, and the people carried
captive by the Assyrian, [Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md),
[Kg2 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023.md), which is called by way of
eminency, the captivity. It is not said, that the graven image was there
so long, for that is restrained to a shorter date, even to the
continuance of the ark in Shiloh, [Jdg
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031.md), which was removed thence, [Sa1
4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003.md). But only that Jonathan's
posterity, (so his name is at last mentioned) were priests to this tribe
or family of Dan, which they might be under all the changes, even 'till
the Assyrian captivity, sometimes more openly, sometimes more secretly,
sometimes in one way of idolatry, and sometimes in another.
