### [1 John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

[1 John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 5:1</span></span>

The scope and sum of this whole paragraph appears from the conclusion of
it, [Jo1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md), "These things have I
written to you who believe, that ye may know that ye who believe have
eternal life." So faith is the first and last point with St. John also.
Every one who loveth - God that begat loveth him also that is begotten
of him - Hath a natural affection to all his brethren.

[1 John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 5:2</span></span>

Hereby we know - This is a plain proof. That we love the children of God
- As his children.

[1 John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 5:3</span></span>

For this is the love of God - The only sure proof of it. That we keep
his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous - To any that
are born of God.

[1 John 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 5:4</span></span>

For whatsoever - This expression implies the most unlimited
universality. Is born of God overcometh the world - Conquers whatever it
can lay in the way, either to allure or fright the children of God from
keeping his commandments. And this is the victory - The grand means of
overcoming. Even our faith - Seeing all things are possible to him that
believeth.

[1 John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 5:5</span></span>

Who is he that overcometh the world - That is superior to all worldly
care, desire, fear? Every believer, and none else. [Jo1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007) (usually so reckoned.md) is a brief
recapitulation of all which has been before advanced concerning the
Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is cited, in conjunction with [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md) and [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md) by Tertullian, Cyprian, and an
uninterrupted train of Fathers. And, indeed, what the sun is in the
world, what the heart is in a man, what the needle is in the mariner's
compass, this verse is in the epistle. By this [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md), and [Jo1
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md) are indissolubly connected; as
will be evident, beyond all contradiction, when they are accurately
considered.

[1 John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 5:6</span></span>

This is he - St. John here shows the immovable foundation of that faith
that Jesus is the Son of God; not only the testimony of man, but the
firm, indubitable testimony of God. Who came - Jesus is he of whom it
was promised that he should come; and who accordingly, is come. And this
the Spirit, and the water, and the blood testify. Even Jesus - Who,
coming by water and blood, is by this very thing demonstrated to be the
Christ. Not by the water only - Wherein he was baptized. But by the
water and the blood - Which he shed when he had finished the work his
Father had given him to do. He not only undertook at his baptism "to
fulfil all righteousness," but on the cross accomplished what he had
undertaken; in token whereof, when all was finished, blood and water
came out of his side. And it is the Spirit who likewise testifieth - Of
Jesus Christ, namely, by Moses and all the prophets, by John the
Baptist, by all the apostles, and in all the writings of the New
Testament. And against his testimony there can be no exception, because
the Spirit is truth - The very God of truth.

[1 John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 5:7</span></span>

What Bengelius has advanced, both concerning the transposition of these
two verses, and the authority of the controverted verse, partly in his
"Gnomon," and partly in his "Apparatus Criticus," will abundantly
satisfy any impartial person. For there are three that testify -
Literally, testifying, or bearing witness. The participle is put for the
noun witnesses, to intimate that the act of testifying, and the effect
of it, are continually present. Properly, persons only can testify; and
that three are described testifying on earth, as if they were persons,
is elegantly subservient to the three persons testifying in heaven. The
Spirit - In the word, confirmed by miracles. The water - Of baptism,
wherein we are dedicated to the Son, (with the Father and Spirit,)
typifying his spotless purity, and the inward purifying of our nature.
And the blood - Represented in the Lord's supper, and applied to the
consciences of believer. And these three harmoniously agree in one - In
bearing the same testimony, - that Jesus Christ is the divine, the
complete, the only Saviour of the world.

[1 John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 5:8</span></span>

And there are three that testify in heaven - The testimony of the
Spirit, the water, and the blood, is by an eminent gradation
corroborated by three, who give a still greater testimony. The Father -
Who clearly testified of the Son, both at his baptism and at his
transfiguration. The Word - Who testified of himself on many occasions,
while he was on earth; and again, with still greater solemnity, after
his ascension into heaven, [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md);
[Rev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md). And the Spirit - Whose
testimony was added chiefly after his glorification, [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md); [Joh
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md); [Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md); [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md). And these three are one - Even
as those two, the Father and the Son, are one, [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md). Nothing can separate the Spirit
from the Father and the Son. If he were not one with the Father and the
Son, the apostle ought to have said, The Father and the Word, who are
one, and the Spirit, are two. But this is contrary to the whole tenor of
revelation. It remains that these three are one. They are one in
essence, in knowledge, in will, and in their testimony.

It is observable, the three in the one verse are opposed, not
conjointly, but severally, to the three in the other: as if he had said,
Not only the Spirit testifies, but also the Father, [Joh
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md); not only the water, but also the
Word, [Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md), [Joh
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#041.md); not only the blood, but also
the Holy Ghost, [Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md), &c. It
must now appear, to every reasonable man, how absolutely necessary [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md) is. St. John could not think of
the testimony of the Spirit, and water, and blood, and subjoin, "The
testimony of God is greater," without thinking also of the testimony of
the Son and Holy Ghost; yea, and mentioning it in so solemn an
enumeration. Nor can any possible reason be devised, why, without three
testifying in heaven, he should enumerate three, and no more, who
testify on earth. The testimony of all is given on earth, not in heaven;
but they who testify are part on earth, part in heaven. The witnesses
who are on earth testify chiefly concerning his abode on earth, though
not excluding his state of exaltation: the witnesses who are in heaven
testify chiefly concerning his glory at God's right hand, though not
excluding his state of humiliation.

[Jo1 5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md) contains a recapitulation
of the whole economy of Christ, from his baptism to pentecost; [Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md) the sum of the divine economy,
from the time of his exaltation. Hence it farther appears, that this
position of [Jo1 5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md), which places
those who testify on earth before those who testify in heaven, is
abundantly preferable to the other, and affords a gradation admirably
suited to the subject.

[1 John 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 5:9</span></span>

If we receive the testimony of men - As we do continually, and must do
in a thousand instances. The testimony of God is greater - Of higher
authority, and much more worthy to be received; namely, this very
testimony which God the Father, together with the Word and the Spirit,
hath testified of the Son, as the Saviour of the world.

[1 John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 5:10</span></span>

He that believeth on the Son of God hath the testimony - The dear
evidence of this, in himself: he that believeth not God, in this, hath
made him a liar; because he supposes that to be false which God has
expressly testified.

[1 John 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 5:11</span></span>

And this is the sum of that testimony, that God hath given us a title
to, and the real beginning of, eternal life; and that this is purchased
by, and treasured up in, his Son, who has all the springs and the
fulness of it in himself, to communicate to his body, the church, first
in grace and then in glory.

[1 John 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 5:12</span></span>

It plainly follows, he that hath the Son - Living and reigning in him by
faith. Hath this life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not this
life - Hath no part or lot therein. In the former clause, the apostle
says simply, the Son; because believers know him: in the latter, the Son
of God; that unbelievers may know how great a blessing they fall short
of.

[1 John 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 5:13</span></span>

These things have I written - In the introduction, [Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004.md), he said, I write: now, in the
close, I have written. That ye may know - With a fuller and stronger
assurance, that ye have eternal life.

[1 John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 5:14</span></span>

And we - Who believe. Have this farther confidence in him, that he
heareth - That is, favourably regards, whatever prayer we offer in
faith, according to his revealed will.

[1 John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 5:15</span></span>

We have - Faith anticipates the blessings. The petitions which we asked
of him - Even before the event. And when the event comes, we know it
comes in answer to our prayer.

[1 John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 5:16</span></span>

This extends to things of the greatest importance. If any one see his
brother - That is. any man. Sin a sin which is not unto death - That is,
any sin but total apostasy from both the power and form of godliness.
Let him ask, and God will give him life - Pardon and spiritual life, for
that sinner. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray
for that - That is, let him not pray for it. A sin unto death may
likewise mean, one which God has determined to punish with death.

[1 John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 5:17</span></span>

All deviation from perfect holiness is sin; but all sin is not
unpardonable.

[1 John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 5:18</span></span>

Yet this gives us no encouragement to sin: on the contrary, it is an
indisputable truth, he that is born of God - That sees and loves God.
Sinneth not - So long as that loving faith abides in him, he neither
speaks nor does anything which God hath forbidden. He keepeth himself -
Watching unto prayer. And, while he does this, the wicked one toucheth
him not - So as to hurt him.

[1 John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 5:19</span></span>

We know that we are children of God - By the witness and the fruit of
his Spirit, [Jo1 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md). But the whole
world - All who have not his Spirit, not only is "touched" by him, but
by idolatry, fraud, violence lasciviousness, impiety, all manner of
wickedness. Lieth in the wicked one - Void of life, void of sense. In
this short expression the horrible state of the world is painted in the
most lively colours; a comment on which we have in the actions,
conversations, contracts, quarrels, and friendships of worldly men.

[1 John 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 5:20</span></span>

And we know - By all these infallible proofs. That the Son of God is
come - Into the world. And he hath given us a spiritual understanding,
that we may know him, the true one - "The faithful and true witness."
And we are in the true one - As branches in the vine, even in Jesus
Christ, the eternal Son of God. This Jesus is the only living and true
God, together with the father and the Spirit, and the original fountain
of eternal life. So the beginning and the end of the epistle agree.

[1 John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 5:21</span></span>

Keep yourselves from idols - From all worship of false gods, from all
worship of images or of any creature, and from every inward idol; from
loving, desiring, fearing anything more than God. Seek all help and
defence from evil, all happiness in the true God alone.
