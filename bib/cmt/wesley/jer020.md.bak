### [Jeremiah Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 20:1</span></span>

Immer - The course of Immer was the sixteenth course of the priests,
[Ch1 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014.md). Pashur was his son, that
is descended from him.

[Jeremiah 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 20:3</span></span>

Not called - God's meaning was, not that he should by men be no longer
called Pashur, but that his condition should not answer that name
Pashur, which signifies, a flourishing priest; but Magor - missabib,
that is, fear and terror on all sides.

[Jeremiah 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 20:7</span></span>

Hast prevailed - Thou prevailedst against me. Jeremiah at first excused
himself to God, [Jer 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006.md), but the Lord
prevailed against him replying, [Jer
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#007.md), Say not, I am a child, for thou
shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee
thou shalt speak, [Jer 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009.md). This is
all that is here meant, namely, God's over - ruling him contrary to his
own inclinations.

[Jeremiah 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 20:8</span></span>

Since - Since I first began to be a prophet, I have faithfully
discharged my office, and that with warmth and zeal. Spoil - I have
prophesied that violence and spoil was coming. Because - Because of that
scorn and derision with which they treated him.

[Jeremiah 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 20:9</span></span>

I said - He did not speak this openly, but in his heart. But - He found
in his heart a constraint to go on.

[Jeremiah 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 20:10</span></span>

Prevail - Desiring nothing more than that I might be enticed to speak or
do something which they might make matter of a colourable accusation.

[Jeremiah 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 20:11</span></span>

But - The prophet recovering himself out of his fit of passion,
encourageth himself in his God, whom he calls the mighty and terrible
one, so declaring his faith in the power of God, as one able to save
him, and in the promise and good will of God toward him; therefore he
saith, The Lord is with me; such was the promise of God to this prophet,
when he first undertook the prophetical office, [Jer
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md). Be not afraid of their faces, for
I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord: from hence be concludes,
that though he had many that pursued after his life, yet they should
stumble in their ways of violence, and should not prevail. Ashamed -
That they should be ashamed of what they had done, or be brought to
shame for what they had done; for prosper they should not: or they acted
like fools, and did not deal prudently for themselves (so this word is
translated, [Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013),.md) yea, they
should become a reproach, and their reproach should be a lasting
perpetual reproach that should not be forgotten.

[Jeremiah 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 20:14</span></span>

Cursed - This sudden change makes some think that these words proceeded
from Jeremiah rather as a repetition of a former passion into which the
abuses of his enemies had put him, than as the immediate product of his
spirit at this time.

[Jeremiah 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 20:16</span></span>

The cities - Sodom and Gomorrah; by the cry in the morning and shouting
at noon, he means the shouts and noises that enemies make when they
break in upon a place.
