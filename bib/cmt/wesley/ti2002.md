### [2 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001)

[2 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 2:2</span></span>

The things - The wholesome doctrine, [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013). Commit - Before thou leavest
Ephesus. To faithful men, who will be able, after thou art gone, to
teach others.

[2 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 2:4</span></span>

No man that warreth entangleth himself - Any more than is unavoidable.
In the affairs of this life - With worldly business or cares. That -
Minding war only, he may please his captain. In this and the next verse
there is a plain allusion to the Roman law of arms, and to that of the
Grecian games. According to the former, no soldier was to engage in any
civil employment; according to the latter, none could be crowned as
conqueror, who did not keep strictly to the rules of the game.

[2 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 2:6</span></span>

Unless he labour first, he will reap no fruit.

[2 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 2:8</span></span>

Of the seed of David - This one genealogy attend to.

[2 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 2:9</span></span>

Is not bound - Not hindered in its course.

[2 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 2:10</span></span>

Therefore - Encouraged by this, that "the word of God be not bound." I
endure all things - See the spirit of a real Christian? Who would not
wish to be likeminded? Salvation is deliverance from all evil; glory,
the enjoyment of all good.

[2 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 2:11</span></span>

Dead with him - Dead to sin, and ready to die for him.

[2 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 2:12</span></span>

If we deny him - To escape suffering for him.

[2 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 2:13</span></span>

If we believe not - That is, though some believe not, God will make good
all his promises to them that do believe. He cannot deny himself - His
word cannot fail.

[2 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 2:14</span></span>

Remind them - Who are under thy charge. O how many unnecessary things
are thus unprofitably, nay hurtfully, contended for.

[2 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 2:15</span></span>

A workman that needeth not to be ashamed - Either of unfaithfulness or
unskilfulness. Rightly dividing the word of truth - Duly explaining and
applying the whole scripture, so as to give each hearer his due portion.
But they that give one part of the gospel to all (the promises and
comforts to unawakened, hardened, scoffing men) have real need to be
ashamed.

[2 Timothy 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 2:16</span></span>

They - Who babble thus will grow worse and worse.

[2 Timothy 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 2:17</span></span>

And their word - If they go on, will be mischievous as well as vain, and
will eat as a gangrene.

[2 Timothy 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 2:18</span></span>

Saying the resurrection is already past - Perhaps asserting that it is
only the spiritual passing from death unto life.

[2 Timothy 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 2:19</span></span>

But the foundation of God - His truth and faithfulness. Standeth fast -
Can never be overthrown; being as it were sealed with a seal, which has
an inscription on each side: on the one, The Lord knoweth those that are
his; on the other, Let every one who nameth the name of the Lord, as his
Lord, depart from iniquity. Indeed, they only are his who depart from
iniquity. To all others he will say, "I know you not." [Mat
7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)

[2 Timothy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 2:20</span></span>

But in a great house - Such as the church, it is not strange that there
are not only vessels of gold and silver, designed for honourable uses,
but also of wood and of earth - For less honourable purposes. Yet a
vessel even of gold may be put to the vilest use, though it was not the
design of him that made it.

[2 Timothy 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti2 2:21</span></span>

If a man purge himself from these - Vessels of dishonour, so as to have
no fellowship with them.

[2 Timothy 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti2 2:22</span></span>

Flee youthful desires - Those peculiarly incident to youth. Follow peace
with them - Unity with all true believers. Out of a pure heart -
Youthful desires, destroy this purity: righteousness, faith, love,
peace, accompany it.

[2 Timothy 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti2 2:24</span></span>

A servant of the Lord must not - Eagerly or passionately. Strive - As do
the vain wranglers spoken of, [Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023). But be apt to teach - Chiefly by
patience and unwearied assiduity.

[2 Timothy 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ti2 2:25</span></span>

In meekness - He has often need of zeal, always of meekness. If haply
God - For it is wholly his work. May give them repentance - The
acknowledging of the truth would then quickly follow.

[2 Timothy 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ti2 2:26</span></span>

Who - At present are not only captives, but asleep; utterly insensible
of their captivity.
