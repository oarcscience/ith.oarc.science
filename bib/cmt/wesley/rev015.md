### [Revelation Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 15:1</span></span>

And I saw seven holy angels having the seven last plagues - Before they
had the phials, which were as instruments whereby those plagues were to
be conveyed. They are termed the last, because by them the wrath of God
is fulfilled - Hitherto. God had borne his enemies with much
longsuffering; but now his wrath goes forth to the uttermost, pouring
plagues on the earth from one end to the other, and round its whole
circumference. But, even after these plagues, the holy wrath of God
against his other enemies does not cease, [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 15:2</span></span>

The song was sung while the angels were coming out, with their plagues,
who are therefore mentioned both before and after it, [Rev
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md). And I saw as it were a sea of
glass mingled with fire - It was before "clear as crystal," [Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md), but now mingled with fire, which
devours the adversaries. And them that gained, or were gaining, the
victory over the wild beast - More of whom were yet to come. The mark of
the beast, the mark of his name, and the number of his name, seem to
mean here nearly the same thing. Standing at the sea of glass - Which
was before the throne. Having the harps of God - Given by him, and
appropriated to his praise.

[Revelation 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 15:3</span></span>

And they sing the song of Moses - So called, partly from its near
agreement ,with the words of that song which he sung after passing the
Red Sea, [Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md), and of that which
he taught the children of Israel a little before his death, [Deu
32:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#003.md). But chiefly because Moses was
the minister and representative of the Jewish church, as Christ is of
the church universal. Therefore it is also termed the sons of the Lamb.
It consists of six parts, which answer each other: Great and wonderful
are thy works, Lord God Almighty. For thou only art gracious. Just and
true are thy ways, O King of the nations. For all the nations shall come
and worship before thee. Who would not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify
thy name? For thy judgments are made manifest. We know and acknowledge
that all thy works in and toward all the creatures are great and
wonderful; that thy ways with all the children of men, good and evil,
are just and true. For thou only art gracious - And this grace is the
spring of all those wonderful works, even of his destroying the enemies
of his people. Accordingly in Psa. 136:1-26., that clause, "For his
mercy endureth for ever," is subjoined to the thanksgiving for his works
of vengeance as well as for his delivering the righteous. For all the
nations shall come and worship before thee - They shall serve thee as
their king with joyful reverence. This is a glorious testimony of the
future conversion of all the heathens. The Christians are now a little
flock: they who do not worship God, an immense multitude. But all the
nations shall come, from all parts of the earth, to worship him and
glorify his name. For thy judgments are made manifest - And then the
inhabitants of the earth will at length learn to fear him.

[Revelation 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 15:5</span></span>

After these things the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony - The
holiest of all. Was opened - Disclosing a new theatre for the coming
forth of the judgments of God now made manifest.

[Revelation 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 15:6</span></span>

And the seven angels came out of the temple - As having received their
instructions from the oracle of God himself. St. John saw them in
heaven, [Rev 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md), before they went
into the temple. They appeared in habits like those the high priest wore
when he went into the most holy place to consult the oracle. In this was
the visible testimony of God's presence. Clothed in pure white linen -
Linen is the habit of service and attendance. Pure - unspotted,
unsullied. White - Or bright and shining, which implies much more than
bare innocence. And having their breasts girt with golden girdles - In
token of their high dignity and glorious rest.

[Revelation 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 15:7</span></span>

And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels - After they
were come out of the temple. Seven golden phials - Or bowls. The Greek
word signifies vessels broader at the top than at the bottom. Full of
the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever - A circumstance which
adds greatly to the dreadfulness of his wrath.

[Revelation 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 15:8</span></span>

And the temple was filled with smoke - The cloud of glory was the
visible manifestation of God's presence in the tabernacle and temple. It
was a sign of protection at erecting the tabernacle and at the
dedication of the temple. But in the judgment of Korah the glory of the
Lord appeared, when he and his companions were swallowed up by the
earth. So proper is the emblem of smoke from the glory of God, or from
the cloud of glory, to express the execution of judgment, as well as to
be a sign of favour. Both proceed from the power of God, and in both he
is glorified. And none - Not even of those who ordinarily stood before
God. Could go into the temple - That is, into the inmost part of it.
Till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled - Which did
not take up a long time, like the seven trumpets, but swiftly followed
each other.
