<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001">Hebrews 11:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">heb 11:1</A></FONT></span></p>The definition of faith given in this verse, and exemplified in the various instances following, undoubtedly includes justifying faith, but not directly as justifying. For faith justifies only as it refers to, and depends on, Christ. But here is no mention of him as the object of faith; and in several of the instances that follow, no notice is taken of him or his salvation, but only of temporal blessings obtained by faith. And yet they may all be considered as evidences of the power of justifying faith in Christ, and of its extensive exercise in a course of steady obedience amidst difficulties and dangers of every kind. Now faith is the subsistence of things hoped for, the evidence or conviction of things not seen - Things hoped for are not so extensive as things not seen. The former are only things future and joyful to us ; the latter are either future, past, or present, and those either good or evil, whether to us or others. The subsistence of things hoped for - Giving a kind of present subsistence to the good things which God has promised: the divine supernatural evidence exhibited to, the conviction hereby produced in, a believer of things not seen, whether past, future, or spiritual; particularly of God and the things of God. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002">Hebrews 11:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">heb 11:2</A></FONT></span></p>By it the elders - Our forefathers. This chapter is a kind of summary of the Old Testament, in which the apostle comprises the designs, labours, sojournings, expectations, temptations, martyrdoms of the ancients. The former of them had a long exercise of their patience; the latter suffered shorter but sharper trials. Obtained a good testimony - A most comprehensive word. God gave a testimony, not only of them but to them: and they received his testimony as if it had been the things themselves of which he testified, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004">Heb 11:4-5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039">Heb 11:39</A>. Hence they also gave testimony to others, and others testified of them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003">Hebrews 11:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">heb 11:3</A></FONT></span></p>By faith we understand that the worlds - Heaven and earth and all things in them, visible and invisible. Where made - Formed, fashioned, and finished. By the word - The sole command of God, without any instrument or preceding matter. And as creation is the foundation and specimen of the whole divine economy, so faith in the creation is the foundation and specimen of all faith. So that things which are seen - As the sun, earth, stars. Were made of things which do not appear - Out of the dark, unapparent chaos, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002">Gen 1:2</A>. And this very chaos was created by the divine power; for before it was thus created it had no existence in nature. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004">Hebrews 11:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">heb 11:4</A></FONT></span></p>By faith - In the future Redeemer. Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice - The firstlings of his flock, implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved, and a desire of sharing in the great atonement. Than Cain - Whose offering testified no such faith, but a bare acknowledgment of God the Creator. By which faith he obtained both righteousness and a testimony of it: God testifying - Visibly that his gifts were accepted; probably by sending fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice, a token that justice seized on the sacrifice instead of the sinner who offered it. And by it - By this faith. Being dead, he yet speaketh - That a sinner is accepted only through faith in the great sacrifice. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005">Hebrews 11:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">heb 11:5</A></FONT></span></p>Enoch was not any longer found among men, though perhaps they sought for him as they did for Elijah, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#017">Kg2 2:17</A>. He had this testimony - From God in his own conscience. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006">Hebrews 11:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">heb 11:6</A></FONT></span></p>But without faith - Even some divine faith in God, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God - in prayer, or another act of worship, must believe that he is. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007">Hebrews 11:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">heb 11:7</A></FONT></span></p>Noah being warned of things not seen as yet - Of the future deluge. Moved with fear, prepared an ark, by which open testimony he condemned the world - Who neither believed nor feared. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008">Hebrews 11:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">heb 11:8</A></FONT></span></p><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001">Gen 12:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004">Gen 12:4-5</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Hebrews 11:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">heb 11:9</A></FONT></span></p>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise - The promise was made before, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007">Gen 12:7</A>. Dwelling in tents - As a sojourner With Isaac and Jacob - Who by the same manner of living showed the same faith Jacob was born fifteen years before the death of Abraham. The joint heirs of the same promise - Having all the same interest therein. Isaac did not receive this inheritance from Abraham, nor Jacob from Isaac, but all of them from God. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008">Gen 17:8</A> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010">Hebrews 11:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">heb 11:10</A></FONT></span></p>He looked for a city which hath foundations - Whereas a tent has none. Whose builder and former is God - Of which God is the sole contriver, former, and finisher. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011">Hebrews 11:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">heb 11:11</A></FONT></span></p>Sarah also herself - Though at first she laughed at the promise, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012">Gen 18:12</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002">Gen 21:2</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012">Hebrews 11:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">heb 11:12</A></FONT></span></p>As it were dead - Till his strength was supernaturally restored, which continued for many years after. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013">Hebrews 11:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">heb 11:13</A></FONT></span></p>All these - - Mentioned <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007">Heb 11:7-11</A>. Died in faith - In death faith acts most vigorously. Not having received the promises - The promised blessings. Embraced - As one does a dear friend when he meets him. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014">Hebrews 11:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">heb 11:14</A></FONT></span></p>They who speak thus show plainly that they seek their own country - That they keep in view, and long for, their native home. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015">Hebrews 11:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">heb 11:15</A></FONT></span></p>If they had been mindful of - Their earthly country, Ur of the Chaldeans, they might have easily returned. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016">Hebrews 11:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">heb 11:16</A></FONT></span></p>But they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly - This is a full convincing proof that the patriarchs had a revelation and a promise of eternal glory in heaven. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: seeing he hath prepared for them a city - Worthy of God to give. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017">Hebrews 11:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">heb 11:17</A></FONT></span></p>By faith Abraham - When God made that glorious trial of him. Offered up Isaac - The will being accepted as if he had actually done it. Yea, he that had received the promises - Particularly that grand promise, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." Offered up - This very son; the only one he had by Sarah. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001">Gen 22:1</A>, &amp;c. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#018">Hebrews 11:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">heb 11:18</A></FONT></span></p>In Isaac shall thy seed be called - From him shall the blessed seed spring. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Gen 21:12</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019">Hebrews 11:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">heb 11:19</A></FONT></span></p>Accounting that God was able even to raise him from the dead - Though there had not been any instance of this in the world. From whence also - To speak in a figurative way. He did receive him - Afterwards, snatched from the jaws of death. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020">Hebrews 11:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">heb 11:20</A></FONT></span></p>Blessed - <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027">Gen 27:27</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#039">Gen 27:39</A>; prophetically foretold the particular blessings they should partake of. Jacob and Esau - Preferring the elder before the younger. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021">Hebrews 11:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">heb 11:21</A></FONT></span></p>Jacob when dying - That is, when near death. Bowing down on the top of his staff - As he sat on the side of his bed. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016">Gen 48:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031">Gen 47:31</A>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">heb 11:22</A></FONT></span></p>Concerning his bones - To be carried into the land of promise. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023">Hebrews 11:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">heb 11:23</A></FONT></span></p>They saw - Doubtless with a divine presage of things to come. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024">Hebrews 11:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">heb 11:24</A></FONT></span></p>Refused to be called - Any longer. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026">Hebrews 11:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">heb 11:26</A></FONT></span></p>The reproach of Christ - That which he bore for believing in the Messiah to come, and acting accordingly. For he looked off - From all those perishing treasures, and beyond all those temporal hardships Unto the recompence of reward - Not to an inheritance in Canaan; he had no warrant from God to look for this, nor did he ever attain it; but what his believing ancestors looked for, - a future state of happiness in heaven. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027">Hebrews 11:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">heb 11:27</A></FONT></span></p>By faith he left Egypt - Taking all the Israelites with him. Not then fearing the wrath of the king - As he did many years before, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014">Exo 2:14</A>. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015">Exo 14:15</A>, &amp;c. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028">Hebrews 11:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">heb 11:28</A></FONT></span></p>The pouring out of the blood - Of the paschal lamb, which was sprinkled on the door - posts, lest the destroying angel should touch the Israelites. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012">Exo 12:12-18</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029">Hebrews 11:29</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_029">heb 11:29</A></FONT></span></p>They - Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites. Passed the Red Sea - It washed the borders of Edom, which signifies red. Thus far the examples are cited from Genesis and Exodus; those that follow are from the former and the latter Prophets. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030">Hebrews 11:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">heb 11:30</A></FONT></span></p>By the faith of Joshua. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031">Hebrews 11:31</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">heb 11:31</A></FONT></span></p>Rahab - Though formerly one not of the fairest character. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032">Hebrews 11:32</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">heb 11:32</A></FONT></span></p>After Samuel, the prophets are properly mentioned. David also was a prophet; but he was a king too. The prophets - Elijah, Elisha, &amp;c., including likewise the believers who lived with them. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033">Hebrews 11:33</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">heb 11:33</A></FONT></span></p>David, in particular, subdued kingdoms. Samuel (not excluding the rest) wrought righteousness. The prophets, in general, obtained promises, both for themselves, and to deliver to others. Prophets also stopped the mouths of lions, as Daniel; and quenched the violence of fire, as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. To these examples, whence the nature of faith clearly appears, those more ancient ones are subjoined, (by a transposition, and in an inverted order,) which receive light from these. Jephthah escaped the edge of the sword; Samson out of weakness was made strong; Barak became valiant in fight; Gideon put to flight armies of the aliens. Faith animates to the most heroic enterprises, both civil and military. Faith overcomes all impediments effects the greatest things; attains to the very best; and inverts, by its miraculous power the very course of nature. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001">Sa2 8:1</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009">Sa1 8:9</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003">Sa1 13:3</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022">Dan 6:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027">Dan 3:27</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003">Jdg 12:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#019">Jdg 15:19</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028">Jdg 16:28</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014">Jdg 4:14</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021">Jdg 7:21</A>. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035">Hebrews 11:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">heb 11:35</A></FONT></span></p>Women - Naturally weak. Received their dead - Children. Others were tortured - From those who acted great things the apostle rises higher, to those who showed the power of faith by suffering. Not accepting deliverance - On sinful terms. That they might obtain a better resurrection - An higher reward, seeing the greater their sufferings the greater would be their glory. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#022">Kg1 17:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035">Kg2 4:35</A>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_036">heb 11:36</A></FONT></span></p>And others - The apostle seems here to pass on to recent examples. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037">Hebrews 11:37</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_037">heb 11:37</A></FONT></span></p>They were sawn asunder - As, according to the tradition of the Jews, Isaiah was by Manasseh. Were tempted - Torments and death are mentioned alternately. Every way; by threatenings, reproaches, tortures, the variety of which cannot be expressed; and again by promises and allurements. 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038">Hebrews 11:38</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_038">heb 11:38</A></FONT></span></p>Of whom the world was not worthy - It did not deserve so great a blessing. They wandered - Being driven out from men.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_039">heb 11:39</A></FONT></span></p>And all these - Though they obtained a good testimony, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002">Heb 11:2</A>, yet did not receive the great promise, the heavenly inheritance.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_040">heb 11:40</A></FONT></span></p>God having provided some better thing for us - Namely, everlasting glory. That they might not be perfected without us - That is, that we might all be perfected together in heaven.
