### [1 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 2:3</span></span>

Judah - Whom he puts first, because the best part of the right of the
firstborn, namely, the dominion, was conferred upon him, [Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md), and because the Messiah was to
come out of his loins.

[1 Chronicles 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 2:6</span></span>

Dara - If these be the same who are mentioned as the sons of Machol,
[Kg1 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md), either the same man had two
names, Zerah and Machol, as was usual among the Hebrews: or, one of
these was their immediate father, and the other their grand - father.
These are named, because they were the glory of their father's house.
When the Holy Ghost would magnify the wisdom of Solomon, he saith, he
was wiser than these four men. That four brothers should be so eminent,
was a rare thing.

[1 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 2:7</span></span>

Carmi - Who is here mentioned, because he was the son of Zimri, who is
also called Zabdi, [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md). Achar -
Called Achan, [Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001.md), and here
Achar, with a little variation for greater significancy: for Achar
signifies a troubler.

[1 Chronicles 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 2:13</span></span>

Eliab - Called also Elihu, [Ch1 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#018.md),
unless that was another person, and the word brother be taken more
largely for a kinsman, as it is frequently.

[1 Chronicles 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch1 2:15</span></span>

Seventh - He had eight sons, [Sa1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#010.md), but probably one of them died
presently after that time.

[1 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch1 2:17</span></span>

Ishmaelite - By birth or habitation, but by profession an Israelite,
[Sa2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#025.md).

[1 Chronicles 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 2:18</span></span>

Her sons - The sons of Azubah, who is by way of distinction called his
wife, when Jerioth probably was only his concubine, and, it may seem,
barren: therefore upon Azubah's death he married another wife. And those
other sons of this Caleb mentioned, [Ch1
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#042.md), are his sons by some other wife
distinct from all these.

[1 Chronicles 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 2:21</span></span>

Gilead - Of a man so called: a man of noted valour, and the great
champion in those parts.

[1 Chronicles 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 2:23</span></span>

Sons of Machir - Partly to his own sons, and partly to his son - in -
law Jair, who by reason of that dear affection which was betwixt them,
and his forsaking his own tribe and kindred to fight for them and to
dwell with them, is here reckoned as his own son.

[1 Chronicles 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 2:24</span></span>

Tekoa - A known place whose father he is called, because he was either
the progenitor of the people inhabiting there: or, their prince and
ruler: or, the builder of the city.

[1 Chronicles 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch1 2:31</span></span>

The sons - An expression often used in prophane authors too, where there
is but one son.

[1 Chronicles 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch1 2:35</span></span>

Jarha - Probably he was not only a proselyte, but an eminent man: else
an Israelite would not have given him his only daughter.

[1 Chronicles 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">ch1 2:45</span></span>

Beth - zur - A place in Judah.

places in Judah.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">ch1 2:55</span></span>

Scribes - Either civil, who were public notaries, that wrote and signed
legal instruments: or ecclesiastical. And these were either Levites, or
Simeonites, or rather Kenites, and are here mentioned not as if they
were of the tribe of Judah, but because they dwelt among them, and
probably were allied to them by marriages, and so in a manner
incorporated with them.
