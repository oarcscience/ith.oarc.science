### [2 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 1:3</span></span>

Whom I serve from my forefathers - That is, whom both I and my ancestors
served. With a pure conscience - He always worshipped God according to
his conscience, both before and after his conversion One who stands on
the verge of life is much refreshed by the remembrance of his
predecessors, to whom he is going.

[2 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 1:4</span></span>

Being mindful of thy tears - Perhaps frequently shed, as well as at the
apostle's last parting with him.

[2 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 1:5</span></span>

Which dwelt - A word not applied to a transient guest, but only to a
settled inhabitant. First - Probably this was before Timothy was born,
yet not beyond St. Paul's memory.

[2 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 1:6</span></span>

Wherefore - Because I remember this. I remind thee of stirring up -
Literally, blowing up the coals into a flame. The gift of God - All the
spiritual gifts, which the grace of God has given thee.

[2 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 1:7</span></span>

And let nothing discourage thee, for God hath not given us - That is,
the spirit which God hath given us Christians, is not the spirit of fear
- Or cowardice. But of power - Banishing fear. And love and sobriety -
These animate us in our duties to God, our brethren, and ourselves.
Power and sobriety are two good extremes. Love is between, the tie and
temperament of both; preventing the two bad extremes of fearfulness and
rashness. More is said concerning power, [Ti1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008.md); concerning love, [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md), &c.; concerning sobriety, [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001.md), &c.

[2 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 1:8</span></span>

Therefore be not thou ashamed - When fear is banished, evil shame also
flees away. Of the testimony of our Lord - The gospel, and of testifying
the truth of it to all men. Nor of me - The cause of the servants of God
doing his work, cannot be separated from the cause of God himself. But
be thou partaker of the afflictions - Which I endure for the gospel's
sake. According to the power of God - This which overcomes all things is
nervously described in the two next verses.

[2 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 1:9</span></span>

Who hath saved us - By faith. The love of the Father, the grace of our
Saviour, and the whole economy of salvation, are here admirably
described. Having called us with an holy calling - Which is all from
God, and claims us all for God. According to his own purpose and grace -
That is, his own gracious purpose. Which was given us - Fixed for our
advantage, before the world began.

[2 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 1:10</span></span>

By the appearing of our Saviour - This implies his whole abode upon
earth. Who hath abolished death - Taken away its sting, and turned it
into a blessing. And hath brought life and immortality to light - Hath
clearly revealed by the gospel that immortal life which he hath
purchased for us.

[2 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 1:12</span></span>

That which I have committed to him - My soul. Until that day - Of his
final appearing.

[2 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 1:13</span></span>

The pattern of sound words - The model of pure, wholesome doctrine.

[2 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 1:14</span></span>

The good thing - This wholesome doctrine.

[2 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 1:15</span></span>

All who are in Asia - Who had attended me at Rome for a while. Are
turned away from me - What, from Paul the aged, the faithful soldier,
and now prisoner of Christ! This was a glorious trial, and wisely
reserved for that time, when he was on the borders of immortality.
Perhaps a little measure of the same spirit might remain with him under
whose picture are those affecting words, "The true effigy of Francis
Xavier, apostle of the Indies, forsaken of all men, dying in a cottage."

[2 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 1:16</span></span>

The family of Onesiphorus - As well as himself. Hath often refreshed me
- Both at Ephesus and Rome.
