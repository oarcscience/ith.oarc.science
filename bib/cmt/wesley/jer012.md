### [Jeremiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 12:1</span></span>

Talk with thee - Not by way of accusing thee, but for my own
satisfaction concerning thy judicial dispensations in the government of
the world. Wherefore - I know thy ways are just and righteous, but they
are dark; I cannot understand why thou doest this.

[Jeremiah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 12:2</span></span>

Far - Thou art far from their inward parts, they neither fear thee, nor
love thee.

[Jeremiah 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 12:4</span></span>

He - They were bold to say, neither the prophet nor any other should see
their last end.

[Jeremiah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 12:5</span></span>

If - If thou art not able to encounter lesser dangers, how wilt thou be
able to overcome greater? I have greater dangers for thee to encounter
than those at Anathoth; if thou art so disturbed with them, how wilt
thou be able to grapple with those at Jerusalem. Jordan - Anathoth seems
to be understood by the land of thy peace, that is, the land of thy
friends wherein thou hadst a confidence: if thy enemies there tire thee,
what wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan? In a place in which thou
art like to meet with greater troubles, like the swelling of Jordan
(which in harvest used to overflow its banks).

[Jeremiah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 12:6</span></span>

For even - The men of Anathoth, thine own town and country, and those of
thy own family have conspired evil against thee secretly. A multitude -
They have exposed thee to the rage of a multitude. Though - Tho'
therefore they give thee fair words, yet repose no confidence in them.

[Jeremiah 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 12:7</span></span>

My house - God by his house here understands the temple. Heritage - The
whole body of the Israelites, whom God threatens to leave with respect
to his special providence.

[Jeremiah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 12:8</span></span>

As a lion - Those that were my sheep, are become like lions.

[Jeremiah 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 12:9</span></span>

The birds round about - It is usual for other birds to flock about a
strange coloured bird, such as they have not been used to see.

[Jeremiah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 12:10</span></span>

A wilderness - They have caused God to turn the country which he had
chosen for his portion, into a wilderness.

[Jeremiah 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 12:11</span></span>

They - Heb. He hath made it desolate: but it cannot be meant of God, for
it is God that speaketh, and God is he mentioned in the next words; it
must therefore either be understood of Nebuchadnezzar, the instrumental
cause; or (one number being put for another) of the people or the rulers
as the meritorious cause, and in that rueful state into which their sins
had brought it, it cried onto God. Because - And one great cause of this
sore judgment was, the peoples not seriously considering what God had
done or was doing against it.

[Jeremiah 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 12:12</span></span>

Are come - The prophet, as usual, speaks of a thing as already done,
which was very shortly to be done. No flesh - No rank or order of men.

[Jeremiah 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 12:13</span></span>

Shall not profit - All the works of their hands, all their counsels and
deliberations should be of no profit unto them. Because - The fierce
anger of God shall be so shewed, that the returns of their labours or
estates, the profits of their trades, shall be so small, that they shall
be ashamed of them.

[Jeremiah 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 12:14</span></span>

Behold - I will bring the sword upon them also, and they shall be led
into captivity; and tho' they may have made inroads upon my people, and
carried away some of them, yet I will fetch them out of their captivity.

[Jeremiah 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 12:16</span></span>

If - If they will leave their idolatries, and learn to worship me, and
swear by my name the Lord liveth, that is, pay that homage which they
owe to the Divine being to me, the living and true God. Then - They
shall have a portion among my people, which was eminently fulfilled in
the conversion of the Gentiles.
