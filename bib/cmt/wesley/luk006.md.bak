### [Luke Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

[Luke 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 6:1</span></span>

The first Sabbath - So the Jews reckoned their Sabbaths, from the
passover to pentecost; the first, second, third, and so on, till the
seventh Sabbath (after the second day.) This immediately preceded
pentecost, which was the fiftieth day after the second day of unleavened
bread. [Mat 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md); [Mar
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#023.md).

[Luke 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 6:2</span></span>

Why do ye - St. Matthew and Mark represent the Pharisees as proposing
the question to our Lord himself. It was afterward, probably, they
proposed it to his disciples.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 6:4</span></span>

To save life or to kill - He just then probably saw the design to kill
him rising in their hearts.

[Luke 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 6:12</span></span>

In the prayer of God - The phrase is singular and emphatical, to imply
an extraordinary and sublime devotion. [Mar
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#013.md).

[Luke 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 6:17</span></span>

On a plain - At the foot of the mountain.

[Luke 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 6:20</span></span>

In the following verses our Lord, in the audience of his newly - chosen
disciples, and of the multitude, repeats, standing on the plain, many
remarkable passages of the sermon he had before delivered, sitting on
the mount. He here again pronounces the poor and the hungry, the
mourners, and the persecuted, happy; and represents as miserable those
who are rich, and full, and joyous, and applauded: because generally
prosperity is a sweet poison, and affliction a healing, though bitter
medicine. Let the thought reconcile us to adversity, and awaken our
caution when the world smiles upon us; when a plentiful table is spread
before us, and our cup is running over; when our spirits are gay; and we
hear (what nature loves) our own praise from men. Happy are ye poor -
The word seems here to be taken literally: ye who have left al\] for me.
[Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md).

[Luke 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 6:24</span></span>

Miserable are ye rich - If ye have received or sought your consolation
or happiness therein.

[Luke 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 6:25</span></span>

Full - Of meat and drink, and worldly goods. That laugh - That are of a
light trifling spirit.

[Luke 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 6:26</span></span>

Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you - But who will believe
this?

[Luke 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 6:27</span></span>

But I say to you that hear - Hitherto our Lord had spoken only to
particular sorts of persons: now he begins speaking to all in general.
[Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md).

[Luke 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 6:29</span></span>

To him that smiteth thee on the cheek - Taketh away thy cloak - These
seem to be proverbial expressions, to signify an invasion of the
tenderest points of honour and property. Offer the other - Forbid not
thy coat - That is, rather yield to his repeating the affront or injury,
than gratify resentment in righting your self; in any method not
becoming Christian love. [Mat 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md).

[Luke 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 6:30</span></span>

Give to every one - Friend or enemy, what thou canst spare, and he
really wants: and of him that taketh away thy goods - By borrowing, if
he be insolvent, ask them not again. [Mat
5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#042.md).

[Luke 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 6:31</span></span>

[Mat 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md).

[Luke 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 6:32</span></span>

It is greatly observable, our Lord has so little regard for one of the
highest instances of natural virtue, namely, the returning love for
love, that he does not account it even to deserve thanks. For even
sinners, saith he, do the same: men who do not regard God at all.
Therefore he may do this, who has not taken one step in Christianity.

[Luke 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 6:37</span></span>

[Luke 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 6:38</span></span>

Into your bosom - Alluding to the mantles the Jews wore, into which a
large quantity of corn might be received. With the same measure that ye
mete with, it shall be measured to you again - Amazing goodness! So we
are permitted even to carve for ourselves! We ourselves are, as it were,
to tell God how much mercy he shall show us! And can we be content with
less than the very largest measure? Give then to man, what thou
designest to receive of God.

[Luke 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 6:39</span></span>

He spake a parable - Our Lord sometimes used parables when he knew plain
and open declarations would too much inflame the passions of his
hearers. It is for this reason he uses this parable, Can the blind lead
the blind? - Can the scribes teach this way, which they know not
themselves? Will not they and their scholars perish together? Can they
make their disciples any better than themselves? But as for those who
will be my disciples, they shall be all taught of God; who will enable
them to come to the measure of the stature of the fulness of their
Master. Be not ye like their disciples, censuring others, and not
amending yourselves. [Mat 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 6:46</span></span>

And why call ye me Lord, Lord - What will fair professions avail,
without a life answerable thereto? [Mat
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md).

[Luke 6:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 6:47</span></span>
