### [Isaiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001)

[Isaiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 19:1</span></span>

Rideth - As a general in the head of his army. A swift cloud - This
phrase shews that the judgment should come speedily, unexpectedly, and
unavoidably. Shall be moved - So far shall they be from helping the
Egyptians, that they shall tremble for themselves.

[Isaiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 19:2</span></span>

I will set - Egypt was now one kingdom, but not many years after this
time it was divided into twelve kingdoms, between whom there were many
and cruel wars.

[Isaiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 19:3</span></span>

The spirit - Their courage.

[Isaiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 19:4</span></span>

A fierce king - Psammetichus, who being at first one of those twelve
kings, waged war with the rest, and subdued them, and conquered all the
land of Egypt and ruled it with rigour.

[Isaiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 19:5</span></span>

The waters - Which may be understood either, Metaphorically, of the
taking away of their dominion or commerce, &c. or rather, Properly, as
may be gathered from the following words. For as the river Nile, when it
had a full stream, and free course, did pour forth a vast quantity of
waters by its seven famous mouths into the sea, so when that was dried
up, which is expressed in the next clause, those waters did truly and
properly fail from the sea. So there is no need of understanding by sea
either the river Nile, or the great lake of Maeris, which, after the
manner of the Hebrews, might be so called. The river - Nile: upon whose
fulness and overflow both the safety and the wealth of the land
depended; and therefore this was a very terrible judgment. Dried up -
Not totally, but in a very great measure.

[Isaiah 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 19:6</span></span>

Rivers - The rivers (those rivulets by which the waters of Nile were
distributed into several parts of the land) shall be turned far away, as
they must needs be, when the river which fed them was dried up. Brooks -
The several branches of the river Nile, which were a great defence to
Egypt. Reeds - Which were useful to them for making their boats. Whither
- As they commonly do for want of water.

[Isaiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 19:7</span></span>

Paper - reeds - These by a needle, or other fit instrument, were divided
into thin and broad leaves, which being dried and fitted, were used at
that time for writing; and consequently was a very good commodity. By
brooks - And much more what was sown in more dry and unfruitful places.

[Isaiah 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 19:8</span></span>

Mourn - Because they could catch no fish; which was a great loss to the
people, whose common diet this was.

[Isaiah 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#009)

They - That make fine linen, which was one of their best commodities.

[Isaiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 19:13</span></span>

Noph - Another chief city, and one of the kings seats, called also Moph,
and by latter authors, Memphis. The stay - Their chief counsellors.
Tribes - Of the provinces, which he calls by a title borrowed from the
Hebrews, in whose language he spake and wrote this prophecy.

[Isaiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 19:14</span></span>

Mingled - Or, hath poured out or given them to drink. To err - In all
their designs and undertakings. Staggereth - When he is so drunk, that
he reels to and fro, and vomits up his drink.

[Isaiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015)

[Isaiah 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 19:18</span></span>

In that day - After that time. In the times of the gospel. Five - A
considerable number of their chief cities: a certain number being put
for an uncertain. Speak - Profess the Jewish religion, agree with them
in the same mind; which is fitly signified by speaking the same
language. Swear - This implies the dedication, and yielding up of a
person or thing to the Lord, by a solemn vow, or covenant. One - Not one
of the five, but another city, the sixth city. As divers cities shall be
converted and saved, so some other cities shall continue in their
impenitency, and be destroyed.

[Isaiah 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 19:19</span></span>

by typical phrases.

[Isaiah 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 19:22</span></span>

the church of God, shall now be reconciled and united together in the
service of God, and love to his church. Serve - The Lord.

[Isaiah 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 19:24</span></span>

The third - The third party, in that sacred league, whereby all of them
oblige themselves to serve God. Egypt - These are named, because they
were the most obstinate enemies to God's church, but they are here put
for all the Gentiles. A blessing - This is peculiar to Israel, who is
not only a third party, but is the most eminent of the three, as being
the fountain, by which the blessing is conveyed to the other two;
because Christ was to be born of them, and the gospel - church and
ordinances were first established among them, and from them derived to
the Gentiles. The land - Or, of those lands, Egypt and Assyria, between
which Israel lay.

people - This title, and those which follow, that were peculiar to the
people of Israel, shall now be given to these and all other nations.
