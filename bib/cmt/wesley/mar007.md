### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

[Mark 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 7:1</span></span>

Coming from Jerusalem - Probably on purpose to find occasion against
him. [Mat 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001).

[Mark 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 7:4</span></span>

Washing of cups and pots and brazen vessels and couches - The Greek word
(baptisms) means indifferently either washing or sprinkling. The cups,
pots, and vessels were washed; the couches sprinkled.

[Mark 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 7:5</span></span>

The tradition of the elders - The rule delivered down from your
forefathers.

[Mark 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 7:6</span></span>

[Isa 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).

[Mark 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 7:10</span></span>

[Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012); [Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017).

[Mark 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 7:15</span></span>

There is nothing entering into a man from without which can defile him -
Though it is very true, a man may bring guilt, which is moral
defilement, upon himself by eating what hurts his health, or by excess
either in meat or drink yet even here the pollution arises from the
wickedness of the heart, and is just proportionable to it. And this is
all that our Lord asserts.

[Mark 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 7:19</span></span>

Purging all meats - Probably the seat was usually placed over running
water.

[Mark 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 7:22</span></span>

Wickedness - The word means ill natured, cruelty, inhumanity, and all
malevolent affections. Foolishness - Directly contrary to sobriety of
thought and discourse: all kind of wild imaginations and extravagant
passions.

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

[Mat 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).

[Mark 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 7:26</span></span>

The woman was a Greek (that is, a Gentile, not a Jew) a Syrophenician or
Canaanite. Canaan was also called Syrophenicia, as lying between Syria,
properly so called, and Phenicia.

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

[Mat 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029).

[Mark 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 7:33</span></span>

He put his fingers into his ears - Perhaps intending to teach us, that
we are not to prescribe to him (as they who brought this man attempted
to do) but to expect his blessing by whatsoever means he pleases: even
though there should be no proportion or resemblance between the means
used, and the benefit to be conveyed thereby.

[Mark 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 7:34</span></span>

Ephphatha - This was a word of SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY, not an address to
God for power to heal: such an address was needless; for Christ had a
perpetual fund of power residing in himself, to work all miracles
whenever he pleased, even to the raising the dead, [Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021), [Joh
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026).

[Mark 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 7:36</span></span>

Them - The blind man and those that brought him.
