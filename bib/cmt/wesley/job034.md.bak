### [Job Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

[Job 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 34:2</span></span>

Ear - The ear, is put for the mind to which things are conveyed by it.

[Job 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 34:4</span></span>

Let us - Not contend for victory, but for truth and equity. Know - Let
us shew one another who hath the best cause.

[Job 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 34:5</span></span>

Said - I am so far righteous, that I have not deserved, such hard usage
from God. Had taken - So Job had said, [Job
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002.md), he denies me that which is just
and equal, to give me a fair hearing.

[Job 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 34:6</span></span>

Should I lie - So Job had said in effect, [Job
27:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004.md), should I falsely accuse myself
of sins of which I am not guilty? Without transgression - Without any
such crying, sin, as might reasonably bring down such terrible judgments
upon my head.

[Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 34:7</span></span>

Like water - Abundantly and greedily: who doth so break forth into
scornful expressions, not only against his friends, but in some sort
against God himself.

[Job 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 34:8</span></span>

Who goeth - Although I dare not say, that he is a wicked man, yet in
this matter he speaks and acts like one of them.

[Job 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 34:9</span></span>

He said - Not in express terms, but by consequence; because he said that
good men were no less, nay, sometimes more miserable here than the
wicked.

[Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 34:12</span></span>

Pervert - As Job hath affirmed.

[Job 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 34:13</span></span>

Who - Who or where is his superior that made the world, and, then
delivered the government of it to God? God himself is the sole creator,
the absolute Lord of all, and therefore cannot do unjustly: because the
creator and Lord of the world must needs have all possible perfections
in himself, and amongst others, perfect justice. Disposed - Or,
committed, to him, to be governed by him, in the name, of his Lord, to
whom he must give an account.

[Job 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 34:15</span></span>

All - The design of this and the foregoing verse is the same with that
of [Job 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md), namely, to declare
God's absolute and uncontrollable sovereignty over all men.

[Job 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 34:17</span></span>

Shall he - That is unrighteous. Govern - Elihu's argument is the same
with that of Abraham, [Gen 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025.md), and
that of St. Paul, [Rom 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md). If God
be unrighteous, how shall he judge or govern the world? And the argument
is undeniable: if God were unjust, there would be nothing but injustice
and confusion in the world, whereas we see there is a great deal of
justice administered in the world, and all this must proceed from him
who is the fountain of all justice, and rule, and authority. And he that
makes men just, shall he be unjust? Most just - God, who hath given so
many clear and unquestionable evidences of his justice, in giving just
and holy laws, in encouraging and rewarding righteous persons in this
life, and inflicting dreadful judgments upon tyrants and oppressors.

[Job 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 34:18</span></span>

Wicked - Though a king may be wicked, yet his subjects neither may nor
dare call him so.

[Job 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 34:21</span></span>

For - God doth not destroy either prince or people unjustly, no nor out
of his mere pleasure, but for their sins, which he sees exactly,
although they use all possible arts to hide them.

[Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 34:26</span></span>

As - Because they are wicked men. In the open light - In publick view
for their greater shame, and for the greater glory of his justice.

[Job 34:28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 34:28</span></span>

Cry of the poor - Their case is bad, who have the prayers and tears of
the poor against them: for these will draw down vengeance sooner or
later, on the heads of their oppressors.

[Job 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 34:29</span></span>

Whether - God can carry on his work either of mercy or justice, as
irresistible upon an whole nation as upon one particular person.

[Job 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 34:30</span></span>

Reign not - May not continue his tyranny, lest the people be ensnared,
lest the people should be longer kept in the the snares of oppression;
God doth this to free poor oppressed people from the snares which
ungodly men lay for them.

That - The secret sins which I cannot discover, manifest thou to me.

[Job 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 34:33</span></span>

Should it be - Doth God need thy advice how to govern the world, and
whom, and when to reward or punish? Refuse - To submit as is expressed,
[Job 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md). Therefore - If thou canst
say any thing for thyself, I am ready to hear thy defence.

[Job 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 34:34</span></span>

Let - I am content that any wise man should judge of my words, and let
such consider what I say.

[Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md)

against God and his providence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 34:37</span></span>

Addeth - He sinned before, by impatience under his afflictions, now he
is grown obstinate, and instead of humbling himself for his sins,
justifies himself, and accuses the blessed God. Clapped - Insulting and
triumphing. Against God - In effect, though not directly.
