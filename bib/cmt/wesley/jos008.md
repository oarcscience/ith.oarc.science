### [Joshua Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 8:1</span></span>

Take all the people - That all of them might be partakers of this first
spoil, and thereby encouraged to proceed in their work. The weak
multitude indeed were not to go, because they might have hindered them
in the following stratagem; and it was but fit that the military men who
run the greatest hazards, should have the precedency in the spoils.

[Joshua 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 8:2</span></span>

To Ai - That is, the city and people of Ai. Unto Jericho and her king -
That is, overcome and destroy them. This was enjoined to chastise their
last insolence, and the triumphs and blasphemies which doubtless their
success had produced: and to revive the dread and terror which had been
impressed upon the Canaanites by Jericho's ruin, and had been much
abated by the late success of Ai.

[Joshua 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 8:3</span></span>

To go up against Ai - That is, to consider about this expedition; not as
if all the people of war did actually go up, which was both unnecessary
and burdensome: but it seems to be resolved by Joshua and all the
council of war, that the thirty thousand here following should be
selected for the enterprize. Either,

1, the thirty thousand now mentioned; or, 2. part of them; namely, such
as were to lie in wait; and these were

only five thousand men, as is expressed, [Jos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md).

[Joshua 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 8:4</span></span>

Them - The same party last spoken of, even the five thousand mentioned
[Jos 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md), there are only two parties
engaged in the taking of Ai, and but one ambush, as plainly appears by
comparing [Jos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md), with [Jos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md), which speaks only of five
thousand, who are justly supposed to be a part of those thirty thousand
named, [Jos 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md).

[Joshua 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 8:5</span></span>

That are - Or, that shall be: for at present he sent them away, [Jos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md), but the next morning followed,
and joined himself with them, [Jos
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md). That we - I and the twenty
five thousand with me.

[Joshua 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 8:9</span></span>

Sent them - The same party. Among the people - Heb. that people, the
people of war as they are called, [Jos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#011.md), that is, the main body of the
host consisting of thirty thousand.

[Joshua 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 8:10</span></span>

The people - Heb. that people, not all the people of Israel; which was
needless, and required more time than could now be spared; but the rest
of that host of thirty thousand, whereof five thousand were sent away;
the remainder are numbered, to see whether some of them had not
withdrawn themselves, taking the advantage of the night, and of the
design of laying an ambush; and that it might be evident, this work was
done without any loss of men, whereby they might be encouraged to trust
in God, and to proceed resolutely in their work. The elders of Israel -
The chief magistrates and rulers of Israel under Joshua; and these, I
suppose, went with Joshua, and with the army, to take care that the
cattle and the spoil of the city, which was given by God to all Israel
for a prey, [Jos 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#002.md), [Jos
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#027.md), might be justly and equally
divided between those that went to battle, and the rest of the people.

[Joshua 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 8:11</span></span>

That were with him - Namely, the thirty thousand mentioned, [Jos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md), or the most of them.

[Joshua 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 8:12</span></span>

And he took - Or rather, but he had taken, namely, out of the said
number of thirty thousand, for this is added by way of recapitulation
and farther explication of what is said in general, [Jos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md).

[Joshua 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 8:13</span></span>

Joshua went - Namely, accompanied with a small part of the host now
mentioned, that is, very early in the morning, when it was yet dark, as
is said in a like case, [Joh 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md),
whence it is here called night, though it was early in the morning, as
is said, [Jos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md), for it seems most
probable, that all was done in one night's space, and in this manner;
Joshua sends away the ambush by night, [Jos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md), and lodgeth that night with
twenty - five thousand men, [Jos 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md),
not far from the city. But not able or willing to sleep all night, he
rises very early, [Jos 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md), and
numbers his men, which by the help of the several officers was quietly
done, and so immediately leads them towards Ai; and while it was yet
duskish or night, he goes into the midst of the valley, [Jos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013.md), and when the day dawns he is
discovered by the king and people of Ai, who thereupon rose up early to
fight with them, [Jos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014.md). The valley
- Which was near the city, thereby to allure them forth.

[Joshua 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 8:14</span></span>

His people - Namely, all his men of war, for the rest were left in Ai,
[Jos 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#016.md). At a time appointed - At a
certain hour agreed upon between the king and people of Ai, and of
Bethel too, who were their confederates in this enterprize, as it may
seem from [Jos 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017.md). Possibly they
might appoint the same hour of the day on which they had fought against
Israel with good success, looking upon it as a lucky hour. Before the
plain - That is, towards or in sight of that plain or valley in which
the Israelites were, that so they might put themselves in battle -
array. Against him - The former success having made him secure, as is
usual in such cases; God also blinding his mind, and infatuating him, as
he useth to do with those whom he intends to destroy.

[Joshua 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 8:15</span></span>

Made as if they were beaten - That is, fled from them, as it were for
fear of a second blow. The wilderness - Which lay between Ai and
Jericho, whither they now seemed to flee.

[Joshua 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 8:16</span></span>

All the people - Namely, all that were able to bear arms, for old men
and children were unfit for the pursuit or fight; and that they were yet
left, may seem from [Jos 8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024.md).

[Joshua 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 8:17</span></span>

Not a man - Namely, fit for war. Bethel - Which, being a neighbouring
city, and encouraged by the former success, had sent some forces to
assist them; and now, upon notice sent to them of the flight of their
common enemies, or upon some other signal given, all their men of war
join with those of Ai in the pursuit.

[Joshua 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 8:18</span></span>

Stretch out the spear - This was, either, for a sign to his host present
with him, to stop their flight, and make head against the pursuers: or,
for a signal to the liers in wait, or, as a token of God's presence and
assistance with them, and of their victory.

[Joshua 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 8:19</span></span>

Set the city on fire - Not all of it, as appears from [Jos
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028.md), and because then they had lost
that prey which God had allowed them; but part of it, enough to raise a
smoke, and give notice to their brethren of their success.

[Joshua 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 8:21</span></span>

All Israel - That is, all the Israelites there present.

[Joshua 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 8:22</span></span>

The other - They who lay in ambush.

[Joshua 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 8:23</span></span>

Took alive - Reserving him to a more ignominious punishment.

[Joshua 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 8:24</span></span>

Smote it - That is, the inhabitants of it, the men, who through age or
infirmity were unfit for war, and the women, [Jos
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025.md).

[Joshua 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 8:25</span></span>

Of Ai - Not strictly, but largely so called, who were now in Ai, either
as constant and settled inhabitants, or as sojourners and such as came
to them for their help.

[Joshua 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 8:26</span></span>

Drew not his hand back - He kept his hand and spear in the same posture,
both stretched out and lifted up, as a sign both to encourage them, and
to direct them to go on in the work.

[Joshua 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 8:29</span></span>

Hanged on a tree - He dealt more severely with the kings of Canaan than
with the people, because the abominable wickedness of that people was
not restrained and punished (as it should have been) but countenanced
and encouraged by their evil examples; and because they were the
principal authors of the destruction of their own people, by engaging
them in an obstinate opposition against the Israelites. Down from the
tree - According to God's command in that case, [Deu
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#022.md). The gate of the city - Which
place he chose either as most commodious, now especially when all the
city within the gate was already turned in to an heap of stones and
rubbish; or because this was the usual place of judgment; and therefore
proper to bear the monument of God's just sentence against him, not
without reflection upon that injustice which he had been guilty of in
that place.

[Joshua 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 8:30</span></span>

Then - Namely, after the taking of Ai. For they were obliged to do this,
when they were brought over Jordan into the land of Canaan, [Deu
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#029.md), [Deu
27:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002.md), which is not to be understood
strictly, as if it were to be done the same day; for it is manifest they
were first to be circumcised, and to eat the passover, which they did,
and which was the work of some days; but as soon as they had opportunity
to do it, which was now when these two great frontier cities were taken
and destroyed, and thereby the coast cleared, and the bordering people
under great consternation, so that all the Israelites might securely
march thither. And indeed this work was fit to be done as soon as might
be, that thereby they might renew their covenant with God, by whose help
alone they could expect success in their great and difficult enterprize.
Built an altar - Namely, for the offering of sacrifices, as appears from
the following verse. Mount Ebal - God's altar was to be but in one
place, [Deu 12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013.md), and this place
was appointed to he mount Ebal, [Deu
27:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#004.md), which also seems most proper,
that in that place whence the curses of the law were denounced against
sinners, there might also be the tokens and means of grace, and peace,
and reconciliation with God, for the removing of the curses, and the
procuring of God's blessing to sinners.

[Joshua 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 8:32</span></span>

Upon the stones - Not upon the stones of the altar, which were to be
rough and unpolished, [Jos 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#031.md), but
upon other stones, smooth and plaistered, as is manifest from [Deu
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002.md). The law of Moses - Not certainly
the whole five books of Moses, for what stones and time would have
sufficed for this, but the most weighty parts of the law, and especially
the law of the ten commandments.

[Joshua 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 8:33</span></span>

All Israel - That is, the whole congregation, old and young, male and
female. That side - Some on one side of it, and some on the other. Mount
Gerizim - These two places were in the tribe of Ephraim, not far from
Shechem, as appears both from scripture, and from other authors. Bless -
Or curse, which is easily understood out of the following verse.

[Joshua 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 8:34</span></span>

Afterward - After the altar was built, and the stones plaistered and
writ upon. He read - That is, he commanded the priests or Levites to
read, [Deu 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014.md). Blessings and
cursings - Which words came in not by way of explication, as if the
words of the law were nothing else besides the blessings and curses; but
by way of addition, to note that these were read over and above the
words of the law.

[Joshua 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 8:35</span></span>

Read not - Therefore he read not the blessings and curses only, as some
think, but the whole law, as the manner was when all Israel, men and
women, were assembled together, or the ten commandments. Among them -
Who were proselytes, for no others can be supposed to be with them at
this time.
