### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 9:1</span></span>

Ramoth - The kings of Israel and Judah were both absent, and Jehu, as it
seems, was left in chief command.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 9:7</span></span>

I may avenge,&c. - That they were idolaters was bad enough: yet that is
not mentioned here: the controversy God has with them, is for being
persecutors. Nothing fills the measure of the iniquity of any prince so
as this doth, nor brings a surer or sorer ruin.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 9:11</span></span>

Mad fellow - They perceived him to be a prophet by his habit, and
gestures, and manner of speech. And these prophane soldiers esteemed the
prophets mad - men. Those that have no religion, commonly speak of those
that are religious with disdain, and look upon them as crack - brained.
They said of our Lord, He is beside himself; of St. Paul, that much
learning had made him mad. The highest wisdom is thus represented as
folly, and they that best understand themselves, as men beside
themselves.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 9:13</span></span>

They hasted - God putting it into their hearts thus readily to own him.
Under him - Under Jehu. A ceremony used in the eastern parts towards
superiors, in token of reverence to his person, that they would not have
his feet to touch the ground, and that they put themselves and their
concerns under his feet, and into his disposal. The stairs - In some
high and eminent place, whence he might be seen and owned by all the
soldiers, who were called together upon this great occasion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 9:21</span></span>

Portion of Naboth - The very sight of that ground was enough to make
Jehu triumph and Joram tremble. The circumstances of events are
sometimes so ordered by Divine providence, as to make the punishment
answer the sin, as face answers face in a glass.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 9:22</span></span>

Whoredoms, &c. - This may be understood, either literally; spiritual
whoredom, which is idolatry, being often punished with corporal: and
witchcraft was often practised by idolaters: or spiritually, of her
idolatry, which is often called whoredom, because it is a departing from
God, to whom we are tied by many obligations; and witchcraft, because it
doth so powerfully bewitch men's minds; and because it is a manifest
entering into covenant with the devil. He mentions not Joram's, but his
mother's sins; because they were more notorious and infamous: and
because they were the principal cause why God inflicted, and he was come
to execute these judgments. The way of sin can never be the way of
peace.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 9:24</span></span>

The arrow - It was one of God's arrows, which he ordained against the
persecutor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg2 9:27</span></span>

He died - The history is briefly and imperfectly described here, and the
defects supplied in (the book of Chronicles, is great part written for
that end, to supply things omitted in the book of Kings) out of both it
may be thus compleated: he fled first to Megiddo, and thence to Samaria,
where he was caught, and thence brought to Jehu, and by his sentence was
put to death at Megiddo.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg2 9:31</span></span>

Had Zimri - Remember thy brother traitor Zimri had but a very short
enjoyment of the benefit of his treason.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 9:34</span></span>

And said - It seems he had forgot the charge given him above, [Kg2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010.md). A king's daughter - He doth not
say, because she was a king's wife, lest he should seem to shew any
respect to that wicked house of Ahab, which God had devoted to utter
destruction.
