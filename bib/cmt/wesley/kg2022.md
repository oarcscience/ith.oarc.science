### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 22:3</span></span>

The scribe - The secretary of state.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 22:8</span></span>

The book - That original book of the law of the Lord, given or written
by the hand of Moses, as it is expressed, [Ch2
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#014.md), which by God's command was put
beside the ark, [Deu 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md), and
probably taken from thence and hid, by the care of some godly priest,
when some of the idolatrous kings of Judah persecuted the true religion,
and defaced the temple, and (which the Jewish writers affirm) burnt all
the copies of God's law which they could find. It was now found among
the rubbish, or in some secret place.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 22:11</span></span>

The words - The dreadful comminations against them for the sins still
reigning among the people. If Josiah had seen and read it before, which
seems more probable, yet the great reverence which he justly bare to the
original book, and the strange, and remarkable, and seasonable finding
of it, had awakened and quickened him to a more serious and diligent
consideration of all the passages contained in it. And what a providence
was this, that it was still preserved! Yea, what a providence, that the
whole book of God is preserved to us. If the holy scriptures had not
been of God, they had not been in being at this day. God's care of the
bible, is a plain proof of his interest in it. It was a great instance
of God's favour, that the book of the law was thus seasonably brought to
light, to direct and quicken that blessed reformation, which Joash had
begun. And it is observable, they were about a good work, repairing the
temple, when it was found. They that do their duty according to their
knowledge, shall have their knowledge increased.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 22:13</span></span>

Enquire - What we shall do to appease his wrath, and whether the curses
here threatened must come upon us without remedy, or whether there be
hope in Israel concerning the prevention of them.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 22:14</span></span>

Huldah - The king's earnest affection required great haste; and she was
in Jerusalem, which is therefore noted in the following part of the
verse, when Jeremiah might at this time be at Anathoth, or in some more
remote part of the kingdom; and the like may be said of Zephaniah, who
also might not be a prophet at this time, though he was afterward, in
the days of Josiah. College - Where the sons of the prophets, or others,
who devoted themselves to the study of God's word, used to meet and
discourse of the things of God, and receive the instructions of their
teachers.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 22:15</span></span>

The man - She uses no compliments. Tell the man that sent you - Even
kings, though gods to us, are men to God, and shall be so dealt with:
for with him there is no respect of persons.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 22:17</span></span>

The works - Gods made with hands.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 22:19</span></span>

Tender - He trembled at God's word. He was grieved for the dishonour
done to God by the sins of his people. He was afraid of the judgments of
God, which he saw coming on Jerusalem. This is tenderness of heart.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 22:20</span></span>

In peace - That is, in a time of public peace: for otherwise he died in
battle. Besides, he died in peace with God, and was by death translated
to everlasting peace.
