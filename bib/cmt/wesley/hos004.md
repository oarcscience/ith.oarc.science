### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001)

[Hosea 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 4:2</span></span>

Break out - As waters that swell above all banks. Toucheth blood -
Slaughters are multiplied; so that the end of one is the beginning of
another.

[Hosea 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 4:3</span></span>

Shall languish - Shall pine away. With the beasts of the field - God
punishes man in cutting off what was made for man's benefit; and 'tis
probable the tamer cattle were starved for want of grass or fodder, all
being consumed by the wasting armies. The tamer either were killed by
enemies, or offended with stench, forsook the country, or were devoured
by birds of prey. Taken away - Whether by drying up the waters, or by
corrupting them with blood and carcasses.

[Hosea 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 4:4</span></span>

Let no man strive - They are so hardened, it is to no purpose to warn
them any more. As they that strive - There is no modesty, or fear of God
or man left among them, they will contend with their teachers,
reprovers, and counsellors.

[Hosea 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 4:5</span></span>

Therefore - The prophet turns his speech to the people, thou O Israel;
he speaks to them as to one person. Fall - Stumble, and fall, and be
broken. This day - Very suddenly; your fall shall be no longer delayed.
The prophet - Prophesied lies. In the night - In the darkest calamities.
Thy mother - Both the state, or kingdom; and the synagogues, or
churches: the publick is as a mother to private persons, so all shall be
destroyed.

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

Destroyed - Many were already cut off by Pul king of Assyria, and many
destroyed by the bloody tyranny of Menahem. Of knowledge - Of God, his
law, his providence, his holy nature, his hatred of sin and power to
punish it. Because thou - The prophet now turns from the people to the
priests, to whom he speaks as to one person. Rejected knowledge - Art
and wilt be ignorant. Seeing thou - O Israel, and you O priests, you
have broken all the precepts of it. Thy children - The people of Israel,
the whole kingdom of the ten tribes.

[Hosea 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 4:7</span></span>

As they - Kings, priests, and people. Were increased - In number, in
riches, and honour. So they sinned - Sin grew with their wealth and
honour. Their glory - They turned all that in which they might glory
above others, into sin. I will turn it into their dishonour.

[Hosea 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 4:8</span></span>

They - The priests who minister to the idols. The sin - Probably by sin
is meant sin - offering, in which the priest had his share. And they -
Covetous, luxurious, idolatrous priests.

[Hosea 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 4:10</span></span>

Not have enough - They shall not be nourished, nor satisfied with what
they eat. Shall not increase - They shall not hereby increase the number
of their children, either the women shall not bear, or the children
shall not live.

[Hosea 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 4:11</span></span>

Take away the heart - Deprive men of their understanding and judgment.

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

Stocks - Wooden statues. The spirit of whoredom - A heart ensnared with
whoredoms, spiritual and corporal. Caused them to err - Hath blinded,
and deceived them.

[Hosea 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 4:13</span></span>

Good - Convenient for the sacrificers. Shall commit whoredom - Shall
dishonour themselves, and their families, with fornicators.

[Hosea 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 4:14</span></span>

Nor your spouses - I will give them up to their own hearts. For
themselves - The husband and fathers are examples to their wives and
daughters. Therefore the people - The sottish ignorant people, that know
not God. Shall fall - Be utterly ruined.

[Hosea 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 4:15</span></span>

Offend - Commit like sins. Gilgal - Gilgal was chosen by Jeroboam, or by
succeeding idolaters for the solemn worship of their idols. Beth - aven
- Beth - el, where Jacob lodged, who called it Beth - el, the house of
God; but when Jeroboam made it the place for his calf - worship, it
became Beth - aven, the house of vanity or iniquity. Nor swear - This is
a part put for the whole worship of God, which the prophet warns them
not to blend with their idolatries.

[Hosea 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 4:16</span></span>

Israel - The ten tribes. As a back - sliding heifer - Which when grown
lusty, and wanton, will neither endure the yoke nor be confined in her
allowed pastures. In a large place - In a large place or wilderness,
where is no rest, safety or provision; such shall be the condition of
the ten tribes.

[Hosea 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 4:17</span></span>

Ephraim - The children of Ephraim were numerous and potent, and here put
for the whole ten tribes. Let him alone - He is obstinate, as such,
throw him up.

[Hosea 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 4:18</span></span>

Their drink - Their wine is corrupt and hurtful. Continually - Without
ceasing from Jeroboam's time to this day. Give ye - Beside there is
shameful oppression and bribery among them.

[Hosea 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hos 4:19</span></span>

The wind - The whirlwind of wrath from God hath seized this old
adulteress, and carried some of her children away already. They shall be
ashamed - What they made their confidence, shall be their shame.
