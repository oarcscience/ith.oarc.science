Observe the month of Abib - Or of new fruits, which answers to part of

With it - Or, in it, that is, during the time of the feast of the

to put thee in mind both of thy miseries endured in Egypt; and of thy
hasty coming out of it, which allowed thee no time to leaven or prepare
thy bread.

There - Namely, in the court of the tabernacle or temple. This he
prescribed, partly that this great work might be done with more
solemnity in such manner as God required; partly, because it was not
only a sacrament, but also a sacrifice, and because here was the
sprinkling of blood, which is the essential part of a sacrifice; and
partly to design the place where Christ, the true passover or lamb of
God, was to be slain. At the season - About the time you were preparing
yourselves for it.
