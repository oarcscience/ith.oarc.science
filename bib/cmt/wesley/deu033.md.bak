### [Deuteronomy Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 33:1</span></span>

Moses blessed Israel - He is said to bless them, by praying to God with
faith for his blessing upon them; and by foretelling the blessings which
God would confer upon them. And Moses calls himself here the man of God,
that is, the servant or prophet of God, to acquaint them that the
following prophecies were not his own inventions, but divine
inspirations. The children of Israel - The several tribes: only Simeon
is omitted, either in detestation of their parent Simeon's bloody
carriage, for which Jacob gives that tribe a curse rather than a
blessing, in [Gen 49:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#005.md). Or, because
that tribe had no distinct inheritance, but was to have its portion in
the tribe of Judah, [Jos 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md).

[Deuteronomy 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 33:2</span></span>

The Lord came - Namely, to the Israelites, manifested himself graciously
and gloriously among them. From Sinai - Beginning at Sinai, where the
first appearance of God was, and so going on with them to Seir and
Paran. And rose up - He appeared or shewed himself, as the sun doth when
it riseth. From Seir - From the mountain or land of Edom, to which place
the Israelites came, [Num 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md), &c.
and from thence God led them on towards the land of promise, and then
gloriously appeared for them in subduing Sihon and Og before them. But
because the land of Edom is sometimes taken more largely, and so
reacheth even to the Red - sea, and therefore mount Sinai was near to
it, and because Paran was also near Sinai, being the next station into
which they came from the wilderness of Sinai: all this verse may belong
to God's appearance in mount Sinai, where that glorious light which
shone upon mount Sinai directly, did in all probability scatter its
beams into adjacent parts, such as Seir and Paran were. And if so, this
is only a poetical expression of the same thing in divers words, and God
coming or rising or shining from or to or in Sinai and Seir and Paran
note one and the same illustrious action of God appearing there with ten
thousands of his saints or holy angels, and giving a fiery law to them.
Paran - A place where God eminently manifested his presence and goodness
both in giving the people flesh which they desired, and in appointing
the seventy elders and pouring forth his spirit upon them. With ten
thousands of saints - That is, with a great company of holy angels, [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md), which attended upon him in this
great and glorious work of giving the law, as may be gathered from [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). From his right hand - Which both
wrote the law and gave it to men. An allusion to men who ordinarily
write and give gifts with their right hand. A fiery law - The law is
called fiery, because it is of a fiery nature purging and searching and
inflaming, to signify that fiery wrath which it inflicteth upon sinners
for the violation of it, and principally because it was delivered out of
the midst of the fire.

[Deuteronomy 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 33:3</span></span>

The people - The tribes of Israel. The sense is, this law, though
delivered with fire and smoke and thunder, which might seem to portend
nothing but hatred and terror, yet in truth was given to Israel, in
great love, as being the great mean of their temporal and eternal
salvation. Yea, he, embraced the people, and laid them in his bosom! so
the word signifies, which speaks not only the dearest love, but the most
tender and careful protection. All God's saints or holy ones, that is,
his people, were in thy hand, that is, under God's care to protect,
direct and govern them. These words are spoken to God: the change of
persons, his and thy, is most frequent in the Hebrew tongue. This clause
may farther note God's kindness to Israel, in upholding them when the
fiery law was delivered, which was done with so much terror that not
only the people were ready to sink under it, but even Moses did
exceedingly fear and quake. But God sustained both Moses and the people,
in or by his hand, whereby he in a manner covered them that no harm
might come to them. At thy feet - Like scholars to receive instructions.
He alludes to the place where the people waited when the law was
delivered, which was at the foot of the mount. Every one - Of the people
will receive or submit to thy instructions and commands. This may
respect either, the peoples promise when they heard the law, that they
would hear and do all that was commanded. Or, their duty to do so.

[Deuteronomy 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 33:4</span></span>

Moses - He speaks this of himself in the third person, which is very
usual in the Hebrew language. The law is called their inheritance,
because the obligation of it was hereditary, passing from parents to
their children, and because this was the best part of their inheritance,
the greatest of all those gifts which God bestowed upon them.

[Deuteronomy 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 33:5</span></span>

He was king in Jeshurun - Moses was their king not in title, but in
reality, being under God, their supreme governor, and law giver.
Gathered together - When the princes and people met together for the
management of public affairs, Moses was owned by them as their king and
lawgiver.

[Deuteronomy 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 33:6</span></span>

Let Reuben live - Though Reuben deserve to be cut off or greatly
diminished and obscured, according to Jacob's prediction, [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004.md), yet God will spare them and give
them a name and portion among the tribes of Israel, and bless them with
increase of their numbers. All the ancient paraphrasts refer this to the
other world, so far were they from expecting temporal blessings only.
Let Reuben live in life eternal, says Onkelos, and not die the second
death. Let Reuben live in this world, so Jonathan and the Jerusalem
Targum, and not die that death which the wicked die in the world to
come.

[Deuteronomy 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 33:7</span></span>

Hear, Lord - God will hear his prayer for the accomplishment of those
great things promised to that tribe, [Gen
49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md). This implies the delays and
difficulties Judah would meet with, that would drive him to his prayers,
which would be with success. Unto his people - When he shall go forth to
battle against his enemies and shall fall fiercely upon them, as was
foretold, [Gen 49:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md). Bring him back
with honour and victory, to his people, to the rest of his tribe who
were left at home when their brethren went to battle: and to his
brethren the other tribes of Israel. Let his hands be sufficient for him
- This tribe shall be so numerous and potent that it shall suffice to
defend itself without any aid, either from foreign nations or from other
tribes; as appeared when this tribe alone was able to grapple with nine
or ten of the other tribes. From his enemies - Thou wilt preserve this
tribe in a special manner, so that his enemies shall not be able to ruin
it, as they will do other tribes, and that for the sake of the Messiah
who shall spring out of it.

[Deuteronomy 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 33:8</span></span>

Let thy Urim - The Thummim and the Urim, which are thine, O Lord by
special institution and consecration, (by which he understands the ephod
in which they were put, and the high priesthood, to which they were
appropriated, and withal the gifts and graces signified by the Urim and
Thummim, and necessary for the discharge of that high - office) shall be
with thy holy one, that is, with that priest, whom thou hast consecrated
to thyself, and who is holy in a more peculiar manner than all the
people were; that is, the priesthood shall be confined to and continued
in Aaron's family. Whom thou didst prove - Altho' thou didst try him,
and rebuke him, yet thou didst not take away the priesthood from him. At
Massah - Not at that Massah mentioned [Exo
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007.md), which is also called Meribah,
but at that other Meribah, [Num 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md).
Thou didst strive - Whom thou didst reprove and chastise.

[Deuteronomy 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 33:9</span></span>

I have not seen him - That is, I have no respect unto them. The sense
is, who followed God and his command fully, and executed the judgment
enjoined by God without any respect of persons, [Exo
32:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#026.md). They kept thy covenant -
When the rest broke their covenant with God by that foul sin of idolatry
with the calf, that tribe kept themselves pure from that infection, and
adhered to God and his worship.

[Deuteronomy 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 33:11</span></span>

His substance - Because he hath no inheritance of his own and therefore
wholly depends upon thy blessing. The work of his hands - All his holy
administrations, which he fitly calls the work of his hands, because a
great part of the service of the Levites and priests was done by the
labour of their hand and body, whereas the service of evangelical
ministers is more spiritual and heavenly. Smite - He pray's thus
earnestly for them, because he foresaw they who were to teach and
reprove, and chastise others would have many enemies, and because they
were under God, the great preservers and upholders of religion, and
their enemies were the enemies of religion itself.

[Deuteronomy 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 33:12</span></span>

Of Benjamin - Benjamin is put next to Levi, because the temple, where
the work of the Levites lay, was upon the edge of the lot of this tribe.
And 'tis put before Joseph, because of the dignity of Jerusalem, (part
of which was in this lot) above Samaria, which was in the tribe of
Ephraim: likewise because Benjamin adhered to the house of David and to
the temple of God, when the rest of the tribes deserted both. The
beloved of the Lord - So called in allusion to their father Benjamin who
was the beloved of his father Jacob; and because of the kindness of God
to this tribe which appeared both in this, that they dwelt in the best
part of the land, as Josephus affirms, and in the following privilege.
Shall dwell in safety by him - Shall have his lot nigh to God's temple,
which was both a singular comfort and safeguard to him. Shall cover -
Shall protect that tribe continually while they cleave to him. He - The
Lord shall dwell, that is, his temple shall be placed, between his
shoulders, that is, in his portion, or between his border's as the word
shoulder is often used. And this was truly the situation of the temple,
on both sides whereof was Benjamin's portion. And though mount Sion was
in the tribe of Judah, yet mount Moriah, on which the temple was built,
was in the tribe of Benjamin.

[Deuteronomy 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 33:13</span></span>

And of Joseph - Including both Ephraim and Manasseh. In Jacob's blessing
that of Joseph's is the largest. And so it is here. His land - His
portion shall be endowed with choice blessings from God. Of heaven -
That is, the precious fruits of the earth brought forth by the
influences of heaven, the warmth of the sun, and the rain which God will
send from heaven. The deep - The springs of water bubbling out of the
earth: perhaps it may likewise refer to the great deep, the abyss of
waters, which is supposed to be contained in the earth.

[Deuteronomy 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 33:14</span></span>

By the sun - Which opens and warms the earth, cherishes and improves and
in due time ripens the seeds and fruits of it. The moon - Which by its
moisture refreshes and promotes them. Heb. Of the moons, or months, that
is, which it bringeth forth in the several months or seasons of the
year.

[Deuteronomy 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 33:15</span></span>

The chief things - That is, the excellent fruits, as grapes, olives,
figs, &c. which delight in mountains, growing upon, or the precious
minerals contained in, their mountains and hills called ancient and
lasting, that is, such as have been from the beginning of the world, and
are likely to continue to the end of it, in opposition to those hills or
mounts which have been cast up by man.

[Deuteronomy 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 33:16</span></span>

And for - And in general for all the choice fruits which the land
produceth in all the parts of it, whither hills or valleys. Fulness
thereof - That is, the plants and cattle and all creatures that grow,
increase, and flourish in it. The good will - For all other effects of
the good will and kindness of God who not long since did for a time
dwell or appear in the bush to me in order to the relief of his people,
[Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md). Of Joseph - That is, of
Joseph's posterity. Him that was separated from his brethren - His
brethren separated him from them by making him a slave, and God
distinguished him from them by making him a prince. The preceeding words
might be rendered, My dweller in the bush. That was an appearance of the
divine majesty to Moses only, in token of his particular favour. Many a
time had God appeared to Moses; but now he is just dying, he seems to
have the most pleasing remembrance, of the first time that he saw the
visions of the Almighty. It was here God declared himself the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and so confirmed the promise made to the
father, that promise which our Lord shews, reaches as far as the
resurrection and eternal life.

[Deuteronomy 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 33:17</span></span>

His glory is like the firstling of his bullock - Or young bull, which is
a stately creature, and was therefore formerly used as an emblem of
royal majesty. This seems to note the kingdom which Ephraim should
obtain in Jeroboam and his successors. His horns - His strength and
power shall be very great. The people - All that shall oppose him, and
particularly the Canaanites. The ten thousands - Of the land of Canaan.
Though Manasseh be now more numerous, yet Ephraim shall shortly outstrip
him, as was foretold [Gen 48:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#017.md).

[Deuteronomy 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 33:18</span></span>

Rejoice - Thou shalt prosper and have cause of rejoicing. In thy going
out - To war, as this phrase is often used. To sea, in way of traffick,
because their portion lay near the sea. And in both respects his course
is opposite to that of Issachar, who was a lover of peace and pasturage.
He is here joined with Zebulun, both because they were brethren by
father and mother too, and because their possessions lay near together.
In thy tents - Thou shalt give thyself to the management of laud and
cattle, living quietly in thy own possessions.

[Deuteronomy 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 33:19</span></span>

They - Zebulun of whom Moses takes more special notice. And so having
dispatched Issachar in two words, he returns to Zebulun. The people -
the Gentiles, either those of Galilee, which was called Galilee of the
Gentiles, who were their neighbours; or people of other nations, with
whom they had commerce, which they endeavoured to improve in persuading
them to worship the true God. The mountain - That is, to the temple,
which Moses knew was to be seated upon a mountain. Sacrifices of
righteousness - Such as God requires. Their trafficking abroad with
Heathen nations shall not make them forget their duty at home, nor shall
their distance from the place of sacrifice hinder them from coming to it
to discharge that duty. Of the abundance of the sea - They shall grow
rich by the traffick of the sea, and shall consecrate themselves and
their riches to God. Hid in the sand - Such precious things as either
Are contained in the sand of the sea and rivers, in which sometimes
there is mixed a considerable quantity of gold and silver. Or, Such as
grow in the sea, or are fetched from the sandy bottom of it, as pearls,
coral, ambergrease. Or, Such as being cast into the sea by shipwreck are
cast upon the shore by the workings of the sea. It were well, if the
enlargement of our trade with foreign countries, were made to contribute
to the spreading of the gospel.

[Deuteronomy 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">deu 33:20</span></span>

Enlargeth - That bringeth him out of his straits amid troubles, which he
was often engaged in, because he was encompassed with potent enemies. As
a lion - Safe and secure from his enemies, and terrible to them when
they rouse and molest him. Teareth the arm - Utterly destroys his
enemies, both the head, the seat of the crown, their dignity and
principality, and the arm, the subject of strength and instrument of
action; both chief princes, and their subjects.

[Deuteronomy 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">deu 33:21</span></span>

The first part - The first fruits of the land of promise, the country of
Sihon, which was first conquered, which he is said to provide for
himself, because he desired and obtained it of Moses. Of the law - giver
- Of Moses, whose portion this is called, either because this part of
the land beyond Jordan was the only part of the land which Moses was
permitted to enter upon: or because it was given him by Moses, whereas
the portions beyond Jordan were given to the several tribes by Joshua
according to the direction of the lot. Seated - Heb. hid or protected:
for their wives and children were secured in their cities, while many of
their men went over to the war in Canaan. He came - He went, or he will
go, to the war in Canaan, with the princes, or captains, or rulers of
the people of Israel, that is, under their command and conduct, as
indeed they did; or with the first of the people; or, in the front of
the people, as the Syriack renders it; for this tribe and their brethren
whose lot fell beyond Jordan, were to march into Canaan before their
brethren. He executed - The just judgment of God against the Canaanites,
as the rest of the Israelites did.

[Deuteronomy 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 33:22</span></span>

A lion's whelp - Courageous, and generous, and strong, and successful
against his enemies. Which leapeth - From Bashan, because there were
many and fierce lions in those parts, whence they used to come forth and
leap upon the prey. Or this may refer either to the particular victories
obtained by Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan, or to a more general
achievement of that tribe, when a party of them surprised Laish, which
lay in the farthest part of the land of Canaan from them. And the
mountain of Bashan lying not far from that city, from whence they
probably made their descent upon it, thus leaping from Basham.

[Deuteronomy 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">deu 33:23</span></span>

Satisfied with favour - With the favour of God. That only is the favour
that satisfies the soul. They are happy indeed that have the favour of
God; and they shall have it, that place their satisfaction in it. And
full with the blessing of the Lord - Not Only with corn, wine and oil,
the fruit of the blessing, but with the blessing itself, the grace of
God, according to his promise and covenant. Possess thou the west and
the south - Or, the sea and the south. This is not to be understood of
the place, that his lot should fall there, for he was rather in the east
and north of the land; but of the pleasures and commodities of the west
or of the sea, which were conveyed to him from his neighbour Zebulun;
and of the south, that is, from the southern tribes and parts of Canaan,
which were brought to him down the river Jordan, and both sorts of
commodities were given him in exchange for the fruitful rich soil which
he had in great abundance.

[Deuteronomy 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">deu 33:24</span></span>

Let Asher - Who carries blessedness in his very name, be blessed with
children - He shall have numerous, strong and healthful children.
Acceptable to his brethren - By his sweet disposition and winning
carriage. In oil - He shall have such plenty of oil that he may not only
wash his face, but his feet also in it.

[Deuteronomy 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">deu 33:25</span></span>

Iron and brass - The mines of iron and copper, which were in their
portion, whence Sidon their neighbor was famous among the Heathens for
its plenty of brass, and Sarepta is thought to have its name from the
brass and iron which were melted there in great quantity. Thy strength
shall be - Thy strength shall not be diminished with age, but thou shalt
have the vigor of youth even in thine old age: thy tribe shalt grow
stronger and stronger.

[Deuteronomy 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 33:26</span></span>

There us none - These are the last words that ever Moses wrote, perhaps
the greatest writer that ever lived upon the earth. And this man of God,
who had as much reason to know both as ever any mere man had, with his
last breath magnifies both the God of Israel, and the Israel of God.
Unto the God of Jeshurun, who to help thee, rideth upon the heaven, and
with the greatest state and magnificence, on the sky. Riding on the
heaven denotes the greatness and glory, in which he manifests himself to
the upper world, and the use he makes of the influences of heaven and
the products of the clouds, in bringing to pass his own counsels in this
lower world. All these he manages and directs, as a man doth the horse
he rides on.

[Deuteronomy 33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">deu 33:27</span></span>

The eternal God - He who was before all worlds, and will be, when time
shall be no more: Is thy refuge - Or, thy habitation or mansion - house
(so the word signifies) in whom thou art safe, and easy, and at rest, as
a man is in his own house. Every true Israelite is at home in God: the
soul returns to him, and reposes in him. And they that make him their
habitation shall have all the comforts and benefits of an habitation in
him. And underneath are the everlasting arms - The almighty power of
God, which protects and comforts all that trust in him, in their
greatest straits and distresses. He shall thrust out the enemy from
before thee - Shall make room for thee by his resistless power, and
shall say, Destroy them - Giving thee not only a commission but strength
to put it in execution. And, has he not given the same commission and
the same strength to believers, to destroy all sin?

[Deuteronomy 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 33:28</span></span>

Alone - Either Tho' they be alone, and have no confederates to defend
them, but have all the world against them, yet my single protection
shall be sufficient for them. Or, Distinct and separated from all other
nations, with whom I will not have them mingle themselves. The fountain
- That is, the posterity of Jacob, which flowed from him as waters from
a fountain, in great abundance. The fountain is here put for the river
or streams which flow from it, as Jacob or Israel who is the fountain is
often put for the children of Israel. His heavens - That is, those
heavens or that air which hangs over his land.

[Deuteronomy 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">deu 33:29</span></span>

The shield of they help - By whom thou are sufficiently guarded against
all assailants; and the sword of thy excellency - Or, thy most excellent
sword, that is, thy strength and the author of all thy past or
approaching victories. Those in whose hearts is the excellency of
holiness, have God himself for their shield and sword. They are defended
by the whole armour of God: His word is their sword, and faith their
shield. And thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee - Who said they
would destroy thee: or at least, that they would never submit: and thou
shalt tread upon their high places - Their strong holds, palaces and
temples. Thus shall the God of peace tread Satan under the feet of all
believers, and that shortly.
