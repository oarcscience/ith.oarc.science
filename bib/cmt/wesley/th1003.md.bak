### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 3:1</span></span>

We - Paul and Silvanus. Could bear no longer - Our desire and fear for
you.

[1 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 3:3</span></span>

We are appointed hereto - Are in every respect laid in a fit posture for
it, by the very design and contrivance of God himself for the trial and
increase of our faith and all other graces. He gives riches to the
world; but stores up his treasure of wholesome afflictions for his
children.

[1 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 3:6</span></span>

But now when Timotheus was come to us from you - Immediately after his
return, St. Paul wrote; while his joy was fresh, and his tenderness at
the height.

[1 Thessalonians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 3:8</span></span>

Now we live - Indeed; we enjoy life: so great is our affection for you.

[1 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 3:10</span></span>

And perfect that which is wanting in your faith - So St. Paul did not
know that "they who are once upon the rock no longer need to be taught
by man."

[1 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 3:11</span></span>

Direct our way - This prayer is addressed to Christ, as well as to the
Father.

[1 Thessalonians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 3:13</span></span>

With all his, Christ's, saints - Both angels and men.
