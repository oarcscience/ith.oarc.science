### [Matthew Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 1:1</span></span>

The book of the generation of Jesus Christ - That is, strictly speaking,
the account of his birth and genealogy. This title therefore properly
relates to the verses that immediately follow: but as it sometimes
signifies the history of a person, in that sense it may belong to the
whole book. If there were any difficulties in this genealogy, or that
given by St. Luke, which could not easily be removed, they would rather
affect the Jewish tables, than the credit of the evangelists: for they
act only as historians setting down these genealogies, as they stood in
those public and allowed records. Therefore they were to take them as
they found them. Nor was it needful they should correct the mistakes, if
there were any. For these accounts sufficiently answer the end for which
they are recited. They unquestionably prove the grand point in view,
that Jesus was of the family from which the promised seed was to come.
And they had more weight with the Jews for this purpose, than if
alterations had been made by inspiration itself. For such alterations
would have occasioned endless disputes between them and the disciples of
our Lord. The son of David, the son of Abraham - He is so called,
because to these he was more peculiarly promised; and of these it was
often foretold the Messiah should spring. [Luk
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#031.md).

[Matthew 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 1:3</span></span>

Of Thamar - St. Matthew adds the names of those women also, that were
remarkable in the sacred history.

[Matthew 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 1:4</span></span>

Naasson - Who was prince of the tribe of Judah, when the Israelites
entered into Canaan.

[Matthew 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 1:5</span></span>

Obed begat Jesse - The providence of God was peculiarly shown in this,
that Salmon, Boaz, and Obed, must each of them have been near a hundred
years old, at the birth of his son here recorded.

[Matthew 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 1:6</span></span>

David the king - Particularly mentioned under this character, because
his throne is given to the Messiah.

[Matthew 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 1:8</span></span>

Jehoram begat Uzziah - Jehoahaz, Joash, and Amaziah coming between. So
that he begat him mediately, as Christ is mediately the son of David and
of Abraham. So the progeny of Hezekiah, after many generations, are
called the sons that should issue from him, which he should beget, [Isa
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md).

[Matthew 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 1:11</span></span>

Josiah begat Jeconiah - Mediately, Jehoiakim coming between. And his
brethren - That is, his uncles. The Jews term all kinsmen brethren.
About the time they were carried away - Which was a little after the
birth of Jeconiah.

[Matthew 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 1:16</span></span>

The husband of Mary - Jesus was generally believed to be the son of
Joseph. It was needful for all who believed this, to know, that Joseph
was sprung from David. Otherwise they would not allow Jesus to be the
Christ. Jesus, who is called Christ - The name Jesus respects chiefly
the promise of blessing made to Abraham: the name Christ, the promise of
the Messiah's kingdom, which was made to David. It may be farther
observed, that the word Christ in Greek, and Messiah in Hebrew, signify
anointed, and imply the prophetic, priestly, and royal characters, which
were to meet in the Messiah. Among the Jews, anointing was the ceremony
whereby prophets, priests, and kings were initiated into those offices.
And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a want of Christ in all
these respects. We are by nature at a distance from God, alienated from
him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we want a mediator, an
intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly office. This regards
our state with respect to God. And with respect to ourselves, we find a
total darkness, blindness, ignorance of God, and the things of God. Now
here we want Christ in his prophetic office, to enlighten our minds, and
teach us the whole will of God. We find also within us a strange misrule
of appetites and passions. For these we want Christ in his royal
character, to reign in our hearts, and subdue all things to himself.

[Matthew 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 1:17</span></span>

So all the generations - Observe, in order to complete the three
fourteens, David ends the first fourteen, and begins the second (which
reaches to the captivity) and Jesus ends the third fourteen. When we
survey such a series of generations, it is a natural and obvious
reflection, how like the leaves of a tree one passeth away, and another
cometh! Yet the earth still abideth. And with it the goodness of the
Lord which runs from generation to generation, the common hope of
parents and children. Of those who formerly lived upon earth, and
perhaps made the most conspicuous figure, how many are there whose names
are perished with them? How many, of whom only the names are remaining?
Thus are we likewise passing away! And thus shall we shortly be
forgotten! Happy are we, if, while we are forgotten by men, we are
remembered by God! If our names, lost on earth, are at length found
written in the book of life!

[Matthew 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 1:19</span></span>

A just man - A strict observer of the law: therefore not thinking it
right to keep her.

[Matthew 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 1:21</span></span>

Jesus - That is, a Saviour. It is the same name with Joshua (who was a
type of him) which properly signifies, The Lord, Salvation. His people -
Israel. And all the Israel of God.

[Matthew 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 1:23</span></span>

They shall call his name Emmanuel - To be called, only means, according
to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really
and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title.
Thus, Unto us a child is born - and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace - That is, he shall be
all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect. And
thus was he called Emmanuel; which was no common name of Christ, but
points out his nature and office; as he is God incarnate, and dwells by
his Spirit in the hearts of his people. It is observable, the words in
Isaiah are, Thou (namely, his mother) shalt call; but here, They - that
is, all his people, shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel,
God with us. Which being interpreted - This is a clear proof that St.
Matthew wrote his Gospel in Greek, and not in Hebrew. [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 1:25</span></span>

He knew her not, till after she had brought forth - It cannot be
inferred from hence, that he knew her afterward: no more than it can be
inferred from that expression, [Sa2
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#023.md), Michal had no child till the day
of her death, that she had children afterward. Nor do the words that
follow, the first - born son, alter the case. For there are abundance of
places, wherein the term first born is used, though there were no
subsequent children. [Luk 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md).
