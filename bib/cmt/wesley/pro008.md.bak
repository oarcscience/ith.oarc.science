<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 8:1</span></span>

Wisdom - It is a great question what this wisdom is. Some understand it
of the Divine wisdom; others of the second person in the Godhead: and it
cannot be denied that some passages best agree to the former, and others
to the latter opinion. Possibly both may be joined together, and the
chapter may be understood of Christ considered partly in his personal
capacity, and partly in regard of his office, which was to impart the
mind and will of God to mankind.

paths meet, where there is a great concourse, and where travellers may
need direction.
