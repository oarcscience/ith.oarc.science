### [Matthew Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 26:1</span></span>

When Jesus had finished all these discourses - When he had spoken all he
had to speak. Till then he would not enter upon his passion: then he
would delay it no longer. [Mar 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#001.md);
[Luk 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 26:2</span></span>

After two days is the passover - The manner wherein this was celebrated
gives much light to several circumstances that follow. The master of the
family began the feast with a cup of wine, which having solemnly
blessed, he divided among the guests, [Luk
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#017.md). Then the supper began with the
unleavened bread and bitter herbs; which when they had all tasted, one
of the young persons present, according to [Exo
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#026.md), asked the reason of the
solemnity. This introduced the showing forth, or declaration of it: in
allusion to which we read of showing forth the Lord's death, [Co1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#026.md). Then the master rose up and
took another cup, before the lamb was tasted. After supper, he took a
thin loaf or cake, which he broke and divided to all at the table, and
likewise the cup, usually called the cup of thanksgiving, of which he
drank first, and then all the guests. It was this bread and this cup
which our Lord consecrated to be a standing memorial of his death.

[Matthew 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 26:3</span></span>

The chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people - (Heads
of families.) These together constituted the sanhedrim, or great
council, which had the supreme authority, both in civil and
ecclesiastical affairs.

[Matthew 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 26:5</span></span>

But they said, Not at the feast - This was the result of human wisdom.
But when Judas came they changed their purpose. So the counsel of God
took place, and the true paschal Lamb was offered up on the great day of
the paschal solemnity.

[Matthew 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 26:6</span></span>

[Mar 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#003.md).

[Matthew 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 26:8</span></span>

His disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying - It seems several of
them were angry, and spoke, though none so warmly as Judas Iscariot.

[Matthew 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 26:11</span></span>

Ye have the poor always with you - Such is the wise and gracious
providence of God, that we may have always opportunities of relieving
their wants, and so laying up for ourselves treasures in heaven.

[Matthew 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 26:12</span></span>

She hath done it for my burial - As it were for the embalming of my
body. Indeed this was not her design: but our Lord puts this
construction upon it, to confirm thereby what he had before said to his
disciples, concerning his approaching death.

[Matthew 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 26:13</span></span>

This Gospel - That is, this part of the Gospel history.

[Matthew 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 26:14</span></span>

[Mar 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#010.md); [Luk
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003.md).

[Matthew 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 26:15</span></span>

They bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver - (About three
pounds fifteen shillings sterling; or sixteen dollars sixty - seven
cents,) the price of a slave, [Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032.md).

[Matthew 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 26:17</span></span>

On the first day of unleavened bread - Being Thursday, the fourteenth
day of the first month, [Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006.md),
[Exo 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md). [Mar
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md); [Luk
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007.md)

[Matthew 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 26:18</span></span>

The Master saith, My time is at hand - That is, the time of my
suffering.

[Matthew 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 26:20</span></span>

[Mar 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#017.md); [Luk
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#014.md).

[Matthew 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 26:23</span></span>

He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish - Which it seems Judas was
doing at that very time. This dish was a vessel full of vinegar, wherein
they dipped their bitter herbs.

[Matthew 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 26:24</span></span>

The Son of man goeth through sufferings to glory, as it is written of
him - Yet this is no excuse for him that betrayeth him: miserable will
that man be: it had been good for that man if he had not been born - May
not the same be said of every man that finally perishes? But who can
reconcile this, if it were true of Judas alone, with the doctrine of
universal salvation?

[Matthew 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 26:25</span></span>

Thou hast said - That is, it is as thou hast said.

[Matthew 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 26:26</span></span>

Jesus took the bread - the bread or cake, which the master of the family
used to divide among them, after they had eaten the passover. The custom
our Lord now transferred to a nobler use. This bread is, that is,
signifies or represents my body, according to the style of the sacred
writers. Thus [Gen 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#012.md), The three
branches are three days. Thus [Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md), St. Paul speaking of Sarah and
Hagar, says, These are the two covenants. Thus in the grand type of our
Lord, [Exo 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011.md), God says of the
paschal lamb, This is the Lord's passover. Now Christ substituting the
holy communion for the passover, follows the style of the Old Testament,
and uses the same expressions the Jews were wont to use in celebrating
the passover.

[Matthew 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 26:27</span></span>

And he took the cup - Called by the Jews the cup of thanksgiving; which
the master of the family used likewise to give to each after supper.

[Matthew 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 26:28</span></span>

This is the sign of my blood, whereby the new testament or covenant is
confirmed. Which is shed for many - As many as spring from Adam.

[Matthew 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 26:29</span></span>

I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till I drink it
new with you in my Father's kingdom - That is, I shall taste no more
wine, till I drink wine of quite another kind in the glorious kingdom of
my Father. And of this you shall also partake with me.

[Matthew 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 26:30</span></span>

And when they had sung the hymn - Which was constantly sung at the close
of the passover. It consisteth of six psalms, from the 113th to the
118th. [Psa 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md) &c. The mount of
Olives - Was over against the temple, about two miles from Jerusalem.
[Mar 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#026.md); [Luk
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039.md); [Joh
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 26:31</span></span>

All ye will be offended at me - Something will happen to me, which will
occasion your falling into sin by forsaking me. [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md).

[Matthew 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 26:32</span></span>

But notwithstanding this, after I am risen I will go before you (as a
shepherd before his sheep) into Galilee. Though you forsake me, I will
not for this forsake you.

[Matthew 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 26:34</span></span>

Before cock crowing thou wilt deny me thrice - That is, before three in
the morning, the usual time of cock crowing: although one cock was heard
to crow once, after Peter's first denial of his Lord.

[Matthew 26:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 26:35</span></span>

In like manner also said all the disciples - But such was the tenderness
of our Lord, that he would not aggravate their sin by making any reply.

[Matthew 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 26:36</span></span>

Then cometh Jesus to a place called Gethsemane - That is, the valley of
fatness. The garden probably had its name from its soil and situation,
laying in some little valley between two of those many hills, the range
of which constitutes the mount of Olives. [Mar
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#032.md); [Luk
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#040.md).

[Matthew 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 26:37</span></span>

And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee - To be witnesses
of all; he began to be sorrowful and in deep anguish - Probably from
feeling the arrows of the Almighty stick fast in his soul, while God
laid on him the iniquities of us all. Who can tell what painful and
dreadful sensations were then impressed on him by the immediate hand of
God? The former word in the original properly signifies, to be
penetrated with the most exquisite sorrow; the latter to be quite
depressed, and almost overwhelmed with the load.

[Matthew 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 26:39</span></span>

And going a little farther - About a stone's cast, [Luk
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041.md)- So that the apostles could both
see and hear him still. If it be possible, let this cup pass from me -
And it did pass from him quickly. When he cried unto God with strong
cries and tears, he was heard in that which he feared. God did take away
the terror and severity of that inward conflict.

[Matthew 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 26:41</span></span>

The spirit - Your spirit: ye yourselves. The flesh - Your nature. How
gentle a rebuke was this, and how kind an apology! especially at a time
when our Lord's own mind was so weighed down with sorrow.

[Matthew 26:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 26:45</span></span>

Sleep on now, if you can, and take your rest - For any farther service
you can be of to me.

[Matthew 26:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">mat 26:47</span></span>

[Mar 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#043.md); [Luk
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047.md); [Joh
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002.md).

[Matthew 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 26:50</span></span>

The heroic behaviour of the blessed Jesus, in the whole period of his
sufferings, will be observed by every attentive eye, and felt by every
pious heart: although the sacred historians, according to their usual
but wonderful simplicity, make no encomiums upon it. With what composure
does he go forth to meet the traitor! With what calmness receive that
malignant kiss! With what dignity does he deliver himself into the hands
of his enemies! Yet plainly showing his superiority over them, and even
then leading as it were captivity captive!

[Matthew 26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 26:51</span></span>

And one of them striking the servant of the high priest - Probably the
person that seized Jesus first; Cut off his ear - Aiming, it seems, to
cleave his head, but that by a secret providence interposing, he
declined the blow. [Mar 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#047.md); [Luk
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#049.md); [Joh
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md).

[Matthew 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mat 26:52</span></span>

All they that take the sword - Without God's giving it them: without
sufficient authority.

[Matthew 26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">mat 26:53</span></span>

He will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels - The least
of whom, it is probable, could overturn the earth and destroy all the
inhabitants of it.

[Matthew 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">mat 26:55</span></span>

[Mar 14:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#048.md); [Luk
22:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#052.md)

[Matthew 26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 26:57</span></span>

They led him away to Caiaphas - From the house of Annas, the father - in
- law of Caiaphas, to whom they had carried him first. [Mar
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053.md); [Luk
22:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#054.md); [Joh
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012.md).

[Matthew 26:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">mat 26:58</span></span>

But Peter followed him afar off - Variously agitated by conflicting
passions; love constrained him to follow his Master; fear made him
follow afar off. And going in, sat with the servants - Unfit companions
as the event showed.

[Matthew 26:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">mat 26:60</span></span>

Yet found they none - On whose evidence they could condemn him to die.
At last came two false witnesses - Such they were, although part of what
they said was true; because our Lord did not speak some of those words
at all; nor any of them in this sense.

[Matthew 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">mat 26:64</span></span>

Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man - He speaks in the third person,
modestly, and yet plainly; Sitting on the right hand of power - That is,
the right hand of God: And coming upon the clouds of heaven - As he is
represented by Daniel, [Dan 7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md).
Our Lord looked very unlike that person now! But nothing could be more
awful, more majestic and becoming, than such an admonition in such
circumstances!

[Matthew 26:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mat 26:65</span></span>

Then the high priest rent his clothes - Though the high priest was
forbidden to rend his clothes (that is, his upper garment) in some cases
where others were allowed to do it, [Lev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#010.md); yet in case of blasphemy or any
public calamity, it was thought allowable. Caiaphas hereby expressed, in
the most artful manner, his horror at hearing such grievous blasphemy.

[Matthew 26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">mat 26:67</span></span>

Then - After he had declared he was the Son of God, the sanhedrim
doubtless ordered him to be carried out, while they were consulting what
to do. And then it was that the soldiers who kept him began these
insults upon him.

[Matthew 26:72](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_072">mat 26:72</span></span>

He denied with an oath - To which possibly he was not unaccustomed,
before our Lord called him.

[Matthew 26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">mat 26:73</span></span>

Surely thou art also one of them, for thy speech discovereth thee -
Malchus might have brought a stronger proof than this. But such is the
overruling providence of God, that the world, in the height of their
zeal, commonly catch hold of the very weakest of all arguments against
the children of God.

[Matthew 26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_074">mat 26:74</span></span>

Then began he to curse and to swear - Having now quite lost the reins,
the government of himself.
