Strong - Mighty in power, and undaunted in courage, if you refer it to the Assyrian or Babylonians; if to those vermin, they are, though each weak by itself, yet in those multitudes, strong and irresistible.

Dried up - The drought was so great, that the vines were withered, and all their hopes of new wine cut off. The oil - The olive - trees.
