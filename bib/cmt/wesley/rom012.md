### [Romans Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)

[Romans 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 12:1</span></span>

I exhort you - St. Paul uses to suit his exhortations to the doctrines
he has been delivering. So here the general use from the whole is
contained in [Rom 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001). The
particular uses follow, from the third verse to the end of the Epistle.
By the tender mercies of God - The whole sentiment is derived from Rom.
1-5. The expression itself is particularly opposed to "the wrath of
God," [Rom 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018). It has a reference
here to the entire gospel, to the whole economy of grace or mercy,
delivering us from "the wrath of God," and exciting us to all duty. To
present - So [Rom 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013); [Rom
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019); now actually to exhibit before
God. Your bodies - That is, yourselves; a part is put for the whole; the
rather, as in the ancient sacrifices of beasts, the body was the whole.
These also are particularly named in opposition to that vile abuse of
their bodies mentioned, [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024).
Several expressions follow, which have likewise a direct reference to
other expressions in the same chapter. A sacrifice - Dead to sin and
living - By that life which is mentioned, [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017); [Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004), &c. Holy - Such as the holy law
requires, [Rom 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012). Acceptable - [Rom
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008). Which is your reasonable service
- The worship of the heathens was utterly unreasonable, [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018), &c; so was the glorying of the
Jews, [Rom 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003), &c. But a Christian
acts in all things by the highest reason, from the mercy of God
inferring his own duty.

[Romans 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 12:2</span></span>

And be not conformed - Neither in judgment, spirit, nor behaviour. To
this world - Which, neglecting the will of God, entirely follows its
own. That ye may prove - Know by sure trial; which is easily done by him
who has thus presented himself to God. What is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of God - The will of God is here to be
understood of all the preceptive part of Christianity, which is in
itself so excellently good, so acceptable to God, and so perfective of
our natures.

[Romans 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 12:3</span></span>

And I say - He now proceeds to show what that will of God is. Through
the grace which is given to me - He modestly adds this, lest he should
seem to forget his own direction. To every one that is among you -
Believers at Rome. Happy, had they always remembered this! The measure
of faith - Treated of in the first and following chapters, from which
all other gifts and graces flow.

[Romans 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 12:5</span></span>

So we - All believers. Are one body - Closely connected together in
Christ, and consequently ought to be helpful to each other.

[Romans 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 12:6</span></span>

Having then gifts differing according to the grace which is given us -
Gifts are various: grace is one. Whether it be prophecy - This,
considered as an extraordinary gift, is that whereby heavenly mysteries
are declared to men, or things to come foretold. But it seems here to
mean the ordinary gift of expounding scripture. Let us prophesy
according to the analogy of faith - St. Peter expresses it, "as the
oracles of God;" according to the general tenor of them; according to
that grand scheme of doctrine which is delivered therein, touching
original sin, justification by faith, and present, inward salvation.
There is a wonderful analogy between all these; and a close and intimate
connexion between the chief heads of that faith "which was once
delivered to the saints." Every article therefore concerning which there
is any question should be determined by this rule; every doubtful
scripture interpreted according to the grand truths which run through
the whole.

[Romans 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 12:7</span></span>

Ministering - As deacons. He that teacheth - Catechumens; for whom
particular instructers were appointed. He that exhorteth - Whose
peculiar business it was to urge Christians to duty, and to comfort them
in trials.

[Romans 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 12:8</span></span>

He that presideth - That hath the care of a flock. He that showeth mercy
- In any instance. With cheerfulness - Rejoicing that he hath such an
opportunity.

[Romans 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 12:9</span></span>

Having spoken of faith and its fruit, [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003), &c., he comes now to love. Abhor
that which is evil; cleave to that which is good - Both inwardly and
outwardly, whatever ill - will or danger may follow.

[Romans 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 12:10</span></span>

In honour preferring one another - Which you will do, if you habitually
consider what is good in others, and what is evil in yourselves.

[Romans 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 12:11</span></span>

Whatsoever ye do, do it with your might. In every business diligently
and fervently serving the Lord - Doing all to God, not to man.

[Romans 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 12:12</span></span>

Rejoicing in hope - Of perfect holiness and everlasting happiness.
Hitherto of faith and love; now of hope also, see the fifth and eighth
chapters; afterwards of duties toward others; saints, [Rom
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013) persecutors, [Rom
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#014) friends, strangers, enemies,
[Rom 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015), &c.

[Romans 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 12:13</span></span>

Communicate to the necessities of the saints - Relieve all Christians
that are in want. It is remarkable, that the apostle, treating expressly
of the duties flowing from the communion of saints, yet never says one
word about the dead. Pursue hospitality - Not only embracing those that
offer, but seeking opportunities to exercise it.

[Romans 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 12:14</span></span>

Curse not - No, not in your heart.

[Romans 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 12:15</span></span>

Rejoice - The direct opposite to weeping is laughter; but this does not
so well suit a Christian.

[Romans 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 12:16</span></span>

Mind not high things - Desire not riches, honour, or the company of the
great.

[Romans 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 12:17</span></span>

Provide - Think beforehand; contrive to give as little offence as may be
to any.

[Romans 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 12:19</span></span>

Dearly beloved - So he softens the rugged spirit. Revenge not
yourselves, but leave that to God. Perhaps it might more properly be
rendered, leave room for wrath; that is, the wrath of God, to whom
vengeance properly belongs. [Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035)

[Romans 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 12:20</span></span>

Feed him - With your own hand: if it be needful, even put bread into his
mouth. Heap coals of fire upon his head - That part which is most
sensible.

"So artists melt the sullen ore of lead, By heaping coals of fire upon
its head; In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow, And pure from
dross the silver runs below." [Pro
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021), &c.

[Romans 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 12:21</span></span>

And if you see no present fruit, yet persevere. Be not overcome with
evil - As all are who avenge themselves. But overcome evil with good.
Conquer your enemies by kindness and patience.
