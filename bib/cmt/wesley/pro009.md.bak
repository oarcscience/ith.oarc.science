<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 9:1</span></span>

Her house - For the reception of her guests. Seven - Many pillars;
whereby is intimated the beauty and stability of the church. Pillars -
Prophets, and apostles, and ministers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 9:3</span></span>

Maidens - Her servants to invite the guests, ministers of the word whom
he calls maidens for the decency of the parable; for wisdom being
compared to a great princess, was fit to be attended upon by maidens.
Highest places - From such high seats as those from which judges
delivered their sentences, and officers made proclamations.

[Proverbs 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#004.md)

A former - He shews whom he meant by the foolish, [Pro
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#006.md), even scorners and wicked men, and
presses his last advice of forsaking them because there was no good, but
hurt to be got from them.

[Proverbs 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 9:8</span></span>

[Proverbs 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#012.md)

For thyself - Thou dost not profit me but thyself.

[Proverbs 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#014.md)

Sweet - From the difficulty of obtaining them; and because the very
prohibition renders them more grateful to corrupt nature.
