### [Matthew Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 27:1</span></span>

In the morning - As the sanhedrim used to meet in one of the courts of
the temple, which was never opened in the night, they were forced to
stay till the morning before they could proceed regularly, in the
resolution they had taken to put him to death. [Mar
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001.md); [Luk
22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066.md); [Luk
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001.md); [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028.md).

[Matthew 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 27:2</span></span>

Having bound him - They had bound him when he was first apprehended. But
they did it now afresh, to secure him from any danger of an escape, as
he passed through the streets of Jerusalem.

[Matthew 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 27:3</span></span>

Then Judas seeing that he was condemned - Which probably he thought
Christ would have prevented by a miracle.

[Matthew 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 27:4</span></span>

They said, what is that to us? - How easily could they digest innocent
blood! And yet they had a conscience! It is not lawful (say they) to put
it into the treasury - But very lawful to slay the innocent!

[Matthew 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 27:5</span></span>

In that part of the temple where the sanhedrim met.

[Matthew 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 27:7</span></span>

They bought with them the potter's field - Well known, it seems, by that
name. This was a small price for a field so near Jerusalem. But the
earth had probably been digged for potters' vessels, so that it was now
neither fit for tillage nor pasture, and consequently of small value.
Foreigners - Heathens especially, of whom there were then great numbers
in Jerusalem.

[Matthew 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 27:9</span></span>

Then was fulfilled - What was figuratively represented of old, was now
really accomplished. What was spoken by the prophet - The word Jeremy,
which was added to the text in latter copies, and thence received into
many translations, is evidently a mistake: for he who spoke what St.
Matthew here cites (or rather paraphrases) was not Jeremy, but
Zechariah. [Zac 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012.md).

[Matthew 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 27:10</span></span>

As the Lord commanded me - To write, to record.

[Matthew 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 27:11</span></span>

Art thou the king of the Jews? - Jesus before Caiaphas avows himself to
be the Christ, before Pilate to be a king; clearly showing thereby, that
his answering no more, was not owing to any fear.

[Matthew 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 27:15</span></span>

At every feast - Every year, at the feast of the passover. [Mar
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#006.md); [Luk
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#017.md); [Joh
18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039.md).

[Matthew 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 27:18</span></span>

He knew that for envy they had delivered him - As well as from malice
and revenge; they envied him, because the people magnified him.

[Matthew 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 27:22</span></span>

They all say, Let him be crucified - The punishment which Barabbas had
deserved: and this probably made them think of it. But in their malice
they forgot with how dangerous a precedent they furnished the Roman
governor. And indeed within the compass of a few years it turned
dreadfully upon themselves.

[Matthew 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 27:24</span></span>

Then Pilate took water and washed his hands - This was a custom
frequently used among the heathens as well as among the Jews, in token
of innocency.

[Matthew 27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 27:25</span></span>

His blood be on us and on our children - As this imprecation was dread.
fully answered in the ruin so quickly brought on the Jewish nation, and
the calamities which have ever since pursued that wretched people, so it
was peculiarly fulfilled by Titus the Roman general, on the Jews whom he
took during the siege of Jerusalem. So many, after having been scourged
in a terrible manner, were crucified all round the city, that in a while
there was not room near the wall for the crosses to stand by each other.
Probably this befell some of those who now joined in this cry, as it
certainly did many of their children: the very finger of God thus
pointing out their crime in crucifying his Son.

[Matthew 27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 27:26</span></span>

He delivered him to be crucified - The person crucified was nailed to
the cross as it lay on the ground, through each hand extended to the
utmost stretch, and through both the feet together. Then the cross was
raised up, and the foot of it thrust with a violent shock into a hole in
the ground prepared for it. This shock disjointed the body, whose whole
weight hung upon the nails, till the persons expired through mere dint
of pain. This kind of death was used only by the Romans, and by them
inflicted only on slaves and the vilest criminals.

[Matthew 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 27:27</span></span>

The whole troop - or cohort. This was a body of foot commanded by the
governor, which was appointed to prevent disorders and tumults,
especially on solemn occasions. [Mar
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#016.md); [Joh
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#002.md).

[Matthew 27:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 27:28</span></span>

They put on him a scarlet robe - Such as kings and generals wore;
probably an old tattered one.

[Matthew 27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 27:32</span></span>

Him they compelled to bear his cross - He bore it himself, till he sunk
under it, [Joh 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md).

[Matthew 27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 27:33</span></span>

A place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull - Golgotha in
Syriacts signifies a skull or head: it was probably called so from this
time; being an eminence upon Mount Calvary, not far from the king's
gardens. [Mar 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#022.md); [Luk
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033.md); [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md)

[Matthew 27:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 27:34</span></span>

They gave him vinegar mingled with gall - Out of derision: which,
however nauseous, he received and tasted of. St. Mark mentions also a
different mixture which was given him, Wine mingled with myrrh: such as
it was customary to give to dying criminals, to make them less sensible
of their sufferings: but this our Lord refused to taste, determining to
bear the full force of his pains.

[Matthew 27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 27:35</span></span>

They parted his garments - This was the custom of the Romans. The
soldiers performed the office of executioners, and divided among them
the spoils of the criminals. My vesture - That is, my inner garment.
[Psa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018.md).

[Matthew 27:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 27:38</span></span>

[Mar 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#027.md); [Luk
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#032.md).

[Matthew 27:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 27:44</span></span>

[Mar 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#032.md); [Luk
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#033.md).

[Matthew 27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 27:45</span></span>

From the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the earth unto the
ninth hour - Insomuch, that even a heathen philosopher seeing it, and
knowing it could not be a natural eclipse, because it was at the time of
the full moon, and continued three hours together, cried out, "Either
the God of nature suffers, or the frame of the world is dissolved." By
this darkness God testified his abhorrence of the wickedness which was
then committing. It likewise intimated Christ's sore conflicts with the
Divine justice, and with all the powers of darkness.

[Matthew 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 27:46</span></span>

About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice - Our Lord's great
agony probably continued these three whole hours, at the conclusion of
which be thus cried out, while he suffered from God himself what was
unutterable. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? - Our Lord
hereby at once expresses his trust in God, and a most distressing sense
of his letting loose the powers of darkness upon him, withdrawing the
comfortable discoveries of his presence, and filling his soul with a
terrible sense of the wrath due to the sins which he was bearing. [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 27:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 27:48</span></span>

One taking a sponge, filled it with vinegar - Vinegar and water was the
usual drink of the Roman soldiers. It does not appear, that this was
given him in derision, but rather with a friendly design, that he might
not die before Elijah came. [Joh
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028.md).

[Matthew 27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">mat 27:50</span></span>

After he had cried with a loud voice - To show that his life was still
whole in him. He dismissed his spirit - So the original expression may
be literally translated: an expression admirably suited to our Lord's
words, [Joh 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018.md) No man taketh my
life from me, but I lay it down of myself. He died by a voluntary act of
his own, and in a way peculiar to himself. He alone of all men that ever
were, could have continued alive even in the greatest tortures, as long
as he pleased, or have retired from the body whenever he had thought
fit. And how does it illustrate that love which he manifested in his
death? Insomuch as he did not use his power to quit his body, as soon as
it was fastened to the cross, leaving only an insensible corpse, to the
cruelty of his murderers: but continued his abode in it, with a steady
resolution, as long as it was proper. He then retired from it, with a
majesty and dignity never known or to be known in any other death:
dying, if one may so express it, like the Prince of life.

[Matthew 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">mat 27:51</span></span>

Immediately upon his death, while the sun was still darkened, the veil
of the temple, which separated the holy of holies from the court of the
priests, though made of the richest and strongest tapestry, was rent in
two from the top to the bottom: so that while the priest was ministering
at the golden altar (it being the time of the sacrifice) the sacred
oracle, by an invisible power was laid open to full view: God thereby
signifying the speedy removal of the veil of the Jewish ceremonies the
casting down the partition wall, so that the Jews and Gentiles were now
admitted to equal privileges, and the opening a way through the veil of
his flesh for all believers into the most holy place. And the earth was
shaken - There was a general earthquake through the whole globe, though
chiefly near Jerusalem: God testifying thereby his wrath against the
Jewish nation, for the horrid impiety they were committing.

[Matthew 27:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">mat 27:52</span></span>

Some of the tombs were shattered and laid open by the earthquake, and
while they continued unclosed (and they must have stood open all the
Sabbath, seeing the law would not allow any attempt to close them) many
bodies of holy men were raised, (perhaps Simeon, Zacharias, John the
Baptist, and others who had believed in Christ, and were known to many
in Jerusalem,) And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, went
into the holy city (Jerusalem) and appeared to many - Who had probably
known them before: God hereby signifying, that Christ had conquered
death, and would raise all his saints in due season.

[Matthew 27:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">mat 27:54</span></span>

The centurion - The officer who commanded the guard; and they that were
with him feared, saying, Truly this was the Son of God - Referring to
the words of the chief priests and scribes, [Mat
27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043.md) He said, I am the Son of God.

[Matthew 27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">mat 27:56</span></span>

James - The less: he was so called, to distinguish him from the other
James, the brother of John; probably because he was less in stature.

[Matthew 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">mat 27:57</span></span>

When the evening was come - That is, after three o'clock; the time from
three to six they termed the evening. [Mar
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#042.md); [Luk
23:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050.md); [Joh
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038.md).

[Matthew 27:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">mat 27:62</span></span>

On the morrow, the day that followed the day of the preparation - The
day of preparation was the day before the Sabbath, whereon they were to
prepare for the celebration of it. The next day then was the Sabbath
according to the Jews. But the evangelist seems to express it by this
circumlocution, to show the Jewish Sabbath was then abolished.

[Matthew 27:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">mat 27:63</span></span>

That impostor said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise
again - We do not find that he had ever said this to them, unless when
he spoke of the temple of his body, [Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md), [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md). And if they here refer to what
he then said, how perverse and iniquitous was their construction on
these words, when he was on his trial before the council? [Mat
26:61](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#061.md). Then they seemed not to
understand them!

[Matthew 27:65](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">mat 27:65</span></span>

Ye have a guard - Of your own, in the tower of Antonia, which was
stationed there for the service of the temple.

[Matthew 27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">mat 27:66</span></span>

They went and secured the sepulchre, sealing the stone, and setting a
guard - They set Pilate's signet, or the public seal of the sanhedrim
upon a fastening which they had put on the stone. And all this uncommon
caution was overruled by the providence of God, to give the strongest
proofs of Christ's ensuing resurrection; since there could be no room
for the least suspicion of deceit, when it should be found, that his
body was raised out of a new tomb, where there was no other corpse, and
this tomb hewn out of a rock, the mouth of which was secured by a great
stone, under a seal, and a guard of soldiers.
