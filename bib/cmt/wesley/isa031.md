<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 31:2</span></span>

He is safe - You think you are safe, in engaging the Egyptians; but God
is not inferior to them in wisdom or strength, and therefore you have

The helpers, as it is explained in the next verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 31:8</span></span>

melt away, a great part of them being destroyed by the angel; and the
hearts of the rest melting for fear.

[Isaiah 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 31:9</span></span>

He - Sennacherib shall flee away, from Jerusalem, to his strong city of
Nineveh. The ensign - Of the Lord's ensign, which he hath lifted up
against them. Whose fire - Who is, and will appear to be in Zion, like a
fire to defend his people, and to consume their enemies.
