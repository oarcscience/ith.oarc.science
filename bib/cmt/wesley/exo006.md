### [Exodus Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 6:1</span></span>

With a strong hand - That is, being forced to it by a strong hand, he
shall let them go.

[Exodus 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 6:2</span></span>

l am Jehovah - The same with I am that I am, the fountain of being and
blessedness, and infinite perfection. The patriarchs knew this name, but
they did not know him in this matter by that which this name signifies.
God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, A God performing
what he had promised, and so giving being to his promises. A God
perfecting what he had begun, and finishing his own work. In the history
of the creation God is never called Jehovah, till the heavens and the
earth were finished, [Gen 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#004.md). When
the salvation of the saints is compleated in eternal life, then he will
be known by his name Jehovah, [Rev
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013.md), in the mean time they shall
find him for their strength and support, El - shaddai, a God All -
sufficient, a God that is enough.

[Exodus 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 6:5</span></span>

I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel - He means their
groaning on occasion of the late hardships put upon them. God takes
notice of the increase of his people's calamities, and observes how
their enemies grow upon them.

[Exodus 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 6:6</span></span>

I will bring you out: I will rid you: I will redeem you: I will bring
you into the land of Canaan; and, I will give it you - Let man take the
shame of his unbelief which needs such repetitions, and let God have the
glory of his condescending grace which gives us such repeated
assurances. With a stretched out arm - With almighty power: A metaphor
taken from a man that stretches out his arm, to put forth all his
strength.

[Exodus 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 6:7</span></span>

I will take you to me for a people - A peculiar people, and I will be to
you a God - And more than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make
us happy.

[Exodus 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 6:8</span></span>

I am the Lord - And therefore have power to dispose of lands and
kingdoms as I please.

[Exodus 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 6:9</span></span>

But they hearkened not to Moses for anguish of spirit - That is, They
were so taken up with their troubles that they did not heed him.

[Exodus 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 6:11</span></span>

That he let the children of Israel go - God repeats his precepts, before
he begins his punishments. Those that have oft been called in vain to
leave their sins, yet must be called again, and again.

[Exodus 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 6:12</span></span>

Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; they gave no
heed to what I have said, how then shall Pharaoh hear me? - If the
anguish of their spirit makes them deaf to that which would compose and
comfort them, much more will his pride and insolence, make him deaf to
that which will but exasperate him. Who am of uncircumcised lips - He
was conscious to himself that he had not the gift of utterance.

[Exodus 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 6:13</span></span>

The Lord gave them a charge, both to the children of Israel, and to
Pharaoh - God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections, and
binds us to obedience without murmuring or disputing.

[Exodus 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 6:14</span></span>

This genealogy ends in those two great patriots, Moses and Aaron; and
comes in here to shew that they were Israelites, bone of their bone, and
flesh of their flesh, whom they were sent to deliver, raised up unto
them of their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the
prophet and priest, the Redeemer and law - giver of the house of Israel,
and whose genealogy also like this was to be carefully preserved. The
heads of the houses of three of the tribes are here named, agreeing with
the accounts we had, Gen. 46:8-27. Reuben and Simeon seem to be
mentioned only for the sake of Levi, from whom Moses and Aaron
descended, and all the priests of the Jewish church.

[Exodus 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 6:16</span></span>

The age of Levi, Kohath, and Amram, the father, grandfather, and great
grandfather of Moses is here recorded; and they all lived to a great
age, Levi to one hundred thirty seven, Kohath to one hundred thirty
three, and Amram to one hundred thirty seven: Moses himself came much
short of them, and fixed seventy or eighty for the ordinary stretch of
human life. [Psa 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010.md). For now Israel
was multiplied, and become a great nation, and divine revelation was by
the hand of Moses committed to writing, and no longer trusted to
tradition; the two great reasons for the long lives of the patriarchs
were ceased, and therefore from henceforward fewer years must serve men.

[Exodus 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 6:20</span></span>

His father's sister - That is, kins - woman. So the Hebrew word is
frequently used.

[Exodus 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 6:23</span></span>

Aminadab - A prince of the tribe of Judah. The Levites might marry into
any tribe, there being no danger of confusion or loss of inheritance
thereby.

[Exodus 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 6:26</span></span>

According to their armies - Like numerous armies, in military order, and
with great power. In the close of the chapter, he returns to his
narrative, from which he had broken off somewhat abruptly [Exo
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#013.md), and repeats, the charge God had
given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh, [Exo
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#029.md).

[Exodus 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 6:29</span></span>

Speak all that I say unto thee - As a faithful ambassador. Those that go
on God's errand must not shun to declare the whole counsel of God.
