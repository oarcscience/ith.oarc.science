### [John Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

[John 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 6:1</span></span>

After these things - The history of between ten and eleven months is to
be supplied here from the other evangelists. [Mat
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md); [Mar
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032.md); [Luk
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010.md).

[John 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 6:3</span></span>

Jesus went up - Before the people overtook him.

[John 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 6:5</span></span>

Jesus saith to Philip - Perhaps he had the care of providing victuals
for the family of the apostles.

[John 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 6:15</span></span>

He retired to the mountain alone - Having ordered his disciples to cross
over the lake.

[John 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 6:16</span></span>

[Mat 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md); [Mar
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#045.md).

[John 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 6:22</span></span>

Who had stood on the other side - They were forced to stay a while,
because there were then no other vessels; and they stayed the less
unwillingly, because they saw that Jesus was not embarked.

[John 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 6:26</span></span>

Our Lord does not satisfy their curiosity, but corrects the wrong motive
they had in seeking him: because ye did eat - Merely for temporal
advantage. Hitherto Christ had been gathering hearers: he now begins to
try their sincerity, by a figurative discourse concerning his passion,
and the fruit of it, to be received by faith.

[John 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 6:27</span></span>

Labour not for the meat which perisheth - For bodily food: not for that
only not chiefly: not at all, but in subordination to grace, faith,
love, the meat which endureth to everlasting life. Labour, work for
this; for everlasting life. So our Lord expressly commands, work for
life, as well as from life: from a principle of faith and love. Him hath
the Father sealed - By this very miracle, as well as by his whole
testimony concerning him. See [Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md). Sealing is a mark of the
authenticity of a writing.

[John 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 6:28</span></span>

The works of God - Works pleasing to God.

[John 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 6:29</span></span>

This is the work of God - The work most pleasing to God, and the
foundation of all others: that ye believe - He expresses it first
properly, afterward figuratively.

[John 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 6:30</span></span>

What sign dost thou? - Amazing, after what they had just seen!

[John 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 6:31</span></span>

Our fathers ate manna - This sign Moses gave them. He gave them bread
from heaven - From the lower sublunary heaven; to which Jesus opposes
the highest heaven: in which sense he says seven times, [Joh
6:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md), [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md), [Joh
6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md), [Joh
6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md), [Joh
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md), that he himself came down from
heaven.

[John 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 6:32</span></span>

Moses gave you not bread from heaven - It was not Moses who gave the
manna to your fathers; but my Father who now giveth the true bread from
heaven. [Psa 78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024.md).

[John 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 6:33</span></span>

He that - giveth life to the world - Not (like the manna) to one people
only: and that from generation to generation. Our Lord does not yet say,
I am that bread; else the Jews would not have given him so respectful an
answer, [Joh 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034.md).

[John 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 6:34</span></span>

Give us this bread - Meaning it still, in a literal sense: yet they seem
now to be not far from believing.

[John 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 6:35</span></span>

I am the bread of life - Having and giving life: he that cometh - he
that believeth - Equivalent expressions: shall never hunger, thirst -
Shall be satisfied, happy, for ever.

[John 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 6:36</span></span>

I have told you - Namely, [Joh 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md).

[John 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 6:37</span></span>

All that the Father giveth me - All that feel themselves lost, and
follow the drawings of the Father, he in a peculiar manner giveth to the
Son: will come to me - By faith. And him that thus cometh to me, I will
in nowise cast out - I will give him pardon, holiness, and heaven, if he
endure to the end - to rejoice in his light.

[John 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 6:39</span></span>

Of all which he hath already given me - See [Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md), [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md). If they endure to the end. But
Judas did not.

[John 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 6:40</span></span>

Here is the sum of [Joh 6:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md). This
is the will of him that sent me - This is the whole of what I have said:
this is the eternal, unchangeable will of God. Every one who truly
believeth, shall have everlasting life. Every one that seeth and
believeth - The Jews saw, and yet believed not. And I will raise him up
- As this is the will of him that sent me, I will perform it
effectually.

[John 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 6:44</span></span>

Christ having checked their murmuring, continues what he was saying,
[Joh 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#040.md). No man comes to me, unless
my Father draw him - No man can believe in Christ, unless God give him
power: he draws us first, by good desires. Not by compulsion, not by
laying the will under any necessity; but by the strong and sweet, yet
still resistible, motions of his heavenly grace.

[John 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 6:45</span></span>

Every man that hath heard - The secret voice of God, he, and he only
believeth. [Isa 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md).

[John 6:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 6:46</span></span>

Not that any one - Must expect him to appear in a visible shape. He who
is from or with God - In a more eminent manner than any creature.

[John 6:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 6:50</span></span>

Not die - Not spiritually; not eternally.

[John 6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 6:51</span></span>

If any eat of this bread - That is, believe in me: he shall live for
ever - In other words, he that believeth to the end shall be saved. My
flesh which I will give you - This whole discourse concerning his flesh
and blood refers directly to his passion, and but remotely, if at all,
to the Lord's Supper.

[John 6:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 6:52</span></span>

Observe the degrees: the Jews are tried here; the disciples, [Joh
6:60-66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md), the apostles, [Joh
6:67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md).

[John 6:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 6:53</span></span>

Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man - Spiritually: unless ye draw
continual virtue from him by faith. Eating his flesh is only another
expression for believing.

[John 6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">joh 6:55</span></span>

Meat - drink indeed - With which the soul of a believer is as truly fed,
as his body with meat and drink.

[John 6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">joh 6:57</span></span>

I live by the Father - Being one with him. He shall live by me - Being
one with me. Amazing union!

[John 6:58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">joh 6:58</span></span>

This is - That is, I am the bread - Which is not like the manna your
fathers ate, who died notwithstanding.

[John 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">joh 6:60</span></span>

This is a hard saying - Hard to the children of the world, but sweet to
the children of God. Scarce ever did our Lord speak more sublimely, even
to the apostles in private. Who can hear - Endure it?

[John 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">joh 6:62</span></span>

What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before? - How
much more incredible will it then appear to you, that he should give you
his flesh to eat?

[John 6:63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">joh 6:63</span></span>

It is the Spirit - The spiritual meaning of these words, by which God
giveth life. The flesh - The bare, carnal, literal meaning, profiteth
nothing. The words which I have spoken, they are spirit - Are to be
taken in a spiritual sense and, when they are so understood, they are
life - That is, a means of spiritual life to the hearers.

[John 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">joh 6:64</span></span>

But there are some of you who believe not - And so receive no life by
them, because you take them in a gross literal sense. For Jesus knew
from the beginning - Of his ministry: who would betray him - Therefore
it is plain, God does foresee future contingencies: "But his
foreknowledge causes not the fault, Which had no less proved certain
unforeknown."

[John 6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">joh 6:65</span></span>

Unless it be given - And it is given to those only who will receive it
on God's own terms.

[John 6:66](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">joh 6:66</span></span>

From this time many of his disciples went back - So our Lord now began
to purge his floor: the proud and careless were driven away, and those
remained who were meet for the Master's use.

[John 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">joh 6:68</span></span>

Thou hast the words of eternal life - Thou, and thou alone, speakest the
words which show the way to life everlasting.

[John 6:69](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">joh 6:69</span></span>

And we - Who have been with thee from the beginning, whatever others do,
have known - Are absolutely assured, that thou art the Christ.

[John 6:70](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">joh 6:70</span></span>

Jesus answered the - And yet even ye have not all acted suitable to this
knowledge. Have I not chosen or elected you twelve? - But they might
fall even from that election. Yet one of you - On this gracious warning,
Judas ought to have repented; is a devil - Is now influenced by one.
