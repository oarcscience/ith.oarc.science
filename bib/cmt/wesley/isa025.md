[Isaiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 25:1</span></span>

O Lord - The prophet reflecting upon those great and glorious prophecies
which he had delivered, interrupts the course of his prophecies, and
breaks forth into a solemn celebration of God's wonderful works. Thy
counsels - From which all thy works proceed, and which thou hast from
time to time revealed to thy prophets and people, which were of old,
being conceived from all eternity, are true and firm, and shall
certainly be accomplished.

[Isaiah 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 25:2</span></span>

A city - Which is put for cities: or of enemies of God and his people.
And under the name cities he comprehends their countries and kingdoms.
Strangers - The royal cities, in which were the palaces of strangers, of
Gentiles. No city - Their cities and palaces have been or shall be
utterly and irrecoverably destroyed.

[Isaiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 25:3</span></span>

Shall fear - Thy stoutest enemies observing thy wonderful works, shall
be converted, or at least forced to tremble before thee.

[Isaiah 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 25:4</span></span>

For - For thou hast defended thy poor and helpless people. As a storm -
Makes a great noise, but without any effect.

[Isaiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 25:5</span></span>

The noise - The tumultuous noise, as the word properly signifies; the
rage and furious attempts of those Heathen nations that fought against
God's people. As the heat - With as much ease as thou dost allay the
heat of a dry place, by the shadow of thy clouds, or by the rain which
falls from black and shadowy clouds. The branch - The arm or power, as a
branch is the arm of a tree.

[Isaiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006)

And - In mount Zion, in God's church. All people - Both Jews and
Gentiles. A feast - A feast made up of the most delicate provisions,
which is manifestly meant of the ordinances, graces, and comforts given
by God in his church. Of wines - Which have continued upon the lees a
competent time, whereby they gain strength, and are afterwards drawn
off, and refined.

[Isaiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 25:7</span></span>

The face - The covering of the face. The veil - The ignorance of God,
and of the true religion, which then was upon the Gentiles, and now is
upon the Jews.

[Isaiah 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008)

He - Christ will by his death destroy the power of death, take away the
sting of the first death, and prevent the second. In victory - Heb. unto
victory; so as to overcome it perfectly; which complete victory Christ
hath already purchased for, and will in due time actually confer upon
his people. Rebuke - The reproach and contempt cast upon his faithful
people by the ungodly world.

[Isaiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009)
