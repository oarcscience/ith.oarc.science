### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

And - He that sat upon the throne, Jesus Christ. Son of man - A phrase
which is ninety - five times, at least, used in this prophecy to keep
him humble who had such great revelations. Stand - Arise, fear not. And
with this command God sent forth a power enabling him to rise and stand.

[Ezekiel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 2:2</span></span>

The spirit - The same spirit which actuated the living creatures.

[Ezekiel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 2:5</span></span>

Shall know - They that obey shall know by the good I will do them, those
that will not, by the evil which I will bring upon them.

[Ezekiel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 2:6</span></span>

Words - Accusations, threats, or whatever else a malicious heart can
suggest to the tongue. Briars - Which usually run up among thorns, are a
very fit emblem of the frowardness and keenness of sinners against God
and his prophet. Scorpious - Malicious, revengeful men. They that will
do any thing to purpose in the service of God, must not fear the faces
of men.

[Ezekiel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 2:8</span></span>

Hear - Obey. Open - This was done only in a vision.

[Ezekiel 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 2:9</span></span>

Roll - Their books were not like ours, but written in parchment and in
the length of it, and so one piece fastened to another, 'till the whole
would contain what was to be written, and then it was wrapped or rolled
about a round piece of wood, fashioned for that purpose.

[Ezekiel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 2:10</span></span>

And - The person, who held out his hand. Spread - Unrolled it. Within
&c. - On both sides, on that side which was inward when rolled, and on
that side also that was outward.
