The lips - It concerns thee to get and to use discretion, that thou
mayest be able to resist those temptations to which thou art exposed.

[Proverbs 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 5:4</span></span>

But - The effect of that to which she entices men, is destruction.

[Proverbs 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005.md)

Feet - Her manner of life.

[Proverbs 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 5:6</span></span>

Lest - To prevent thy serious consideration. Moveable - She transforms
herself into several shapes, and has a thousand arts to ensnare. Know -
Thou canst not discover all her practice.

[Proverbs 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 5:9</span></span>

Honour - Thy dignity and reputation, the strength of thy body and mind.
Years - The flower of thine age. The cruel - To the harlot, who though
she pretends love, yet in truth is one of the most cruel creatures in
the world, wasting thy estate and body without pity, and damming thy
soul for ever.

[Proverbs 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 5:10</span></span>

Strangers - Not only the strange women themselves, but others who are in
league with them. Labors - Wealth gotten by thy labours.

[Proverbs 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 5:14</span></span>

A moment - In how little a time am I now come into remediless misery!
Assembly - And that in the congregation of Israel, where I was taught
better things.

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

Drink - Content thyself with those delights which God alloweth thee in
the sober use of the marriage - bed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 5:16</span></span>

Fountains - Thy children proceeding from thy wife and from thyself.
Fountains are here put for rivers flowing from them. Dispersed - They
shall in due time appear abroad to thy comfort, and for the good of
others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 5:19</span></span>

Satisfy thee - At all convenient times: for that there may be excess in
the marriage - bed is manifest. Ravished - Love her fervently. It is an
hyperbolical expression.

eternal salvation.
