### [Jeremiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 30:8</span></span>

In that day - In the day when God should deliver the seed of Jacob out
of trouble. His yoke - The yoke of the king of Babylon, that power of
his, which for seventy years he exercised over the Jews. Of him - Of the
Jews.

[Jeremiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 30:9</span></span>

But - Either this must be understood of the kingdom of Christ, under
which the Jews that received him were made spiritually free: or there is
a time yet to come, when this ancient people of God shall be restored to
a farther civil liberty than they have enjoyed ever since the captivity
of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 30:11</span></span>

In measure - Not in equity only, but with moderation. Unpunished - But
yet God will not let his own people go unpunished, that by it they may
be reclaimed, and the world may take notice that God is of purer eyes
than that he can, in any persons, behold iniquity.

[Jeremiah 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 30:12</span></span>

For - They had sinned to that degree that God had resolved they should
go into captivity.

[Jeremiah 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 30:13</span></span>

No medicine - The prophet's design was to convince them, that there was
no present remedy, but patience, though their false prophets might
promise a cure.

[Jeremiah 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 30:14</span></span>

Thy lovers - The Egyptians and Assyrians.

[Jeremiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 30:23</span></span>

A continuing - Not a sudden blast, that shall presently go over, but a
vengeance that shall abide.

[Jeremiah 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 30:24</span></span>

Consider - And though at present they will not consider, yet afterward,
when they see things come to pass, then they shall consider what I have
told them.
