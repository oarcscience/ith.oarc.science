glorious deliverance. He - God. Went - As a captain at the head of his
people. Egypt - To execute his judgments upon that land. I - My
progenitors, for all the successive generations of Israel make one body,
and are sometimes spoken of as one person. A language - The Egyptian
language, which at first was unknown to the Israelites, [Gen
42:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#013.md), and probably continued so for
some considerable time, because they were much separated both in place
and conversation from the Egyptians.
