### [Jeremiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 51:5</span></span>

Forsaken - Not utterly forsaken.

[Jeremiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 51:6</span></span>

Soul - By soul is meant life, and by iniquity the punishment of the
Babylonian's iniquity.

[Jeremiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 51:7</span></span>

Drunken - She had made all the nations about her drunken with the Lord's
fury. Mad - Through the misery they felt from her.

[Jeremiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 51:9</span></span>

We - The prophet seems to personate the mercenary soldiers, saying, they
would have helped Babylon, but there was no healing for her.

[Jeremiah 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 51:10</span></span>

Some - These words are spoken in the person of the Jews, owning the
destruction of Babylon to be the mighty work of God, and an act of
justice, revenging the wrongs of his people.

[Jeremiah 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 51:12</span></span>

Set up - These seem to be the prophet's words to the Babylonians,
rousing them out of their security. Historians tell us that the city was
fortified by walls of fifty cubits high, and two hundred cubits broad,
and by a very deep and large ditch.

[Jeremiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 51:13</span></span>

Waters - Babylon is said to dwell upon many waters, because the great
river Euphrates, did not only run by it, but almost encompass it
branching itself into many smaller rivers, which made several parts of
the city, islands.

[Jeremiah 51:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 51:23</span></span>

Break in pieces - The sense of all these three verses is the same; that
God had made use, and was still making use of the Babylonians to destroy
many nations, to spoil much people, wasting their goods, routing their
armies, killing all sorts of their inhabitants.

[Jeremiah 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 51:25</span></span>

Mountain - Babylon was very high for its power, and greatness, and had
very high walls and towers, that it looked at a distance like an high
rocky mountain. They had destroyed many people. Burnt - Thy cities and
towers which appear like a mountain shall be burnt.

[Jeremiah 51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 51:27</span></span>

As caterpillars - The Median horses are compared to their insects,
either with respect to their numbers, or in regard of the terror caused
by them when they came, being a great plague to the places which they
infected.

[Jeremiah 51:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 51:29</span></span>

The land - Babylon, or the land of Chaldea.

[Jeremiah 51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 51:31</span></span>

At one end - Cyrus entered the city at one end, by the channel of the
river, which he had drained, and surprized Belshazzar in the midst of
his feast.

[Jeremiah 51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 51:32</span></span>

The passages - The passages over the river Euphrates, and all the other
passages by which the Babylonians might make their escape, were guarded
with soldiers. Reeds - On the border of the river Euphrates were vast
quantities of great and tall reeds, which with the mud in which they
stood, were as another wall to the city; but the Medes had burnt them so
as the way was open.

[Jeremiah 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 51:33</span></span>

Threshing floor - Babylon had been a threshing instrument, by which, and
a threshing - floor in which God had threshed many other nations; God
now intended to make it as a threshing - floor wherein he would thresh
the Chaldeans. Tread her - So they used to prepare their threshing -
floors against the time of harvest. The time - The harvest which the
justice of God would have from the ruin of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 51:34</span></span>

Me - The prophet speaks this in the name of the Jews. Cast me out - As
beasts of prey eat what they please of other beasts they have preyed
upon, and leave the rest in the field.

[Jeremiah 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 51:36</span></span>

Dry up - Alluding to what Cyrus did.

They - The Babylonians, upon the taking of their city.

[Jeremiah 51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 51:39</span></span>

Heat - When they shall grow hot with wine, I will make them a feast of
another nature. Interpreters judge that Belshazzar, [Dan
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001.md), made a feast to a thousand of his
Lords, when he and his wives, and concubines, drank wine in the vessels
belonging to the temple, during which feast the city was taken. And not
awake - While they were merry with their wine, they fell into a sleep
which they never awoke out of.

[Jeremiah 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041.md)

The sea - A multitude of enemies.

[Jeremiah 51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 51:44</span></span>

Bel - Bel was the principal Babylonian idol. Bring forth - All the
vessels of the temple, [Ch2 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007.md), and
whatever gifts the Babylonians had presented to him. The wall - And the
city of Babylon shall be also ruined.

[Jeremiah 51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">jer 51:45</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">jer 51:48</span></span>

Then - All the creatures in heaven and earth shall rejoice at the
vengeance which God shall take upon Babylon.

[Jeremiah 51:49](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">jer 51:49</span></span>

Of all the earth - This term must be understood in a restrained sense;
the Chaldeans coming up from all parts of Chaldea to help Babylon, were
slain there, as by the means of Babylon the Israelites were slain that
came from all parts of Judea to help Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">jer 51:50</span></span>

Ye - Ye Jews, leave Babylon as soon as liberty is proclaimed. Remember -
And remember in Judea the great things both of justice and mercy which
God hath done.

[Jeremiah 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jer 51:51</span></span>

We - We Jews are ashamed to hear the enemies reproaching us, for our
God, or for our religion. Strangers - Pagans that were strangers to the
commonwealth of Israel, are come, not to worship, but to plunder, the
sanctuaries of the Lord; even into the courts of the priests and of the
Israelites; yea, into the most holy place.

[Jeremiah 51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">jer 51:52</span></span>

Wherefore - For this profanation of my holy place, I will be revenged
not only upon their idols, but upon the worshippers of them, and cause a
groaning of wounded men over all the country of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 51:55](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">jer 51:55</span></span>

The great voice - The noises caused from multitudes of people walking up
and trafficking together. A noise - The noise of her enemies that shall
break in upon her shall be like the roaring of the sea.

[Jeremiah 51:56](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">jer 51:56</span></span>

Because - Little more is said here than was before, only the words hint
the taking of Babylon by a surprize when the king, and the inhabitants
were not aware of it, which we had before also told us, [Jer
51:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md). Requite - The wrongs done to
his people.

[Jeremiah 51:57](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">jer 51:57</span></span>

Drunk - A plain allusion to the posture the king of Babylon, and the
thousand of his lords were in, when their city was taken while they were
drinking wine in the bowls that were brought from the temple at
Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 51:58](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">jer 51:58</span></span>

Weary - Though the people should labour to quench this fire, or to
rebuild this city, yet it would be all lost labour.

[Jeremiah 51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">jer 51:59</span></span>

In the fourth year - This circumstance lets us know that this prophecy
was many years before Babylon was destroyed; for it was seven years
before Jerusalem was taken; so as it must be above sixty years before it
was fulfilled in the first degree.

[Jeremiah 51:61](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">jer 51:61</span></span>

Shalt read - Probably to the Jews, that were in Babylon.

[Jeremiah 51:62](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">jer 51:62</span></span>

Shalt say - Thou shalt testify that thou believest what thou hast read.

[Jeremiah 51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">jer 51:64</span></span>

Weary - With that weight of judgment which shall be upon them. The words
- The prophetical words of Jeremiah; for the matter of the next chapter
is historical, and the book of Lamentations is not prophetical.
