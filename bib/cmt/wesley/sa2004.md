### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 4:4</span></span>

Jonathan had a son - This history is inserted as that which encouraged
these men to this wicked murder, because Saul's family was now reduced
to a low ebb; and if Isbosheth was dispatched, there would be none left,
but a lame child, who was altogether unfit to manage the kingdom, and
therefore the crown must necessarily come to David by their act and
deed; for which they promised themselves no small recompense. Jezreel -
The place of that last and fatal fight.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 4:6</span></span>

Fetched wheat - Which was laid up in publick granaries in the king's
house, and was fetched thence by the captains and commanders of the army
for the pay of their soldiers, who, in those ancient times were not paid
in money, but in corn. Upon this pretence they were admitted into the
house, and so went from room to room, to the place where the king lay.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 4:12</span></span>

David commanded. &c.But what a disappointment to Baanah and Rechab, was
the sentence which David passed upon them! And such they will meet with,
who think to serve the Son of David, by cruelty or injustice: who under
colour of religion, outrage or murder of their brethren, think they do
God service. However men may now canonize such methods of serving the
church and the catholic cause, Christ will let them know another day,
that Christianity was not designed to destroy humanity. And they who
thus think to merit heaven, shall not escape the damnation of hell.
