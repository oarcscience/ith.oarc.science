### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 4:1</span></span>

All Israel - This is spoken with respect to his successors, who were
kings only over a part, and that the smallest part of it.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 4:2</span></span>

Princes - That is, the chief rulers or officers. The son - Or the grand
- son. The priest - The second priest, or the priest that attended upon
Solomon's person in holy offices and administrations.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 4:3</span></span>

Scribes - That is, secretaries of state. He chose two, whereas David had
but one: either, because he observed some inconveniences in trusting all
those matters in one hand: or, because he had now much more employment
than David had, this being a time of great peace and prosperity, and his
empire enlarged.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 4:4</span></span>

Priests - That is, the high - priests, successively, first Abiathar, and
then Zadok.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 4:5</span></span>

Officers - Over those twelve Officers, named [Kg1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007.md), &c. who were all to give up their
accompts to him. Nathan - The prophet, who had been so highly
instrumental in Solomon's establishment in the throne. Principal officer
- Possibly, president of the king's council. Friend - His confident,
with whom he used to communicate his most secret counsels.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 4:6</span></span>

Abiathar was - Steward of the king's household. Tribute - The personal
tribute, or the levy of men, as appears by comparing this with [Kg1
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md), it being very fit that there
should be some one person to whom the chief conduct of that great
business was committed.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 4:8</span></span>

The son, &c. - This and others of them are denominated from their
fathers, because they were known and famous in their generation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 4:10</span></span>

Hepher - In Judah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 4:19</span></span>

Country of Gilead - That is, in the remaining part of that land of
Gilead, which was mentioned above. The only officer - In all Gilead,
excepting the parcels mentioned before, in all the territories of Sihon
and Og; which because they were of large extent, and yet all committed
to this one man, it is here noted concerning him as his privilege above
the rest.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 4:21</span></span>

The river - Euphrates: for so far David, having conquered the Syrians,
extended his empire, which Solomon also maintained in that extent. And
so God's promise concerning the giving the whole land, as far as
Euphrates, to the Israelites, was fulfilled. And, if the Israelites had
multiplied so much that the land of Canaan would not suffice them,
having God's grant of all the land as far as Euphrates, they might have
seized upon it whensoever occasion required. The land of the Philistines
- Which is to be understood inclusively; for the Philistines were within
Solomon's dominion. The border of Egypt - Unto the river Sihor, which
was the border between Egypt and Canaan. And served - By tribute, or
other ways, as he needed and required.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 4:22</span></span>

Measures - Heb. Cors: each of which contained ten ephahs. So this
provision was sufficient for near three thousand persons. Meal - Of a
coarser sort for common use.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 4:23</span></span>

Fat - Fatted in stalls. Out of pastures - Well fleshed, tender and good,
though not so fat as the former.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 4:24</span></span>

Tiphsah - Either that Tiphsah, [Kg2
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016.md), which was in the kingdom of
Israel within Jordan; or, rather, another place of that name upon
Euphrates, even that eminent city which is mentioned by Ptolemy, and
Strabo, and Pliny, called Thapsarum. And this best agrees with the
following: Azzah, which was the border of Canaan in the south and west,
as Tiphsah was in the north and east. And so his dominion is described
by both its borders. All kings - Who owned subjection, and paid tribute
to him.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 4:25</span></span>

Under his vine - Enjoying the fruit of his own labour with safety and
comfort. Under these two trees, which were most used and cultivated by
the Israelites, he understands all other fruit - bearing trees, and all
other comforts. And they are brought in as fitting or dwelling under
these trees, partly for recreation or delight in the shade; and partly,
for the comfort or advantage of the fruit; and withal, to note their
great security, not only in their strong cities, but even in the
country, where the vines and fig - trees grew, which was most open to
the incursions of their enemies.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 4:26</span></span>

Forty thousand - In [Ch2 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025.md), it is
but four thousand. But it is not exactly the same Hebrew word which is
here and there, though we translate both stalls; and therefore there may
well be allowed some difference in the signification, the one signifying
properly stables, of which there were four thousand, the other stalls or
partitions for each horse, which were forty thousand. Chariots - Both
for his military chariots, which seem to be those fourteen hundred, [Kg1
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#026.md), and for divers other uses, as
about his great and various buildings, and merchandises, and other
occasions, which might require some thousands of other chariots.
Horsemen - Appointed partly for the defence of his people in peace; and
partly for attendance upon his person, and for the splendor of his
government.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 4:27</span></span>

The officers - Named above. They lacked - Or rather, they suffered
nothing to be lacking to any man that came thither, but plentifully
provided all things necessary.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 4:29</span></span>

Largeness of heart - Vastness of understanding, a most comprehensive
knowledge of all things both Divine and human.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 4:30</span></span>

East country - The Chaldeans, Persians, and Arabians, who all lay
eastward from Canaan, and were famous in ancient times for their wisdom
and learning. Egypt - The Egyptians, whose fame was then great for their
skill in the arts and sciences, which made them despise the Grecians as
children in knowledge.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 4:31</span></span>

All men - Either of his nation; or, of his time: or, of all times and
nations, whether of the east or any other country excepting only the
first and second Adam. Ethan, &c. - Israelites of eminent wisdom,
probably the same mentioned, [Ch1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md),
[Ch1 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md), [Ch1
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#004.md); [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001)(title,.md) [Psa
89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001)(title.md). Chalcol, &c. - Of whom
see [Ch1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006.md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 4:32</span></span>

Proverbs - That is, short, and deep, and useful sentences, whereof a
great part are contained in the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.
Songs - Whereof the chief and most divine are in the Canticles.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 4:33</span></span>

Trees - That is, of all plants, of their nature and qualities: all which
discourses are lost, without any impeachment of the perfection of the
holy scriptures; which were not written to teach men philosophy or
physick, but only to make them wise unto salvation. From the cedar, &c.
- That is, from the greatest to the least.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 4:34</span></span>

All kings - All the neighbouring kings; a restriction grounded upon the
following words, where this is limited to such as heard of Solomon's
wisdom. Let those who magnify the modern learning above that of the
ancients, produce such a treasury of learning, anywhere in these later
ages, as that was, which Solomon was master of. Yet this puts an honour
upon human learning, that Solomon is praised for it, and recommends it
to the great ones of the earth, as well worthy their diligent search. In
all this Solomon was a type of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge.
