### [Psalms Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 4:1</span></span>

O God - The witness and defender of my righteous cause.

[Psalms 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 4:2</span></span>

My glory - By his glory probably he means that honour which God had
conferred upon him. Vanity - Wickedness. Lying - Those calumnies which
they raised against him, to make him odious to all the people.

[Psalms 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 4:3</span></span>

Godly - Me, whom, though you traduce as an hypocrite, God hath
pronounced to he a man after his own heart, [Sa1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#014.md). For himself - In his stead, or
to be his vicegerent, as all kings are, and especially the kings of
God's own people.

[Psalms 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 4:4</span></span>

In awe - Be afraid, if not of me, yet of God, who hath engaged in my
cause. Sin not - By prosecuting your rebellion against God's authority.
On your bed - Calmly consider these things in the silent night, when you
are at leisure from distracting business. Be still - Compose your
tumultuous minds.

[Psalms 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 4:5</span></span>

Offer - Unto God, that he may be reconciled to you. Righteousness -
Righteous sacrifices; which requires that the persons offering them be
righteous and do righteous things, and offer them with an honest mind,
with faith and true repentance. Without which, he intimates, that all
their sacrifices were of no esteem with God, and would be wholly
unprofitable to them.

[Psalms 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 4:6</span></span>

Many - Of my followers, who are weary of waiting upon God. Who - Who
will put an end to our troubles, and give us tranquility. Lift up - Upon
me and my friends. Give us an assurance of thy love, and evidence it by
thy powerful assistance.

[Psalms 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 4:7</span></span>

Thou hast - Whatsoever thou shalt do with me for the future, I have at
present unspeakable satisfaction in the testimonies of thy love to my
soul; more than worldly persons have in the time of a plentiful harvest.

[Psalms 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 4:8</span></span>

In peace - In tranquility of mind, resting securely upon God's promises.
