Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Ruth Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

[Ruth 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 1:1</span></span>

In the land - Of Canaan. It must be early: for Boaz was born of Rahab.
So Christ descended from two Gentile mothers.

[Ruth 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 1:2</span></span>

Ephrathites - Bethlehem was otherwise called Ephratha. Naomi signifies
my amiable or pleasant one: Mahlon and Chilon signify sickness and
consumption. Probably they were sickly children, and not likely to be
long - lived. Such are the products of our pleasant things, weak and
infirm, fading and dying.

[Ruth 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rut 1:4</span></span>

Took wives - Either these were Proselytes when they married them, or
they sinned in marrying them, and therefore were punished with short
life, and want of issue.

[Ruth 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rut 1:5</span></span>

Was left of her two sons, and her husband - Loss of children and
widowhood are both come upon her. By whom shall she be comforted? It is
God alone that is able to comfort those who are thus cast down.

[Ruth 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 1:6</span></span>

Bread - That is, food; so she staid no longer there than necessity
forced her.

[Ruth 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 1:8</span></span>

Mother's house - Because daughters used to converse more frequently with
their mothers, and to dwell in the same apartments with them, which then
were distinct from those parts of the house where the men dwelt. The
dead - With my sons, your husbands, while they lived.

[Ruth 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 1:11</span></span>

Your husbands - According to the ancient custom, [Gen
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#008.md), and the express law of God, [Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md), which doubtless she had
acquainted them with before, among other branches of the Jewish
religion.

[Ruth 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 1:13</span></span>

It grieveth me - That you are left without the comfort of husbands or
children; that I must part with such affectionate daughters; and that my
circumstances are such, that I cannot invite you to go alone with me.
For her condition was so mean at this time, that Ruth, when she came to
her mother's city, was forced to glean for a living. It is with me, that
God has a controversy. This language becomes us, when we are under
affliction; tho' many others share in the trouble, yet we are to hear
the voice of the rod, as if it spake only to us. But did not she wish to
bring them to the worship of the God of Israel? Undoubtedly she did. But
she would have them first consider upon what terms, lest having set
their hand to the plow, they should look back.

[Ruth 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rut 1:14</span></span>

Kissed - Departed from her with a kiss. Bade her farewell for ever. She
loved Naomi, but she did not love her so well, as to quit her country
for her sake. Thus many have a value for Christ, and yet come short of
salvation by him, because they cannot find in their hearts, to forsake
other things for him. They love him, and yet leave him, because they do
not love him enough, but love other things better.

[Ruth 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rut 1:15</span></span>

To her gods - Those that forsake the communion of saints, will certainly
break off their communion with God. This she saith, to try Ruth's
sincerity and constancy, and that she might intimate to her, that if she
went with her, she must embrace the true religion.

[Ruth 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rut 1:17</span></span>

There will I be buried - Not desiring to have so much as her dead body
carried back into the land of Moab: but Naomi and she having joined
souls, she desires they may mingle dust, in hopes of rising together,
and remaining together for ever.

[Ruth 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rut 1:18</span></span>

Left speaking unto her - See the power of resolution! Those who are half
- resolved, are like a door a - jar, which invites a thief. But
resolution shuts and bolts he door, and then the devil flees from us.

[Ruth 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 1:19</span></span>

Is this - Is this she that formerly lived in so much plenty and honour?
How marvelously is her condition changed?

[Ruth 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rut 1:20</span></span>

Naomi - Which signifies pleasant, and chearful. Mara - Which signifies
bitter or sorrowful.

[Ruth 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rut 1:21</span></span>

Full - With my husband and sons, and a plentiful estate for our support.
Testified - That is, hath borne witness, as it were, in judgment, and
given sentence against me.
