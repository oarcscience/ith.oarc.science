### [Matthew Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 25:1</span></span>

Then shall the kingdom of heaven - That is, the candidates for it, be
like ten virgins - The bridemaids on the wedding night were wont to go
to the house where the bride was, with burning lamps or torches in their
hands, to wait for the bride groom's coming. When he drew near, they
went to meet him with their lamps, and to conduct him to the bride.

[Matthew 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 25:3</span></span>

The foolish took no oil with them - No more than kept them burning just
for the present. None to supply their future want, to recruit their
lamp's decay. The lamp is faith. A lamp and oil with it, is faith
working by love.

[Matthew 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 25:4</span></span>

The wise took oil in their vessels - Love in their hearts. And they
daily sought a fresh supply of spiritual strength, till their faith was
made perfect.

[Matthew 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 25:5</span></span>

While the bridegroom delayed - That is, before they were called to
attend him, they all slumbered and slept - Were easy and quiet, the wise
enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace.

[Matthew 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 25:6</span></span>

At midnight - In an hour quite unthought of.

[Matthew 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 25:7</span></span>

They trimmed their lamps - They examined themselves and prepared to meet
their God.

[Matthew 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 25:8</span></span>

Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out - Our faith is dead.
What a time to discover this! Whether it mean the time of death, or of
judgment. Unto which of the saints wilt thou then turn? Who can help
thee at such a season?

[Matthew 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 25:9</span></span>

But the wise answered, Lest there be not enough for us and you! -
Beginning the sentence with a beautiful abruptness; such as showed their
surprise at the state of those poor wretches, who had so long received
them, as well as their own souls. Lest there be not enough - It is sure
there is not; for no man has more than holiness enough for himself. Go
ye rather to them that sell - Without money and without price: that is,
to God, to Christ. And buy - If ye can. O no! The time is past and
returns no more!

[Matthew 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 25:13</span></span>

Watch therefore - He that watches has not only a burning lamp, but
likewise oil in his vessel. And even when he sleepeth, his heart waketh.
He is quiet; but not secure.

[Matthew 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 25:14</span></span>

Our Lord proceeds by a parable still plainer (if that can be) to declare
the final reward of a harmless man. May God give all such in this their
day, ears to hear and hearts to understand it! The kingdom of heaven -
That is, the King of heaven, Christ. [Mar
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md); [Luk
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#012.md).

[Matthew 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 25:15</span></span>

To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one - And
who knows whether (all circumstances considered) there be a greater
disproportion than this, in the talents of those who have received the
most, and those who have received the fewest? According to his own
ability - The words may be translated more literally, according to his
own mighty power. And immediately took his journey - To heaven.

[Matthew 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 25:18</span></span>

He that had received one - Made his having fewer talents than others a
pretence for not improving any. Went and hid his master's money -
Reader, art thou doing the same? Art thou hiding the talent God hath
lent thee?

[Matthew 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 25:24</span></span>

I knew thou art a hard man - No. Thou knowest him not. He never knew
God, who thinks him a hard master. Reaping where thou hast not sown -
That is, requiring more of us than thou hast given us power to perform.
So does every obstinate sinner, in one kind or other, lay the blame of
his own sins on God.

[Matthew 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 25:25</span></span>

And I was afraid - Lest if I had improved my talent, I should have had
the more to answer for. So from this fear, one will not learn to read,
another will not hear sermons!

[Matthew 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 25:26</span></span>

Thou knewest - That I require impossibilities! This is not an allowing,
but a strong denial of the charge.

[Matthew 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 25:27</span></span>

Thou oughtest therefore - On that very account, on thy own supposition,
to have improved my talent, as far as was possible.

[Matthew 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 25:29</span></span>

To every one that hath shall he given - So close does God keep to this
stated rule, from the beginning to the end of the world. [Mat
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012.md).

[Matthew 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 25:30</span></span>

Cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness - For what?
what had he done? It is true he had not done good. But neither is he
charged with doing any harm. Why, for this reason, for barely doing no
harm, he is consigned to outer darkness. He is pronounced a wicked,
because he was a slothful, an unprofitable servant. So mere
harmlessness, on which many build their hope of salvation, was the cause
of his damnation! There shall be the weeping - Of the careless
thoughtless sinner; and the gnashing of teeth - Of the proud and
stubborn. The same great truth, that there is no such thing as negative
goodness, is in this chapter shown three times: In the parable of the
virgins; In the still plainer parable of the servants, who had received
the talents; and In a direct unparabolical declaration of the manner
wherein our Lord will proceed at the last day. The several parts of each
of these exactly answers each other, only each rises above the
preceding.

[Matthew 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 25:31</span></span>

When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels
with him - With what majesty and grandeur does our Lord here speak of
himself Giving us one of the noblest instances of the true sublime.
Indeed not many descriptions in the sacred writings themselves seem to
equal this. Methinks we can hardly read it without imagining ourselves
before the awful tribunal it describes.

[Matthew 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 25:34</span></span>

Inherit the kingdom - Purchased by my blood, for all who have believed
in me with the faith which wrought by love. Prepared for you - On
purpose for you. May it not be probably inferred from hence, that man
was not created merely to fill up the places of the fallen angels?

[Matthew 25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 25:35</span></span>

I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink -
All these works of outward mercy suppose faith and love, and must needs
he accompanied with works of spiritual mercy. But works of this kind the
Judge could not mention in the same manner. He could not say, I was in
error, and ye recalled me to the truth; I was in sin, and ye brought me
to repentance. In prison - Prisoners need to be visited above all
others, as they are commonly solitary and forsaken by the rest of the
world.

[Matthew 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 25:37</span></span>

Then shall the righteous answer - It cannot be, that either the
righteous or the wicked should answer in these very words. What we learn
herefrom is, that neither of them have the same estimation of their own
works as the Judge hath.

[Matthew 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 25:40</span></span>

Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did
it to me - What encouragement is here to assist the household of faith?
But let us likewise remember to do good to all men.

[Matthew 25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 25:41</span></span>

Depart into the everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and
his angels - Not originally for you: you are intruders into everlasting
fire.

[Matthew 25:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 25:44</span></span>

Then will they answer - So the endeavour to justify themselves, will
remain with the wicked even to that day!

[Matthew 25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 25:46</span></span>

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
into life everlasting - Either therefore the punishment is strictly
eternal, or the reward is not: the very same expression being applied to
the former as to the latter. The Judge will speak first to the
righteous, in the audience of the wicked. The wicked shall then go away
into everlasting fire, in the view of the righteous. Thus the damned
shall see nothing of the everlasting life; but the just will see the
punishment of the ungodly. It is not only particularly observable here,
That the punishment lasts as long as the reward; but, That this
punishment is so far from ceasing at the end of the world, that it does
not begin till then.
