### [Joshua Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001)

[Joshua 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 4:1</span></span>

Spake - This was commanded before, [Jos
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#012), and is here repeated with
enlargement, as being now to be put in execution.

[Joshua 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 4:2</span></span>

Out of every tribe a man - For the greater evidence, and the more
effectual spreading the report of this marvellous work among all the
tribes.

[Joshua 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 4:3</span></span>

Lodge this night - That is, in Gilgal, as is expressed below, [Jos
4:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019).

[Joshua 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 4:4</span></span>

Prepared - That is, appointed for that work, and commanded to be ready
for it.

[Joshua 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 4:5</span></span>

Before the ark - That is, go back again to the place where the ark
stands.

[Joshua 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 4:6</span></span>

A sign - A monument or memorial of this day's work.

[Joshua 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 4:9</span></span>

Twelve stones - These stones are not the same with those which a man
could carry upon his shoulder, [Jos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#005). They might be very much larger;
and being set up in two rows one above another, might be seen, at least
when the water was low, especially where it was shallow, as it was
ordinarily, though not at this time, when Jordan overflowed all its
banks. Add to this, that the waters of Jordan are very clear; therefore
these stones might be seen in it, either by those who stood upon the
shore, because the river was not broad; or by those that passed in
boats. Unto this day - This might be written, either by Joshua who
probably wrote this book near 20 years after this was done: or, by some
other holy man divinely inspired, who inserted this and some such
passages both in this book and in the writings of Moses.

[Joshua 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 4:10</span></span>

Commanded Joshua - Not particularly, but in general; because he
commanded Joshua to observe and do all that God had commanded him by
Moses, and all that he should command him any other way. Hasted - That
is, passed over with haste, an argument of their fear, or weakness of
their faith; as on the contrary, the priests are commended that they
stood firm, and settled in their minds, as well as in the posture of
their bodies.

[Joshua 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 4:13</span></span>

Before the Lord - Either, before the ark, or, in the presence of God who
observed whether they would keep their covenant made with their
brethren, or not.

[Joshua 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 4:16</span></span>

Out of Jordan - For being now in the middle, and deepest place of the
river, they are most properly said to go up to the land.

[Joshua 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 4:17</span></span>

The priests - Who stayed contentedly in the river, 'till God by Joshua
called them out.

[Joshua 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 4:18</span></span>

Their place - Returned into their proper channel, according to their
natural and usual course.

[Joshua 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 4:19</span></span>

The first month - Namely, of Nisan, which wanted but five days of forty
years from the time of their coming out of Egypt, which was on the
fifteenth day of this month. So punctual is God in the performing of his
word, whether promised or threatened. And this day was very seasonable
for the taking up of the lambs which were to he used four days after,
according to the law, [Exo 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003), [Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006). Gilgal - A place afterwards so
called, [Jos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#009).

[Joshua 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jos 4:20</span></span>

In Gilgal - Probably in order, like so many little pillars, to keep up
the remembrance of this miraculous benefit.

[Joshua 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 4:23</span></span>

Before us - That is, myself and Caleb, and all of us here present; for
this benefit, though done to their fathers, is justly said to be done to
themselves, because they were then in their parent's loins. It greatly
magnifies later mercies, to compare them with former mercies; for hereby
it appears, that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.
