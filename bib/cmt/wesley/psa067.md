### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001)

[Psalms 67:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 67:2</span></span>

Thy way - The way of truth, or the true religion; the same which in the
next clause is called his saving health, and both together signify the
way of salvation; deal so graciously with thy people, that thereby the
Gentile - world may at last be allured to join with them.

[Psalms 67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 67:4</span></span>

Judge - Rule them. Govern - Heb. lead; gently, as a shepherd doth his
sheep; and not rule them with rigour, as other lords had done.

[Psalms 67:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 67:6</span></span>

Them - When the people of the earth shall be converted to God, God will
cause it to yield them abundance of all sorts of fruits. Under which one
blessing, all other blessings both temporal and spiritual are
comprehended. Our own - He who is Israel's God in a peculiar manner.
