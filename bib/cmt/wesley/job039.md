were fed with corn. Go forth - Finding sufficient provisions abroad by
the care of God's providence.

[Job 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 39:5</span></span>

Sent - Who hath given him this disposition that he loves freedom, and
hates that subjection which other creatures quietly endure? Loosed - Who
keeps him from receiving the bands, and submitting to the service of
man.

[Job 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 39:7</span></span>

swift, and can easily escape them. Driver - He will not be brought to
receive his yoke, nor to do his drudgery.

[Job 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 39:8</span></span>

fattest pastures with servitude.

Unicorn - It is disputed whether this be the Rhinoceros; or a kind of
wild bull.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 39:16</span></span>

Her labour - In laying her eggs is in vain, because she hath not the
fear and tender concern for them, which she should have.

[Job 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 39:17</span></span>

Deprived - Because God hath not implanted in her that instinct, and
affection, which he hath put into other birds and beasts toward their
young.

[Job 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 39:18</span></span>

Lifteth - To flee from her pursuer: to which end she lifts up her head
and body, and spreads her wings. Scorneth - She despises them thro' her
swiftness; for though she cannot fly, yet by the aid of her wings she
runs so fast, that horse - men cannot reach her.

Valley - Battles used to be pitched in valleys, or low grounds,
especially horse battles.

[Job 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#023.md)

Quiver - The quiver is here put for the arrows contained in it, which
being shot against the horse and rider, make a rattling noise.

[Job 39:24](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 39:24</span></span>

Swalloweth - He is so full of rage and fury, that he not only champs his
bridle, but is ready to tear and devour the very ground on which he
goes. Believeth - He is so pleased with the approach of the battle, and
the sound of the trumpet calling to it, that he can scarce believe his
ears for gladness.

[Job 39:25](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 39:25</span></span>

Ha, ha - An expression of joy and alacrity declared by his proud
neighings. Thunder - The loud and joyful clamour begun by the
commanders, and followed by the soldiers when they are ready to join
battle.

Fly - So strongly, constantly, unweariedly, and swiftly. South - At the
approach of winter, when wild hawks fly into warmer countries, as being
impatient of cold. The birds of the air are proofs of the wonderful
providence of God, as well as the beasts of the earth. God instances in
two stately ones.

to look upon the sun with open eyes, and to behold the smallest prey
upon the earth or sea, when she is mounted out of our sight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 39:33</span></span>

Blood - There are divers eagles who do not feed upon carcases, but many
eagles do feed on them. She - In an instant, flying thither with
admirable celerity.
