### [1 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 4:1</span></span>

Let a man account us, as servants of Christ - The original word properly
signifies such servants as laboured at the oar in rowing vessels; and,
accordingly, intimates the pains which every faithful minister takes in
his Lord's work. O God, where are these ministers to be found? Lord,
thou knowest. And stewards of the mysteries of God - Dispenseth of the
mysterious truths of the gospel.

[1 Corinthians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 4:3</span></span>

Yea, I judge not myself - My final state is not to be determined by my
own judgment.

[1 Corinthians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 4:4</span></span>

I am not conscious to myself of anything evil; yet am I not hereby
justified - I depend not on this, as a sufficient justification of
myself in God's account. But he that judgeth me is the Lord - By his
sentence I am to stand or fall.

[1 Corinthians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 4:5</span></span>

Therefore judge nothing before the time - Appointed for judging all men.
Until the Lord come, who, in order to pass a righteous judgment, which
otherwise would be impossible, will both bring to light the things which
are now covered with impenetrable darkness, and manifest the most secret
springs of action, the principles and intentions of every heart. And
then shall every one - Every faithful steward, have praise of God.

[1 Corinthians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 4:6</span></span>

These things - Mentioned, [Co1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md),
&c. I have by a very obvious figure transferred to myself and Apollos -
And Cephas, instead of naming those particular preachers at Corinth, to
whom ye are so fondly attached. That ye may learn by us - From what has
been said concerning us, who, however eminent we are, are mere
instruments in God's hand. Not to think of any man above what is here
written - Or above what scripture warrants. [Co1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007.md)

[1 Corinthians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 4:7</span></span>

Who maketh thee to differ - Either in gifts or graces. As if thou hadst
not received it - As if thou hadst it originally from thyself.

[1 Corinthians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 4:8</span></span>

Now ye are full - The Corinthians abounded with spiritual gifts; and so
did the apostles: but the apostles, by continual want and sufferings,
were kept from self - complacency. The Corinthians suffering nothing,
and having plenty of all things, were pleased with and applauded
themselves; and they were like children who, being raised in the world,
disregard their poor parents. Now ye are full, says the apostle, in a
beautiful gradation, ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings - A
proverbial expression, denoting the most splendid and plentiful
circumstances. Without any thought of us. And I would ye did reign - In
the best sense: I would ye had attained the height of holiness. That we
might reign with you - Having no more sorrow on your account, but
sharing in your happiness.

[1 Corinthians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 4:9</span></span>

God hath set forth us last, as appointed to death - Alluding to the
Roman custom of bringing forth those persons last on the stage, either
to fight with each other, or with wild beasts, who were devoted to
death; so that, if they escaped one day, they were brought out again and
again, till they were killed.

[1 Corinthians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 4:10</span></span>

We are fools, in the account of the world, for Christ's sake, but ye are
wise in Christ - Though ye are Christians, ye think yourselves wise; and
ye have found means to make the world think you so too. We are weak - In
presence, in infirmities, in sufferings. But ye are strong - In just
opposite circumstances.

[1 Corinthians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 4:11</span></span>

And are naked - Who can imagine a more glorious triumph of the truth,
than that which is gained in these circumstances when St. Paul, with an
impediment in his speech, and a person rather contemptible than
graceful, appeared in a mean, perhaps tattered, dress before persons of
the highest distinction, and yet commanded such attention. and made such
deep impressions upon them!

[1 Corinthians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 4:12</span></span>

We bless - suffer it - intreat - We do not return revilings,
persecution, defamation; nothing but blessing.

[1 Corinthians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 4:13</span></span>

We are made as the filth of the world, and offscouring of all things -
Such were those poor wretches among the heathens, who were taken from
the dregs of the people, to be offered as expiatory sacrifices to the
infernal gods. They were loaded with curses, affronts, and injuries, all
the way they went to the altars; and when the ashes of those unhappy men
were thrown into the sea, these very names were given them in the
ceremony.

[1 Corinthians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 4:14</span></span>

I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I
warn you - It is with admirable prudence and sweetness the apostle adds
this, to prevent any unkind construction of his words.

[1 Corinthians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 4:15</span></span>

I have begotten you - This excludes not only Apollos, his successor, but
also Silas and Timothy, his companions; and the relation between a
spiritual father and his children brings with it an inexpressible
nearness and affection.

[1 Corinthians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 4:16</span></span>

Be ye followers of me - In that spirit and behaviour which I have so
largely declared.

[1 Corinthians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 4:17</span></span>

My beloved son - Elsewhere he styles him "brother," [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md); but here paternal affection takes
place. As I teach - No less by example than precept.

[1 Corinthians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 4:18</span></span>

Now some are puffed up - St. Paul saw, by a divine light, the thoughts
which would arise in their hearts. As if I would not come - Because I
send Timothy.

[1 Corinthians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 4:19</span></span>

I will know - He here shows his fatherly authority Not the big, empty
speech of these vain boasters, but how much of the power of God attends
them.

[1 Corinthians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 4:20</span></span>

For the kingdom of God - Real religion, does not consist in words, but
in the power of God ruling the heart.

[1 Corinthians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 4:21</span></span>

With a rod - That is, with severity.
