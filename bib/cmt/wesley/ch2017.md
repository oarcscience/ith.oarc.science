### [2 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 17:3</span></span>

Sought not, &c. - It is true, he recovered from that fall. "Yet perhaps,
says Mr. Henry, he never, while he lived, fully retrieved the spiritual
strength he lost by it."

[2 Chronicles 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 17:5</span></span>

Brought presents - As subjects in those times used to do to their kings,
as a token of their respect and subjection to them.

[2 Chronicles 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 17:6</span></span>

Lifted up - Above all discouragements, and fears. He was valiant and
resolute for God and his ways. Groves - Those wherein idols were
worshipped, and though Asa had done this before, yet either he did not
do it thoroughly; or the Jews (who were many of them mad upon their
idols) had secretly made new ones, in the latter part of his reign, when
he grew more infirm in body, and more remiss in God's cause.

[2 Chronicles 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 17:7</span></span>

To teach - To inform the people of their duty, and of the king's
pleasure, as judges teach or instruct the people in the laws of the
land, when they deliver their charges upon the bench; so did these
princes in the king's name admonish and require the people to observe
and obey the laws of God, which were the municipal laws of that land:
the particular explication and enforcement whereof, they left to the
Levites and priests here following, who were sent for this end, and
accordingly taught the people, [Ch2
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#009).

[2 Chronicles 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 17:9</span></span>

And they taught, &c. - And these itinerant judges and itinerant
preachers together, Mr. Henry observes were instrumental to diffuse a
blessed light throughout the cities of Judah.

[2 Chronicles 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 17:10</span></span>

Fear fell - Justly concluding from his singular piety that God would
eminently appear for him, for even the Heathens could not but observe,
that the kings of Judah were either prosperous or unhappy, according as
they served God or forsook him.

[2 Chronicles 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 17:13</span></span>

Business - To repair and fortify them, and furnish them with provisions:
and to purge out all their relicks of idolatry and injustice.

[2 Chronicles 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 17:19</span></span>

Waited - These above - mentioned were the trained bands or auxiliaries:
whose chief officers waited on the king to receive his commands, and to
raise, and bring in all, or part of their forces, to the service of the
king as need required. A vast number for so small a compass of ground,
to furnish out and maintain. But we may consider, that God had promised
to make the seed of Abraham like the sand of the sea for number; that
there had now been a long peace; that many were come to them from the
kingdom of Israel and that Jehoshaphat was under a special blessing of
God. They were doubtless dispersed all the country over, every one
residing on his own land: only they were ready at call, whenever there
was occasion.
