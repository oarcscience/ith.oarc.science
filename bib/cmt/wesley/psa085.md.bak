### [Psalms Chapter 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 85:1</span></span>

Captivity - The captives.

[Psalms 85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 85:4</span></span>

Turn us - Restore us to our former tranquillity, and free us from the
troubles which we yet groan under.

[Psalms 85:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 85:6</span></span>

Revive us - Give us a second reviving in bringing home the rest of our
brethren, and in restraining our enemies.

[Psalms 85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 85:8</span></span>

Will hear - Diligently observe. Will speak - What answer God will give
to my prayers. Peace - He will give an answer of peace. Saints - Not to
all that are called God's people, but only to those who are truly such.

[Psalms 85:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 85:9</span></span>

His salvation - That compleat salvation for which all the Israel of God
wait; even the redemption by the Messiah; of which not only Christian,
but even Jewish writers understand this place; and to which the
following passages properly belong. And the psalmist might well say this
salvation was nigh, because the seventy weeks determined by Daniel were
begun. Glory - The glorious presence of God, and the God of glory
himself, even Christ, who is the brightness of his father's glory.

[Psalms 85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 85:10</span></span>

Kissed - That great work of redemption by Christ, shall clearly manifest
God's mercy in redeeming his people Israel, and in the conversion of the
Gentiles; his truth in fulfilling that great promise of sending his son,
his righteousness in punishing sin, on his son, and in conferring
righteousness upon guilty and lost creatures; and his peace or
reconciliation to sinners, and that peace of conscience which attends
upon it.

[Psalms 85:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 85:11</span></span>

Truth - Truth among men. Righteousness - And God's justice shall be
satisfied: he shall look down upon sinful men with a smiling
countenance.

[Psalms 85:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 85:13</span></span>

Before him - As his harbinger. He shall fulfil all righteousness, he
shall satisfy the righteousness of God, and shall advance righteousness
and holiness among men. Set us - Shall cause us to walk in those
righteous ways wherein he walketh.
