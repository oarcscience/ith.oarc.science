### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 7:1</span></span>

Ahaz - A most wicked king: yet no prophecies are more comfortable than
those which were delivered in his time; God so ordering it for the
encouragement of the faithful that lived under his impious reign.

[Isaiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 7:2</span></span>

David - Ahaz, and his relations. He calls them the house of David, to
intimate that the following comfortable message was sent to Ahaz, not
for his own sake, but for the sake of his worthy progenitor David.
Ephraim - The kingdom of the ten tribes, commonly called Ephraim,
because that was the most numerous of all. Moved - With fear, arising
from a consciousness of their own guilt, and their enemies strength.

[Isaiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 7:3</span></span>

Thy son - Whose very name carried in it a sign and pledge of the
promised deliverance, signifying, The remnant shall return. Fuller's
field - Whither he probably went to take care about the waters which
thence were brought into the city, to secure them to himself, or keep
them from the enemy, as Hezekiah afterward did, [Ch2
32:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003.md).

[Isaiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 7:4</span></span>

Be quiet - Settle thy mind by the belief of that joyful message which I
am now to deliver thee from the Lord. Fire - brands - They are not whole
fire - brands, but small pieces or ends of them, taken out of the fire,
in which there is more smoak than fire. They have more of shew and
terror, than of strength. Pekah, king of Israel, he calls only the son
of Remaliah, to intimate, that he was unworthy the name of king, as
having got that title by usurpation, and the murder of his master, [Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md).

[Isaiah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 7:6</span></span>

Let us - Break their power and kingdom and subdue it to ourselves.

[Isaiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 7:7</span></span>

It - Their evil counsel.

[Isaiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 7:8</span></span>

Damascus - Damascus shall still continue the capital of the kingdom of
Syria; and therefore Jerusalem shall not become a part of Rezin's
dominion: but he shall keep within his own bounds, and be king of
Damascus only.

[Isaiah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 7:9</span></span>

Samaria - Samaria shall continue to be the chief city if the kingdom of
Israel, and Pekah shall not conquer Jerusalem. If - If you do not
believe this, but seek to the Assyrians for succour, ye shall be
consumed thereby.

[Isaiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 7:12</span></span>

I will not - By asking a sign, as if I questioned the truth of his word:
but this was deep hypocrisy.

[Isaiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 7:13</span></span>

David - He reproves them all, because they were the king's counsellors.
Is it a small thing - Is it not wickedness enough. My God - To vex God's
prophets and people, with your oppressions and horrid impieties. And by
your ingratitude and unbelief, and disobedience of his commands.

[Isaiah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 7:14</span></span>

Therefore - Because you despise me, and the sign which I now offer to
you, God of his own free grace will send you a more honourable
messenger, and give you a nobler sign. A sign - Of your deliverance. But
how was this birth, which was not to happen 'till many ages after, a
sign of their deliverance from present danger? This promised birth
supposed the preservation of that city, and nation and tribe, in and of
which the Messiah was to be born; and therefore there was no cause to
fear that ruin which their enemies now threatened. Immanuel - God with
us; God dwelling among us, in our nature, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md). God and man meeting in one
person, and being a mediator between God and men. For the design of
these words is not so much to relate the name by which Christ should
commonly he called, as to describe his nature and office.

[Isaiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 7:15</span></span>

Butter - The common food of children in that country. He - The virgin's
son. Know - To discern between things good and evil.

[Isaiah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 7:16</span></span>

Yea - Not only this land shall be preserved until the virgin's son shall
be born, but thine enemies land shall be sorely scourged, and these two
kings destroyed within a very little time. This child - Shear - Jashub,
whom in all probability the prophet pointed at, and who was brought
hither by God's special command, [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md). for this very use. The land - The
lands of Syria and Israel. Forsaken - So far shall Pekah and Rezin be
from conquering thy land, that they shall lose their own lands, and
their lives too; which they did within two years after this time, being
both slain by the king of Assyria.

[Isaiah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 7:17</span></span>

Shall bring - But altho' God will deliver you at this time, yet he will
requite all your wickedness. Thee - For part of this Assyrian storm fell
in Ahaz's reign. And - Upon thy sons and successors, the kings of Judah.
Days - Calamities. Departed - When ten tribes revolted from thy father's
house. The king - Who may well be called their plague or calamity, as he
is called the rod of God's anger, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md).

[Isaiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 7:18</span></span>

The fly - The flies. So he calls these enemies, to imply their great
numbers. In - In their extremity, where they go out into the sea. Rivers
- Of the river Nile, which may be called rivers, either for its
greatness, or because towards the end of it, it is divided into seven
streams. When the Chaldeans had in good measure subdued the Egyptians,
it is probable great numbers of the Egyptian soldiers listed themselves
in the Chaldean army, and with them invaded the land of Judah. The bee -
The Assyrian army, compared to bees, as for their numerous forces and
orderly march, so for their fierce attempts and mischievous effects.
Assyria - In the empire of Assyria, or Babylon; for these two were
united into one empire, and therefore in scripture are promiscuously
called sometimes by one title, and sometimes by the other.

[Isaiah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 7:19</span></span>

Valleys - Such as they found fruitful, but made desolate. Rocks - To
which possibly the Israelites fled for refuge. Bushes - Which he
mentions because flies and bees use frequently to rest there; and to
intimate, that no place should escape their fury.

[Isaiah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 7:20</span></span>

Shave - Utterly spoil, as shaving takes away the hair. Hired - By Ahaz,
who did hire them, [Kg2 16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md). And so
the prophet notes the just judgment of God, in scourging them with a rod
of their own making. By - By the successive kings of the Assyrian
empire, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and especially by Nebuchadnezzar. The
head - By these metaphorical expressions he signifies the total
destruction of their state, from head to foot, from the highest to the
lowest.

[Isaiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 7:21</span></span>

Sheep - They who formerly used to keep great herds of cattle, and many
flocks of sheep, shall esteem it a happiness if they can keep but one
cow and two sheep.

[Isaiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 7:22</span></span>

Abundance - Because they shall have large pastures, by reason of the
great scarcity of cattle. Butter - Which the poorer sort had formerly
used to sell, to procure them cheaper food for themselves: but now the
land should be so destitute of people, that there were none to whom they
could sell them.

[Isaiah 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 7:23</span></span>

Of silver - Each of the thousand vineyards might have been sold or let
for a thousand shekels, which was the yearly rent of some excellent
vineyards.

[Isaiah 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 7:24</span></span>

With arrows - Either to hunt, or to defend themselves from wild beasts,
which commonly abide in desolate grounds.

[Isaiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 7:25</span></span>

Digged - That used to be digged and dressed for the planting of vines,
or other choice fruit - trees. The fear - That they might be freed from
briars and thorns. Cattle - All sorts of cattle may enter, and feed
there, the fences being broken down, and the owners slain, or carried
into captivity.
