### [Joshua Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 13:1</span></span>

Thou art old - Therefore delay not to do the work which I have commanded
thee to do. It is good for those that are stricken in years, to be
remembered that they are so: that they may be quickened to do the work
of life, and prepare for death which is coming on apace.

[Joshua 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 13:2</span></span>

Remaineth - Unconquered by thee, and to be conquered by the Israelites,
if they behave themselves aright. All Geshuri - A people in the
northeast of Canaan, as the Philistines are on the southwest.

[Joshua 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 13:3</span></span>

Counted to the Canaanites - That is, which though now possessed by the
Philistines, who drove out the Canaanites the old inhabitants of it,
[Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md); [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md), yet is a part of the land of
Canaan, and therefore belongs to the Israelites. The Avites - Or, the
Avims, as they are called, [Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md),
who though they were expelled out of their ancient seat, and most of
them destroyed by the Caphtorims or Philistines, as is there said, yet
many of them escaped, and planted themselves not very far from the
former.

[Joshua 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 13:4</span></span>

From the south - That is, from those southern parts of the sea - coast,
now possessed by the Philistines, all the more northern parts of the sea
- coast being yet inhibited by the Canaanites, almost as far as Sidon.
The Amorites - The Amorites were a very strong and numerous people, and
we find them dispersed in several parts, some within Jordan, and some
without it, some in the south and others in the north, of whom he speaks
here.

[Joshua 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 13:6</span></span>

Will I drive out - Whatever becomes of us, however we may be laid aside
as broken vessels, God will do his work in his own time. I will do it by
my word; so the Chaldee here, as in many other places: by the eternal
word, the captain of my host. But the promise of driving them out from
before the children of Israel, supposes that the Israelites must use
their own endeavours, must go up against them. If Israel, thro' sloth or
cowardice let them alone, they are not likely to be driven out. We must
go forth on our Christian warfare, and then God will go before us.

[Joshua 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 13:8</span></span>

Which Moses gave them - By my command, and therefore do not thou disturb
them in their possessions, but proceed to divide the other possessions
to the rest.

[Joshua 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 13:9</span></span>

Medeba unto Dibon - Two cities anciently belonging to the Moabites, and
taken from them by the Amorites, [Num
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030.md), and from them by the
Israelites; and after the Israelites were gone into captivity, recovered
by the first possessors, the Moabites.

[Joshua 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 13:11</span></span>

And Maacathites - Whose land God had given to the Israelites without
Jordan, though they had not yet used the gift of God, nor taken
possession of it, as is noted, [Jos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013.md).

[Joshua 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 13:12</span></span>

These did Moses smite - Not all now mentioned, but Sihon and Og, and
their people, and the generality of them.

[Joshua 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 13:14</span></span>

He gave - That is, Moses. None inheritance - Namely, in the land beyond
Jordan, where yet a considerable part of the Levites were to have their
settled abode. This is mentioned as the reason both why Moses gave all
that land to the Reubenites and Gadites and Manassites; and why Joshua
should divide the land only into nine parts and an half, as was said,
[Jos 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007.md), because Levi was otherwise
provided for. Made by fire - Which are here put for all the sacrifices
and oblations, including first - fruits and tithes, that were assigned
to the Levites; and this passage is repeated, to prevent those calumnies
and injuries which God foresaw the Levites were likely to meet with,
from the malice, envy and covetousness of their brethren.

[Joshua 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 13:15</span></span>

According to their families - Dividing the inheritance into as many
parts as they had families; but this is only spoken of the greater
families; for the lesser distributions to the several small families was
done by inferior officers, according to the rules which Moses gave them.

[Joshua 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jos 13:19</span></span>

In the mount of the valley - In the mountain bordering upon that valley,
which then was famous among the Israelites; whether that where Moses was
buried, which was near to Beth - peor, [Deu
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md), [Deu
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006.md), or some other. And this clause
is thought to belong to all the cities now mentioned.

[Joshua 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 13:21</span></span>

Cities of the plain - Opposed to the cities of the mountain of the
valley. All the kingdom of Sihon - A great part of it; in which sense we
read of all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, [Mat
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md), and all Galilee, [Mat
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#023.md). Whom Moses smote - Not in the
same time or battle, as appears by comparing [Num
21:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023.md), with [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md), but in the same manner. And they
are here mentioned, partly because they were slain not long after, and
upon the same occasion, even their enmity against Israel; and partly
because of their relation and subjection to Sihon. Dukes of Sihon - But
how could they be so, when they were kings of Midian? [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md). There were divers petty kings in
those parts, who were subject to greater kings; and such these were, but
are here called dukes or princes of Sihon, because they were subject and
tributaries to him, and therefore did one way or other assist Sihon in
this war, though they were not killed at this time. It is probable, that
when Sihon destroyed those Moabites which dwelt in these parts, he
frighted the rest of them, and with them their neighbours and
confederates, the Midianites, into some kind of homage, which they were
willing to pay him. Dwelling in the country - Heb. inhabiting that land,
namely Midian, last mentioned; whereby he signifies, that tho' they were
subject to Sihon, yet they did not dwell in his land, but in another.

[Joshua 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jos 13:22</span></span>

Were slain by them - This was recorded before, [Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008.md), and is here repeated, because
the defeating of Balaam's purpose to curse Israel, and the turning that
curse into a blessing, was such an instance of the power and goodness of
God, as was fit to be had in everlasting remembrance.

[Joshua 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 13:23</span></span>

The border thereof - That is, those cities or places which bordered upon
Jordan.

[Joshua 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jos 13:25</span></span>

The cities of Gilead - That is, all the cities of eminency; all the
cities properly so called, which lay in that part of Gilead; and so this
may well agree with [Jos 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031.md), where
half the country of Gilead is said to be given to the Manassites; but
there is no mention of any cities there. The land of the children of
Ammon - Not of that which was now theirs, for that they were forbidden
to meddle with, but of that which was anciently theirs, 'till taken from
them by the Amorites, from whom the Israelites took it. Aroer - The
border between them and Moab. Rabbah - The chief city of the Ammonites.

[Joshua 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 13:26</span></span>

Ramath - mizpeh - Called Ramoth - Gilead, or Ramoth in Gilead. Mahanaim
- Exclusively; for Mahanaim was in the portion of Manasseh, beyond
Jabbok, which was the border of Gad and Manasseh.

[Joshua 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jos 13:27</span></span>

The rest of the kingdom - The northern part of his kingdom.

[Joshua 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 13:29</span></span>

Of Manasseh - Not that thou desired it, as Reuben and Gad did, [Num
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md), but partly as a recompence to
Machir the Manassite, for his valiant acts against Og; and partly for
the better defence of the other two tribes, by so considerable an
accession to them, which also was without any inconvenience to them,
because the country was too large for the two tribes of Reuben and Gad.

[Joshua 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 13:30</span></span>

Of Jair - Who, though of the tribe of Judah, by the father, [Ch1
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#021.md), yet is called the son of
Manasseh, [Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041.md), because he
married a daughter of Manasseh, and wholly associated himself with those
valiant Manassites; and with their help took sixty cities or great
towns, [Deu 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004.md), [Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014.md), which thence were called the
towns of Jair.

[Joshua 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 13:31</span></span>

Children of Machir - Whom before he called the children of Manasseh, he
now calls the children of Machir, because Machir was the most eminent,
and as it may seem, the only surviving son of Manasseh, [Num
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#029.md); [Ch1
7:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md).
