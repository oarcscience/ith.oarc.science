### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 6:2</span></span>

Bones - My inmost parts.

[Psalms 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 6:5</span></span>

In death - Among the dead. Remembrance - He speaks of the remembrance or
celebration of God's grace in the land of the living, to the edification
of God's church, and the propagation of true religion among men; which
is not done in the other life.

[Psalms 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 6:6</span></span>

With my tears - It well becomes the greatest spirits to be tender, and
to relent under the tokens of God's displeasure. David who could face
Goliath himself, melts into tears at the remembrance of sin, and under
the apprehension of Divine wrath, and it is no diminution to his
character.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

Hath heard - By the workings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his
prayer was accepted. His tears had a voice, in the ears of the God of
mercy. Silent tears are no speechless ones. Our tears are cries to God.

[Psalms 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 6:10</span></span>

Ashamed - Of their vain confidence. Return - Repent of their sins and
return to their obedience.
