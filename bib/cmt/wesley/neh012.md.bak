### [Nehemiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 12:1</span></span>

Priests - The chief of the priests, the heads of those twenty four
courses which David appointed by divine direction, 1Ch. 24:1-19. And
whereas there were twenty four, and here but twenty - two, and [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md), &c. only twenty, the reason of
this difference may be, because two of the twenty four courses were
extinct in Babylon, and two of the persons here named, [Neh
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#002.md), [Neh
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#005.md), Hattush, and Maadiah, may be
omitted in the account of the posterity of these, [Neh
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md), &c. because they had no
posterity. Ezra - Either this was another Ezra, or if it were the same
mentioned [Ezr 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#001.md), he lived to a
great age; which may well be supposed, considering his great sobriety,
and his great piety to which God promised long life, and withal the
special providence of God continuing him so long in such a season,
wherein the church of God did greatly need his help and counsel.

[Nehemiah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 12:8</span></span>

Moreover, &c. - He was to see, that the psalms of thanksgiving were
continually sung in the temple, in due time and manner.

[Nehemiah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">neh 12:10</span></span>

Jeshua - Here follows a catalogue of the Jewish high - priests; which
was the more necessary, because their times were now to be measured, not
by the years of their kings as formerly, but by their high - priests.

[Nehemiah 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 12:12</span></span>

Priests - As their fathers were priests in the days of Joshua, so in the
days of Joiakim the son of Joshua, the sons of those persons executed
the priesthood in their father's steads, some of their fathers probably
being yet living, and many of them dead.

[Nehemiah 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">neh 12:22</span></span>

Darius - Darius Noehus; and so this Jaddua might be father to him who
was in the days of Darius Codomanus, and of Alexander the Great.

[Nehemiah 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">neh 12:27</span></span>

The wall - Of the city itself, which is here dedicated to God, and to
his honour and service, not only upon a general account, by which we
ought to devote ourselves, and all that is ours, to God; but upon a more
special ground, because this was a place which God himself had chosen,
and sanctified by his temple and gracious presence, and therefore did of
right belong to him; whence it is often called the holy city. And they
restored it to God by this dedication, withal imploring the presence,
and favour, and blessing of to this city by solemn prayers, and praises,
and sacrifices, wherewith this dedication was accompanied. Places - To
which they were now retired after that great and general assembly, chap.
8, 9, & 10. [Neh 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md) &c.

[Nehemiah 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">neh 12:30</span></span>

Purified themselves - They that would be instrumental to sanctify
others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God, with
purity of mind and sincerity of intention.

[Nehemiah 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">neh 12:31</span></span>

Princes - And half of the people with them. The wall - For the wall was
broad and strong, and so ordered that men might conveniently walk upon
it. Right hand - Towards the south and east.

[Nehemiah 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">neh 12:39</span></span>

Stood still - Waiting, as also their brethren did, that they might go
together in due order into God's house, there to perfect the solemnity.

[Nehemiah 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">neh 12:43</span></span>

The children rejoiced - And their hosanna's were not despised, but are
recorded to their praise. All that share in public mercies, ought to
join in public thanksgivings.

[Nehemiah 12:44](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">neh 12:44</span></span>

Rejoiced - For the eminent gifts and graces which they observed in many
of them: for the great benefit which they had now received by their
ministry: and for the competent provision which hereby was made for
them, that so they might wholly wait upon their office. The sure way for
ministers to gain an interest, in the affections of their people, is to
wait on their ministry, to spend their whole time, and thought, and
strength therein.

[Nehemiah 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">neh 12:45</span></span>

The ward - That ward, or charge, which God had prescribed to them. And
in particular the charge of purification, of taking care that no unclean
person or thing should enter into the house or courts of the Lord.

[Nehemiah 12:47](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">neh 12:47</span></span>

Sanctified - They set apart the first - fruits and tithes from their own
share, and devoted them to the use of the Levites. And so did the
Levites by the tithe of the tithes. Thus they all conscientiously paid
their dues, and did not profane those things which God had sanctified,
nor take them into their own common use. When what is contributed for
the support of religion, is given with an eye to God, it is sanctified,
and will cause the blessing to rest upon the house, and all that is
therein.
