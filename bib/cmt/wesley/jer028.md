### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

which was one of the cities of the priests; that he was a priest.

[Jeremiah 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 28:12</span></span>

Then - Some time after.

[Jeremiah 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 28:13</span></span>

But - Thou hast further incensed God against them, and provoked him to
make their judgment heavier.

[Jeremiah 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 28:17</span></span>

dangerous a thing it is for ministers to teach people contrary to the
revealed will of God.
