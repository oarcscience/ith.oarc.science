### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 21:2</span></span>

Sarah conceived - Sarah by faith, received strength to conceive, [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md). God therefore, by promise, gave
that strength. Abraham was old, and Sarah old, and both as good as dead,
and then the word of God took place.

[Genesis 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 21:4</span></span>

He circumcised his son - The covenant being established with him, the
seal of the covenant was administered to him.

[Genesis 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 21:6</span></span>

And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh - He hath given me both cause
to rejoice, and a heart to rejoice. And it adds to the comfort of any
mercy to have our friends rejoice with us in it, See [Luk
1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058.md). They that hear will laugh with
me - Others will rejoice in this instance of God's power and goodness,
and be encouraged to trust in him.

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

Sarah saw the son of the Egyptian mocking - Mocking Isaac no doubt, for
it is sad, with reference to this, [Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029.md), that he that was born after the
flesh, persecuted him that was born after the spirit. Ishmael is here
called the son of the Egyptian, because (as some think) the four hundred
years affliction of the seed of Abraham by the Egyptians began now, and
was to be dated from hence.

[Genesis 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 21:10</span></span>

Cast out the bond - woman - This was a type of the rejection of the
unbelieving Jews, who, though they were the seed of Abraham, yet,
because they submitted not to the gospel - covenant, were unchurched and
disfranchised. And that, which above any thing provoked God to cast them
off, was, their mocking and persecuting the gospel - church, God's
Isaac, in his infancy.

[Genesis 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 21:11</span></span>

The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight - it grieved him that
Ishmael had given such provocation. And still more that Sarah insisted
upon such a punishment.

[Genesis 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 21:13</span></span>

The casting out of Ishmael was not his ruin. He shall be a nation
because he is thy seed - We are not sure that it was his eternal ruin.
It is presumption to say, that all these who are left out of the
external dispensation of God's covenant are excluded from all his
mercies. Those may be saved who are not thus honoured.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

And Abraham rose up early in the morning - We may suppose immediately
after he had in the night - visions received orders to do this.

[Genesis 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 21:17</span></span>

God heard the voice of the lad - We read not of a word be said; but his
sighs and groans, cried loud in the ears of the God of mercy. An angel
was sent to comfort Hagar, who assures her, God has heard the voice of
the lad where he is - Though he be in the wilderness; for wherever we
are, there is a way open heavenwards; therefore lift up the lad, and
hold him in thy hand - God's readiness to help us when we are in trouble
must not slacken, but quicken our endeavours to help ourselves. He
repeats the promise concerning her son, that he should be a great
nation, as a reason why she should bestir herself to help him.

[Genesis 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 21:31</span></span>

Beer - sheba - That is, the well of the oath, in remembrance of the
covenant that they sware to, that they might be ever mindful of it.

[Genesis 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 21:33</span></span>

And Abraham planted a grove - For a shade to his tent, or perhaps an
orchard of fruit trees; and there, though we cannot say he settled, for
God would have him while he lived to be a stranger and a pilgrim, yet he
sojourned many days. And called there on the name of the Lord - Probably
in the grove he planted, which was his oratory, or house of prayer: he
kept up publick worship, to which probably his neighbours resorted, and
joined with him. Men should not only retain their goodness wherever they
go, but do all they can to propagate it, and make others good. The
everlasting God - Though God had made himself known to Abraham as his
God in particular; yet he forgets not to give glory to him as the Lord
of all, the everlasting God, who was before all worlds, and will be when
time and days shall be no more.
