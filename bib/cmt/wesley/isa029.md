[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

The city - The royal city, and seat of David and his posterity. Set them
- Go on in killing sacrifices from time to time, one year after another,
whereby you think to appease me, but all shall be in vain.

[Isaiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 29:4</span></span>

And thou - Thou who now speakest so loftily, shall be humbled, and with
a low voice, beg the favour of thine enemies. As one - Who, that they
might possess the people with a kind of reverence and horror, used to
deliver their answers with a low voice, from some cave under the ground.

[Isaiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 29:5</span></span>

Strangers - Whom thou hast hired to assist thee, as indeed they did,
when the Chaldeans came against them. Terrible ones - Thy great
commanders, and stout soldiers. It - This destruction of thy strangers,
and terrible ones shall come to pass.

[Isaiah 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 29:6</span></span>

Thou - Thou, O Jerusalem. Fire - With dreadful judgments, which are
frequently expressed by these metaphors.

[Isaiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 29:8</span></span>

His soul - His appetite or desire is unsatisfied. So - No less
unsatisfied and insatiable; they shall be always thirsting after more of
your blood.

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

Wonder - At the stupidity of this people. Cry - Cry out again and again
through astonishment. They stagger - With giddiness or stupidity, which
makes them like drunken men, insensible of their danger.

[Isaiah 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 29:10</span></span>

Dead sleep - Hardness of heart, and insensibleness of your danger. Seers
- Your magistrates and ministers. Covered - With the veil of ignorance
and stupidity.

[Isaiah 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 29:12</span></span>

Of all - Of all, your prophets. As a book - In which no man can read,
while it is sealed up, as books then sometimes were, being made in the
form of rolls. Delivered - Unsealed and opened.

[Isaiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 29:13</span></span>

Draw near - Namely, in acts of worship. With lips - With outward
devotions. But - They do not pay me that love, and fear, and obedience,
which I require. And - They worship me not in such a manner, as I have
prescribed, but according to mens inventions, preferring the devices and
traditions of their false prophets, before my institutions.

[Isaiah 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 29:14</span></span>

Hid - Shall disappear and vanish.

[Isaiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 29:15</span></span>

Seek deep - A metaphor from men, who use to dig deep into the earth,
that they may hide any thing there. To hide - Vainly imagining, that
they can deceive, not only men, but God, by their external professions.
Who - Neither God nor man can discover us.

[Isaiah 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 29:16</span></span>

Surely - All your subtle devices, by which you turn yourselves into all
shapes. As clay - It is no more to me, than the clay is to the potter,
who can alter and dispose it as he sees fit.

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

As a forest - The forest of Lebanon, which was a barren mountain, shall
by God's providence, become a fruitful and populous place; and these
places which are now fruitful and populous, shall then become as barren
and desolate, as that forest. This is a prophecy of the rejection of the
Jews, and of the calling of the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 29:18</span></span>

Shall see - Being, by God's grace, brought out of gross, ignorance and
wickedness, unto a clear and saving knowledge of the truth.

[Isaiah 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 29:19</span></span>

Meek - The humble and meek believers. Poor - Mean and despicable people,
such as the Gentiles were in the opinion of the Jews, and such as the
greatest part of the first Christians were.

[Isaiah 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 29:20</span></span>

That watch - That early and diligently apply themselves to the practice
of wickedness.

[Isaiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 29:21</span></span>

That make a man - That condemn a man, as if he was a great criminal. For
him - For God's faithful prophets and ministers. The gate - There the
people used to assemble, both upon civil and sacred accounts, and there
prophets used to deliver their prophecies. Turn - From his right. The
just - The faithful ministers of God. Nought - Not for any great
advantage, but for a trifle.

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 29:22</span></span>

Redeemed - From manifold dangers, and especially from idolatry. Jacob -
The Israelites or posterity of Jacob, who had great cause to be ashamed,
for their continued infidelity, shall at last be brought back to the God
of their fathers, and to their Messiah. Pale - Through fear of their
enemies.

[Isaiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 29:23</span></span>

He seeth - When the believing seed of Jacob shall see those children,
whom they have begotten to God, by the gospel, even the Gentiles. The
work - The children, not of the flesh, but of the promise, whom I, by my
almighty grace, have regenerated. In the midst - Incorporated with the
Jews, into one and the same body. Shall sanctify - They shall glorify
God, with them and for them.

[Isaiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 29:24</span></span>

That erred - Those Gentiles who erred from God's truth. Murmured - They
that murmured at God's faithful teachers, shall now receive God's truth
in the love of it.
