### [2 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 4:1</span></span>

I charge thee therefore - This is deduced from the whole preceding
chapter. At his appearing and his kingdom - That is, at his appearing in
the kingdom of glory.

[2 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 4:2</span></span>

Be instant - Insist on, urge these things in season, out of season -
That is, continually, at all times and places. It might be translated,
with and without opportunity - Not only when a fair occasion is given:
even when there is none, one must be made.

[2 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 4:3</span></span>

For they will heap up teachers - Therefore thou hast need of "all
longsuffering." According to their own desires - Smooth as they can
wish. Having itching ears - Fond of novelty and variety, which the
number of new teachers, as well as their empty, soft, or philosophical
discourses, pleased. Such teachers, and such hearers, seldom are much
concerned with what is strict or to the purpose. Heap to themselves -
Not enduring sound doctrine, they will reject the sound preachers, and
gather together all that suit their own taste. Probably they send out
one another as teachers, and so are never at a loss for numbers.

[2 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 4:5</span></span>

Watch - An earnest, constant, persevering exercise. The scripture
watching, or waiting, implies steadfast faith, patient hope, labouring
love, unceasing prayer; yea, the mighty exertion of all the affections
of the soul that a man is capable of. In all things - Whatever you are
doing, yet in that, and in all things, watch. Do the work of an
evangelist - Which was next to that of an apostle.

[2 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 4:6</span></span>

The time of my departure is at hand - So undoubtedly God had shown him.
I am ready to be offered up - Literally, to be poured out, as the wine
and oil were on the ancient sacrifices.

[2 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 4:8</span></span>

The crown of that righteousness - Which God has imputed to me and
wrought in me. Will render to all - This increases the joy of Paul, and
encourages Timotheus. Many of these St. Paul himself had gained. That
have loved his appearing - Which only a real Christian can do. I say a
real Christian, to comply with the mode of the times: else they would
not understand, although the word Christian necessarily implies
whatsoever is holy, as God is holy. Strictly speaking, to join real or
sincere to a word of so complete an import, is grievously to debase its
noble signification, and is like adding long to eternity or wide to
immensity.

[2 Timothy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 4:9</span></span>

Come to me - Both that he might comfort him, and be strengthened by him.
Timotheus himself is said to have suffered at Ephesus.

[2 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 4:10</span></span>

Demas - Once my fellowlabourer, [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024.md). Hath forsaken me. Crescens,
probably a preacher also, is gone, with my consent, to Galatia, Titus to
Dalmatia, having now left Crete. These either went with him to Rome, or
visited him there.

[2 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 4:11</span></span>

Only Luke - Of my fellowlabourers, is with me - But God is with me; and
it is enough. Take Mark - Who, though he once "departed from the work,"
is now again profitable to me.

[2 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 4:13</span></span>

The cloak - Either the toga, which belonged to him as a Roman citizen,
or an upper garment, which might be needful as winter came on. Which I
left at Troas with Carpus - Who was probably his host there. Especially
the parchments - The books written on parchment.

[2 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 4:14</span></span>

The Lord will reward him - This he spoke prophetically.

[2 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 4:16</span></span>

All - My friends and companions. Forsook me - And do we expect to find
such as will not forsake us? My first defence - Before the savage
emperor Nero.

[2 Timothy 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 4:17</span></span>

The preaching - The gospel which we preach.

[2 Timothy 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 4:18</span></span>

And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work - Which is far more
than delivering me from death. Yea, and, over and above, preserve me
unto his heavenly kingdom - Far better than that of Nero.

[2 Timothy 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti2 4:20</span></span>

When I came on, Erastus abode at Corinth - Being chamberlain of the
city, [Rom 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md). But Trophimus I have
left sick - Not having power (as neither had any of the apostles) to
work miracles when he pleased, but only when God pleased.
