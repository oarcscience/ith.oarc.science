### [Job Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001)

[Job 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 33:3</span></span>

My words - I will not speak passionately or partially, but from a
sincere desire to do thee good. Clearly - What I speak will be plain,
not hard to be understood.

[Job 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 33:4</span></span>

Life - I am thy fellow creature, and am ready to discourse with thee
upon even terms, according to thy desire.

[Job 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 33:6</span></span>

Behold - I will plead with thee in God's name and stead, which thou hast
often wished, and I am God's creature like thyself.

[Job 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 33:9</span></span>

Clean - Not absolutely, for he often confesses himself to be a sinner,
but no such transgression, as might give God just occasion to punish him
so severely, as is implied, where he blames God for finding occasions
against him, implying that he had given him none by his sins. And thus
far Elihu's charge was just, and herein it differs from the charge of
Job's three friends, who often accuse him, for asserting his own
innocency; although they did it, because they thought him an hypocrite,
whereas Elihu does it upon other grounds, even because Job's
justification of himself was accompanied with reflections upon God.

[Job 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 33:11</span></span>

Marketh - He narrowly prys into all my actions, that he may find matter
against me.

[Job 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 33:12</span></span>

Not just - Thou art in the wrong. Greater - Not only in power and
majesty, but also in justice, and wisdom, and goodness, and therefore
thou dost foolishly, in censuring his judgments, thou castest off that
awe and reverence which thou shouldest constantly maintain towards thy
sovereign Lord.

[Job 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 33:13</span></span>

He - Useth not to give an account to his creatures of the grounds and
reasons of his judgments or dispensations as being the supreme governor
of all persons and things, in whose will it becometh all men to
acquiesce.

[Job 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 33:14</span></span>

Yet - Although he doth not give men an account of his matters, yet he
doth that which is sufficient for them. Twice - When once speaking doth
not awaken men, God is graciously pleased to give them another
admonition: though he will not gratify men's curiosity in enquiring into
his hidden judgments, yet he will acquaint them with their duty. God
speaks to us by conscience, by providence, and by ministers, of all
which Elihu here treats at large, to shew Job, that God was now telling
him his mind, and endeavouring to do him good. He shews first, how God
admonishes men by their own consciences.

[Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 33:16</span></span>

Sealeth - He imprints those instructions upon their minds.

[Job 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 33:17</span></span>

Pride - And God by this means is said to hide pride from man, because by
these glorious representations of his Divine majesty to man, he takes
him off from the admiration of his own excellency, and brings him to a
sight of his own weakness, and to an humble and ready submission to his
will.

[Job 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 33:18</span></span>

Keepeth - By his gracious admonitions whereby he leads him to
repentance.

[Job 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 33:19</span></span>

Pain - The second way whereby God instructs men and excites them to
repentance.

[Job 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 33:22</span></span>

The destroyers - The pangs of death, here called the destroyers, are
just ready to seize him.

[Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 33:23</span></span>

A messenger - A prophet or teacher. To expound the providence, and point
out the design of God therein. One, &c. - A person rightly qualified for
this great and hard work, such as there are but very few. To shew - To
direct him to the right way how he may please God, and procure that
mercy which he thirsts after; which is not by quarrelling with God, but
by an humble confession. and supplication for mercy through Christ the
redeemer.

[Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 33:24</span></span>

He - God. A ransom - Although I might justly destroy him, yet I will
spare him, for I have found out a way of ransoming sinners from death,
which is the death of my son, the redeemer of the world, and with
respect to which I will pardon them that repent and sue for mercy.
Observe how God glories in the invention! I have found, I have found a
ransom; a ransom for poor, undone sinners! I, even I am he that hath
done it.

[Job 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 33:26</span></span>

Render - He will deal with him as with one reconciled to him through the
mediator, and turning from sin to righteousness.

[Job 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 33:28</span></span>

Life - His life which was endangered, shall be restored and continued.
Yea, farther, God shall Deliver his soul from going into the pit of
hell: and his life shall see the light, all good, in the vision and
fruition of God.

[Job 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 33:29</span></span>

Lo - All these ways God uses to convince, and save sinners.

[Job 33:30](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 33:30</span></span>

To bring - That he may save men from being forever miserable, and make
them forever happy. "Lord, what is man, that thou shouldest thus visit
him? This should engage us, to comply with God's designs, to work with
him for our own good, and not to counter - work him. And this will
render those that perish inexcusable, that, so much was done to save
them, and they would not he healed." So Mr. Henry. Excellent words! But
how much did God do to save them? Did he ever do any thing to save them?
Did he ever design to save them? If not, how does that which was never
done, no nor designed, "render them inexcusable?"
