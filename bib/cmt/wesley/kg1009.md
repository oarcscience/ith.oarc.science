### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 9:3</span></span>

For ever - As long as the Mosaic dispensation lasts; whereas hitherto my
worship has been successively in several places. Eyes - My watchful and
gracious providence. Heart - My tender affection. Shall be there - Shall
be towards this place and people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 9:5</span></span>

Then - Upon that condition; for my promise to David was conditional.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 9:8</span></span>

High - Glorious and renowned. Astonished - At its unexpected and
wonderful ruin. Hiss - By way of contempt and derision.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 9:11</span></span>

Galilee - Or, near the land of Galilee, bordering upon it; in those
parts which were near, and adjoining to Hiram's dominions: with the
cities, understand the territories belonging to them. These cities,
though they were within those large bounds which God fixed to the land
of promise, [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018); [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004), yet were not within those parts
which were distributed by lot in Joshua's time. It is probable they were
not inhabited by Israelites, but by Canaanites, or other Heathens; who
being subdued, and extirpated by David or Solomon, those cities became a
part of their dominions; and afterwards were reckoned a part of Galilee,
as Josephus notes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 9:13</span></span>

Cabul - That is, of dirt, as most interpret it. Because, though the land
was very good, yet being a thick and stiff clay, and therefore requiring
great pains to manure it, it was very unsuitable to the disposition of
the Tyrians, who were delicate, and lazy, and luxurious, and wholly
given to merchandise. And on his returning them, there is no doubt but
Solomon gave him an equivalent more to his taste.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 9:14</span></span>

Sent - And this seems to be here added, both to declare the quantity of
the gold sent, which had been only named before, [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011), and as the reason why he
resented Solomon's action, because so great a sum required a better
recompense.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 9:15</span></span>

Raised - Both the levy of men; of which, [Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013), and the levy of money upon his
people and subjects. He raised this levy, both to pay what he owed to
Hiram, and to build the works following.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 9:21</span></span>

Those - He used them as bondmen, and imposed bodily labours upon them.
But why did not Solomon destroy them as God had commanded, when now it
was fully in his power to do so? The command of destroying them, [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002), did chiefly, if not only, concern
that generation of Canaanites, who lived in, or, near the time of the
Israelites entering into Canaan. And that command seems not to be
absolute, but conditional, and with some exception for those who should
submit and embrace the true religion, as may be gathered both from [Jos
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019), and from the history of the
Gibeonites. For if God's command had been absolute, the oaths of Joshua,
and of the princes, could not have obliged them, nor dispensed with such
a command.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 9:25</span></span>

Three times - That is, at the three solemn feasts: and undoubtedly at
all other appointed times.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 9:26</span></span>

Made - Not now, but in the beginning of his reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 9:27</span></span>

Knowledge of the sea - For which the Tyrians were famous. He sent also
ships to join with Solomon's, not from Tyre, the city of Phoenicia; but
from an island in the Red - sea, called Tyre, because it was a colony of
the Tyrians, as Strabo notes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 9:28</span></span>

Ophir - A place famous for the plenty and fineness of the gold there. It
is agreed, that it was a part of the East - Indies, probably Ceylon,
which though very remote from us, yet was far nearer the Red - sea, from
whence they might easily sail to it in those ancient times, because they
might (according to the manner of those first ages) sail all along near
the coast, though the voyage was thereby more tedious, which was the
reason why three years were spent in it. And here, and here only were to
be had all the commodities which Solomon fetched from Ophir, [Kg1
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022). Fetched - In all there came to
the king four hundred and fifty talents, whereof it seems thirty talents
were allowed to Hiram and his men, and so there were only four hundred
and twenty that came clear into the king's treasury.
