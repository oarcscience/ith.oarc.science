### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 21:1</span></span>

Reigned - In which time the years of his imprisonment are comprehended.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 21:3</span></span>

He built, &c. - Trampling on the dust and affronting the memory of his
worthy father. All the host of heaven - The sun, moon and stars.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 21:6</span></span>

Through the fire - Between two fires, by which he dedicated him to
Molock, in contempt of the seal of circumcision by which he had been
dedicated to God. Times - Lucky, or unlucky days according to the
superstitious practice of the heathens.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 21:7</span></span>

An image - The image of that Baal which was worshipped in the grove.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 21:9</span></span>

More evil - Partly, because they were not contented with those idols
which the Canaanites worshipped, but either invented, or borrowed from
other nations many new idols, and partly, because as their light was far
more clear, their obligations to God infinitely higher, and their helps
against idolatry much stronger than the Canaanites had; so their sins,
though the same in kind, were unspeakably worse in respect of these
dreadful aggravations.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 21:13</span></span>

The line - She shall have the same measure, the same judgments which
Samaria had. The line is often put for one's lot or portion, because
mens portions or possessions used to be measured by lines. A dish - As
men do with a dish that hath been used, first wholly empty it of all
that is in it, then throughly cleanse and wipe it; and lastly, turn it
upside down, that nothing may remain in it; so will I deal with
Jerusalem, throughly empty and purge it from all its wicked inhabitants.
Yet the comparison intimates, that this should be in order to the
purifying, not the final destruction of Jerusalem. The dish shall not be
broken in pieces, or wholly cast away, but only wiped.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 21:15</span></span>

Since, &c. - This forejudgment, though it was chiefly inflicted for the
sins of Manasseh and his generation, yet had a respect unto all their
former sins.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 21:16</span></span>

Blood - The blood of those prophets and righteous men who either
reproved his sinful practices, or refused to comply with his wicked
commands. His sin - His idolatry, which is called sin, by way of
eminency. The tradition of the Jews is, that he caused Isaiah in
particular to be sawn asunder.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg2 21:18</span></span>

Garden - Not in the sepulchre of the kings; probably, by his own choice
and command, as a lasting testimony of his sincere repentance and
abhorrence of himself for his former crime.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 21:21</span></span>

He walked, &c. - He revived that idolatry which Manasseh in the latter
end of his reign had put down. Those who set bad examples, if they
repent themselves, cannot be sure that they whom their example has drawn
into sin will repent. It is often otherwise.
