<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 10:9</span></span>

Looked - Attentively viewed. Beryl stone - Of sea - green.

[Ezekiel 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 10:10</span></span>

They - The wheels. This intimates the references of providence to each
other, and their dependences on each other: and the joint tendency of
all to one common end, while their motions appear to us intricate and
perplexed, yea, seemingly contrary.

[Ezekiel 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 10:11</span></span>

When - The wheels moved by the cherubim, or that spirit of life, which
moved the living creatures. They went - They were so framed, that they
could move on all four sides without the difficulty and delay of
turning. Head - Of the living creatures.

[Ezekiel 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 10:12</span></span>

And - Now he describes both the cherubim and wheels as full of wisdom,
and as governed by an excellent wisdom. The wheels - Which the four
cherubim had to move, govern, and direct.

[Ezekiel 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 10:13</span></span>

The wheels - As to their frame and motion. It was cried - Still there
was one who guided, as by vocal direction. Unto them - To each of them.

[Ezekiel 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 10:14</span></span>

Every one - Of the living creatures, [Eze
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md).

[Ezekiel 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 10:17</span></span>

For - There is a perfect harmony between second causes in their
dependence on, and subjection to, the one infinite, wise, good, holy,
and just God. The spirit of God directs all the creatures, upper and
lower, so that they shall serve the divine purpose. Events are not
determined by the wheel of fortune, which is blind, but by the wheels of
providence, which are full of eyes.

[Ezekiel 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 10:18</span></span>

And stood - On the right side of the house, where the cherubim were in

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 10:19</span></span>

And every one - The glory, the cherubim, the wheels, all stood,
respiting execution, and giving opportunity of preventing the
approaching misery. The east gate - The last court, the court of the
people.

[Ezekiel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 10:20</span></span>

I knew - Either by special assurance as a prophet, or by comparing them
with those which he had often seen in the temple.
