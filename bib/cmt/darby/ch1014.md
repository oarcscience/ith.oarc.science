### [1 Chronicles Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001)

The history of the royalty continues. David establishes himself at
Jerusalem, and Jehovah confirms the kingdom in his hands, and it is
lifted up on high because of His people. Having inquired of God and
exactly followed His directions, David twice gains a complete victory
over the Philistines. Being thus blessed of Jehovah, his fame goes out
into all lands.
