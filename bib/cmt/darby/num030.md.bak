### [Numbers Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#001.md)

Chapter 30 is the case of the vows of women, which has reference also to
the fate of Israel, who have indeed taken these vows upon themselves, in
the hearing of God, and He has not disannulled them in His government
here below; and Israel have continued responsible to the vow wherewith
they have bound themselves, and of which, on the other hand, the
precious Saviour has been obliged to take the burden upon Himself.
