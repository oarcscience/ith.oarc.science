### [Psalms Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

The first, Psalm 3, gives the condition in general in contrast with
Psalm 2, and the support and confidence of faith in it. The troublers of
the godly man are multiplied, haughty, and triumphing over him as having
no help in God; but Jehovah is his shield. He lies down in peace, and by
faith sees his enemies smitten and their power destroyed. Salvation
belongs to Jehovah, and His blessing is upon His people. Here again,
remark, we find the latter days; and, though surrounded by his enemies,
the godly man rests in peace and prophetically sees their destruction,
and blessing on Israel. It expresses confidence in God in the midst of
hostile numbers, and without resource. Christ has surely entered fully
into this; but the place of the psalm is in the latter days, after proof
of the non accomplishment of Psalm 2, at His first presenting Himself as
Messiah to Israel.
