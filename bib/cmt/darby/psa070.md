### [Psalms Chapter 70](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001)

Psalm 70 embodies the desire of the Spirit of Christ in connection with
His sufferings from man, (but expresses itself, as in the remnant in
that day); that His enemies may be confounded those that say, Aha, aha,
as they did when He was on the cross; that those that seek Jehovah may
rejoice, and be glad and rejoice, and those who look for His deliverance
say, Let God be magnifiedthat is, enjoy that deliverance. For this, He,
as on earth, is content to be poor and needy, and nothing else, to the
end. Still He trusts in Jehovah; He is His help and deliverer. He is
assured He will come. He asks He may not tarry. Any saint of the remnant
could say it doubtless; but it is a summing up of the principle on which
the Spirit of Christ speaks in them, and of His personal association
with their sorrows, and thus in principle furnishes a key. It will be
remarked that from [Psa 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013) the
covenant name of Jehovah is introduced.
