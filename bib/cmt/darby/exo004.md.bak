### [Exodus Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)

Moses still raises difficulties, and God gives him again signs,
remarkable signs. The two first seem to me in their character-types, the
first, of sin and of its healing; the second, of power, which, having
become Satanic, is taken back, and becomes the rod of God; and then
presents that which refreshes, coming from God, as having become
judgment and death. But we must note here the difference of what was
then given to Moses and what occurred in Egypt. Here in the two personal
signs there is first restoration (the leprosy is healed), and then power
from which Moses fled becomes the rod of God in his hand The water
becoming blood is simple judgment. In Egypt the first is not found, he
acted for God there, but there was a much larger development of the two
last signs. The persona healing, that is, and removal of sin there was
nothing of. But power completely destroys all manifestation of Satanic
power and the worshipped source of wealth for the flesh and the world
became death and judgment to it. But Moses refuses still and the wrath
of God is kindled against him; yet He acts in mercy, in a way, however,
humbling to Moses, with whom h now joins Aaron his brother whom He had
already prepared for that, and who had come out of Egypt to meet him;
for the folly of His children, while it is to their shame and to their
loss accomplishes the purposes of God.

Whatever may be the power of Him that delivers, it is necessary that
circumcision should be found in him who is interested in, and who is
used as an instrument of the deliverance; for the Saviour-God is a God
of holiness; it is in holiness and in judging sin, that He delivers: and
acting in holiness He does not suffer sin in those who are co-workers
for Him with whom He is in contact; for He comes out of His place in
judgment. For us the question is of being dead to sin, the true
circumcision; our Moses is a bloody husband to her who has to do with
him. God cannot use the flesh in the fight against Satan. He cannot
suffer it Himself, for He is in His place in judgment. Satan also would
have power over it, and of right; God therefore puts it to death
Himself, and this is done for us on the cross, where He who knew no sin
was made sin for us (compare [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md). And He wills that this should be
accomplished in us also. This is true of those who compose the assembly;
but they can reckon themselves dead. We bear about in the body the dying
of the Lord Jesus \[See Note \#1\]. It will be true in one way more
evidently, in judgment at the last day, when the Lord pleads with all
flesh, and identifies Himself with those who have not taken part
spiritually in the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, the Christian's
place. God will purge Jerusalem by the spirit of burning.

Note \#1

In Colossians 3 we find God's judgment of him in whom Christ (compare
[Rom 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010).md); in Romans 6 faith reckons
it so: in 2 Corinthians 4 it is practically realised. And God proves the
faith, but to confirm the soul in it. See 2 Corinthians 1 and 4.
