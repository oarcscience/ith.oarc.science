### [James Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md)

The two classes in Israel are distinctly marked here in contrast with
one another, with the addition of the walk which the Christian ought to
pursue when chastised by the Lord.

The apostle gives the coming of the Lord as the term of their condition,
both to the unbelieving rich oppressors in Israel, and to the poor
believing remnant. The rich have heaped up treasures for the last days;
the oppressed poor are to be patient until the Lord Himself shall come
to deliver them. Moreover, he says, deliverance would not be delayed.
The husbandman waits for the rain and the times of harvest; the
Christina for his Master's coming. This patience characterizes, as we
have seen, the walk of faith. It had been witnessed in the prophets; and
in the case of others we count them happy which endure afflictions for
the Lord's sake. Job shews us the ways of the Lord: he needed to have
patience, but the end of the Lord was blessing and tender mercy towards
him.

This expectation of the coming of the Lord was a solemn warning, and at
the same time the strongest encouragement, but one which maintained the
true character of the Christian's practical life. It shewed also what
the selfishness of man's will would end in, and it restrained all action
of that will in believers. The feelings of brethren towards each other
were placed under the safeguard of this same truth. They were not to
have a spirit of discontent, or to murmur against others who were
perhaps more favoured in their outward circumstances: "the judge stood
before the door."

Oaths displayed still more the forgetfulness of God, and the actings
consequently of the self-will of nature. "Yea," ought to be yea, and
"Nay," nay. The actings of the divine nature in the consciousness of the
presence of God, and the repression of all human will and of sinful
nature, is what the writer of this epistle desires.

Now there were resources in Christianity both for joy and sorrow. If any
were afflicted, let them pray (God was ready to hear); if happy, let
them sing; if sick, send for the elders of the assembly, who would pray
for the sufferer and anoint him, and the chastisement would be removed,
and the sins for which, according to God's government, he was thus
chastised, would be forgiven as regards that government; for it is that
only which is here spoken of.

The imputation of sin for condemnation has no place here. The efficacy
of the prayer of faith is set before us; but it is in connection with
the maintenance of sincerity of heart. The government of God is
exercised with regard to His people. He chastises them by sickness; and
it is important that truth in the inner man should be maintained. Men
hide their faults; theydesire to walk as if all were going on well; but
God judges His people. He tries the heart and the reins. They are held
in bonds of affliction. God shews them their faults, or their unbroken
self-will. Man "is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the
multitude of his bones with strong pain." ([Job
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019).md) And now the church of God
intervenes in charity, and according to its own order, by means of the
elders; the sick man commits himself to God, confessing his state of
need; the charity of the church acts and brings him who is chastised,
according to this relationship, before God for that is where the church
is. Faith pleads this relationship of grace; the sick man is healed. If
sins and not merely the need of discipline were the cause of his
chastisement, those sins will not hinder his being healed, they shall be
forgiven him.

The apostle then presents the principle in general as the course for
all, namely , to open their hearts to each other, in order to maintain
truth in the inner man as to oneself; and to pray for each other in
order that charity should be in full exercise with regard to the faults
of others; grace and truth being thus spiritually formed in the church,
and a perfect union of heart among Christians, so that even their faults
are an occasion for the exercise of charity (as in God towards us), and
entire confidence in each other, according to that charity, such as is
felt towards a restoring and pardoning God. What a beautiful picture is
presented of divine principles animating men and causing them to act
according to the nature of God Himself, and the influence of His love
upon the heart.

We may remark, that it is not confession to the elders that is spoken
of. That would have been confidence in men official confidence. God
desires the operation of divine charity in all. Confession to one
another shews the condition of the church, and God would have the church
to be in such a state, that love should so reign in it, that they should
be so near to God, as to be able to treat the transgressor according to
the grace they know in Him: and that this love should be so realised,
that perfect inward sincerity should be produced by the confidence and
operation of grace. Official confession destroys all this is contrary to
it. How divine the wisdom which omitted confession when speaking of the
elders, but which commands it as the living and voluntary impression of
the heart!

This leads us also to the value of the energetic prayers of the
righteous man. It is his nearness to God, the sense that he has
consequently of that which God is, which (through grace and the
operation of the Spirit) gives him this power. God takes account of men,
and that according to the infinitude of His love. He takes account of
the trust in Himself, the faith in His word, shewn by one who thinks and
acts according to a just appreciation of what He is. That is always
faith, which makes sensible to us that which se do not see God Himself,
who acts in accordance with the revelation that He has given of Himself.
Now the man who in the practical sense is righteous through grace, is
near to God; as being righteous, he has not to do with God for himself
with regard to sin, which would keep his heart a t a distance; his heart
is thus free to draw nigh to God, according to His holy nature on behalf
of others; and, moved by the divine nature, which animates him and which
enables him to appreciate God, he seeks, according to the activity of
that nature, that his prayers may prevail with God whether for the good
of others or for the glory of God Himself in His service. And God
answers, according to that same nature, by blessing this trust and
responding to it, in order to manifest what He is for faith, to
encourage it by sanctioning its activity, putting His seal on the man
who walks by faith. \[See Note \#2\]

The Spirit of God acts we know in all this; but the apostle does not
here speak of Him, being occupied with the practical effect, and
presenting the man as he is seen, acting under the influence of this
nature in its positive energy with regard to God, and near to Him, so
that it acts in all its intensity, moved by the power of that nearness.
But if we consider the action of the Spirit, these thoughts are
confirmed. The righteous man does not grieve the Holy Ghost, and the
Spirit works in him according to His own power, but acting in the man
according to the poser of his communion.

Finally, we have the assurance that the ardent and energetic prayer of
the righteous man has great efficacy: it is the prayer of faith, which
knows God and counts upon Him and draws near Him. The case of Elijah is
interesting, as shewing us (and there are other examples of the same
king) how the Holy Ghost acts inwardly in a man where we see the outward
manifestation of poser. In the history we have Elijah's declaration:
"Jehovah liveth, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
according to my word." This is the authority, the power, exercised in
the name of Jehovah. In our epistle the secret operation, that which
passes between the soul and God, is set forth. He prayed, and God heard
him. We have the same testimony on the part of Jesus at the tomb of
Lazarus. Only that in the latter case we have the two together, except
that the prayer itself is not given unless in the unutterable groan of
Christ's spirit.

Comparing Galatians 2 with the history in Acts 15, we find a revelation
from God which determined Paul's conduct, whatever outward motives there
may have been which were known to all. By such cases as those which the
apostle proposes to the church, and those of Elijah and the Lord Jesus,
a God, living acting, and interesting Himself in all that happens among
His people, is revealed to us.

There is also the activity of love towards those who err. If any one
departs from the truth, and they bring him back by grace, let it be
known that to bring back a sinner form the error of his ways is the
exercise simple as our action in it may be of power that delivers a soul
from death; accordingly all those sins which spread themselves in their
odious nature before the eyes of God, and offended His glory and His
heart by their presence in His uniVerse, are covered. The soul being
brought to God by grace, all its sins are pardoned, appear no more, are
blotted out form before the face of God. The apostle (as throughout)
does not speak of the power that acts in this work of love, but of the
fact. He applies it to cases that had happened among them; but he
establishes a universal principle with regard to the activity of grace
in the heart that is animated by it. The erring soul is saved; the sin
put away from before God.

Charity in the assembly suppresses, so to speak, the sins which
otherwise would destroy union and overcome that charity in the assembly,
and appear in all their deformity and all their malignancy before God.
Whereas, being met by love in the assembly, they go no farther, are, as
it were (as regards the state of things before God in this world).
dissolved and put away by the charity which they could not vanquish. The
sin is vanquished by the love which dealt with it, disappears, is
swallowed up by it. Thus love covers a multitude of sins. Here it is its
action in the conversion of a sinner.

Note \#2

It is well to remember that this is carried out in respect of the
governing ways of God, and thus under the title of Lord a place which
Christ specially holds, though here the term is used generally. Compare
[Jam 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011.md), and the general Jewish
reference of the passage. To us we have one God the Father, and one Lord
Jesus Christ. He is become Lord and Christ, and every tongue shall
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
