### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001.md)

Psalm 56 expresses the sense of the bitter and relentless enmity of the
wicked, but the tears of the godly are put in God's bottle. God is owned
as the Most High, the title of promise but not of covenant (that of
covenant is Jehovah); and here the remnant are cast out. But the word of
God is a sure trusting place. It carries the truth of God as its basis
to the soul, and contains all the expression of His goodness, and ways,
and faithfulness, and interest also in His people. Hence there is no
fear of man. The soul of the godly was delivered from death; he had
escaped and fled, and now he looks to God that his feet may be kept,
that he may walk before God in the light of the living. As the
expression of the tried heart driven out, but so escaped, it has a most
clear and distinct place.
