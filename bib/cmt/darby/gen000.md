Introduction to Genesis

Genesis has a character of its own; and, as the beginning of the Holy
Book, presents to us all the great elementary principles which find
their development in the history of the relationships of God with man,
which is recorded in the following books. The germ of each of these
principles will be found here, unless we except the law. There was
however a law given to Adam in his innocence; and Hagar, we know,
prefigures at least Sinai. There is scarce anything afterwards
accomplished of which the expression is not found in this book in one
form or another. There is found also in it, though the sad history of
man's fall be there, a freshness in the relationship of men with God,
which is scarce met with afterwards in men accustomed to abuse it and to
live in a society full of itself. But whether it be the creation, man
and his fall, sin, the power of Satan, the promises, the call of God,
His judgment of the world, redemption, the covenants, the separation of
the people of God, their condition of strangers on the earth, the
resurrection, the establishment of Israel in the land of Canaan, the
blessing of the nations, the seed of promise, the exaltation of a
rejected Lord to the throne of the world, all are found here in fact or
in figure-in figure, now that we have the key, even the church itself.
