<p>The following commentary covers Chapters 33 and 34.
<p>Chapters 33, 34 announce the last two great acts of judgment. At the moment when God establishes Himself in Zion, and fills it with righteousness, a final and powerful enemy (whom I believe to be the same as the Gog of Ezekiel), who had come up to spoil the land, appears on the scene. But there are those who wait upon Jehovah, and He arises, and the enemy is put to flight. They gather the spoil of those who thought to despoil Israel. In Verses 14, 15 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014">Isa 33:14-15</A>), the faithful remnant are distinguished. The Messiah appears in His beauty; and, all being at peace after the destruction of this enemy, the most distant parts of the land are open to the inhabitants of Zion, which is established in safety for ever. Chapter 34 reveals the terrible judgments which will fall upon the other nations in Edom (compare chap. 63). [See Note #1] Here it is those who have oppressed Zion, and the vengeance that God takes on oppressors. Idumea is itself the particular object of this; but all the enemies of Israel, who were associated with Edom, the armies of the nations assembled against Jerusalem, will perish by the judgment of Jehovah in the land of Edom.
<p>Note #1
<p>Compare also Psalm 83 and Obadiah.
