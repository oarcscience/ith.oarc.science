### [Isaiah Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001.md)

Then, in chapter 32, the Messiah should reign in righteousness and set
everything morally in order. Zion would in fact be a wilderness until
the Spirit was poured out from on high, and then it should become a
Carmel; and that which before had passed for a Carmel should be counted
comparatively but a wilderness. Righteousness should be established
everywhere, and peace, the fruit of righteousness, when the hail should
come down upon the lofty ones who bear no fruit; and the city, the
organisation of human pride, should be utterly abased. The last Verse
([Isa 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020).md) appears to me to speak of
the blessedness of full earthly peace.
