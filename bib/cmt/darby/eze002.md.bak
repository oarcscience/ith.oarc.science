### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001.md)

In testimony and example, as to his prophetic relation, the same thing
happens in Ezekiel's case. God is rejected; His prophet takes this
place, with the throne, to judge the whole nation, and especially
Jerusalem, announcing at the same time (to faith) their re-establishment
in grace. He is sent from Jehovah to a rebellious people, to say,
Jehovah has spoken, whether they would hear or not. The judgment would
make it known that a prophet had been among them. His first testimony is
composed of lamentations, and mourning, and woe; nevertheless the
communication of the word of God is always full of sweetness, looked at
as a revelation from Him, and as taking place between God and man (chap.
2). Some important principles in the relations of God with Israel are
developed in chapter 3.

But we have yet to notice a feature that characterises the Book of
Ezekiel, comparing it with that of Jeremiah. The latter addresses
himself immediately to his contemporaries (that is to say, to the people
of God) in a testimony which, making its way through the bruised and
wounded heart of the prophet, exhibits the marvellous patience of God,
who, up to the last moment, invites His people to repentance. It is not
thus with Ezekiel. He announces that which necessitates the judgment. He
is sent indeed to Israel, but to Israel in a hardened condition. His
mouth is shut as to the people; he is not to rebuke them. He may
communicate to them certain declarations of Jehovah at a suitable time,
when Jehovah opens his mouth to make them understand that there is a
prophet among them; but he does not address himself directly and morally
to the people, as being still the object of God's dealings. Jehovah
reveals to him the iniquities that oblige Him to cast off His people,
and no longer to act towards them on principles of government
established by Himself, as with a people whom He acknowledged. It is, on
God's part, a setting forth of Israel's conduct as the occasion of the
rupture of His relations with them. At the same time certain new
principles of conduct are revealed. I speak of that part of the prophecy
which relates to Israel; for there are also sundry judgments upon the
Gentiles, and a description of the future state of the land, as well as
of the temple-a state which the prophet was to communicate to Israel in
case they should repent.
