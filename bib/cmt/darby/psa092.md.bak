### [Psalms Chapter 92](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md)

Psalm 92 takes up these names of God, Jehovah and Most High; only it is
no longer a secret place, known only to fidelity and faith. Almighty
power secured blessing and answers faith; Verses 7-8 explain how ([Psa
92:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#007).md). What is celebrated is not the
disciplinary exercise of faith, but the answer to it, showing that
Jehovah ([Psa 92:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#015).md) is upright, and
that there is no unrighteousness in Him. Psalms 90, 91, 92 go together
as an introduction to the great theme that follows, Jehovah reigns.
Already power had been displayed; and the full result in the judgment of
all enemies and abiding blessing is looked for now, not merely as hope,
but as founded on the manifested intervention of God. It is spoken in
the place which Messiah had taken in the previous psalm, identified
there in spirit with Israel in the latter days, Israel restored by
divine power, but not yet in the full peaceful enjoyment of divine
blessing, just as we have seen in Book 3. Messiah takes therefore the
lead in praises, and looks to His horn being exalted with honor (compare
[Psa 75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010).md). But Jehovah's thoughts
are deeper. He sees far, even the end from the beginning, and
accomplishes all His purposes and His word. This is what faith has to
remember.
