<p>Chapter 14 refers to a famine which took place in the land. The desolation of Jerusalem by the sword and by famine is again declared. But observe here the touching intercession of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007">Jer 14:7-9</A>; and again in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017">Jer 14:17-22</A>, the deep affliction of the Spirit of Christ which expresses itself in the prophet's mouth. "For in all their affliction he was afflicted." Observe also another element of their condition, pointed out by the Apostle Peter, and by the Lord Himself, with reference to the last days-namely, false prophets.
