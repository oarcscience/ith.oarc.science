Introduction to Song of Songs

This Book takes up the Jew, or at least the remnant, in quite another
aspect. It tells of the affections that the King can create in their
heart, and by which He draws them to Himself. However strong these
affections may be. they are not developed according to the position in
which christian affections, properly so called, are formed. They differ
in this respect. They do not possess the profound repose and sweetness
of an affection that flows from a relationship already formed, known,
and fully appreciated, the bonds of which are formed and recognised,
that counts upon the full and constant acknowledgment of the
relationship, and that each party enjoys, as a certain thing, in the
heart of the other. The desire of one who loves, and is seeking the
affections of the beloved object, is not the sweet, entire, and
established affection of the wife, with whom marriage has formed an
indissoluble union. To the former the relationship is only in desire,
the consequence of the state of heart; to the latter the state of heart
is the consequence of the relationship. Now, although the marriage of
the Lamb is not yet come, nevertheless, on account of the revelation
which has been made to us, and of the accomplishment of our salvation,
this latter character of affection is that which is proper to the
assembly. Praise and glory be to God for it! We know whom we have
believed. The strength and energy of desire is, however, still
maintained, because glory and the marriage of the Lamb are yet future.
What a position is that of the assembly! The entire confidence of the
relationship on the one hand, the ardent expectation of the betrothed of
the Lord on the other, whose love, however, is well known; an
expectation that is linked with the glory in which He will come to
receive her to Himself, to be for ever with Him.

This is not the position of the Jew. The point for him is to know that
his Beloved is his. That is the question. That there is a principle in
common is true. Christ loves His assembly, He loves His earthly people,
He loves the soul that He draws to Himself. So that there is a moral
application to ourselves which is very precious. Nevertheless it is
important that we distinguish and do not apply to the assembly that
which relates to Israel. Otherwise we shall not have the right character
of affection, and shall fail in that which is due to Christ.

The Song of Songs gives then the re-establishment of the relations
between Christ and the remnant, in order that by exercise of
heart-necessary on account of their position-they may be confirmed in
the assurance of His love, and in the knowledge that all is of grace,
and a grace that can never fail. Then is He fully known as Solomon. His
heart becomes like the chariot of His willing people (Ammi-nadib), which
carries Him away.

[Sol 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#001.md) affords us a passage which
may serve to express the state of mind treated in the book. "Oh that
thou wert as my brother! when I should find thee without I would kiss
thee!" Nevertheless, the Spirit of God desiring to assure the heart of
the remnant of the Saviour's love, we see that the expression of the
heart's desire to possess its Beloved does not cease until it has gained
its object. The heart assures itself according to the operation of the
Spirit of prophecy; for in fact Christ is for the remnant, and the
remnant is for Him. The whole is based on this. But the heart needs to
be reassured, as in a similar case we observe in other passages.

Having thus given the general idea, we shall point out some features
that are developed in the course of this book, and that possess a moral
import of great interest to ourselves.
