### [Psalms Chapter 72](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md)

Psalm 72 introduces us, not to David in suffering and conflict, but to
the full reign of peace and royal blessing. It is the Son of David we
have here, the source and securer of millennial blessings. I know not
that this psalm requires much explanation by reason of its clearness. It
is the king to whom God gives His judgments, and who is at the same time
the king's Son, the Son of David, in His reign of righteousness and
peace, as Solomon or Melchisedec. His kingdom has the full extent of
promise, but all kings fall down before Him. Blessings of every kind
accompany this reign of righteousness. The expression "prayer shall be
made continually for him" shows simply, that the blessings enjoyed
through Him raise the desire and request for His glory and continuance
in power. While literally spoken of Solomon, I think it would point out
Christ reigning as a true man upon earth. Verse 17 ([Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017).md) shows, I think, it is not
uncertainty of duration, but the effects of His rule on the hearts of
all that are under it. There will be a prince of the house of David in
Jerusalem, I suppose: still this, I think, looks beyond him.

This closes the Book. We have seen in it the godly ones cast out; their
distress and confidence in this position; this ending in the certainty
and confidence of restoration; and then Messiah's deliverance and
exaltation and previous humiliation the glorious and yet humbled person
being thus brought outand then the human royal rule established in
Israel. This ends the dealings with the remnant in the land, looked at
as apart from the rest.
