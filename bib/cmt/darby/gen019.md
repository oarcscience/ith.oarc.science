### [Genesis Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001.md)

Lot, in the following chapter, because of his connection with the
heavenly man, depositary of God's counsels and wisdom, and intercessor,
himself down in the plain of this world, which he had chosen, as the
Jews have, is delivered by providential power; but he passes through the
tribulation, and suffers the loss of all that for which he had refused
the heavenly condition, and sought the earth, as ignorant of the
judgment as he was of the heavenly treasure. Such is the position of the
people of faith when sunk into the world of judgment. Soon abandoned to
the uncertainty of unbelief in the presence of visible judgment, he
seeks his refuge in that place of Abraham's blessing to which he had
previously been afraid to flee, and which he had earlier abandoned for
the ease of the well-watered plain; but he is in miserable darkness, the
parent of a perpetual thorn to the people of God. But this last part is
only historically given, that Israel might know the origin of Moab and
Ammon; and furnishes a general principle for all times. Thus faith had
its place, and the world had been judged. So will it be in the days of
the Son of man; but here the heir is not yet actually brought in, but
expected, and the path of faith, or the opposite, till He comes
depicted.
