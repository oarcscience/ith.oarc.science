### [Exodus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)

Up to this all was grace, though there were dependence and conflict. The
murmurs of the people had only served to shew the riches of the grace of
God, who displayed His sovereignty in giving them all they could desire;
which appears so much the more striking, because afterwards the same
desires, under the law, brought very bitter chastisements. At length,
after this reign of grace, follows the order of divine government, what
will be realised in the millennium (chap. 18), where the king in
Jeshurun judges in righteousness, establishes order and government, the
Gentiles eat and offer sacrifices with Israel, and acknowledge that the
God of the Jews is exalted above all gods. All this was the acting of
God's grace and power.

During the days of the deliverance of Israel Moses's wife had been sent
away, as the church during the tribulation, and as the church will
appear in the joy of Israel's deliverance, so now Zipporah appears again
upon the scene, and we have not only Gershom, "a pilgrim in a foreign
land," but a second son, Eliezer; "for," Moses said, "the God of my
fathers was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh." The
application of this to the future deliverance of Israel is too evident
to require any lengthened explanation.
