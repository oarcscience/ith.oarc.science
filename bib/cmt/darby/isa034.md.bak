### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 33 and 34.

Chapters 33, 34 announce the last two great acts of judgment. At the
moment when God establishes Himself in Zion, and fills it with
righteousness, a final and powerful enemy (whom I believe to be the same
as the Gog of Ezekiel), who had come up to spoil the land, appears on
the scene. But there are those who wait upon Jehovah, and He arises, and
the enemy is put to flight. They gather the spoil of those who thought
to despoil Israel. In Verses 14, 15 ([Isa
33:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014).md), the faithful remnant are
distinguished. The Messiah appears in His beauty; and, all being at
peace after the destruction of this enemy, the most distant parts of the
land are open to the inhabitants of Zion, which is established in safety
for ever. Chapter 34 reveals the terrible judgments which will fall upon
the other nations in Edom (compare chap. 63). \[See Note \#1\] Here it
is those who have oppressed Zion, and the vengeance that God takes on
oppressors. Idumea is itself the particular object of this; but all the
enemies of Israel, who were associated with Edom, the armies of the
nations assembled against Jerusalem, will perish by the judgment of
Jehovah in the land of Edom.

Note \#1

Compare also Psalm 83 and Obadiah.
