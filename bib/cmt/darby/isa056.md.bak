### [Isaiah Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 55, 56, and 57.

Chapters 55, 56, 57 are exhortations given in view of these things.
Chapter 55 is full free grace, which consequently embraces the Gentiles.
For this reason it can be applied as a principle to the gospel. Its
accomplishment will be in the time of blessings to the earth through the
Lord's presence. Chapter 56 gives the moral character that is necessary
to enjoy the blessing, which is no longer according to the narrow legal
principles of former days. His house shall in fact be a house of prayer
for all those whose hearts are truly turned unto the God of Israel; and
they shall be joyful in it. Chapter 57 denounces (we may say, on the
same principle) those even in Israel who morally walk contrary to the
will of God. The righteous might perish. But it would only be taking
them from the evil to come. But whether it were Israel or not, there
would be no peace for the wicked. These three chapters then give the
moral instruction that belongs to those days. The faithful shall be
blessed, and the meek, be they who they may; the wicked shall be judged,
whether of Israel or not. Thus closes, as I have said, with chapter 57
the second subdivision of this part of the prophecy.
