### [Psalms Chapter 95](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)

From Psalms 95 to 100 we have the progress of the introduction of the
Only-begotten into the world most distinctly brought out; but here, all
through, seen as Jehovah coming from heaven in judgment, and at length
taking His place between the cherubim, and calling up the world to
worship Him there. It puts the setting up of Israel in blessing by
power, in contrast with their old failure when first delivered.

Psalm 95 summons Israel to come with joyful songs and thanksgiving
before Jehovah (verses 3-4 ([Psa
95:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#003).md) describing His excellency
above the gods and as Creator). But Jehovah is Israel's Maker, his God
also; and now they may look for rest even after so long time and
continued failure. Till power comes in to judgment, while it is called
today for in that great tomorrow no evil and no rebellious will be
allowed they are called upon not to harden their hearts as of old in the
wilderness, when God swear that they should not enter into His rest. But
now, after all, grace says Today, and invites to come before His
presence who is the rock of their salvation.
