### [Joshua Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 12 through 24.

Chapter 12 is only a summary of their conquests. The Holy Ghost not only
gives us the victory over our enemies, but makes us understand and know
the whole extent of the country, and defines the particular portion of
each; giving us details of everything it contains; of God's perfect
arrangements for the appropriation of the whole, and the distribution of
each part of His people, so as to produce a well-ordered whole, and
perfect in all its parts, according to the wisdom of God. But here we
have to realise the distinction maintained in the New Testament between
the gifts of God, and the enjoyment of the gifts given. "Ye have an
unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things." "He hath made us sit
together in heavenly places by the same power which placed Christ there,
when He raised Him from the dead and set Him above every name that is
named. Alas! how many earthly things still remain unsubdued among
Christians. But the Holy Ghost takes cognizance of this condition, in
view of, and in connection with, that which rightfully belongs to them:
it is this which enables us to understand the second division of this
book.

Although there was still a considerable part of the land to be
possessed, Joshua parcels out the whole amongst the tribes of Israel,
according to the command of Jehovah, who declares that He will Himself
drive out its inhabitants before them. But the people poorly responded
to this promise. The cities of the Philistines were indeed taken, but
their inhabitants were not exterminated; they were spared, and soon
regained power. Here we may remark that, wherever there is faithfulness,
there is rest. The effect of Joshua's work was, that "the land had rest
from war"; so also with that of Caleb ([Jos
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015).md). When the cities of the Levites
were allotted them, we find the same thing again ([Jos
21:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043).md). It is not so in detail. The
whole extent of country is given to Israel, and each tribe has his
share; the portion, therefore, which fell to each tribe was given them
in full right by Jehovah Himself. Their borders were marked out; for the
Spirit of God takes notice of everything in distributing the spiritual
inheritance, and gives to each according to the mind of God. There is
nothing uncertain in God's arrangements. But we find that not one tribe
drove out all the enemies of God from His inheritance, not one realised
the possession of all that God had given him.

Judah and Joseph take possession of their lots. We know that they always
remained chief amongst Israel, fulfilling thus the counsels of God as to
royalty for Judah, and the birthright which fell by grace to Joseph
(chaps. 15-17; see [Ch1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#002).md). The
tabernacle of God was also set up in peace (chap. 18); but, once at
rest, the tribes are very slow in taking possession of their portion-too
frequently the history of God's people. Having found peace, they neglect
His promises. Nevertheless, as we have seen, the Spirit of God did not
fail to point out to the people in detail all that belonged to them.

The cities of refuge are appointed (chap. 20); that is, the land being
Jehovah's, provision is made that it may not be defiled, and for the
return of every man to his inheritance, after he had fled from it for a
time, because of killing some person unawares. We have already seen the
force of this. Only we may remark here, that not only have we seen
spiritual title to all at once before Jericho-the rights of Jehovah
maintained in the case of the king of Ai and mount Ebal, as the ground
of present possession-but provision for restoration to enjoyment of the
inheritance in detail when temporarily lost, which, in figure, applies
to the people in the last days.

The establishment of the two tribes and a half on the other side Jordan
gave rise to difficulties and suspicions. Nevertheless these tribes were
faithful at heart. Their position had done them harm, their self-seeking
having somewhat marred the energy of their faith: still, faithfulness to
Jehovah was found in them.

Finally, Joshua sets the people, in the way of warning, under a curse,
or under a blessing, according to their obedience or disobedience; and
then recapitulates their history, telling them that their fathers had
been idolaters, and that the people around them were so still.

But the people, not having yet lost the sense of the power of God who
had blessed them, declare that they will serve Jehovah alone. They are
thus placed under responsibility, and undertake to obey, as the
condition of their possessing the land and enjoying the fruit of God's
promise. They are left there, it is true, in peaceable possession of it
all, but under the condition of obedience after having already allowed
those, who should have been utterly destroyed, to remain in the land;
and when, from the outset, they had not at all realised that which God
had given them. What a picture of the assembly ever since the days of
the apostles!

There is yet one remark to be made. When Christ shall return in glory,
we shall inherit all things, Satan being bound. The assembly ought to
realise now, by the Holy Ghost, the power of this glory. But there are
things, properly called heavenly, which are ours, as being our
dwelling-place, our standing, our calling; there are others which are
subjected to us, and which are a sphere for the exercise of the power
that we possess. Thus the limits of Israel's abode were less extensive
than those of the territory to which they had a right. Jordan was the
boundary of their abode, the Euphrates that of their possession. The
heavenly things are ours; but the manifestation of the power of Christ
over creation, and the deliverance of this creation, is granted to us.
It will be delivered when Christ Himself shall exercise the power. Thus
the "powers of the world to come \[See Note \#1\]" were deliverances
from the yoke of the enemy. These were not things proper to us;
nevertheless they were ours.

Note \#1

So called, I doubt not, because they were samples of that power which
will entirely subdue the enemy when Christ shall appear.
