Introduction to Ezra

The events which we have been considering, at the close of Kings and
Chronicles, were deeply significant. The throne of God was no longer at
Jerusalem. God had fulfilled His threat of casting off the city which He
had chosen. He had bestowed the throne of the earth upon the Gentiles
([Dan 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037).md). Not only had Israel
failed under the old covenant, and rejected God ([Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007).md), so that God was no longer their
king; but even after grace had raised up the house of David to sustain
the relations of the people with God, under the rule of that house
everything was entirely corrupted by sin; so that there was no more
remedy, and God had written Loammi (not my people), as it were, on the
forehead of a people who had forsaken Him. The counsels of God cannot
fail; but such was the sad state in which the relationship between this
people and God stood, if it can be said that a judgment like this
allowed any relationship still to exist. So far as it depended on
Israel, on man, all was lost. The consequences of this, with respect to
God's dealings, were of great importance; they were nothing less than
His taking His throne from the earth, casting off His people for the
time as to His earthly government, and transferring power to the
Gentiles. Man, in probation under the law, had failed, and he was
condemned. He had been sustained in the way of grace through means which
God had granted, in the family of David, for his continuance in the
enjoyment of the blessings granted him, and he had failed again. Kingly
power was in the hands of the Gentiles, and the people were under
condemnation according to the old covenant.
