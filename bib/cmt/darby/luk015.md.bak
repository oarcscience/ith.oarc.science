### [Luke Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md)

Having thus unfolded the difference in character between the two
dispensations, and the circumstances of the transition from the one to
the other, the Lord turns (chapter 15) to higher principles the sources
of the one that was brought in by grace.

It is indeed a contrast between the two, as well as the chapters we have
been going through. But this contrast rises to its glorious source in
God's own grace, contrasted with the miserable self-righteousness of
man.

The publicans and sinners draw near to hear Jesus. Grace had its true
dignity to those who needed it. Self-righteousness repulsed that which
was not as contemptible as itself, and God Himself at the same time in
His nature of love. The Pharisees and the scribes murmured against Him
who was a witness of this grace in fulfilling it.

I cannot meditate on this chapter, which has been the joy of so many
souls, and the subject of so many testimonies to grace, from the time
that the Lord pronounced it, without enlarging upon grace, perfect in
its application to the heart. Nevertheless I must confine myself here to
great principles, leaving their application to those who preach the
word. This is a difficulty that constantly presents itself in this
portion of the word.

First, the great principle which the Lord exhibits, and on which He
founds the justification of God's dealings (sad state of heart that
requires it! marvellous grace and patience that gives it!) the great
principle, I repeat, is that God finds His own joy in shewing grace.
What an answer to the horrid spirit of the Pharisees who made it an
objection!

It is the Shepherd who rejoices when the sheep is found, the woman when
the piece of money is in her hand, the Father when His child is in His
arms. What an expression of that which God is! How truly is Jesus the
one to make it known! It is on this that all the blessing of man can
alone be founded. It is in this that God is glorified in His grace.

But there are two distinct parts in this grace the love that seeks, and
the love with which one is received. The first two parables describe the
former character of this grace. The shepherd seeks his sheep, the woman
her piece of money: the sheep and the piece of silver are passive. The
shepherd seeks (and the woman also) until he finds, because he has an
interest in the matter. The sheep, wearied with its wanderings, has not
to take one step in returning. The shepherd lays it on his shoulders and
carries it home. He takes the whole charge, happy to recover his sheep.
This is the mind of heaven, whatever the heart of man on earth may be.
It is the work of Christ, the Good Shepherd. The woman sets before us
the pains which God takes in His love; so that it is more the work of
the Spirit, which is represented by that of the woman. The light is
brought she sweeps the house until she finds the piece she had lost.
Thus God acts in the world, seeking sinners. The hateful and hating
jealousy of self-righteousness finds no place in the mind of heaven,
where God dwells, and produces, in the happiness that surrounds Him, the
reflex of His own perfections.

But although neither the sheep nor the piece of silver does anything
towards its own recovery, there is a real work wrought in the heart of
one who is brought back; but this work, necessary as it is for the
finding or even the seeking of peace, is not that on which the peace is
grounded. The return and the reception of the sinner are therefore
described in the third parable. The work of grace, accomplished solely
by the power of God, and complete in its effects, is presented to us in
the first two. Here the sinner returns, with sentiments which we will
now examine sentiments produced by grace, but which never rise to the
height of the grace manifested in his reception until he has returned.

First his estrangement from God is depicted. While as guilty at the
moment that he crosses the paternal threshold, in turning his back upon
his father, as when he eats husks with the swine, man, deceived by sin,
is here presented in the last state of degradation to which sin conducts
him. Having expended all that fell to him according to nature, the
destitution in which he finds himself (and many a soul feels the famine
which it has brought itself into, the emptiness of all around without a
desire after God or holiness, and often into what is degrading in sin)
does not incline him towards God, but leads him to seek a resource in
that which Satan's country (where nothing is given) can supply; and he
finds himself among the swine. But grace operates; and the thought of
the happiness of his father's house, and of the goodness that blessed
all around it, awakes in his heart. Where the Spirit of God works, there
are always two things found, conviction in the conscience and the
attraction of the heart. It is really the revelation of God to the soul,
and God is light and He is love; as light, conviction is produced in the
soul, but as love there is the attraction of goodness, and truthful
confession is produced. It is not merely that we have sinned, but that
we have to do with God and desire to have, but fear because of what He
is, yet are led to go. So the woman in chapter 7. (See page 240.) So
Peter in the boat. This produces the conviction that we are perishing,
and a sense, feeble it may be, yet true, of the goodness of God and the
happiness to be found in His presence, although we may not feel sure of
being received; and we do not remain in the place where we are
perishing. There is the sense of sin, there is humiliation; the sense
that there is goodness in God; but not the sense of what the grace of
God really is. Grace attracts one goes towards God, but one would be
satisfied to be received as a servant a proof that, though the heart be
wrought in by grace, it has not yet met God. Progress, moreover,
although real, never gives peace. There is a certain rest of heart in
going; but one does not know what reception to expect, after having been
guilty of forsaking God. The nearer the prodigal son drew to the house,
the more would his heart beat at the thought of meeting his father. But
the father anticipates his coming, and acts towards him, not according
to his son's deserts, but according to his own heart as a father the
only measure of the ways of God towards us. He is on his son's neck
while the latter is still in rags, before he has had time to say, "Make
me as one of thy hired servants." It was no longer time to say it. It
belonged to a heart anticipating how it would be received, not to one
who had met God. Such an one knows how it has been received. The
prodigal arranges to say it (as people speak of an humble hope, and a
low place); but though the confession is complete when he arrives, he
does not then say, Make me a hired servant. How could he? The father's
heart had decided his position by its own sentiments, by its love
towards him, by the place his heart had given him towards himself. The
father's position decided that of the son. This was between himself and
his son; but this was not all. He loved his son, even as he was, but he
did not introduce him into the house in that condition. The same love
that received him as a son will have him enter the house as a son, and
as the son of such a father should be. The servants are ordered to bring
the best robe and put it on him. Thus loved, and received by love, in
our wretchedness, we are clothed with Christ to enter the house. We do
not bring the robe: God supplies us with it. It is an entirely new
thing; and we become the righteousness of God in Him. This is heaven's
best robe. All the rest have part in the joy, except the self righteous
man, the true Jew. The joy is the joy of the father, but all the house
shares it. The elder son is not in the house. He is near it, but he will
not come in. He will have nothing to do with the grace that makes the
poor prodigal the subject of the joy of love. Nevertheless, grace acts;
the fathergoes out and entreats him to come in. It is thus that God
acted, in the Gospel, towards the Jew. Yet man's righteousness, which is
but selfishness and sin, rejects grace. But God will not give up His
grace. It becomes Him. God will be God; and God is love.

It is this which takes the place of the pretensions of the Jews, who
rejected the Lord, and the accomplishment of the promises in Him.

That which gives peace, and characterises our position, is not the
sentiments wrought in our hearts, although they indeed exist, but those
of God Himself.
