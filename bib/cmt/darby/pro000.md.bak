Introduction to Proverbs

The Book of Proverbs gives us the application of that wisdom which
created the heavens and the earth to the details of life in this world
of confusion and evil. This thought brings out the immensity of grace
unfolded here. God deigns to apply His wisdom to the circumstances of
our practical life, and to shew us, with His own intelligence, the
consequences of all the ways in which man may walk. For it is often in
the way of knowledge, not of precept, that the statements made in the
Book of Proverbs are presented. It is a great blessing to be provided
for in the labyrinth of this world, in which a false step may lead to
such bitter consequences, with a book that sets forth the path of
prudence and of life; and that in connection with a wisdom which comes
from God.

It is well to remember that the Book of Proverbs treats of this world,
and of God's government, according to which man reaps that which he has
sown. This is always true, whatever may be the sovereign grace that
bestows on us things beyond and infinitely above this world.

Solomon was filled with wisdom from above, but which had its exercise in
this world, and its application to it; that is to say, which applied to
it God's way of viewing all things, discerning the truth of all that,
day by day, is developed in it. We have here the ways of God, the divine
path of human conduct, the discernment of that which the heart of man
produces, and of its consequences; and also-for one who is subject to
the word-the means of avoiding the path of his own will and of his own
foolish heart (which is unable to understand the bearing of a multitude
of actions that it suggests to him), and this, not by bringing him back
to moral perfection-for that is not the object of the Proverbs; but to
that wisdom and prudence which enable him to avoid many errors, and to
maintain a serious walk before God, and an habitual submission to His
mind. The precepts of this book establish practical happiness in this
world by maintaining earthly relationships in their integrity according
to God. Now it is not human prudence and sagacity that are enjoined. The
fear of the Lord, \[See Note \#1\] which is the beginning of wisdom, is
the subject here.

Note \#1:

I have left "Lord" here as an expression of general application, but
Jehovah is always His name in Israel, and that of government, save in a
few cases where Adonai (Lord, in the proper appellative use of it) is
employed. But it is to be noted that Jehovah is used in Proverbs,
because it is authoritatively instructive in known relationship; never
in Ecclesiastes, where it is God in contrast with man, having his own
experience as such on earth. "God" abstractedly is only once used in
Proverbs ([Pro 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#002).md). We have "her
God" in [Pro 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md).
