### [John Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md)

In chapter 16 a further step is taken in the revelation of this grace.
The Holy Ghost is looked upon as already here below.

In this chapter the Lord declares that He has set forth all His
instruction with regard to His departure; their sufferings in the world
as holding His place; their joy, as being in the same relationship to
Him as that in which He had been while on earth to His Father; their
knowledge of the fact that He was in the Father and they in Him, and He
Himself in them; the gift of the Holy Ghost, in order to prepare them
for all that would happen when He was gone, that they might not be
offended. For they should be cast out of the synagogues, and he who
should kill them would think that he was serving God. This would be the
case with those who, resting in their old doctrines as a form, and
rejecting the light, would only use the form of truth by which they
accredited the flesh as orthodox to resist the light which, according to
the Spirit, would judge the flesh. This would they do, because they knew
neither the Father nor Jesus, the Son of the Father. It is fresh truth
which tests the soul, and faith. Old truth, generally received and by
which a body of people are distinguished from those around them, may be
a subject of pride to the flesh, even where it is the truth, as was the
case with the Jews. But fresh truth is a question of faith in its
source: there is not the support of a body accredited by it, but the
cross of hostility and isolation. They thought they served God. They
knew not the Father and the Son.

Nature is occupied with that which it loses. Faith looks at the future
into which God leads. Precious thought! Nature acted in the disciples:
they loved Jesus; they grieved at His going away. We can understand
this. But faith would not have stopped there. If they had apprehended
the necessary glory of the Person of Jesus; if their affection, animated
by faith, had thought of Him and not of themselves, they would have
asked, "Whither goest thou?" Nevertheless He who thought of them assures
them that it would be gain to them even to lose Him. Glorious fruit of
the ways of God! Their gain would be in this, that the Comforter should
be here on earth with them and in them. Here, observe, Jesus does not
speak of the Father. It was the Comforter here below in His stead, to
maintain the testimony of His love for the disciples, and His
relationship to them. Christ was going away: for if He went not away,
the Comforter would not come; but if He departed, He would send Him.
When He was come, He would act in demonstration of the truth with regard
to the world that rejected Christ and persecuted His disciples; and He
would act for blessing in the disciples themselves.

With regard to the world, the Comforter had one only subject of
testimony, in order to demonstrate the sin of the world. It has not
believed in Jesus in the Son. Doubtless there was sin of every kind,
and, to speak truth, nothing but sin sin that deserved judgment; and in
the work of conversion, He brings these sins home to the soul. But the
rejection of Christ put the whole world under one common judgment. No
doubt every one shall answer for his sins; and the Holy Ghost makes me
feel them. But, as a system responsible to God, the world had rejected
His Son. This was the ground on which God dealt with the world now; this
it was which made manifest the heart of man. It was the demonstration
that, God being fully revealed in love such as He was, man would not
receive Him. He came, not imputing their trespasses unto them; but they
rejected Him. The presence of Jesus was not the Son of God Himself
manifested in His glory, from which man might shrink with fear, though
he could not escape; it was what He was morally, in His nature, in His
character. Man hated Him: all testimony to bring man to God was
unavailing. The plainer the testimony, the more he turned from it and
opposed it. The demonstration of the sin of the world was its having
rejected Christ. Terrible testimony, that God in goodness should excite
detestation because He was perfect, and perfectly good! Such is man. The
testimony of the Holy Ghost to the world, as God's to Cain of old, would
be, Where is my Son? It was not that man was guilty; that he was when
Christ came; but he was lost, the tree was bad. \[See Note \#62\]

But this was God's path to something altogether different the
demonstration of righteousness, in that Christ went to His Father, and
the world saw Him no more. It was the result of Christ's rejection.
Human righteousness there was none. Man's sin was proved by the
rejection of Christ. The cross was indeed judgment executed upon sin.
And in that sense it was righteousness; but in this world it was the
only righteous One condemned by man and forsaken by God; it was not the
manifestation of righteousness. It was a final judicial separation
between man and God (see chapters 11 and [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031).md). If Christ had been delivered
there, and had become the King of Israel, this would not have been an
adequate consequence of His having glorified God. Having glorified God
His Father, He was going to sit at His right hand, at the right hand of
the Majesty on high, to be glorified in God Himself, to sit on the
Father's throne. To set Him there was divine righteousness (see [Joh
13:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md) and [Joh
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md), [Joh
17:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004).md). This same righteousness
deprived the world, as it is, of Jesus for ever. Man saw Him no more.
Righteousness in favour of men was in Christ at God's right hand in
judgment as to the world, in that it had lost Him hopelessly and for
ever.

Moreover Satan had been proved to be the prince of this world by leading
all men against the Lord Jesus. To accomplish the purposes of God in
grace, Jesus does not resist. He gives Himself up to death. He who has
the power of death committed himself thoroughly. In his desire to ruin
man he had to hazard everything in his enterprise against the Prince of
Life. He was able to associate the whole world with himself in this, Jew
and Gentile, priest and people, governor, soldier, and subject. The
world was there, headed by its prince, on that solemn day. The enemy had
everything at stake, and the world was with him. But Christ has risen,
He has ascended to His Father, and has sent down the Holy Ghost. All the
motives that govern the world, and the power by which Satan held men
captive, are shewn to be of him; he is judged. The power of the Holy
Ghost is the testimony of this, and surmounts all the powers of the
enemy. The world is not yet judged, that is, the judgment executed it
will be in another manner; but it is morally, its prince is judged. All
its motives, religious and irreligious, have led it to reject Christ,
placing it under Satan's power. It is in that character that he has been
judged; for he led the world against Him who is manifested to be the Son
of God by the presence of the Holy Ghost consequent on His breaking the
power of Satan in death.

All this took place through the presence on earth of the Holy Ghost,
sent down by Christ. His presence in itself was the demonstration of
these three things. For, if the Holy Ghost was here, it was because the
world had rejected the Son of God. Righteousness was evidenced by Jesus
being at the right hand of God, of which the presence of the Holy Ghost
was the proof, as well as in the fact that the world had lost Him. Now
the world which rejected Him was not outwardly judged, but, Satan having
led it to reject the Son, the presence of the Holy Ghost proved that
Jesus had destroyed the power of death; that he who had possessed that
power was thus judged; that he had shewn himself to be the enemy of Him
whom the Father owned; that his power was gone, and victory belonged to
the Second Adam, when Satan's whole power had been arrayed against the
human weakness of Him who in love had yielded to it. But Satan, thus
judged, was the prince of this world.

The presence of the Holy Ghost should be the demonstration not of
Christ's rights as Messiah, true as they were, but of those truths that
related to man to the world, in which Israel was now lost, having
rejected the promises, although God would preserve the nation for
Himself. But the Holy Ghost was doing something more than demonstrating
the condition of the world. He would accomplish a work in the disciples;
He would lead them into all truth, and He would shew them things to
come; for Jesus had many things to tell them which they were not yet
able to bear. When the Holy Ghost should be in them, He should be their
strength in them as well as their teacher; and it would be a wholly
different state of things for the disciples. Here He is considered as
present on the earth in place of Jesus, and dwelling in the disciples,
not as an individual spirit speaking from Himself, but even as Jesus
said, "As I hear I judge," with a judgment perfectly divine and
heavenly: so the Holy Ghost, acting in the disciples, would speak that
which came from above, and of the future, according to divine knowledge.
It should be heaven and the future of which He would speak,
communicating what was heavenly from above, and revealing events to come
upon the earth, the one and the other being witnesses that it was a
knowledge which belonged to God. How blessed to have that which He has
to give!

But, further, He takes here the place of Christ. Jesus had glorified the
Father on earth. The Holy Ghost would glorify Jesus, with reference to
the glory that belonged to His Person and to His position. He does not
here speak directly of the glory of the Father. The disciples had seen
the glory of the life of Christ on earth; the Holy Ghost would unfold to
them His glory in that which belonged to Him as glorified with the
Father that which was His own.

They would learn "in part." This is man's measure when the things of God
are in question, but its extent is declared by the Lord Himself: "He
shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto
you. An that the Father hath is mine: therefore, said I, He shall take
of mine, and shall shew it unto you."

Thus we have the gift of the Holy Ghost variously presented in
connection with Christ. In dependence on His Father, and representing
His disciples as gone up from among them, on their behalf, He addresses
Himself to the Father; He asks the Father to send the Holy Ghost ([Joh
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016).md). Afterwards we find that His
own name is all powerful. All blessing from the Father comes in His
name. It is on His account, and according to the efficacy of His name,
of all that in Him is acceptable to the Father, that good comes to us.
Thus the Father will send the Holy Ghost in His name ([Joh
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026).md). And Christ being glorified on
high, and having taken His place with His Father, He Himself sends the
Holy Ghost ([Joh 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026).md) from the
Father, as proceeding from Him. Finally, the Holy Ghost is present here
in this world, in and with the disciples, and He glorifies Jesus, and
takes of His and reveals it to His own ([Joh
16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md). Here all the glory of the
Person of Christ is set forth, as well as the rights belonging to the
position He has taken. "All things that the Father hath" are His. He has
taken His position according to the eternal counsels of God, in virtue
of His work as Son of man. But if He has entered into possession in this
character, all that He possesses in it is His, as a Son to whom (being
one with the Father) all that the Father has belongs.

There He should be hidden for a while: the disciples should afterwards
see Him, for it was only the accomplishment of the ways of God; it was
no question of being, as it were, lost by death. He was going to His
Father. On this point the disciples understood nothing. The Lord
develops the fact and its consequences, without yet shewing them the
whole import of what He said. He takes it up on the human and historical
side. The world would rejoice at having got rid of Him. Miserable joy!
The disciples would lament, although it was the true source of joy for
them; but their sorrow should be turned into joy. As testimony, this
took place when He shewed Himself to them after His resurrection; it
will be fully accomplished when He shall return to receive them unto
Himself. But when they had seen Him again, they should understand the
relationship in which He has placed them with His Father, they should
enjoy it by the Holy Ghost. It should not be as though they could not
themselves draw nigh to the Father, while Christ could do so (as Martha
said, "I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, he willgive it
thee"). They might themselves go directly to the Father, who loved them,
because they had believed in Jesus, and had received Him when He had
humbled Himself in this world of sin (in principle it is always thus);
and asking what they would in His name they should receive it, so that
their joy might be full in the consciousness of the blessed position of
unfailing favour into which they were brought, and of the value of all
that they possessed in Christ.

Nevertheless the Lord already declares to them the basis of the truth He
came from the Father, He was going away to the Father. The disciples
think they understand that which He had thus spoken without a parable.
They felt that He had divined their thought, for they had not expressed
it to Him. Yet they did not rise really to the height of what He said.
He had told them that they had believed in His having come "from God."
This they understood; and that which had taken place had confirmed them
in this faith, and they declare their conviction with regard to this
truth; but they do not enter into the thought of coming "from the
Father," and going away "to the Father." They fancied themselves quite
in the light; but they had apprehended nothing that raised them above
the effect of Christ's rejection, which the belief that He came from the
Father and was going to the Father would have done. Jesus therefore
declares to them, that His death would scatter them, and that they would
forsake Him. His Father would be with Him; He should not be alone.
Nevertheless He had explained all these things to them, in order that
they should have peace in Him. In the world that rejected Him they
should have tribulation; but He had overcome the world, they might be of
good cheer.

This ends the conversation of Jesus with His disciples on earth. In the
following chapter He addresses His Father as taking His own place in
departing, and giving His disciples theirs (that is, His own), with
regard to the Father and to the world, after He had gone away to be
glorified with the Father. The whole chapter is essentially putting the
disciples in His own place, after laying the ground for it in His own
glorifying and work. It is, save the last verses, His place on earth. As
He was divinely in heaven, and so shewed a divine heavenly character on
earth, so (He being glorified as man in heaven) they, united with Him,
were in turn to display the same. Hence we have first the place He
personally takes, and the work which entitles them to be in it.

Note \#62

Man is judged for what he has done; he is lost by what he is.
