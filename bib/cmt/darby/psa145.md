### [Psalms Chapter 145](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)

Psalm 145 goes on in thought into the millennium, after the distress is
over, and the full deliverance can be celebrated. It is Christ in spirit
perhaps even in person as in the midst of Israel, leading the praises of
Jehovah, and awakening them amongst men. Hence, though only expressing
purpose, it is a dialogue in its character. First, he expresses his own
purpose of praising Jehovah, and for ever and ever. One generation
should do it to another. "I will speak." One sees his heart is full of
praise, and he speaks of it ([Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005).md). "And men shall speak of the
might of Jehovah's terrible acts. And I will declare thy greatness. They
shall speak of the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy
righteousness." Then he breaks off most beautifully to speak of the
goodness: for still out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
All Jehovah's works shall praise Him. The saints bless Him. Their
subject shall be the glory of Jehovah's kingdom and His power, to make
known to the mass of mankind His acts, and the glorious majesty of His
kingdom, and that an everlasting one. Then in Verses 14-20 ([Psa
145:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014).md) His character is spoken of.
Verse 21 ([Psa 145:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#021).md) returns to the
purpose of heart of the leader of praise. It is as man Christ speaks
here "my God." Jehovah is looked at as King. In general, the outward
acts and greatness are more in the mouth of the rest what Jehovah is in
the leader's, though he does celebrate His wondrous works. Still the
greatness and excellency and majesty of Jehovah are that which we see
his heart full of, as [Psa 145:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#003.md); [Psa
145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005.md); [Psa
145:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#008.md); and so, in general, His
gracious ways and character ([Psa
145:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014).md). It is to be remarked that
there is the leader who speaks in the psalm, the saints (the Jewish
remnant), and the world in general, the sons of Adam. It is of the
highest interest in this way; because we have Messiah fulfilling the
word, "My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation." And how
full in heart He is of His praises! Jehovah's kingdom is set up; the
Messiah in the midst of Israel first, then the preserved saints, and
then, through their leading, all the world join in His praises, for His
greatness, goodness, and wonderful works.
