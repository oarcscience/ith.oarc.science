### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#001)

Nevertheless Saul is put to a final proof. Jehovah, by the mouth of
Samuel, sends him to smite Amalek, and utterly destroy them and all that
belonged to them. They were the cruel and determined enemies of God's
people ([Deu 25:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#017)). They had been
chief among the nations, their name and their pride were everywhere
known ([Num 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007); [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)); but it was a nation doomed of
God.

God now entrusts Saul with the fulfilment of [Deu
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#019). In this case all Israel
accompanied him without fear. These were not the enemies from within who
were daily wearing away their strength and courage. The victory is
complete. The only question now is that of faithfulness to God, and of
preferring His glory to self-interest. But Saul fears the people. The
Spirit of God says "Saul and the people"; Saul says "the people"; and
that it was for God they spared. But our excuses, even when true, only
condemn us. Saul, not having faith, not looking to God, fears the people
more than God. What a slave is the unbeliever! If not the slave of the
enemy, he is that of the people whom he appears to govern. Saul,
unfaithful to God in the midst of the people, and surrounded by
blessings from Jehovah, is at length deprived of the kingdom. No
humiliation, no brokenness of heart-he confesses his sin, hoping to
avoid its punishment; but, unable to escape it, he entreats Samuel to
honour him in spite of it. Samuel does so and then forsakes him.
Everything changes now, and David appears on the scene. It is well to
remark that the connected history of Saul's reign closes with the end of
chapter 14. Chapter 15 is given as a separate history on account of the
importance of its contents-the definite rejection of Saul, a rejection
which introduces David.
