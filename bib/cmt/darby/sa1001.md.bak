[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 1:1</span></span>

We find then, in the beginning of this book, priesthood existing before
God in the original form we have mentioned. Eli, pious himself, and
fearing God, maintained no order in the priestly family. The priesthood,
instead of binding the people to God, morally separated them. Hophni and
Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were at Shiloh; but their conduct made the
offering of the Lord to be abhorred of the people. Such was the state of
things in Israel. At the same time, in the family of Elkanah, Hannah,
chosen of Jehovah for blessing, was in trial; the desires of her natural
heart were not satisfied, and the adversary tormented her by means of
the prosperous Peninnah. But He, whose strength is perfected in
weakness, having made manifest (as ever in such a case) the
powerlessness of nature, gives blessing according to His own will,
against all hope, in order that that which was of Him should be
evidently wrought by His own power. Hannah has a son according to her
petition, a son devoted to the Lord. His family was of the tribe of Levi
(1 Chronicles 6).
