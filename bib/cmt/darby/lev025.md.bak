### [Leviticus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#001.md)

Chapter 25. The land itself is held for Jehovah, as being His; it must
enjoy God's rest; and moreover he who had lost his inheritance therein
should find it again, according to the counsels of God, at the appointed
time. The trumpet of the jubilee would sound and God would re-establish
each one in his possession, according to His (God's) rights, for the
land was His. Their persons also were to be free then, for the children
of Israel were God's servants. It was not so with those not belonging to
God's people. And although Israel have sold themselves to the stranger,
He who made Himself nigh of kin has redeemed them from his hands. The
day of jubilee will free the people, whatever may be the power of those
who hold them captives.
