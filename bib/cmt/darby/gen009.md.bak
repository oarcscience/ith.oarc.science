### [Genesis Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md)

In chapter 9 begins the history of the new earth. God blesses the earth
more than before; and the answer to the sweet savour of the sacrifice
assures the world that a universal deluge will never recur. God makes a
covenant \[See Note \#1\] with the creation to this effect. Government
is established in the hand of man, and death begins to furnish him with
nourishment. It does not appear to me that, before this, there had been
either government or idolatry. There had been sin against God, violence
without restraint against one another, and corruption; the two perpetual
characters of sin, amongst men, and even in Satan as far as may be \[See
Note \#2\]. God cared for His creation in mercy; but with Noah new
principles were brought out. The sacrifice of Christ (in figure) becomes
a ground of dealing with the earth, not alone of accepting man, as in
Abel; and on this a covenant is founded. That is, God binds Himself in
grace, so that faith has a sure ground to go upon, that on which it can
count.

Another very important principle introduced was the second referred to
government in the hand of man. Covenant was sure, for God is faithful
when He binds Himself. Government was entrusted to the hands of men.
Alas! this new trial soon has the same result as before. The government
confided to Noah loses immediately its honour. The earth, under mercy,
relieved (as Lamech had announced) by agricultural care, becomes in its
fruits a snare to Noah, who becomes intoxicated, and his own son
dishonours him; on whose race consequently the curse falls. This is
given in view of the people opposed to Israel, the centre of God's
earthly government, and of the relationship of God with that family.

In these chapters then we have the old earth closed and the new begun on
new principles. This lasts till the judgment by fire. Man's failure in
the old world is set forth, and God's judgment thereon, in Adam and
Cain. Now the special judgment and the special blessing in connection
with Israel begins to shew itself, for we are yet on the earth here. The
historical course of Noah's family is brought out in connection with
these two points, the blessing and the curse in Shem and Ham. This is
God's survey of the new world, in its three heads Shem, Ham, and
Japheth, in a brief declaration of what characterised their position in
the earth. Its whole history is stated in a few words. How mighty in
everything is the word! He who knows all can state all briefly and
surely. We begin afresh with chapter 10 with the generation or history
of Noah's sons. We have thus the establishment of the new earth and its
whole general prophetic history, as this earth, in the first account of
Noah, and God's communications with him; Shem being owned as the root of
God's family in it, allied to the name of Jehovah, with special judgment
on Canaan, whose place, we know, Israel took.

Note \#1

Covenant, when used in connection with the Lord, is always, it seems to
me, some order established by God and announced to man, according to the
terms of which He enters into relationship with man, or according to
which man is to approach Him.

Note \#2

There are three characters of sin violence, falsehood and corruption.
The two first are directly ascribed to Satan; alas, man follows him in
them, the third is more properly man's. All three are noticed in [Col
3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md). In fact we get these three
characters at the close the false prophet, the beast, and Babylon.
