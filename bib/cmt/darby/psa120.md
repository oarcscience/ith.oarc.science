### [Psalms Chapter 120](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)

We now come, Psalms 120-134, to the songs of degrees, which depict, I
doubt not, the outward circumstances of the same period, when Israel is
in the land, but the power of Gog not yet destroyed. The first of this
series begins with the statement of the cry sent up by the godly in his
distress to Jehovah who heard. The special charge here is deceit and
falsehood. Judgment should come on it. But it is against the godly
himself, not the violence and oppression done to Jerusalem, or the
apostate oppression of the people. His woe is to dwell in Mesech, and
among the tents of Kedar. Wrong is in their hearts; and, when the godly
spoke of peace, they prepared for battle. It does not seem to me to be
the oppression of Antichrist, or the beast at Jerusalem, but to apply to
those who in the land found themselves where the last hostile power
which had pretended to favor them, \[See Note \#1\] and had led many to
apostatise for quietness and prosperity, now showed himself as only a
deceitful oppressor.

Note \#1

I do not refer here to Daniel 9, but to Daniel 8.
