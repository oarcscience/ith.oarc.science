### [Isaiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md)

The folly of trusting in an arm of flesh is again pointed out, but only
while dwelling on the true means of deliverance. Jehovah at Jerusalem
would be in the midst of the nations as a lion among the shepherds, and
would defend Jerusalem as birds hovering over it. His presence should
overthrow the Assyrian, and cause him to flee; for the fire of Jehovah
shall be in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.
