### [Deuteronomy Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#001.md)

Chapter 16 connects the people with the dwelling-place of Jehovah, by
solemnities in which He surrounds Himself with His people, blessed and
happy in the deliverance which He has granted them under His reign.

It gives us three solemn feasts-the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast
of Tabernacles. The spirit of each of these feasts suggests a few
remarks. The Passover recalled deliverance, deliverance from bondage in
Egypt \[See Note \#1\] -for us under sin and Satan. The unleavened
bread, truth in the inward parts, was here the bread of affliction. The
knowledge of Christ, or the application of Christ to the heart, though
coupled with deliverance and salvation, when it takes the form of
repentance (and this is the case, when the question is of remembering
one's deliverance), has always something bitter in it. Joy is not the
point here. One has gone out in haste, by the mighty arm of God; and if
one is happy, it is only as having escaped, feeling that it is through
the power of God alone, and conscious of the state which required it
all. They ate it during the night, and every one returned in the morning
to his tent. They went home with the sense of the goodness of God, with
the sense that it was a deliverance from the evil under which they had
been by their own fault and to their own ruin.

Holiness is presented in repentance and deliverance from the power of
evil, under the form of conscience and judgment of sin; it is an
obligation. One dares not remain any longer in evil. They were cut off
if leaven was found in the house; whereas this holiness is in itself the
joy of the redeemed. They were bound to keep the feast wherever God
should put His name. God gathered the people around His dwelling-place,
and linked them with His name and with Himself. \[See Note \#2\] Their
nationality and all their recollections were connected with the worship
of Jehovah. It was another safeguard against idolatry ([Deu
16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#005).md).

Seven weeks having elapsed, the people were again to gather around
Jehovah. They numbered seven weeks from the time they began to put the
sickle to the corn, from the day they began to reap the fruit of the
land of promise. They waited for the perfect time of the work of God.
That which first of all characterised this feast was, that every one
offered a free-will-offering, according to the blessing wherewith
Jehovah his God had blessed him. It is the Holy Spirit, and the blessing
flowing from Him, which this type presents to us. It is not only
redemption, but the power of the things which are the result of it-not
in full, however; they were only firstfruits offered to God. The
presentation of these firstfruits to God is the effect of the power of
the Holy Ghost. They are the remnant of Israel, historically in the
beginning of Christianity, on the principle of redemption and of the new
covenant; but, in fact, Christians themselves become the firstfruits of
the creation of God. But the effect produced by the Holy Spirit, the
effect of His presence in general, is that which characterises this
feast. There was no mention of free-will-offerings at the passover; they
ate in haste and returned home. But the Holy Spirit has made the renewed
heart willing; and according to the enjoyment of the fruits of the
promise-according to the measure of the blessing of the Spirit of God,
it can and will render to God the firstfruits of the heart, and of all
that He has given us. Therefore (and it is what always accompanies this
free-will-fruit of the Holy Spirit) they were to rejoice in the presence
of Jehovah their God.

The fruits of grace and of the Spirit manifest themselves in joy and in
grace. \[See Note \#3\] Blessing manifests itself in the spirit of
blessing, in the joy and the good-will of grace. Blessed and precious
results! Joy, and the desire for the joy of others, always flow from
grace, known according to the power of the Spirit of God. Thus the
worshipper, his son and his daughter, his manservant and his
maidservant, the Levite within his gates, the stranger, the orphan, and
the widow, were to rejoice together in the place where Jehovah had set
His name. God surrounded Himself with joy, the fruit of grace and of His
blessing. The remembrance of having been themselves bondmen was to touch
the heart and influence the conduct of Israel; and by comprehending the
grace which had delivered them when they were in that condition, they
were to be led to act in grace towards those who were bondmen to them.
They are admonished, at the same time, to observe the statutes of
Jehovah; for the presence of the Holy Spirit, whilst ministering joy,
leads to watchfulness and obedience. We enjoy the earnest and the
firstfruits before God; but still it is down here, where watchfulness
and restraint are needed.

When the ingathering of the harvest and vintage were ended (that is, God
having gathered in His own, hidden them in His garner, and trodden His
enemies in the winepress), then came the Feast of Tabernacles; a feast,
the antitype of which we have not, it is certain, yet seen. Although all
the effects of the Passover and Pentecost are not yet accomplished, yet
they have been fulfilled as to the event marked by them; but there has
been as yet no fulfilment of the Feast of Tabernacles. This will take
place when Israel, restored to their land after the end of this
dispensation, will fully enjoy the effect of the promise of God.
Consequently joy is put in the foreground, whilst in that which
prefigured the presence of the Holy Ghost upon earth the
free-will-offering came first.

This feast was to be kept during seven consecutive days. It is joy, full
and complete joy; not according to the measure of the blessing, as in
Pentecost, but because God had blessed them in all the works of their
hands: therefore they certainly ought to rejoice. The spirit of that day
belongs to us, although the fulfilment of it has not yet taken place.
\[See Note \#4\] There is a joy that manifests itself in us in
connection with the measure of the present effect of the presence of the
Holy Spirit, a joy with requires watchfulness and to walk in the narrow
way, and in which the remembrance of our former condition strengthens in
us the spirit of grace towards others, and the presence of the Lord is
specially marked. There is a joy known to the heart, although the things
which cause it have not yet had their accomplishment, a joy connected
with the time of rest, when labour will be ended, and when there will no
longer be any need of vigilance, nor of the remembrance of our misery,
to urge us to share our blessings with others. The feast itself will
suffice for the joy of all: "Thou shalt rejoice in thy feast." The Lord
recalls the great principle of the three feasts, namely, to appear
before Jehovah three times in a year, bringing offerings to Jehovah.

\[Note: [Deu 16:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018.md) is discussed in
the next chapter.\]

Note \#1

Egypt signifies properly the flesh, but that involves sin and Satan.

Note \#2

This we have seen was part of Deuteronomic worship.

Note \#3

This also characterises Deuteronomic worship.

Note \#4

But it is to be remarked here, that in the account of tabernacles in
this chapter, there is no reference to an eighth day as elsewhere. All
refers properly to Israel placed in the land in present responsibility,
but with promise of yet better things under the new covenant. To us it
is anticipatively the eighth day, that great day of the feast. See John
7 where we get what to us is now in the place of the feast, connected
with the glory of a rejected, but exalted, Christ-the outflowing fulness
of the Holy Ghost.
