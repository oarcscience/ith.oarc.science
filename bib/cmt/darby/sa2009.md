### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#001.md)

He acts in grace also towards the humble remnant of Saul's house; and if
Mephibosheth is not associated with the glory of his kingdom, he enjoys
the privilege of the king's table, who shews him kindness; although
Mephibosheth belongs to the family of his enemy and persecutor, but at
the same time to that little remnant which favoured the king whom God
had chosen (being itself, on that account, hated by those in power). He
enjoys also the whole of his family's inheritance. This touching and
beautiful testimony to David's kindness and faithfulness through grace,
appears to me to give us a picture of Christ's relations to the remnant
of Israel, or at least that of the spirit of these relations. It was
"the kindness of God" which sought out the family of Saul, the enemy of
David's crown-and which rests upon the representative of Jonathan, whose
history we have read, and who typifies those that will attach themselves
to Christ in prospect of the kingdom, to which their thoughts are
limited. The remnant enjoys the effect of the establishment of the
kingdom, but does not rank among those that surround the throne after
having shared the sufferings of the despised and rejected king.
