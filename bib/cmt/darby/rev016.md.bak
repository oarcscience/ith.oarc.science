### [Revelation Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#001.md)

The first vial of wrath brought the utmost distress and shameful misery
on all who had taken the mark of the beast.

The second brought the power of moral death on the mass of peoples; all
who were among them within the limits of the prophetic earth, died I
apprehend, gave up mere outward profession. We have here an example of
the use of symbols which it is well to note. All the vials are poured
out on the earth, that is, applied to the sphere of already formed
relationship with God. But in this there might be a specialrelationship
in which men had to do with God in this world were inhabiters of earth,
or the mass of people within that sphere.

The third vial was poured out on all the sources of popular influence
and action; and they became positively deathful. It seems to me, that
the deadly influence in alienation from God, within the sphere of
prophecy, is strongly marked here. Death is used generally as the
expression of the power of Satan.

Then the supreme authority is made frightfully oppressive. This gave the
first four of direct judgment according to the usual division.

The fifth vial strikes the throne of the beast, the seat and stability
of his authority, which Satan had given him; and his kingdom became full
of darkness. All was confusion and wretchedness, and no resource: they
gnawed their tongues with anguish and blasphemed God.

The sixth angel pours out his vial on Euphrates destroys, I apprehend,
the securing boundary of the Western prophetic powers not the seat of
its power, but broke its frontier, that the way of the kings of the East
might be prepared. I look at this simply as the bringing in of the
powers of Asia into the conflict for the universal conflagration of
powers. The sixth vial sends forth three unclean spirits, the sum of all
evil influences: that of Satan's direct power as antagonistic of Christ;
that of the power of the last empire, the beast; and that of the second
beast of Chapter 13 henceforth known as the false prophet, Satan's
influence as the Antichrist, an idolatrous wonder-working power; and the
kings of the world were gathered together to the battle of the great day
of God Almighty. The allusion is to [Jdg
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md). At the seventh vial there is
a general break-up and subversion, and Babylon comes into judgment. And
the hail of God, the judgment of God, came on men from heaven. (Compare
Isa. 32, 33) All separate independent interests and established powers
disappeared. This was over the earth God's judgment by providence and
instruments but the Lamb was not come yet. The details of Babylon's
judgments are reserved for the following Chapters.
