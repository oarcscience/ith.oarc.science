### [Revelation Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001)

Chapter 18 announces the judgment. The one difficulty here is Verse 4
([Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004)), coming where it is; but,
as every difficulty in scripture, it leads into further light. The
destruction of Babylon is simple enough. She falls by God's judgment
just before Christ comes to judge the earth; and, first perhaps losing
her power and influence, is destroyed by the horns and beast. The
comparison of [Rev 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#008), and the place
it holds, [Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019), [Rev
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#008), and the beginning of 19, make
this plain. Chapter 18 is a warning from heaven, not the angel of
judgment of the earth. It is not consequent on events, but supposes
spiritual apprehension of heaven's mind. This is the case when it is
simply a voice from heaven. This call then was a spiritual call, not a
manifest judgment. It may be more urgent and direct just before
judgment, and I doubt not will be: as the call is in Hebrews to come out
of the camp because Jerusalem's day was at hand. Hence I believe this
applies whenever we see the system to be Babylon, and the sense of her
iniquities is pressed upon the conscience.

The Chapter then goes on to the actual execution of judgment according
to [Rev 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016). The horns, or kingdoms
connected with the beast, have destroyed her. The kings mourn over her;
so do those that have sought profit and ease and commerce in the earth.
The royal and commercial system is shattered to pieces by the upset of
the system. What characterises her, that for which she is judged, is
idolatry, corruption, worldliness, and persecution. She is judged and
destroyed, and the prosperity of the worldly is smitten by her fall, and
the hopes of the kings who had commerce with her. The blood of all
saints was found in her, as in Jerusalem in her day. Persecution comes
from religion connected with worldly advantage. But what a picture we
have here of the world, the relations of the kings and of the saints to
Babylon!
