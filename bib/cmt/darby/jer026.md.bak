### [Jeremiah Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md)

Chapter 26 begins this series of details with a prophecy of the
commencement of Jehoiakim's reign. The people are warned, as being
already in sin, that if they repent, they shall escape. We have
constantly seen this character attached to the prophecies of Jeremiah,
as though God said, "To-day, if ye will hear my voice." Circumstances
rendered this appeal urgent, for in fact, if Israel did not repent, the
house of Jehovah was to be like Shiloh. We find that of which God had
warned the prophet. They strive against him; but, as Jehovah had
promised, they gain no advantage over him. We see that it is the
ecclesiastical party that excite the people against the testimony which
God bears to them by the mouth of the prophet. But God turns the heart
of the princes and of the people towards him. There were some also who
regarded the ways of Jehovah. Their intelligence did not go far, but
sufficiently so for deliverance; they feared God. We may remark here,
that conscience laid hold of the word of God in its immediate
application. No doubt the evil would go on increasing, and, when ripe,
the judgment would be accomplished (for God does not strike before
iniquity has come to its height), and then the prophecy would be
fulfilled. But conscience, under the influence of the word, takes
knowledge of principles which are judged by it, even when all is not yet
ripe for judgment; and as yet consequently the judgment is not executed
([Jer 26:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018).md).
