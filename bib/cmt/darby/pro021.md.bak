### [Proverbs Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 10 through 31.

In chapter 10 begin the details which teach those who give ear how to
avoid the snares into which the simple might fall, the path to be
followed in many cases, and the consequences of men's actions: in short,
that which characterises wisdom in detail, what may be prudence for man,
divine discretion for the children of God; and also, the result of God's
government, whatever appearances may be for awhile. It is well to
observe, that there is no question of redemption or propitiation in this
book; it proposes a walk according to the wisdom of God's government.

In the final chapter we have the character of a king according to
wisdom, and that of the woman in her own house-the king who does not
allow himself that which, by darkening his moral discernment through the
indulgence of his lusts, would make him unfit to govern. In the woman we
see the persevering and devoted industry which fills the house with
riches, brings honour to its inhabitants, and removes all the cares and
anxieties produced by sloth. The typical application of these two
specific characters is too evident to need explanation. The example of
the woman is very useful, as to the spirit of the thing, to one who
labours in the assembly.

Although in this book the wisdom produced by the fear of Jehovah is only
applied to this world, it is on that very account of great use to the
Christian, who, in view of his heavenly privileges, might, more or less,
forget the continual government of God. It is very important for the
Christian to remember the fear of the Lord, and the effect of God's
presence on the details of his conduct; and I repeat that which I said
at the beginning, that it is great grace which deigns to apply divine
wisdom to all the details of the life of man in the midst of the
confusion brought in by sin. Occupied with heavenly things, the
Christian is less in the way of discovering, by his own experience, the
clue to the labyrinth of evil through which he is passing. God has
considered this, and He has laid down this first principle, "wise unto
that which is good, and simple concerning evil." Thus the Christian may
be ignorant of evil (if a worldling were so, he would fall into it), and
yet avoid it through his knowledge of good. The wisdom of God gives him
the latter; the government of God provides for all the rest. Now, in the
Proverbs, we have these things in principle and in detail. I have not
dwelt on the figurative character of the forms of evil. They are rather
principles than figures. But the violent man of the last days is
continually found in the Psalms; and Babylon is the full accomplishment
of the woman who takes the simple in her snares and leads them down to
death; just as Christ is the perfect wisdom of God which leads to life.
But these two things which manifest evil proceed from the heart of man
at all times since the fall: only we have seen that there is an active
development of the wiles of the evil woman, who has her own house and
her own arrangements. It is not simply the principle of corruption, but
an organised system, as is that of sovereign wisdom.
