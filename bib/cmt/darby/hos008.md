### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001)

In chapter 8 it is especially the daring and continual violation of the
law of their God, with which Israel is openly reproached, and which
would bring judgment, with eagle swiftness, upon them. Observe here,.
that the devastation with which Israel is threatened reaches even to the
temple of Jehovah. Israel had forsaken the Lord to make altars of their
own, and Judah had leant upon an arm of flesh. We may remark here, that
the prophecy presents Ephraim, as having entirely forsaken God, and as
being plunged in iniquity, and under impending judgment; Judah, as being
yet faithful outwardly, although at heart unfaithful too (see [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011); [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014); [Hos
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012)). Judgment should fall upon them
both.
