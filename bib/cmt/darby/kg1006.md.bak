### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#001.md)

The house may be looked at in two ways-as a type of the Father's house,
and as in fact the habitation of God on the earth when Jesus reigns. In
the latter aspect I only look for the grand thoughts and character of
the government revealed in it. In the former, as a typical house, two
circumstances give it its character. It is, first of all, God's house,
His dwelling; and then there are chambers all around it \[See Note
\#1\]. God surrounded Himself with dwellings, in the very place where He
had fixed His habitation. As the dwelling-place of God at that time in
the midst of His people, the presence of God in the temple depended on
the faithfulness of Solomon.

That which characterised the house in general is that nothing except
gold was to be seen in it. All was bright with the glory of divine
righteousness that distinguished the throne of God which was placed
there. But it is not transparent as glass. Beauty and holiness are not
what characterise the earthly throne, but righteousness and judgment.
Nor are there seraphim. In the Revelation we have the seraphic character
added to the cherubim, and the gold is transparent as glass. Emblems, as
we have seen, of judicial power, the cherubim had a new position (those
belonging to the ark remained the same); the wing of one of these new
cherubim touched the wall of the house on one side, and on the other the
wing of the other cherub. Their wings extended from one side of the
house to the other. They looked not towards the ark, but outwards \[See
Note \#2\]. At this time, righteousness reigning and being established,
these symbols of God's power can look outwards in blessing, instead of
having their eyes fixed on the covenant alone. During the time that
there was nothing but the covenant, they gazed upon it; but when God has
established His throne in righteousness, He can turn towards the world
to bless it according to that righteousness.

Note \#1

It is to this, I doubt not, that the Lord alludes, when He says, "In my
Father's house are many dwellings"-at any rate, to the fact that other
priests besides the high priest dwell there.

Note \#2

The word in Hebrew is "towards the house," which is used as a
preposition for inwards; but here, being at the bottom of the most holy
place, "towards the house "was outwards. I anticipate the Chronicles
here a little. This circumstance of their looking outwards, which is not
brought in here by the Holy Ghost, refers to the aspect of this history
given in the Chronicles, that is, to the glorious reign of the Son of
David. Here, the typical character of the heavenly house and glory being
the object, the veil is not seen, nor the circumstance as to the
cherubim which gave its character to the governmental blessing of the
earth. Both are in Chronicles. Here, while the veil is not mentioned, in
its place are folding doors. I make this allusion to that which is
written in the Chronicles, in order to give a general idea of the whole,
and to link the two accounts together. I will give here something more
definite, as to the contents of chapters 6 and 7 of the book that
occupies us. There are three parts in this description: the temple
itself; the different houses of cedar; and, lastly, the brazen vessels.
1. The temple. The idea which it presents has been already pointed out.
It is the dwelling-place, the house of God: there are chambers all
around; but it is the house of God. Within, all is gold. Nothing is said
about the veil. Dwelling, not drawing near, is the idea. But there are
folding doors which open. 2. After this comes the royal connection of
Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter with the world without, but with a view
to the glory and elevation of this position. It is not the
dwelling-place of God, but the royal position of the king, the judge,
and of his bride. It is Christ in His glorious administration. All is
solidity, magnificence, and grandeur, within and without. 3. Then comes
the manifestation, according to the power of the Spirit of God, and in a
glorious manner, of all that belonged to His reign here below. All was
of brass, the pillars and the sea. Nothing is said of the altar, because
drawing near to God is not the question; but the manifestation of God in
Christ who reigns in sight of the world-divine righteousness in respect
of man's responsibility, not of approach to God Himself. Thus we behold
the dwelling-place of God where all is gold, the glory of divine
righteousness; the house as the dwelling of the king, and the porch of
judgment: the house of his bride. It is the sovereign glory of Christ in
manifestation according to the dispensation of glory; and then the
development, in this world, by the power of the Spirit, of what Christ
is, of what God Himself is. There is no mention of silver-the type of
the immutable stedfastness of God's purposes and ways in the wilderness.
It is gold; the house of cedar; brass. In the description given by the
Book of Chronicles there are an altar and a veil, because there the
positive administration of the things and circumstances of the true
Solomon's reign is much more the question; the state of things which
will in fact exist upon earth, rather than the abstract idea, and the
type of that which is manifested of God Himself, as well as of the
king's glory; and this, whether in the dwelling-place of God, or on the
earth, as the sphere where He will unfold that which He is according to
the Spirit.
