### [Psalms Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)

The enemy in Psalm 42 is the outward enemy and oppressor the Gentile.
Though in circumstances, of course, and not in the depths of atonement,
it is interesting to see the analogy in Verse 3 ([Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md) with what the Lord said upon the
cross. Psalm 43 is a supplementary psalm to the former: only that here
the ungodly nation, the Jews, are before us, and the deceitful and
unjust man, the wicked one; though the Gentile oppressor be yet there
([Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002).md). We know they will both be
there in that day. From the Jewish nation being now in the scene, the
return to the holy hill and tabernacle and altar of God are more before
the mind of the remnant. Verses 3-4 ([Psa
43:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md) form the groundwork of the
book.
