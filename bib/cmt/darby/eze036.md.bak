### [Ezekiel Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#001.md)

Chapter 36 continues the same subject with reference to the blessing of
Israel. The nations insulted Israel as a land whose ancient high places
were their prey, and-as the spies had said-a land that devoured its
inhabitants. God takes occasion from this to shew that He favours His
people, and Jehovah declares that He will restore peace and prosperity
to the land and take away their reproach. Israel had defiled the land
and profaned the name of Jehovah, and Jehovah had scattered them among
the heathen. And even in this His name would be profaned through their
vileness, because the heathen would say, "These are the people of
Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land." But Jehovah would
intervene and sanctify His great name before the heathen, by bringing
His people back from among them, and cleansing them from all their
filthiness; taking away the hardness of their hearts, giving them His
Spirit, causing them to walk in His statutes, planting them in the land
which He had given to their fathers, owning them as His people, and
being Himself their God. The reproach that the land devoured its
inhabitants would then be evidently without foundation. God would
multiply earthly blessings to His people. Jehovah's work should be
evident to all men.

It is principally to this passage (although not exclusively) that the
Lord Jesus alludes in John 3, telling Nicodemus that He had spoken of
earthly things, and that, as a master of Israel, he ought to have
understood that this renewing of heart was necessary to the blessing of
Israel in the earth. The truth of this, with regard to a Jew, ought not
to surprise him, since it was a work of sovereignty in whomsoever should
be born of God; and if Nicodemus did not understand the declaration of
the prophets, with respect to the necessity of being born again for
Israel's enjoyment of earthly things, how could he understand if Jesus
spoke to him of heavenly things, for the introduction of which the death
of the Son of man, His rejection by the Jews, was absolutely necessary?

We may remark that this prophet speaks of the dealings of God with
respect to Israel as a nation responsible to Jehovah, and never says
anything of the first coming of Christ or of Israel's responsibility
with regard to Him. This took place under the dominion of the Gentiles.
Here Nebuchadnezzar is but a rod in the hand of Jehovah, and the times
of the Gentiles are not considered. This is the reason why we find the
judgment of the nations by Nebuchadnezzar connected with the events of
the last days. The rejection of Christ by the Jews is therefore not
mentioned here. It is Israel before Jehovah. This remark is important in
order to understand Ezekiel (see preceding note).
