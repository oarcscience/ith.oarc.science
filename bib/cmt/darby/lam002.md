### [Lamentations Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#001.md)

The second chapter is a very deep and touching appeal. The desolation of
Jerusalem is looked at as Jehovah's own work, on what was His own, and
not as that of the enemy. Never had there been such sorrow. Not only had
He polluted the kingdom and its princes, and had been as an enemy
against Jerusalem, and all that was goodly in it, but He had cast down
His altar, abhorred His sanctuary. He no longer respected what He had
Himself set up. Only we must remember that it was when the relationships
of Jehovah with His people depended, however long God's patience, on the
faithfulness of the people's obedience to Jehovah, on the old covenant.
But this consideration gives room for appealing to Himself. Still it is
a solemn thing when Jehovah is forced to reject that which He
acknowledges to be His own. But it must be so if the association of His
name is only a means of falsifying the testimony of what He is ([Lam
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006).md). And this brings before us the
amazingly important principle contained in the ministry of Jeremiah, not
merely the substitution of Babylon and the Gentile empire for Jerusalem
and God's government in Israel, but the setting this last aside in
itself, the ground of God's relationship with man where it subsisted, as
that which could not subsist when put to the test.
