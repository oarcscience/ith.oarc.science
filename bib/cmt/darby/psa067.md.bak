### [Psalms Chapter 67](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Psalms 65, 66 and 67.

In Psalms 65-67 we have the bright side, the bright and joyful
confidence of the saint who is conscious of being heard, and who, though
not yet in the blessing, counts upon it; whereas up to this it has been
the sense of the power of evil, or the cry to God and waiting upon Him.
Still in Psalm 65 the door of praise is not yet opened. Praise is silent
in Zion; still it surely would not be silent, the vow now made would be
performed. There God was the hearer of prayer if praise was yet silent,
and all flesh would come to Him. But confidence is very bright here. As
to the actual state of the people and the remnant (indeed, the remnant
alone enter into their case) iniquities prevailed against them. Still
confidence is unshaken, God would purge them away. Blessed the man that
Elohim chose (for all was grace) and made to dwell in His courts. They
would be satisfied with the goodness of His house. The thing was sure
and gave satisfying joy. In Verse 5 ([Psa
65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005).md) we have the judgment in favor of
the remnant by which the blessing would be introducedterrible things in
righteousness. God is the blesser of the earth in every place. The end
of the psalm is the celebration of the earth's blessings, when God comes
in in judgment in favor of His people. At the door of Zion, as yet
eating the fruit of their sins outside, the plea of the remnant is, that
as yet praise was silent in Zion, but it was ready; God had only to
bring in the judgment and deliverance, and it would wake up; and Elohim
would do this, He who was the one blesser and orderer of the whole
earth.

Psalm 66 celebrates this intervention in righteousness. Men are called
to see God's works, but ([Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006).md) it
is the very same God who once delivered Israel before out of Egypt.
Verse 8 ([Psa 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#008).md) calls upon the
nations brought into connection with God, to bless the God of the
remnant, that is, of Israel. They had been brought through every kind of
sorrow and oppression, to prove and try them as silver, but now they
would go before Him and praise Him. They had cried, been righteous, were
heard, and found mercy; their prayer was not turned away, nor God's
mercy from them. Thus after the sorrows (seen clearly now as the way and
hand of God with them), to the righteous there is arisen up light in the
darkness. They can pay the vows uttered in their distress, and tell to
others the blessed and sure deliverance of the Lord who cares for the
righteous, and has indeed heard their cry. But it is a deliverance by
terrible acts of righteousness on God's part, the display of His
intervention in judgment in the government of this world. We see, as
indeed in so many other psalms, how it is in the Jewish remnant, though
not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him, that God displays His
government of this world; as it is in them, which is the subject of the
next psalm, that the blessing of the world takes place.

Psalm 67 closes this short series by looking for the blessing of the
remnant, not only as the righteous and merciful answer to their cry, but
as the way of spreading the knowledge of God's ways to all nations. "God
be merciful to us, that thy way may be known upon earth." Thus all the
peoples will praise God, and the earth be judged and governed
righteously. The earth will yield her increase, God's blessing will be
upon it, and He will, as the own God of the godly remnant that have
trusted in Him, bless them. The result is summed up in the last
verse"God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him."
For the repentant Jew is the way of blessing, life from the dead for the
world.
