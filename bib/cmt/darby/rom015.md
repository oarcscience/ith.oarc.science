### [Romans Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md)

These instructions close the epistle. From [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md), it is the exordium, the personal
circumstances of the apostle, and salutations.

In Verses 8 to 12 ([Rom 15:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008).md), he
sums up his thoughts respecting God's dealings with the Jew and the
Gentile in the advent of Jesus. He was a minister of the circumcision
for the truth of God, to accomplish the promises made to the fathers.
For to the Jews God had made promises; but none to the Gentiles. To the
latter it was not truth that was in question: but by grace they might
through Jesus glorify God for His mercy. For them the apostle quotes
passages from Deuteronomy (that is to say, from the Law), from the
Psalms, and from the Prophets.

In Verse 13 ([Rom 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013).md), he turns
affectionately to the Romans to express his desires for them, and his
confidence in the blessing they had received from God, which enabled
them mutually to exhort one another, while expressing at the same time
his boldness in some sort, because of the grace God had given him, to be
the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles by fulfilling a public
function with regard to them; being, as it were, a priest to offer up
the Gentiles as an offering acceptable to God, because sanctified by the
Holy Ghost (see [Num 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#011).md). This was
his glory before God. This sanctification by the Holy Ghost was that
which took the place of sanctification by birth, and it was well worth
it.

Moreover he had accomplished his task from Jerusalem round about to
Illyricum; notwhere Christ had been preached before, but where they had
not yet heard of Him. This had prevented his coming to Rome. But now
that there was no more place for him, according to the Holy Ghost
nothing more in those parts for him to do, and having long desired to
see them, he thought to visit them on his way to Spain. For the moment
he was going to Jerusalem with the collection made in Macedonia and
Achaia for the saints.

We see that his heart turns to the Jews; they occupied his thoughts; and
while desiring to put the seal of performance on the grace which this
collection betokened, he was pre-occupied with them as Jews, as those
who had a claim: a mingled feeling perhaps of one who was anxious to
shew that he did not forget them; for, in fact, he loved his nation. We
have to learn whether, in executing this service (properly that of a
deacon), pleasing as it might be, he was at the height of his mission as
apostle. However that might be, the hand of God was in it to make all
things work for the good of His beloved servant and child, as well as
for His own glory. Paul had a presentiment that it would not perhaps
turn out well, and he asks the prayers of the saints at Rome, that he
might be delivered from the hands of the wicked, and see their face with
joy. We know how it ended: the subject was spoken of when we were
considering the Acts. He saw them indeed at Rome; he was delivered, but
as a prisoner; and we do not know if he ever went to Spain The ways of
God are according to His eternal counsels, and according to His grace,
and according to His perfect wisdom.
