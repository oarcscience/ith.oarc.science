### [Matthew Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)

At length the rejection of the nation, in consequence of their contempt
of the Lord, is plainly shewn, as well as the cessation of all His
relations with them as such, in order to bring out on God's part an
entirely different system, that is to say, the kingdom in a particular
form. Thus this last chapter is the great turning-point of the whole
history. Christ is a divine witness to Himself, and John Baptist has so
to receive Him, as another would. He stood no longer as Messiah
witnessed to, but as Son of God, but gives His full testimony to John.
But the nation had rejected God manifested in warnings and grace alike:
only there was a remnant. Wisdom was justified of her children. Then
comes His submission to His rejection, evil as it might be, as the
Father's will; but this leads Him out into the consciousness of His
personal glory, the real ground of that rejection. All things were
delivered to Him of His Father. None could know Him, nor any the Father
unless He revealed Him. The whole world, tested by His perfection, was
found lying in wickedness (though with a spared remnant), but man was
universally away from God. He looked down from heaven to see, as we
read, but they were all gone out of the way, none righteous, no, not
one. So Jesus, as He walked on the sea, stood alone in a judged world,
judged by His rejection, but now in the sovereign grace of the Father,
as the Son revealing Him, and calling to the revelation of this grace in
Himself. This is just now the new position. He had tried man. The very
thing that He was, hindered their receiving Him. Now he that was weary
must come to Him who stood thus alone, and He would give them rest. They
must learn of Him who thus had absolutely submitted, and they would have
rest as to the world and everything here. So with us: where we wholly
bow, we come into the conscious possession of our privileges as
disowned, on the heavenly and higher ground.

The first circumstance that brought forward the question of His Person,
and of His right to close the dispensation, was the disciples' plucking
the ears of corn and crushing them in their hands to satisfy their
hunger. For this the Pharisees rebuke them, because it was on a Sabbath
day. Jesus sets before them that the king, rejected by the malice of
Saul, had partaken of that which was only given to the priests. The Son
of David, in a similar case, might well enjoy a similar privilege.
Besides God was acting in grace. The priest also profaned the Sabbath in
the service of the temple; and One greater than the temple was there.
Moreover, if they had really known the mind of God, if they had been
imbued with the Spirit which His word declared to be acceptable to Him
"I will have mercy and not sacrifice," they would not have condemned the
guiltless. In addition to this, the Son of man was Lord even of the
Sabbath. Here He no longer takes the title of Messiah, but that of Son
of man a name which bore witness to a new order of things, and to a more
extended power. Now that which He said had great significance; for the
Sabbath was the token of the covenant between Jehovah and the nation
([Eze 20:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012).md); and the Son of man
was declaring His power over it. If that was touched, it was all over
with the covenant.

The same question arises in the synagogue; and the Lord persists in
acting in grace, and in doing good, shewing them that they would do the
same for one of their sheep. This only excites their hatred, great as
was the proof of His beneficent power. They were children of the
murderer. Jesus withdraws from them, and great multitudes follow Him. He
heals them, charging them not to make Him known. In all this however His
doings were but the fulfilment of a prophecy which clearly traces out
the Lord's position at this time. The hour would come when He should
bring forth judgment unto victory. Meanwhile He retained the position of
entire lowliness, in which grace and truth could commend themselves to
those who appreciated and needed them. But in the exercise of this
grace, and in His testimony to the truth, He would do nothing to falsify
this character, or so to attract the attention of men as to prevent His
true work, or which could make it even suspected that He sought His own
honour. Nevertheless the Spirit of Jehovah was upon Him as His beloved,
in whom His soul delighted; and He should declare judgment to the
Gentiles, and they should put their trust in His name. The application
of this prophecy to Jesus at that moment is very evident. We see how
guarded He was with the Jews, abstaining from the gratification of their
carnal desires respecting Himself, and content to be in the background,
if God His Father was glorified; and glorifying Him perfectly Himself on
the earth by doing good. He was soon to be declared to the Gentiles;
whether by the execution of the judgment of God, or by presenting
Himself to them as the One in whom they should trust.

This passage is manifestly placed here by the Holy Ghost, in order to
give the exact representation of His position, before laying open the
new scenes which His rejection prepares for us.

He then casts out a devil from a man who was blind and dumb a sad
condition, truly depicting that of the people with respect to God. The
multitude, full of admiration, exclaim, "Is not this the Son of David?"
But the religionists, on hearing it, jealous of the Lord, and hostile to
the testimony of God, declare that Jesus wrought this miracle by the
power of Beelzebub, thus sealing their own condition, and putting
themselves under the definitive judgment of God. Jesus demonstrates the
absurdity of what they had said. Satan would not destroy his own
kingdom. Their own children, who had the pretension to do the same,
should judge their iniquity. But if not the power of Satan (and the
Pharisees admitted that the devils were really cast out), it was the
finger of God, and the kingdom of God was among them.

He who had come into the strong man's house to spoil his goods had first
to bind him.

The truth is that the presence of Jesus put everything to the test;
everything on God's part was centred in Him. It is Emmanuel Himself who
was there. He who was not with Him was against Him. He who did not
gather with Him scattered. Everything now depended on Him alone. He
would bear with all unbelief as to His own Person. Grace could remove
that. He could pardon all sin; but to speak against and blaspheme the
Holy Ghost (that is, to acknowledge the exercise of a power, which is
that of God, and to attribute it to Satan) could not be pardoned; for
the Pharisees admitted that the devil was cast out, and it was only with
malice, with open-eyed deliberate hatred to God, that they attributed it
to Satan. And what pardon could there be for this? There was none either
in the age of the law \[See Note \#32\] or in that of the Messiah. The
fate of those who thus acted was decided. This the Lord would have them
understand. The fruit proved the nature of the tree. It was essentially
bad. They were a generation of vipers. John had told them the same.
Their words condemned them. Upon this the scribes and Pharisees asked
for a sign. This was nothing but wickedness. They had had signs enough.
It was only stirring up the unbelief of the rest.

This request gives the Lord occasion to pronounce the judgment of this
generation.

There should be only the sign of Jonah for this evil generation. As
Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so
should the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth. But then lo! Christ was already rejected.

The Ninevites by their conduct should condemn this generation in the day
of judgment, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and a
greater than Jonah was here. The queen of the south likewise testified
against the wickedness of this perverse generation. Her heart attracted
by the report of Solomon's wisdom, had led her to him from the uttermost
parts of the earth; and a greater than Solomon was here. Poor ignorant
Gentiles understood the wisdom of God in His word, whether by the
prophet or the king, better than His beloved people, even when the Great
King and Prophet was among them.

This was then His judgment: the unclean spirit (of idolatry) which had
gone out of the people, finding no rest away from Israel (alas! its true
house, whereas they ought to have been the house of God), should return
with seven spirits worse than itself. They would find the house empty,
swept, and garnished; and the last state should be worse than the first.
What a solemn judgment of the people was this that those among whom
Jehovah had walked should become the habitation of an unclean spirit, of
a superabundance of unclean spirits; not merely of seven, the complete
number, but together with these (who would incite them all to madness
against God and those who honoured God, thus leading them to their own
destruction) that other unclean spirit also, who would draw them back
into the wretched idolatry from which they had escaped! Israel's
judgment was pronounced.

In conclusion Jesus publicly breaks the bonds that naturally existed
between Himself and the people after the flesh, acknowledging those only
which were formed by the word of God, and manifested by doing the will
of His Father which was in heaven. Those persons only would He
acknowledge as His relations, who were formed after the pattern of the
sermon on the Mount.

His actions and His words after this bear witness to the new work which
He was really doing on the earth. He leaves (chapter 13) the house and
sits beside the lake. He takes a new position outside, to proclaim to
the multitude that which was His true work. A sower went forth to sow.

Note \#32

Take notice of this expression. We see the manner in which the Holy
Ghost passes on from the time then present to the Jews, which would soon
end, to the time when the Messiah would set up His kingdom, their "world
\[age\] to come." We have a position outside all this, during the
suspension of the public establishment of the kingdom. The apostles even
did but preach or announce it; they did not establish it. Their miracles
were "the powers of the age to come" (compare [Pe1
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md). This, as we shall see
by-and-by, is of great importance. Thus also with regard to the new
covenant, of which Paul was the minister; and yet he did not establish
it with Judah and Israel.
