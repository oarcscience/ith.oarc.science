### [Psalms Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

Psalm 49 is a moral conclusion for all, founded on these judgments of
God. Wealth, elevation, all that is exalted in man, is nothing. Man
expects to endure, gives his own name to his lands, blesses himself, is
praised by posterity, and spoken well of as prudent and wise, seeing he
has done well to himself. They are laid in sheol like sheep. The hope of
the man of the world does not last; he leaves the world he was great in;
his reputation, which lives, is nought for him, deception for others.
Satan's power is for this life; there is no deceiving after it. Man in
honor without understanding is like the beasts that perish, but the
righteous remnant trusts in God: his soul is redeemed from the power of
the grave. God shall accept him. The preservation on earth, or heavenly
blessing is left somewhat vague here. The immediate hope would be of
preserving life; but it would meet those that might be slain with the
fullest and securest hope. It is even so in [Luk
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md), "gain your souls," and in [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013.md). The ambiguity is preserved
there too designedly.
