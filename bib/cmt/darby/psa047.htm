<p>Psalm 47 only pursues this deliverance to its bright results for Israel according to God's glory in the earth. Jehovah is now a great King over all the earth (compare Zechariah 14). He subdues the nations under Israel and Himself chooses their inheritance. This is triumphantly celebrated from Verses 5-9 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005">Psa 47:5-9</A>), and the association of the princes of the peoples now owning God, with the people of the God of Abraham. He is specially Israel's (the remnant's) King, but if He is, He is King of all the earth. In these Verses God Himself is celebrated, but He is the God of Israel. It is the celebration of the earthly part of the millennial glory of God: Israel owned in the delivered remnant being the center. I apprehend Verse 9 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009">Psa 47:9</A>) should be "have joined themselves to the people."
