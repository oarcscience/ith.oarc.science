### [Joshua Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)

But if we are introduced into a life which is on the other side of
death, by the power of the Spirit of God, as being dead and risen in
Christ, there must be the remembrance of that death, by which we have
been delivered from that which is on this side of it, of the ruin of man
as he now is, and of the fallen creation to which he belongs. Twelve
men, one out of each tribe, were to bring stones from the midst of
Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm with the ark,
while all Israel passed over on dry ground. The Holy Ghost brings with
Him, so to speak, the touching memorial of the death of Jesus, by the
mighty power of which He has turned all the effect of the enemy's
strength into life, and deliverance from what could not enter into
heavenly things, and has laid the basis for our having part in them.
Death comes with us from the grave of Jesus: no longer now as death, it
is become life unto us, and, subjectively for faith, the absence of that
which cannot have part in what is heavenly. This memorial was to be set
up at Gilgal. The meaning of this circumstance will be considered in the
next chapter. We will only dwell here on the memorial itself. The twelve
stones, for the twelve tribes, represented the tribes of God as a whole.
This number is the symbol of perfection in human agency, in connection
here, as elsewhere, with Christ, as in the case of the shewbread.

Here also the Spirit sets us-Christians-in a more advanced position.
There were twelve loaves of the shewbread, and we form but one in our
life of union by the Holy Ghost with Christ our Head, which is the life
we speak of here. Now it is His death that is recalled to us in the
memorial left us by the loving-kindness of our Lord, who condescends to
value our remembrance of His love. I only speak here of this memorial as
the sign of that which should always be a reality. We eat His flesh, we
drink His life given for us. Being one now in the power of our union
with Christ risen and glorified, for here I speak of our whole place,
dead to the world and to sin, it is from the bottom of the river into
which He went down to make it the way of life-heavenly life-for us, that
we bring back the precious memorial of His love, and of the place in
which He fulfilled His work. It is a body whose life by blood is closed
\[See Note \#1\] which we eat, a poured out blood which we drink; and
this is the reason why blood was entirely prohibited, to Israel after
the flesh; for how can death be drunk by those who are mortal? But we
drink it because, alive with Him, through the death of Christ we live,
and it is in realising the death of that which is mortal that we live
with Him. The remembrance of Jordan, of death when Christ was in it, is
the remembrance of that power which secured our salvation in the last
stronghold of him who had the power of death. It is the remembrance of
that love which went down into death, in order that, as to us, it should
lose all its power, except that of doing us good, and being a witness
unto us of infinite and unchangeable love.

Note \#1

The word "broken" is wrongly introduced in the common text. It was after
He had given up His spirit to the Father, in full strength, that the
blood was shed through the soldier's spear. He laid down His life of
Himself.
