### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001)

In Psalm 6 the remnant take another ground. They are oppressed, their
soul vexed, the extremity of distress presses on their spirit, and their
conscience not being cleared gives the fear that Jehovah might be
against them in anger, and they look that Jehovah should not rebuke them
in anger nor chasten in hot displeasure, which they had as a nation
deserved but which the redeemed heart deprecates. But they look to be
saved through mercy and saved from death, and call on the wicked to
depart, for Jehovah has heard.
