### [Luke Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#001.md)

In chapter 16, the effect of grace on conduct is presented, and the
contrast that exists (the dispensation being changed) between the
conduct that Christianity requires with regard to the things of the
world, and the position of the Jews in that respect. Now this position
was only the expression of that of man made evident by the law. The
doctrine thus embodied by the parable is confirmed by the parabolic
history of the rich man and Lazarus, lifting up the veil that hides the
other world in which the result of men's conduct is manifested.

Man is the steward of God (that is, God has committed His goods to man).
Israel stands especially in this position.

But man has been unfaithful; Israel had indeed been so. God has taken
away his stewardship; but man is still in possession of the goods to
administer them, at least, in fact (as Israel was at that moment). These
goods are the things of earth that which man can possess according to
the flesh. Having lost his stewardship by his unfaithfulness, and being
still in possession of the goods, he uses them to make friends of his
master's debtors by doing them good. This is what Christians should do
with earthly possessions, using them for others, having the future in
view. The steward might have appropriated the money due to his master;
he preferred gaining friends with it (that is, he sacrifices present to
future advantage). We may turn the miserable riches of this world into
means of fulfilling love. The spirit of grace which fills our hearts
(ourselves the objects of grace) exercises itself with regard to
temporal things, which we use for others. For us it is in view of the
everlasting habitations. "That they may receive you" is equivalent to
"that you may be received" a common form of expression in Luke, to
designate the fact without speaking of the individuals that perform it,
although using the word they.

Observe that earthly riches are not our own things; heavenly riches, in
the case of a true Christian, are his own.

These riches are unrighteous, in that they belong to fallen man, and not
to the heavenly man, nor had any place when Adam was innocent.

Now, when the veil is lifted from the other world, the truth is fully
brought to light. And the contrast between the Jewish dispensation and
the Christian, is clearly unfolded; for Christianity reveals that world,
and, as to its principle, belongs to heaven.

Judaism, according to God's government on earth, promised temporal
blessing to the righteous; but all was in disorder: even the Messiah,
the head of the system, was rejected. In a word, Israel, looked at as
set under responsibility, and to enjoy earthly blessing on obedience,
had entirely failed. Man, in this world, could no longer, on that
footing, be the means of bearing testimony to the ways of God in
government. There will be a time of earthly judgment, but it was not yet
come. Meanwhile, the possession of riches was anything rather than a
proof of God's favour. Personal selfishness, and alas! indifference to a
brother in distress at his door, was, instead, the characteristic of its
possession among the Jews. Revelation opens the other world to our view.
Man, in this world, is fallen, wicked man. If he has received his good
things here, he has the portion of sinful man; he will be tormented,
while the other one whom he had despised will find happiness in the
other world.

It is not a question here of that which gives title to enter heaven, but
of character, and of the contrast between the principles of this world
and the invisible world. The Jew made choice of this world; he has lost
this and the other also. The poor man whom he had thought contemptible
is found in Abraham's bosom. The whole tenor of this parable shews its
connection with the question of Israel's hopes, and the idea that riches
were a proof of the favour of God (an idea which, false as it may be in
every case, is intelligible enough if this world is the scene of
blessing under the government of God). The subject of the parable is
shewn also by that which is found at the end of it. The miserable rich
man desires that his brethren might be warned by some one who had risen
from the dead. Abraham declares to him the uselessness of this means. It
was all over with Israel. God has not again presented His Son to the
nation who rejected Him, despising the law and the prophets. The
testimony of His resurrection met with the same unbelief that had
rejected Him when living, as well as the prophets before Him. There is
no consolation in the other world if the testimony of the word to the
conscience is rejected in this. The gulf cannot be crossed. A returning
Lord would not convince those who had despised the word. All is in
connection with the judgment of the Jews, which would close the
dispensation; as the preceding parable shews what the conduct of
Christians should be with regard to things temporal. All flows from the
grace which, in love on God's part, accomplished the salvation of man,
and set aside the legal dispensation and its principles by bringing in
the heavenly things.
