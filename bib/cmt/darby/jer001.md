### [Jeremiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 1:1</span></span>

In chapter 1 the prophet is established in his office, to which he had
been appointed by Jehovah, even before his birth, that he should carry
His word unto the nations. But Jeremiah's fears are immediately
manifested. The Lord encourages him by the assurance of His presence. He
puts His words into his mouth, and appoints him as prophet over the
nations to root out and to plant. Two visions are shewn him, which
contain the summary of the prophetic charge communicated to him, and
announce that Jerusalem shall soon be stricken by the kingdoms of the
north. Under these circumstances Jeremiah is set before a rebellious
people, who will strive against him. Nevertheless he must declare
everything; and as the Lord had before encouraged the prophet, He now
adds to the encouragement, in order to enforce it, a threat in case of
disobedience; namely, that, if through fear he drew back from his
commission, the Lord would become a greater cause of fear, and would
break him to pieces before those of whom he was afraid. But if he
fulfilled his appointed task, Jehovah would be with him. [Jer
1:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006); [Jer
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017), shew the great fearfulness of
the prophet's spirit, which needed to be thus strengthened by Jehovah.
