### [Isaiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 36, 37, 38, and 39.

Chapters 36-39 relate the history of the invasion of Sennacherib, its
result, and the sickness unto death of Hezekiah, which preceded it: an
instruction for the remnant as to the manner in which the Lord should be
waited on (this deliverance being, as to the substance of it, a figure
of that which will take place with respect to the Assyrian in the last
days). The sickness of Hezekiah furnishes us with a type of the Son of
David as raised from the dead-the power of Christ, which shall be
perfected in a nation raised also-morally-from the dead, all their sins
being pardoned. It is the outward and inward deliverance of Israel:
resurrection (as to its practical power); and deliverance from the
Assyrian. Meanwhile, as a present thing, the captivity in Babylon is
announced.

Previously to this, we have rather had the outward history of Israel;
but now we have their moral or inward history, in their place of
testimony against idolatry, and in their relationship with Christ, and
the separation of a remnant. See the next note further on.
