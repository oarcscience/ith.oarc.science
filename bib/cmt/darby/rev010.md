### [Revelation Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001)

These were preliminary woes on the body of Jews and Christianized
Gentiles, not the direct antagonism of the power of evil with God. This
is now unfolded but first, in the little open book, put in its place in
the general history. The book is open as part of well-known prophecy,
and now brought to a direct issue on known ground; not the unrevealed
and more unmanifest ways of God introducing the final issue. Christ
comes down and affirms His right to all below; puts His right foot on
the sea, the left on the earth, and utters the voice of His might, to
which the voice of the Almighty in power answers. But its revelations
were sealed up; but Christ swears by Him who lives for ever and ever
that there should be no more delay. All things are drawing to a final
issue. In the sounding of the seventh trumpet the mystery of God would
be closed His direct power come. The prophet is to recommence his
prophecy to nations and tongues, and languages.
