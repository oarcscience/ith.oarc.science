### [Jeremiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 39 through 44.

After this, chapter 39 and the following chapters give us the history of
the confusion and iniquity that reigned among the remnant who were not
carried captive to Babylon, in order that they should be scattered, and
that all should fully bear the judgment which God had pronounced.
Nevertheless, if at this last hour this remnant had submitted to the
yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, peace should have reigned in the land, and these
few that remained should have possessed it. But some revolt, and the
others fear the consequences of their folly. There is no idea of
trusting in Jehovah. They consult Jeremiah, but refuse to obey the word
of the Lord from his mouth. They take refuge in Egypt to escape
Nebuchadnezzar, but only to fall under the sword which would have spared
them in Judea, had they remained there in subjection to the king. In
Egypt they give themselves up to idolatry, that the wrath of God might
come upon them to the end. Nevertheless God would spare even a little
remnant of these, but Pharaoh-hophra, in whom they trusted, should be
given up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, as Zedekiah had been.
