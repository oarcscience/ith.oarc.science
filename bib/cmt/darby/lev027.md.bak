### [Leviticus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001.md)

The last chapter (27) treats of the rights and the appointments of God
in all that relates to things which are devoted to Him through the
medium of priesthood. This necessarily finds its place in that which
treats of priesthood; but it has, I doubt not, a much wider meaning. The
subject treated is that of him who devotes himself to God, and that of
the lands belonging to Him-of the rights of Israel, whose possession it
was not, and of their selling it to others. As to Christ, He offered
Himself without spot to God; He was valued at a low price. Israel by
right belonged to Jehovah. As Emmanuel's land, the Israelites only
enjoyed the land without being proprietors, and they could only pledge
it till jubilee; it would then return to its possessor as Emmanuel's
land. Israel (looked at as the possessor of the gift of God) not having
redeemed it when sold to the stranger, when the jubilee comes the land
will be absolutely the Lord's; the priest will possess it. In Zechariah
11 Christ is thus valued, "whom they of the children of Israel did
value." I only point out the principle presented in the chapter, without
pretending to enter into all the details of application which may
suggest themselves. The principle is the important thing to enable one
to understand the purpose of God; in the case of any vow, whether it be
redeemed or not; or of land, whether it shall return in the day of
jubilee, when God shall take possession again of His rights in the land
of Israel, and cause to enter those whose right it is. Thus the
government of God, resulting in His return in grace to His unconditional
promise and \[earthly\] purpose are given to us in chapter 26, and the
absolute title of Jehovah in chapter 27. Chapter 26 is in fact a
parenthesis shewing God's ways, with return to His promise in grace;
chapter 25 man's redeeming, if he could, or his kinsman; chapter 27
God's absolute title.

It is to be observed also, that the judgment is according to the
judgment of the priest. But although this be attributed to the priest,
it is to the king in Jeshurun (the upright) that the appreciation is
entrusted. This shews plainly who is to do it, and under what character,
though being according to the discernment, the grace, and the rights of
priesthood. It is Christ as Priest, but Christ as King in Israel, who
will order all that.
