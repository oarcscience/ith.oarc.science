### [Numbers Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 34, 35, and 36.

Finally, God takes care of His people in all respects; He marks the
limits of the country they were to enjoy. He settles the taking
possession, the portion of His servants, the Levites, who were not to
have any inheritance.

Six of their cities were to be refuges for those who had unintentionally
committed murder; a precious type of God's dealings with Israel, who, in
their ignorance, killed the Christ. In this sense, God judges them to be
innocent. They are guilty of blood which they could not bear, but guilty
in their ignorance, like Saul himself, who is a striking figure, as one
born out of due time (ektroma, [Co1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008).md), of this same position. Such a
murderer, however, remains out of his possession until the death of the
priest living in those days. And so it will be with regard to Israel. As
long as Christ retains His actual priesthood above, Israel will remain
out of their possession, but under the safe keeping of God. The servants
of God at least, who have no inheritance, serve as a refuge to them, and
understand their position, and recognise them as being under the keeping
of God. When this priesthood above, such as it now is, ends, Israel will
return into their possession. If they did before, it would be to pass
over the blood of Christ, as if the shedding of it were no matter, and
the land would be defiled thereby. Now, the actual position of Christ is
always a testimony to this rejection, and of His death in the midst of
the people. God maintains the inheritance, however, as He has appointed
it (chap. 36).

This last part, then, of the book presents, not the passage itself
through the desert, but the relationship between that position, and the
possession of the promises and of the rest which follows. It is in the
plains of Moab that Moses bore testimony, and a true testimony, to the
perverseness of the people; but where God justified them, shewing His
counsels of grace, in taking their side against the enemy, without even
their knowledge, and pursued all the designs of His grace and of His
determinate purpose for the complete establishment of His people in the
land He had promised them. Blessed be His name! Happy are we in being
allowed to study His ways!
