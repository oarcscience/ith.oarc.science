### [Isaiah Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 64 and 65.

The next two chapters give us a full revelation of the dealings of God
in answer to this appeal. First of all, God, through His grace, had been
sought after by others. He had made Himself known to those who were not
called by His name. The infinite and sovereign grace of God had sought
out the poor Gentiles. At the same time, with infinite patience, He had
stretched forth His hands to a people who would not have Him -to a
people who provoked Him continually in the grossest manner. And now He
declares His mind. The people that forsook Him shall be judged; He will
number them with the sword; they shall bow down to the slaughter. But
there shall be an elect remnant in grace-the servants of Jehovah, who
shall be spared and blessed ([Isa
64:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011.md); [Isa
65:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md); [Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013.md); [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015).md). Jehovah would then introduce
an entirely new order of things, in which the truth of His promises
should be acknowledged, and the former things should be quite
forgotten-new heavens and a new earth, not as yet with respect to the
physical change, but the moral order of which should be entirely new. It
should not be only a new order of things on the earth, which the power
of evil in the heavens might spoil, as in former days; the state of the
heavens themselves should be new. We learn elsewhere that Satan will
have been cast out, and his power there gone for ever. \[See Note \#1\]
Indeed, this would have been the occasion of the last terrible trials in
Jerusalem. But now Jerusalem should be blessed in the earth, and her
people should enjoy the gifts of Jehovah in as long a life as that of
men before the flood. A man of a hundred years old should be a child;
and if any one should die at that age, he must be looked upon as cut off
by the curse of God. God would always grant the prayers of His people.
Peace should be established, and there should be no evil in all His holy
mountain. This is the millennial state of the Jews.

Note \#1

Hence, when the Lord enters into Jerusalem as Jehovah Messiah, it is
said ([Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038).md) "peace in heaven."
