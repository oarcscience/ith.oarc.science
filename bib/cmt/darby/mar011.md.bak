### [Mark Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#001.md)

In that which follows (chapter 11) Jesus presents Himself to Jerusalem
as King. His reception shews the extent to which the testimony He had
rendered had acted on the hearts of the simple. God ordained therefore
that it should take place. There is little difference between the
narrative here and in Matthew. Only the kingdom is more simply presented
as such: "The kingdom of our father David."

With what dignity, as the Judge of all things, Jesus now takes knowledge
of all that was being done in the temple, and goes out without saying
anything! The Lord had visited His temple, as also He had entered the
city riding on the ass's colt, whereon never man sat. Israel is judged
in the condemned fig tree. \[See Note \#15\] The glory of the Lord, of
the house of Jehovah, is vindicated with authority an authority which He
claims, and which He exercises in His own Person. The scribes and chief
priests draw back before the ascendency that His word had given Him over
the people, and He goes out of the city without being molested,
notwithstanding their malice. The next day He assures His disciples, who
were astonished at seeing the fig tree withered away, that whatsoever
they asked in faith should be accomplished; but that they must act in
grace, if they would enjoy this privilege. The scribes and priests and
elders are confounded, and demand His authority. He addresses their
conscience, but in such a manner as to demonstrate their incompetency to
ask Him such a question, exposing at the same time their insincerity.
They could not decide with respect to the baptism of John: by what right
then could they subject Him to their questions respecting His own
claims? They could not decide when the case was before them. On the
other hand, they must either sanction His work by their reply, or lose
their authority with the people by denying the baptism of John who had
borne testimony to Christ. It was no longer a question of winning these
men; but what an empty thing is the wisdom of man in the presence of God
and His wisdom!

The change of dispensation has a more definite place in Matthew, and the
sin which rejected the King. In Mark, it is more the service of Christ
as the Prophet. Afterwards, as we have seen, He presents Himself as
King. And, in both Gospels, we see that it is Jehovah who fills the
office which He has deigned to undertake.

Consequently we find in Matthew more personal accusations, as in the
parable of the two sons ([Mat
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028).md), and the detail of the
change of dispensation in the parable of the marriage feast ([Mat
22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001).md); neither of which is in Mark.
In our Gospel, the unchangeable dignity of His Person, and the simple
fact that the Prophet and King were rejected (rejection that led to
Israel's judgment) are set before us by the Spirit of God. Otherwise it
is the same general testimony we have reviewed in Matthew.
