### [Acts Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001.md)

Chapter 2 relates the fulfilment of this promise, in answer to the
spirit of dependence manifested in their united prayers.

The Spirit comes from above, in His own power, to possess and fill the
dwelling-place prepared for Him.

This event, important beyond all others with respect to man's condition
here below, has here a very simple character, because there is no
question of the causes of this marvellous gift, of the work on which it
depends, of the glory with which it is connected and which it reveals,
and of which it is the earnest: we have here only the fact of its power.
The disciples "were endued with power from on high."

The form of its appearance, however, is characteristic. On Jesus the
Holy Ghost descended in the shape of a dove, because He was not to make
His voice heard in the streets, nor break the bruised reed, nor quench
the smoking flax. But here it was the power of God in testimony, the
word; which was like consuming fire, judging all that came before it.
Nevertheless it was in grace, and was to go beyond the narrow limits of
Jewish ordinances to proclaim the wonderful works of God to every tongue
and nation under the sun. It was that mighty wind from heaven, which
manifested itself to the disciples, and came upon them in the form of
tongues of fire, each one divided into several. This marvel attracts the
multitude; and the reality of this divine work is proved by the fact
that persons from numerous countries hear these poor Galileans proclaim
to them the wonderful works of God, each one in the language of the
country whence he came up to Jerusalem. \[See Note \#4\]

The Jews, who did not understand these languages, mock; and Peter
declares to them in their own tongue, and according to their own
prophecies, the true character of that which had taken place. He takes
his stand upon the resurrection of Christ, foretold by the prophet-king,
and upon His exaltation by the right hand of God. This Jesus, whom they
had crucified, had there received the promise of the Father, and shed
forth that which produced the effects that they heard and saw. They were
therefore to know assuredly, that God had made that same Jesus whom they
had rejected both Lord and Christ.

The character of this testimony will be remarked here. It is essentially
that of Peter. It goes no farther than the affirmation of the fact, that
He who had been rejected by the Jews is made in heaven Lord and Christ.
It begins with Jesus known of the Jews on earth, and establishes the
truth of His being raised again, and exalted to the position of Lord.
God has done this. The apostle does not even proclaim Him as the Son of
God. We shall see that, if it is not done by Peter in the Acts, Paul on
the contrary does it from the first moment of his conversion. Peter
states the result at that moment in power, and does not speak of the
kingdom. He only reminds them that the Spirit was promised in the last
days, and alludes to the terrible day of the coming judgment, which
would be preceded by alarming signs and wonders. Without speaking of the
fulfilment of the promise of the kingdom, the time of which the Father
had kept secret, he puts the fact of the gift of the Holy Ghost in
connection with the responsibility of Israel, to whom God still acted in
grace, by preaching to them a glorified Christ, and by giving them
proofs of His glory in the gift of the Holy Ghost, made sensible to all.
This is the presence of the Holy Ghost according to [Joh
15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md). The testimony as a whole,
however, is founded on and carries out the mission of Luke 24. Only in
Luke we have nothing of baptism. See [Luk
24:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md), to which this fully
corresponds. The testimony was addressed to the Jews; nevertheless it
was not confined to them, \[See Note \#5\] and it was separative.
"Separate yourselves from this untoward generation." This separation was
founded on a real and moral work "repent": the past was all to be
judged, and publicly demonstrated by their reception amongst Christians
by baptism, in order to receive the remission of their sins, and
participate in this heavenly gift of the Holy Ghost. "Repent, and be
baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." This work is
individual. There was judgment on all the past, the admission amongst
them by baptism, and the consequent participation in the Holy Ghost, who
dwelt where they came. We see at once the difference between the moral
change already wrought, the repentance which their godly sorrow works,
and the reception of the Holy Ghost. This was consequent on the
remission of their sins to which they were brought. This gift depended
in a regular way on their admission amongst Christians, the house where
He dwelt, built in the name of Jesus. Afterwards the promise is declared
to belong to them and to their children to the house of Israel as such
to them and to their children after them. But it went beyond the limits
of God's ancient people. The promise was also to those that were afar
off; for it was fulfilled, in connection with faith in Christ, to all
who through grace should come into the new house all whom the Lord, the
God of Israel, should call. The call of God characterised the blessing.
Israel, with her children, was owned, but a remnant called out from
among them. The Gentiles, being called, shared the blessing.

The result of this ineffable gift is related to us. It was not merely a
moral change, but a power which set aside all the motives that
individualised those who had received it, by uniting them as one soul
and in one mind. They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine;
they were in communion with each other and the apostles; they broke
bread; they spent their time in prayer. The sense of God's presence was
powerful among them; and many signs and wonders were wrought by the
hands of the apostles. They were united in the closest bonds; no man
called anything his own, but all divided their possessions with those
that needed. They were daily in the temple, the public resort of Israel
for religious exercises, whilst having their own apart breaking bread at
home daily. They ate with joy and gladness of heart, praising God, and
having favour with all the people around them.

Thus the assembly was formed; and the Lord added to it daily the remnant
of Israel, who were to be saved from the judgments that should fall on a
nation which had rejected the Son of God, their Messiah; and, thank God,
from yet deeper ruin. God brought into the assembly thus owned of Him by
the presence of the Holy Ghost those whom He spared in Israel. \[See
Note \#6\] A new order of things had commenced, marked by the presence
of the Holy Ghost. \[See Note \#7\] Here was found the presence and the
house of God, although the old order of things still existed until the
execution of judgment upon it.

The assembly was formed therefore by the power of the Holy Ghost come
down from heaven, on the testimony that Jesus, who had been rejected,
was raised up to heaven, being made of God both Lord and Christ. It was
composed of the Jewish remnant who were to be spared, with the reserve
of bringing in Gentiles whenever God should call them. It was as yet
formed in connection with Israel in the patience of God, yet apart in
power, God's dwelling place.

Note \#4

The rationalistic notion that it was a kind of excited gibberish, just
as the unbelieving Jews thought, is absurd beyond conception. Think of
Paul's thanking God that he spoke more kinds of gibberish than they all,
and God giving a gift for interpreting gibberish!

Note \#5

The testimony is in terms which, applying to Jews there and scattered
abroad, yet opened the door to the Gentiles in the sovereignty of God
"all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call." God is
still the God of man; but He calls whom He pleases.

Note \#6

This is the force of ('soozomenos') "those that were to be saved," [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md).

Note \#7

God never dwelt with man but on the ground of redemption, not with Adam
nor Abraham. Compare [Exo 29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046.md).
