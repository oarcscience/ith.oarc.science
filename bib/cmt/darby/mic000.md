Introduction to Micah

The prophecy of Micah is of the same date, and, up to a certain point,
has the same character as that of Isaiah. That is to say, it treats
especially of the introduction of the Messiah into the scene of the
development of God's dealings towards Israel, and even speaks
particularly of His presence in connection with the attack of the
Assyrian This prophecy has nevertheless its own peculiar character; it
enters, like those of Hosea and Amos, into the moral condition of the
people, and connects the judgment of the world at large with the
condition of the Jews, as we have had it typically brought before us in
Jonah. Samaria also is in part the subject of this prophecy, so that its
application extends to all Israel.
