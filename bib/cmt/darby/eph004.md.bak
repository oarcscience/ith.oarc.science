### [Ephesians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md)

The faithful were to seek in the dispositions mentioned above to
maintain this unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace. There are three
things in this exhortation: first, to walk worthy of their calling;
second, the spirit in which they were to do so; third, diligence in
maintaining the unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace. It is
important to observe, that this unity of the Spirit is not similarity of
sentiment, but the oneness of the members of the body of Christ
established by the Holy Ghost, maintained practically by a walk
according to the Spirit of grace. It is evident that the diligence
required for the maintenance of the unity of the Spirit relates to the
earth and to the manifestation of this unity on the earth.

The apostle now founds his exhortation on the different points of view
under which this unity may be considered in connection with the Holy
Ghost, with the Lord, and with God.

There is one body and one Spirit; not merely an effect produced in the
heart of individuals, in order that they might mutually understand each
other, but one body. The hope was one, of which this Spirit was the
source and the power. This is the essential, real, and abiding unity.

There is also one Lord. With Him was connected "one faith" and "one
baptism." This is the public profession and recognition of Christ as
Lord. Compare the address in 1 Corinthians.

Finally there is one God and Father of all, who is above all, and
through all, and in us all.

What mighty bonds of unity! The Spirit of God, the lordship of Christ,
the universal ubiquity of God, even the Father, all tend to bring into
unity those connected with each as a divine centre. All the religious
relationships of the soul, all the points by which we are in contact
with God, agree to form all believers into one in this world, in such a
manner that no man can be a Christian without being one with all those
who are so. We cannot exercise faith, nor enjoy hope, nor express
christian life in any form whatever, without having the same faith and
the same hope as the rest, without giving expression to that which
exists in the rest. Only we are called on to maintain it practically.

We may remark, that the three spheres of unity presented in these three
Verses have not the same extent. The circle of unity enlarges each time.
With the Spirit we find linked the unity of the body, the essential and
real unity produced by the power of the Spirit uniting to Christ all His
members: with the Lord, that of faith and of baptism. Here each
individual has the same faith, the same baptism: it is the outward
profession, true and real perhaps, but a profession, in reference to Him
who has rights over those that call themselves by His name. With regard
to the third character of unity, it relates to claims that extend to all
things, although to the believer it is a closer bond, because He who has
a right over all things dwells in believers. \[See Note \#17\] Observe
here, that it is not only a unity of sentiment, of desire, and of heart.
That unity is pressed upon them; but it is in order to maintain the
realisation, and the manifestation here below, of a unity that belongs
to the existence and to the eternal position of the assembly in Christ.
There is one Spirit, but there is one body. The union of hearts in the
bond of peace, which the apostle desires, is for the public maintenance
of this unity; not that there might be patience with one another when
that has disappeared, Christians contenting themselves with its absence.
One does not accept that which is contrary to the word, although in
certain cases those who are in it ought to be borne with. The
consideration of the community of position and of privilege, enjoyed by
all the children of God in the relationships of which we have now been
speaking, served to unite them with each other in the sweet enjoyment of
this most precious position, leading them also, each one, to rejoice in
love at the part which every other member of the body had in this
happiness.

But, on the other hand, the fact that Christ was exalted to be in heaven
the Head over all things, brought in a difference which appertained to
this supremacy of Christ a supremacy exercised with divine sovereignty
and wisdom. "Unto every one of us is given grace \[gift\] according to
the measure of the gift of Christ" (that is to say, as Christ sees fit
to bestow). With regard to our position of joy and blessing in Christ,
we are one. With regard to our service, we have each an individual place
according to His divine wisdom, and according to His sovereign rights in
the work. The foundation of this title, whatever may be the divine power
that is exercised in it, is this: man was under the power of Satan
miserable condition, the fruit of his sin, a condition to which his
self-will had reduced him, but in which (according to the judgment of
God who had pronounced on him the sentence of death) he was a slave in
body and mind to the enemy who had the power of death with reservation
of the sovereign rights and sovereign grace of God (see [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).md). Now Christ has made Himself man,
and began by going as man, led by the Spirit, to meet Satan. He overcame
him. As to His personal power, He was able to drive him out everywhere,
and to deliver man. But man would not have God with him; nor was it
possible for men, in their sinful condition, to be united to Christ
without redemption. The Lord however, carrying on His perfect work of
love, suffered death, and overcame Satan in that his last stronghold,
which God's righteous judgment maintained in force against sinful man a
judgment which Christ therefore underwent, accomplishing a redemption
that was complete, final, and eternal in its value; so that neither
Satan, the prince of death and accuser of the children of God on earth,
nor even the judgment of God, had anything more to say to the redeemed.
The kingdom of Satan was taken from him; the just judgment of God was
undergone and completely satisfied. All judgment is committed to the
Son, and power over all men, because He is the Son of man. These two
results are not yet manifested, although the Lord possesses all power in
heaven and in earth. The thing here spoken of is another result which is
accomplished meanwhile. The victory is complete. He has led the
adversary captive. In ascending to heaven He has placed victorious man
above all things, and has led captive all the power that previously had
dominion over man.

Now before manifesting in person the power He had gained as man by
binding Satan, before displaying it in the blessing of man on earth, He
exhibits it in the assembly, His body, by imparting, as He had promised,
to men delivered from the enemy's dominion gifts which are the proof of
that power.

Chapter 1 had laid open to us the thoughts of God; Chapter 2 the
fulfilment, in power, of His thoughts with regard to the redeemed Jews
or Gentiles, all dead in their sins to form them into the assembly.
Chapter 3 is the especial development of the mystery in that which
concerned the Gentiles in Paul's administration of it on earth. Here
(Chapter 4) the assembly is presented in its unity as a body, and in the
varied functions of its members; that is to say, the positive effect of
those counsels in the assembly here below. But this is founded on the
exaltation of Christ, who, the conqueror of the enemy, has ascended to
heaven as man.

Thus exalted, He has received gifts in man, that is, in His human
character (compare [Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033).md). It is
thus "in man," that it is expressed in Psalm 68, from whence the
quotation is taken. Here, having received these gifts as the Head of the
body, Christ is the channel of their communication to others. They are
gifts for men.

Three things here characterise Him a man ascended on high a man who has
led captive him who held man in captivity a man who has received for
men, delivered from that enemy, the gifts of God, which bear witness to
this exaltation of man in Christ, and serve as a means for the
deliverance of others. For this Chapter does not speak of the more
direct signs of the Spirit's power, such as tongues, miracles such as
are usually termed miraculous gifts. But what the Lord as Head confers
on individuals, they are the gifts, as His servants for forming the
saints to be with Him, and for the edification of the body the fruit of
His care over them. Hence, as already remarked, their continuance (till
we all, one after another, grow up to the head) is stated as to power,
by the Spirit; in 1 Corinthians 12 it is not.

But let us pause here for a moment, to contemplate the import of that
which we have been considering.

What a complete and glorious work is that which the Lord has
accomplished for us, and of which the communication of these gifts is
the precious testimony! When we were the slaves of Satan and
consequently of death, as well as the slaves of sin, we have seen that
He was pleased to undergo for the glory of God that which hung over us.
He went down into death of which Satan had the power. And so complete
was the victory of man in Him, so entire our deliverance, that (exalted
Himself as man to the right hand of God's throne He who had been under
death) He has rescued us from the enemy's yoke, and uses the privilege
which His position and His glory give Him to make those who were
captives before, the vessels of His power for the deliverance of others
also. He gives us the right, as under His jurisdiction, of acting in His
holy war, moved by the same principles of love as Himself. Such is our
deliverance that we are the instruments of His power against the enemy
His fellow-labourers in love through His power. Hence the connection
between practical godliness, the complete subjugation of the flesh, and
the capacity to serve Christ as instruments in the hand of the Holy
Ghost, and the vessels of His power.

Now the Lord's ascension has immense significancy in connection with His
Person and work. He ascended indeed as man, but He first descended as
man even into the darkness of the grave and of death; and from thence
victorious over the power of the enemy who had the power of death, and
having blotted out the sins of His redeemed ones, and accomplished the
glory of God in obedience He takes His place as man above the heavens in
order that He may fill all things; not only as being God, but according
to the glory and the power of a position in which He was placed by the
accomplishment of the work of redemption a work which led Him into the
depths of the power of the enemy, and placed Him on the throne of God a
position that He holds, not only by the title of Creator, which was
already His, but by that of Redeemer, which shelters from evil all that
is found within the sphere of the mighty efficacy of His work a sphere
filled with blessing, with grace, and with Himself. Glorious truth,
which belongs at the same time to the union of the divine and human
natures in the Person of Christ, and to the work of redemption
accomplished by suffering on the cross!

Love brought Him down from the throne of God, and, being found as a man,
\[See Note \#18\] through the same grace, into the darkness of death.
Having died, bearing our sins, He has gone up again to that throne as
man, filling all things. He went below the creature into death, and is
gone above it.

But while filling all things by virtue of His glorious Person, and in
connection with the work which He accomplished, He is also in immediate
relation with that which in the counsels of God is closely united to Him
who thus fills all things, with that which has been especially the
object of His work of redemption. It is His body, His assembly, united
to Him by the bond of the Holy Ghost to complete this mystical man, to
be the bride of this second Man, who fills all in all-a body which, as
manifested here below, is set in the midst of a creation that is not yet
delivered, and in the presence of enemies that are in the heavenly
places, until Christ shall exercise, on the part of God His Father, the
power that has been committed to Him as man. When Christ shall thus
exercise His power, He will take vengeance on those who have defiled His
creation by seducing man, who had been its head down here and the image
of Him who was to be its Head everywhere. He will also deliver creation
from its subjection to evil. Meanwhile, personally exalted as the
glorious man, and seated at God's right hand until God shall make His
enemies His footstool, He communicates the gifts necessary for the
gathering together of those who are to be the companions of His glory,
who are the members of His body, and who shall be manifested with Him
when His glory shines forth in the midst of this world of darkness.

The apostle shews us here an assembly already delivered, and exercising
the power of the Spirit; which on the one side delivers souls, and on
the other builds them up in Christ, that they may grow up to the measure
of their Head in spite of all the power of Satan which still subsists.

But an important truth is connected with this fact. This spiritual power
is not exercised in a manner simply divine. It is Christ ascended (He
however who had previously descended into the lower parts of the earth)
who, as man, has received these gifts of power. It is thus that Psalm 68
speaks as well as [Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md). The
latter passage speaks also of the gifts bestowed on His members. In our
Chapter it is only in the latter way that they are mentioned. He has
given gifts unto men.

I would also remark, that these gifts are not here presented as gifts
bestowed by the Holy Ghost come down to earth, and distributing to every
one according to His will: nor are those gifts spoken of which are
tokens of spiritual power suited to act as signs upon those that are
outside: but they are ministrations for gathering together and for
edification established by Christ as Head of the body by means of gifts
with which He endows persons as His choice. Ascended on high, and having
taken His place as man at the right hand of God, and filling all things,
whatever may be the extent of His glory, Christ has first for His object
to fulfil the ways of God in love in gathering souls, and in particular
towards the saints and the assembly; to establish the manifestation of
the divine nature, and to communicate to the assembly the riches of that
grace which the ways of God display, and of which the divine nature is
the source. It is in the assembly that the nature of God, the counsels
of grace, and the efficacious work of Christ are concentrated in their
object; and these gifts are the means of ministering, in the
communication of these, in blessing to man.

Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers: apostles and
prophets laying, or rather being laid, as the foundations of the
heavenly building, and acting as coming directly from the Lord in an
extraordinary manner; the two other classes (the last being sub-divided
into two gifts, connected in their nature) belonging to ordinary
ministry in all ages. It is important to remark also, that the apostle
sees nothing existing before the exaltation of Christ save man the child
of wrath, the power of Satan, the power which raised us up (dead in sins
as we were) with Christ, and the efficacy of the cross, which had
reconciled us to God, and abolished the distinction between Jew and
Gentile in the assembly, to unite them in one body before God the cross
in which Christ drank the cup and bore the curse, so that wrath has
passed away for the believer, and in which a God of love, a Saviour God,
is fully manifested.

So the existence of the apostles dates here only from the gifts that
followed the exaltation of Jesus. The twelve as sent out by Jesus on
earth have no place in the instruction of this epistle, which treats of
the body of Christ, of the unity and the members of this body; and the
body could not exist before the Head existed and had taken His place as
such. Thus also we have seen that, when the apostle speaks of the
apostles and prophets, the latter are to him those exclusively of the
New Testament, and those who have been made such by Christ after His
ascension. It is the new heavenly man who, being the exalted Head in
heaven, forms His body on the earth. He does it for heaven, putting the
individuals who compose it spiritually and intelligently in connection
with the Head by the power of the Holy Ghost acting in this body on the
earth; the gifts, of which the apostle here speaks, being the channels
by which His graces are communicated according to the bonds which the
Holy Ghost forms with the Head.

The proper and immediate effect is the perfecting of individuals
according to the grace that dwells in the Head. The shape which this
divine action takes, further, is the work of the ministry, and the
formation of the body of Christ, until all the members are grown up into
the measure of the stature of Christ their Head. Christ has been
revealed in all His fulness: it is according to this revelation that the
members of the body are to be formed in the likeness of Christ, known as
filling all things, and as the Head of His body, the revelation of the
perfect love of God, of the excellency of man before Him according to
His counsels, of man the vessel of all His grace, all His power, and all
His gifts. Thus the assembly, and each one of the members of Christ,
should be filled with the thoughts and the riches of a well-known
Christ, instead of being tossed to and fro by all sort of doctrines
brought forward by the enemy to deceive souls.

The Christian was to grow up according to all that was revealed in
Christ, and to be ever increasing in likeness to his Head; using love
and truth for his own soul the two things of which Christ is the perfect
expression. Truth displays the real relation of all things with each
other in connection with the centre of all things, which is God revealed
now in Christ. Love is that which God is in the midst of all this. Now
Christ, as the light, put everything precisely in its place man, Satan,
sin, righteousness, holiness, all things, and that in every detail, and
in connection with God. And Christ was love, the expression of the love
of God in the midst of all this. And this is our pattern; and our
pattern as having overcome, and, as having ascended into heaven, our
Head, to which we are united as the members of His body.

There flows from this Head, by means of its members, the grace needed to
accomplish the work of assimilation to Himself. His body, compacted
together, increases by the working of His grace in each member, and
edifies itself in love. \[See Note \#19\] This is the position of the
assembly according to God, until all the members of the body attain to
the stature of Christ. The manifestation alas! of this unity is marred;
but the grace, and the operation of the grace of its Head to nourish and
cause its members to grow, is never impaired, any more than the love in
the Lord's heart from which this grace springs. We do not glorify Him,
we have not the joy of being ministers of joy to each other as we might
be; but the Head does not cease to work for the good of His body. The
wolf indeed comes and scatters the sheep, but he cannot pluck them out
of the Shepherd's hands. His faithfulness is glorified in our
unfaithfulness without excusing it.

With this precious object of the ministration of grace (namely, for the
growth of each member individually unto the measure of the stature of
the Head Himself), with the ministration of each member in its place to
the edifying itself in love, ends this development of the counsels of
God in the union of Christ and the assembly, in its double character of
the body of Christ in heaven, and the habitation of the Holy Ghost on
earth truths which cannot be separated, but each of which has its
distinctive importance, and which reconcile the certain immutable
operations of grace in the Head with the failures of the assembly
responsible on the earth.

Exhortations to a walk befitting such a position follow, in order that
the glory of God in us and by us, and His grace towards us, may be
identified in our full blessing. We will notice the great principles of
these exhortations.

The first is the contrast \[See Note \#20\] between the ignorance of a
heart that is blind, and a stranger to the life of God, and consequently
walking in the vanity of its own understanding, that is, according to
the desires of a heart given up to the impulses of the flesh without God
the contrast, I say, between this state, and that of having learnt
Christ, as the truth is in Jesus (which is the expression of the life of
God in man, God Himself manifested in the flesh), the having put off
this old man, which is corrupt itself according to its deceitful lusts,
and put on this new man, Christ. It is not an amelioration of the old
man; it is a putting it off, and a putting on of Christ.

Even here the apostle does not lose sight of the oneness of the body; we
are to speak the truth, because we are members one of another. "Truth,"
the expression of simplicity and integrity of heart, is in connection
with "the truth as it is in Jesus," whose life is transparent as the
light, as falsehood is in connection with deceitful lusts.

Moreover, the old man is without God, alienated from the life of God.
The new man is created, it is a new creation, and a creation \[See Note
\#21\] after the model of that which is the character of God
righteousness and holiness of truth. The first Adam was not in that
manner created after the image of God. By the fall the knowledge of good
and evil entered into man. He can no longer be innocent. When innocent,
he was ignorant of evil in itself. Now, fallen, he is a stranger to the
life of God in his ignorance: but the knowledge of good and evil which
he has acquired, the moral distinction between good and evil in itself,
is a divine principle. "The man," said God, "is become as one of us, to
know good and evil." But in order to possess this knowledge, and subsist
in what is good before God, there must be divine energy, divine life.

Everything has its true nature, its true character, in the eyes of God.
That is the truth. It is not that He is the truth. The truth is the
right and perfect expression of that which a thing is (and, in an
absolute way, of that which all things are), and of the relations in
which it stands to other things, or in which all things stand towards
each other. Thus God could not be the truth. He is not the expression of
some other thing. Everything relates to Him. He is the centre of all
true relationship, and of all moral obligation. Neither is God the
measure of all things, for He is above all things; and nothing else can
be so above them, or He would not be so. \[See Note \#22\] It is God
become man; it is Christ, who is the truth, and the measure of all
things. But all things have their true character in the eyes of God: and
He judges righteously of all, whether morally or in power. He acts
according to that judgment. He is just. He also knows evil perfectly,
being Himself goodness, that it may be perfectly an abomination to Him,
that He may repel it by His own nature. He is holy. Now the new man,
created after the divine nature, is so in righteousness and holiness of
truth. What a privilege! What a blessing! It is, as another apostle has
said, to be "partakers of the divine nature." Adam had nothing of this.

Adam was perfect as an innocent man. The breath of life in his nostrils
was breathed into him by God, and he was responsible for obedience to
God in a thing wherein neither good nor evil was to be known, but simply
a commandment. The trial was that of obedience only, not the knowledge
of good or evil in itself. At present, in Christ, the portion of the
believer is a participation in the divine nature itself, in a being who
knows good and evil, and who vitally participates in the sovereign good,
morally in the nature of God Himself, although always thereby dependent
on Him. It is our evil nature which is not so, or at least which refuses
to be dependent on Him.

Now there is a prince of this world, a stranger to God; and, besides
participation in the divine nature, there is the Spirit Himself who has
been given to us. These solemn truths enter also as principles into
these exhortations. "Give no place to the devil," on the one hand give
him no room to come in and act on the flesh; and, on the other hand,
"grieve not the Holy Spirit" who dwells in you. The redemption of the
creature has not yet taken place, but ye have been sealed unto that day:
respect and cherish this mighty and holy guest who graciously dwells in
you. Let all bitterness and malice therefore cease even in word, and let
meekness and kindness reign in you according to the pattern you have in
the ways of God in Christ towards you. Be imitators of God: beautiful
and magnificent privilege! but which flows naturally from the truth that
we are made partakers of His nature, and that His Spirit dwells in us.

These are the two great subjective principles of the Christian the
having put off the old man and put on the new, and the Holy Ghost's
dwelling in him. Nor can anything be more blessed than the pattern of
life here given to the Christian, founded on our being a new creation.
It is perfect subjectively and objectively. First, subjectively, the
truth in Jesus is the having put off the old man and put on the new,
which has God for its pattern. It is created after God in the perfection
of His moral character. But this is not all. The Holy Spirit of God by
which we are sealed to the day of redemption dwells in us: we are not to
grieve Him. These are the two elements of our state, the new man created
after God, and the presence of the Holy Spirit of God; and He is
emphatically here called the Spirit of God, as in connection with God's
character.

And next objectively: created after God, and God dwelling in us, God is
the pattern of our walk, and thus in respect of the two words which
alone give God's essence love and light. We are to walk in love, as
Christ loved us and gave Himself for us a sacrifice to God. "For us" was
divine love; "to God" is perfection of object and motive. Law takes up
the love of self as the measure of love to others. Christ gives up self
wholly and for us, but to God. Our worthlessness enhances the love but,
on the other hand, an affection and a motive have their worth from the
object (and with Christ that was God Himself), self wholly given up.
For, so to speak, we may love up and love down. When we look upward in
our affections, the nobler the object the nobler the affection; when it
is downwards, the more unworthy the object, the more pure and absolute
the love. Christ was perfect in both, and absolutely so. He gave Himself
for us, and to God. Afterwards we are light in the Lord. We cannot say
we are love, for love is sovereign goodness in God; we walk in it, like
Christ. But we are light in the Lord. This is the second essential name
of God and as partakers of the divine nature we are light in the Lord.
Here again Christ is the pattern. "Christ shall give thee light." We are
called on, then, as His dear children to imitate God.

This life, in which we participate and of which we live as partakers of
the divine nature, has been objectively presented to us in Christ in all
its perfection and in all its fulness; in man, and in man now brought to
perfection on high, according to the counsels of God respecting Him. It
is Christ, this eternal life, who was with the Father and has been
manifested unto us He who, having then first descended, has ascended now
into heaven to carry humanity thither, and display it in the glory the
glory of God according to His eternal counsels. We have seen this life
here in its earthly development: God manifest in flesh; man, perfectly
heavenly, and obedient in all things to His Father, moved, in His
conduct to others, by the motives that characterise God Himself in
grace. Hereafter He will be manifested in judgment; and already, here
below, He has gone through all the experiences of a man, understanding
thus how grace adapts itself to our wants, and displaying it now,
according to that knowledge, even as hereafter He will exercise judgment
with a knowledge of man, not only divine, but which, having gone through
this world in holiness, will leave the hearts of men without excuse and
without escape.

But it is the image of God in Him, of which we are now speaking. It is
in Him that the nature which we have to imitate is presented to us, and
presented in man as it ought to be developed in us here below, in the
circumstances through which we are passing. We see in Him the
manifestation of God, and that in contrast with the old man. There we
see "the truth as it is in Jesus," save that in us it involves the
putting off of the old man and putting on the new, answering to Christ's
death and resurrection (compare particularly as to His death, [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md); [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001).md). Thus, in order to attract and to
lead on our hearts, to give us the model on which they are to be formed,
the aim to which they should tend, God has given us an object in which
He manifests Himself, and which is the object of all His own delight.

The reproduction of God in man is the object that God proposed to
Himself in the new man; and that the new man proposes to himself, as he
is himself the reproduction of the nature and the character of God.
There are two principles for the Christian's path, according to the
light in which he views himself. Running his race as man towards the
object of his heavenly calling, in which he follows after Christ
ascended on high: he is running the heavenward race; the excellency of
Christ to be won there, his motive that is not the Ephesian aspect. In
the Ephesians he is sitting in heavenly places in Christ, and he has to
come out as from heaven, as Christ really did, and manifest God's
character upon earth, of which, as we have seen, Christ is the pattern.
We are called, as in the position of dear children, to shew our Father's
ways.

We are not created anew according to that which the first Adam was, but
according to that which God is: Christ is its manifestation. And He is
the second Man, the last Adam. \[See Note \#23\] In detail we shall find
these characteristic features: truthfulness, the absence of all anger
that has the nature of hatred (lying and hatred are the two
characteristics of the enemy); practical righteousness connected with
labour according to the will of God (man's true position); and the
absence of corruption. It is man under the rule of God since the fall,
delivered from the effect of the deceitful lusts. But it is more than
this. A divine principle brings in the desire of doing good to others,
to their body and their soul. I need not say how truly we find here the
picture of the life of Christ, as in the preceding remarks it was the
putting off of the spirit of the enemy and of the old man. The spirit of
peace and love (and that, in spite of evil in others and the wrongs they
may do us) completes the picture, adding that which will be easily
understood after what has been said, that, in "forgiving one another,"
we are to be imitators of God, and to walk in love as Christ has loved
us, and has given Himself for us. Beautiful picture, precious privilege!
May God grant us so to look at Jesus as to have His image stamped upon
us, and in some sort to walk like Him.

Note \#17

To recapitulate, there is, first, one body and one Spirit, one hope of
our calling; second, one Lord, with whom are connected one faith and one
baptism; third, one God and Father of all, who is above all things,
everywhere, and in all Christians. Moreover, while insisting upon these
three great relationships in which all Christians are placed, as being
in their nature the foundations of unity, and the motives of its
maintenance, these relationships extend successively in breadth. The
direct relationship applies properly to the same persons; but the
character of Him who is the basis of the relationship enlarges the idea
connected with it. With regard to the Spirit, His presence unites the
body is the bond between all the members of the body: none but the
members of the body and they, as such are seen here. The Lord has wider
claims. In this relationship it is not the members of the body that are
spoken of; there is one faith and one baptism, one profession in the
world: there could not be two. But although the persons who are in this
outward relationship may stand also in the other relationships and be
members of the body, yet the relationship here is one of individual
profession; it is not a thing which cannot exist at all except in
reality (one is a member of Christ's body, or one is not). God is the
Father of these same members, as being His children, but He who
maintains this relationship is necessarily and always above all things
personally above all things, but divinely everywhere.

Note \#18

The descent into the lower parts of the earth is viewed as from His
place as man on earth; not His coming down from heaven to be a man. It
is Christ who descended.

Note \#19

Verse 11 ([Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md) gives special and
permanent gifts; Verse 16 ([Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016).md),
what every joint supplies in its place. Both have their place in the
forming and growth of the body.

Note \#20

I have already noticed, that contrast of the new state and the old
characterises the Ephesians more than Colossians, where we find more
development of life.

Note \#21

In Colossians we have "renewed in knowledge after the image of him that
created us."

Note \#22

There is a sense in which God is, morally, the measure of other beings a
consideration that brings out the immense privilege of the child of God.
It is the effect of grace, in that, being born of Him and partaking of
His nature, the child of God is called to be the imitator of God, to be
perfect as His Father is perfect. He who loves is born of God, and knows
God, for God is love. He makes us partakers of His holiness,
consequently we are called to be imitators of God, as His dear children.
This shews the immense privileges of grace. It is the love of God in the
midst of evil, and which, superior to all evil, walks in holiness, and
rejoices also together, in a divine way, in the unity of the same joys
and the same sentiments. Therefore Christ says (John 17), "as we are,"
and "in us."

Note \#23

It is useful to note here the difference of [Rom
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md), and this epistle. The Romans,
we have seen, contemplates a living man on earth; hence he is to give
his body up as a living sacrifice alive in Christ, he is to yield his
members up wholly to God. Here the saints are seen as sitting in
heavenly places already, and they are to come out in testimony of God's
character before men, walking as Christ did in love, and light.
