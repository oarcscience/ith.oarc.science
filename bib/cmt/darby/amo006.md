### [Amos Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md)

Chapter 6 dwells upon the false confidence that deceived the heads of
Israel. A similar judgment to that of Calneh and Hamath might fall upon
Israel. Their chief men gave themselves up to luxury, as though all were
prosperity. They had no sense of the affliction of Joseph. They should
be the first to go into captivity. Jehovah would give up Israel to
desolation. He would abhor the excellency of Jacob. For they trusted in
that which was but vanity-in their golden calf. But He whom they
despised would raise up an enemy that should afflict them from Hamath to
the borders of Egypt.
