### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 3 and 4.

In the following chapter we enter into the historical part of Elisha's
ministry. Jehoram goes to war; and, although less wicked than his
father, the prophet no longer regards him. Jehoshaphat is still
something to him: but the prophet seeks to abstract himself from the
influence of the whole scene. He then proclaims blessing, and directs
the counsels of the united kings. He is a saviour of Israel. He provides
(chap. 4) for the need of the poor of his people, and delivers them from
their distress. He bestows the heart's desire upon faith, which
recognises and receives the prophet; and restores life to the dead, thus
binding up the broken heart. He feeds the sons of the prophets during
the famine, and multiplies the scant measure of bread. Death having been
mingled with the food, he remedies the evil so that they eat with
impunity.
