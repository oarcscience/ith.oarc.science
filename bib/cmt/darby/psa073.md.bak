### [Psalms Chapter 73](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

BOOK 3 - Psalms 73-89

In the Third Book we get out into a larger sphere than the state of the
residue of the Jews in the last days, whether in Jerusalem or driven
out; and hence we find much less of the personal circumstances and
feelings and associations of the Lord who, in His day, walked among
them. The general interests of Israel are in view, and thus Israel's
history is entered into. The whole national position is before us, still
distinguishing a true-hearted residue. Remark here that, save one, we
have no psalms of David in this book. Asaph, sons of Korah, Ethan, are
the professed authors; I know of no reason to reject the alleged
authorship. It is still the state of Israel in the last days: only that
the general facts are spoken of in reference to the whole nation, not
the particular details of the Jewish remnant, and of Christ as taking a
place among them. It is much more Israel and general principles; there
is more reference to their past history and God's dealings with them.

This the first psalm of it shows. Truly God is good to Israel, to such
as are of a true heart: but the saint was perplexed at the prosperity of
the wicked, and his feet almost gone. The prosperous ungodly are then
described; the body of the people join them, and the Most High is
scorned; whereas the godly is continually chastened, he had cleansed his
hands then in vain. But in speaking thus he would offend against the
generation of God's children. Man pondering on it, it was too painful.
In the sanctuary of God, where His mind was revealed, all became plain.
As a dream when one awakes, so all their pretensions would disappear
when once God awoke. The godly man complains of his want of divine sense
in these thoughts and feelings. Still, after all he was ever before God,
and God's right hand upheld him; guided by His counsel in that time of
darkness, when the glory shall have been revealed, he will be received
(read "after the glory, thou wilt receive me": compare [Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008).md). The result is blessed. He has.
none in heaven but the Lord, none on earth whom he desires beside Him:
such is the effect of trial. But his flesh and heart fail: that is
nature. It must be so, but God is the strength of his heart and his
portion for ever. The last two Verses declare the result those far from
Jehovah, and apostates, perish; but it is good for the godly to draw
near to God. He has put his trust in Him when He did not show Himself,
that he might declare all His works when deliverance came; for those
blessed without trial afterwards will not learn this knowledge of God.
