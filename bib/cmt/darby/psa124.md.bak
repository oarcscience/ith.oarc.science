### [Psalms Chapter 124](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001.md)

The power of the enemy had been just now (Psalm 124) fully displayed
against them the godly in the land who trusted in Jehovah. But they had
escaped, but only by Jehovah being on their side, or they had been
utterly swallowed up, by the last power of the enemy, I apprehend, when
the apostate beast and Antichrist were gone from the scene.
