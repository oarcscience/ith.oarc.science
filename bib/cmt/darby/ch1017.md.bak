### [1 Chronicles Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#001.md)

But although David was to connect kingly power in Zion with the ark of
the covenant, and thus to secure blessing by the power of the king whom
God had chosen, yet the warrior king was not to build the Lord's house.
The energy which was victorious over the enemies of God and of His
people was not yet the peaceful and glorious power which would bring the
people into the enjoyment of all God's blessing, when the enemy should
be no more and all should yield implicit obedience to the throne of God
upon the earth. Like Abraham, David was to be in his own person the
depositary of the promises; but he was not himself to enjoy the result
of the promises on the earth. When the people had been redeemed, their
first spiritual desire was to build a habitation in which God should
dwell among them ([Exo 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002).md) \[See
Note \#1\], and this desire was according to the mind of God ([Exo
29:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#044).md). But if God had accompanied
His people in their wanderings; if He had borne with their
unfaithfulness, when He had entrusted to them His glory in the earth,
which He had promised them; and if the song, "His mercy endureth for
ever," echoed around His altar in the midst of the ruin; if, for the
deliverance of His people, He had set up a king after His own heart, and
placed the ark (rescued from the enemy) upon Mount Zion, the place which
He had chosen for His rest; nevertheless it was still true that there
remained a rest for the people of God. The victory which obtained it was
not this rest, neither was the grace which bestowed the victory this
rest. When God should give His people full and entire rest, then the
house in which He would dwell among them should be built; for God comes
into the midst of His people according to their condition and their need
\[See Note \#2\].

But the holy desire to build it for the glory of God becomes the
occasion of revealing to David all the counsels of God with respect to
himself. Grace had chosen him when in a low estate, and had set him up
to rule the people of God, who had Himself been with David wherever he
went, who had cut off David's enemies, and who had exalted him. And this
was not all. He had ordained a rest for His people, which should no more
be disturbed, as it had been aforetime and during all the days of the
judges. Moreover God would subdue all his enemies, and would build him a
house. It should no longer be saviours occasionally raised up to deliver
a people from the miseries into which their unfaithfulness had plunged
them; but the counsels of God on their behalf should be accomplished,
and blessing established for evermore in the house and family of the
king. The son of David should sit upon his throne; he should be a son
unto Jehovah, and Jehovah should be his Father, and Jehovah's mercy
should not be taken away from him. He should also be settled in the
house, and in the kingdom of Jehovah for ever, and his throne should be
established for evermore.

It will be remarked here, that all question of the responsibility of
David's seed \[See Note \#3\] is left out, and that the whole refers to
the fulfilment of God's purposes in Christ, the true Son of David
according to the promise. God takes the matter in hand. While His people
are still deprived of rest, He is pleased to go with them from tent to
tent, and desires not that they should build Him a house. At length He
will Himself raise up the One who shall build up a house, and under
whose reign the people, established in power for ever, shall enjoy the
rest which God Himself shall have procured them. David, with overflowing
heart, makes answer to Jehovah \[See Note \#4\], who, for His servant's
sake, and according to His own heart, had done all these great things,
and had revealed them to make His servant know them. Whilst
acknowledging Israel's glorious privilege, in being the people of such a
God-the only true God, he prays that the God of Israel will in fact be a
God to Israel, and that He will fulfil all that He had spoken to him
concerning his posterity.

Note \#1

This translation here is more than doubtful, but [Exo
29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046.md) is quite clear as to the purpose
of God.

Note \#2

When Israel was a slave, God became his Redeemer; when he dwelt in
tents, God abode in one also; when in conflict, God presented Himself as
Captain of Jehovah's host; when settled in peace, God establishes
Himself in the house of His glory. The interval was the probation of His
people on earth. God abode in the tent, and even His ark is taken. He
interposes in grace for deliverance. Christ also, since we were born of
woman, is born of a woman; since His people were under the law, He is
born under the law; now that He will have a heavenly people, He is on
high for us; when He comes in glory, we shall come with Him, and reign
when He reigns, but in these last we are with Him.

Note \#3

The latter part of Verse 14 in 2 Samuel 7 ([Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014).md) is omitted.

Note \#4

It is beautiful to see, in this affecting prayer, how David's heart is
full of that which God is in this matter. "There is none like thee";
and, if he speaks of the blessing upon His people, Israel is not that
which the people are, but "the only nation in the earth whom God went to
redeem to himself, that they might be his own people, to make himself a
name of greatness and terribleness." "Let thy name be magnified for
ever." This is the proper effect of faith.
