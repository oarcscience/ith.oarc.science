### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 11 and 12.

In chapter 11, the judgment of God falls upon the family \[See Note
\#1\] which had corrupted Israel, and even Judah also. The daughter of
the house of Ahab, the usurper of the throne of Judah, Athaliah, is cut
off through the faithfulness of the high priest, whose wife had
preserved one of the offspring of David.

Nevertheless there is not true zeal for Jehovah. The priests keep the
money to themselves, which they had agreed to use for repairing the
house of the Lord, until the king interposes to set things in order.

Note \#1

During the time that Ahab, stirred up by Jezebel, as well as his family
and sons are the instruments of Israel's apostasy and corruption God
sends the testimony of Elijah and Elisha. This is, in the main (after
Solomon), the subject of the two Books of Kings. The fall of the house
of David, brought on by its alliance with Israel, or by the example of
their kings, is related in the end of the book, where we find also the
connections of the Assyrians with the people of God.
