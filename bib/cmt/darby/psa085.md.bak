### [Psalms Chapter 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md)

I have long hesitated, in reading Psalm 85, whether the first part
referred to external deliverance and the grace shown in it, and the
following to the causing the people to enter into the enjoyment of it by
the restoration of their own souls; or, as we have seen is often the
case, the statement of the great result as the theme of the psalm, and
then going through the sorrows of the remnant and divine workings which
led to this result. There will be a restoring work in the souls of the
people after their outward deliverance. Nor do I now speak of this psalm
with very great certainty on this point. On the whole, I am disposed to
think that they look for their enjoyment of divine favor in it, as
between themselves and God, when delivered from all their enemies, and
shown to be forgiven by that deliverance. Thus the first three Verses
lay this ground ([Psa 85:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001).md), that
God has been favorable to His land, and brought back the captivity of
Jacob. This was the great public truth. But in Verse 4 ([Psa
85:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#004).md) the restored people have need of
other blessing in the reality of their own relationship with God. "Turn
us, O God of our salvation." Jehovah was the God of their salvation; but
they needed His blessing in the midst of the land. They would that His
people should rejoice in Him. How true this is often of the soul which
knows forgiveness! It looks for Jehovah's mercy and salvation, being
thus restored to Him, and listens to know what Elohim Jehovah will
speak; for they reckon on mercy. He will speak peace to His people their
public character and to His saints the remnant who are to enjoy it.
Faith has then the certainty in every way that His salvation is nigh
them that fear Him, that the glory of Jehovah may dwell in the land. The
last Verses celebrate, in remarkable terms, the divine principles on
which their blessings are then established. God's mercy and truth had
now met. His promises, always true, had now been fulfilled by mercy. It
is to be remarked that in the psalms mercy always precedes righteousness
and truth. For Israel had forfeited all title to promise in rejecting
the Lord had come under full guilt had no righteousness on which to lean
had been concluded in unbelief, that they also might be objects of mere
mercy. But then through Christ's work these promises would now be
fulfilled, and mercy and truth met. But more than this. Jehovah was
their righteousness, through grace; and hence that righteousness was
peace for them; and that which in judgment would have been their ruin,
was in grace their peace righteousness and peace kissed each other. I
need hardly say how true these great principles are for any sinner for
yet better and heavenly blessings; here they are applied to earthly
ones. Truth shall spring out of the earth (that is, the full fruit and
effect of God's truth and faithfulness shall be manifest in blessings,
full blessings, on the earth). But it was not by a righteousness that
man had wrought legally here below. Righteousness looked down from
heaven. It was God's righteousness, Jehovah their righteousness. But
this made it stable. Jehovah gives that which is good, and the land is
blessed. Righteousness traces the path of blessing for Jehovah and
Himself in the land His own no doubt. Still His rule shall be so
characterized. A king shall reign in righteousness"no more oppression.
Justice is no longer fallen in the streets, as [Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014.md) speaks; judgment is returned to
it, and the government has this character. "And the fruit of
righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness
and assurance for ever." This last, indeed, is practical; but it is the
result of righteousness having looked down from heaven, yea, of its
being established on the earth (compare [Psa
72:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001.md), where this state is
described).
