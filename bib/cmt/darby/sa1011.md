### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#001)

As yet all goes well with Saul; he does not take vengeance on those who
oppose him. Before his faith is tried, his natural character would gain
him favour with men. And now, in those things which have given rise to
the carnal movement that led the people to desire a king, all apparently
prospers to their wish. The Ammonites are so thoroughly defeated, that
two of them are not left together. Here also Saul acts with prudence and
generosity. He does not allow the people's desire for vengeance to be
carried out. He owns the Lord in the blessing granted to the people. In
truth God was with them, granting to the flesh all the means and helps
necessary for walking with Him, had the thing been possible. Samuel is
there on God's part, and supports by his authority the king whom God has
set up. At Samuel's invitation the people assemble at Gilgal (a place
memorable for the blessing of the people and their association with
Jehovah, the flesh being judged, on entering the land), to renew the
kingdom there, and again to recognise a throne whose authority had just
been confirmed by successful efforts for the deliverance of God's
people. Peace-offerings and great rejoicing make the ceremony more
imposing.
