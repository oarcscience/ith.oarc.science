### [Psalms Chapter 89](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001.md)

Psalm 89. We have seen that Psalm 88 puts Israel in the presence of
Jehovah (when guilty of having been unfaithful to Him), under the
judgment of Jehovah, with the sense of wrath, yet in faith in Jehovah
Himself a place Christ most especially took, though of course for
others, in particular for Israel, but not for that nation only. Psalm 89
takes the other side of Jehovah's relationship with Israel; not the
nation's, Israel's, which was under law, but Jehovah's promises to
David. It is not, remark here, guilt which is brought forward surely in
both cases it was the ground of the state spoken of but wrath, instead
of salvation. For Jehovah had been Israel's Savior, and so faith viewed
Him still; yet instead of the fulfillment of promise, as made to David,
there was desertion of him. There is no trace of confession of sin.
Psalm 88 is complaint of death and wrath; and this (89), when mercy was
to be built up for ever, shows the covenant made void and the crown
profaned. Isaiah (40-58) pleads against Israel to convict them of guilt:
first, against Jehovah, by having idols; secondly, by rejecting Christ
(40-48, 49-58). But here the plaint is Israel's against Jehovah Himself,
not unholily, I apprehend, as blame, but as an appeal to Himself on the
ground of what He had been for Israel. Jehovah is establishing these
relationships here, as indeed we have seen. Israel is Israel, and in the
land (Psalm 85). The heathen are there all is not restored; the last
confederacy is in view, but it is against Israel. God is standing in the
congregation of the mighty, judging among the gods (Psalm 82). Jehovah
has been Himself recalling His former mercies ([Psa
81:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010).md). The ark is remembered, and
God as the dweller between the cherubim, as once in the wilderness
(Psalm 80). In a word, the whole book is the condition of a restored
people in the land, but attacked, destroyed; the temple which exists
again ruined and broken down (Psalms 74-76, 79). Not a mere Jewish
remnant complaining of antichristian wickedness within, with which they
were associated externally, or which had cast them out; but Israel the
nation (represented by the remnant) with enemies who destroy what is
dear to them, with encouraging prophecies of the result, having
instruction as to sovereign grace in David when they had failed in their
own faithfulness as a nation (Psalms 78, 79), which looks to God
(Elohim) as such in contrast with man to the Most High, but returns to
Jehovah (as His own out of Egypt) with prayer, and demand that His hand
might be on the Son of man, the branch \[See Note \#1\] made so strong
for Himself (Psalm 80). The whole book, in a word, is Israel taking the
ground of being a people, and actually in the land, and with a temple,
entering into the relationship by faith, but subject to the destructive
inroads of hostile power sthe Assyrian and allies, to whom indeed,
because of success, the people return ([Psa
73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md); for [Isa
10:5-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md) is not yet fulfilled. Compare
Isaiah 18, particularly [Isa 18:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005).md).

Now these two last psalms of the book present the whole pressure of this
state of things on the spirit of the faithful. Instead of a blessed
people, it is loneliness under wrath. Yet Jehovah is the God of their
salvation. The throne cast down and profaned, though immutable promises
in mercy, not to be set aside by faults, had been given to David. The
result is in the next book, in the manifestation of Jehovah, the
bringing in the Only-begotten into the world. In all this book we are on
prophetic ground with Israel; not the special condition in which the
Jewish remnant will be with Antichrist, because they rejected Christ
their sorrows therefore coming much more fully out when that condition
is treated of. This, we have seen, is in the first and second books.
Hence, in the following books we get to the recognition of Jehovah
having been their dwelling-place in all generations. It is their history
which ends by the appearing of Jehovah-Messiah in glory.

A few words now on Psalm 89 in detail. Its subject is the mercies of
Jehovah (His "graciousness", chasdee, towards Israel), and their
unchangeablenessthe sure mercies. There was faith to say, "for ever,"
for it was grace. This gave the appeal, elsewhere noticed. How long
should it be otherwise, and even apparently for ever? Jehovah was
faithful. For he had said in faith, Mercy, manifested goodness, shall be
built up for ever, and faithfulness was established where nothing could
reach it. And so it will be, Satan being cast down. It is the very
description of the millennium. He then recites the covenant originally
made with David, which is the expression of mercy, and that to which
Jehovah was to be faithful, the sure mercies of David. He turns then,
and continues his praises of Jehovah ([Psa
89:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005).md), recalling the ancient
deliverance from Egypt, and looking to the praise necessarily flowing
from what He was, and the blessedness of the people that know the joyful
sound. In His name they would rejoice all the day, in His (for we are in
grace here) righteousness be exalted. He was the glory of their
strength; and in His favor their horn will be exalted.

Such was the blessedness of association with Jehovah in favor. But this
blessing was in the faithful mercy to David. And where was this? ([Psa
89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018)). Jehovah, the Holy One (kodesh.md)
of Israel, is their King. But, then, He had spoken of, not a kodesh, but
a chasid, in whom all the chasdee (the same word in the plural as
chesed, "mercy"), all the mercies, were to be concentrated, and to whom
the unchangeable faithfulness was to be shown the sure mercies of David.
Read "of thy holy One" (chasid) in Verse 19 ([Psa
89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019).md). Here he returns to the
covenant made with David, showing it never to be altered ([Psa
89:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034).md). But all was different. But
there was faith, founded on this promise, to say, How long, Jehovah? If
He hides for ever, and His wrath burns like fire, what is man to abide
it, and not go down into death? ([Psa
89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048).md).

The former loving-kindness to David is appealed to, as in the person of
David himself, but, I doubt not from Verse 50 ([Psa
89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050).md), applicable to all the
faithful. Still, the Spirit of Christ falls in here, as He did with the
wrath, to take the whole reality of the burden. He of course in that day
will suffer nothing. But He has anticipated that day of suffering, that
His Spirit might speak as with His voice in His people; for the reproach
of the mighty ones and apostates in that day will reproach the footsteps
of God's anointed. And if the faithful walk in them, they will share the
reproach from the enemies of Jehovah. Such is their then position
walking in His footsteps, looking for Israelitish covenant blessings,
feeling wrath, yet in faith, but looking to God's promise in mercy to
David (which was already pure grace, for the ark of the covenant was
gone, and Israel Ichabod), and yet waiting for the answer. This is in
the following book. We are here, as I have said, in prophetic times, in
Isaiah's scenes with the Assyrian and a devastated temple. The wicked
are there: people flock with them in prosperity. If we are in Daniel, it
is chapter 8, not 7. The beast and the Antichrist are not on the scene,
but the land, guilty Israel, promises not the question of a rejected
Christ. This psalm closes the third Book.

Compare the connection and remarkable contrast with John 15.
