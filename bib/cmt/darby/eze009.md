### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

The glory of Jehovah visits the temple. He takes His place on the side
that looked towards the city, and, after having shewn the prophet the
heinous sins committed there, He gives command to execute the deserved
vengeance, but to spare the remnant who mourned over all these
abominations. That which declares morally the state of heart of the
wicked, and which made them give the loose rein to their iniquity, is
that the absence of Jehovah's intervention on account of their sins, had
so acted on their belief as to make them say, "Jehovah hath forsaken the
earth and Jehovah seeth not." This was obduracy of heart.
