### [2 Chronicles Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#001.md)

God fully answered the king's faith; but the iniquity of the people's
heart was little changed, and the ways of God in judgment began to be
manifested; and in such a manner as to make it evident that, in the
midst of His judgments, and at the height of the enemy's power, the
faithful seed of David should be the infallible resource of His people.
This is the lesson of chapter 32. This man is the peace of the people
when the Assyrian enters the land. See, in Isaiah 8, the Assyrian's
entrance into the land already called the land of Immanuel through the
prophetic revelation of the birth of the virgin's Sona revelation
addressed to the unfaithful king, to Ahaz; see also, in the same
chapter, the revelation of the terrible distress of the people, the law
being sealed and entrusted to the remnant who would follow Christ as a
prophet, until the people confess that a Son was born unto them. See
also, in chapter 22 of the same prophet, the Spirit's judgment as to the
moral condition of the people, on the occasion of those events which are
recorded in 2 Chronicles 32. Hezekiah himself did not render again to
Jehovah according to the benefit done unto him; but his heart was lifted
up. Nevertheless, as he humbled himself, he was allowed to see the peace
of Jerusalem all the days of his life.
