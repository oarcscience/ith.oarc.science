### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001)

Psalm 132 is, in some respects, a very interesting psalm. It is the
restoration of the ark of the covenant to its resting-place, and the
promises of Jehovah, in answer to the supplication of His servant. It is
founded on David's bringing the ark up to Zion. This, as we have seen in
the historical books, has a very important place. It was grace acting by
power when Israel had so completely failed that the bond of the people
with God, so far as it was founded on the people's responsibility, was
wholly broken, and the ark gone into captivity, and Ichabod written on
all. \[See Note \#1\] But now, in a fuller and more lasting sense, a
habitation was found for the mighty God of Jacob, where the godly would
worship low before His footstool. The fruit of David's body, the Messiah
of Jehovah, was to sit on His throne, and that for evermore. Jehovah was
entering into His rest He and the ark of His strength. Before ([Num
10:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035)), if He arose it was to
scatter His enemies, and then He returned to the many thousands of
Israel. But now, and this is what characterizes the psalm, the enemies
were scattered, and Jehovah arose to take His rest in Israel. The
sovereign election of God is seen, Verse 13 ([Psa
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013)); and, then, it will be
remarked, that the promise, in answer to the supplication, goes each
time beyond the request (compare Verses ([Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014); ([Psa
132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015); ([Psa
132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008); ([Psa
132:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#016); ([Psa
132:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#009); ([Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017); ([Psa
132:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#018); ([Psa
132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010)). This is of the highest
interest as showing the grace of the Lord, and how His love surpasses
all the hopes of His people, His interest in them.

Note \#1

The three principles of government had been brought out in Israel.
First, direct responsibility to God under priesthood. That had failed
under Eli, and that was Ichabod. It was over with Israel on the ground
of their own responsibility. Then God intervened by a prophet. That He
could still do; it was a sovereign act. But that failed; so did royalty
as set up by the people. Then we have royalty as power in grace, as it
will be in Christ, and the lost ark brought back. This is what we have
in this psalm.
