### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

Chapter 37 reveals the definitive blessing of the people as a fact,
without entering into any details of the events that terminate in this
blessing. The dry bones of Israel, of the nation as a whole, are
gathered together by the power of God. God accomplishes this work by His
Spirit, but by His Spirit acting in power on His people to produce
certain effects rather than in giving spiritual life (although it is not
to be doubted that those who are blessed among the Jews will be
spiritually quickened). The result of this intervention of God is that
the dispersed of Israel, hitherto divided into two peoples, are gathered
together in the earth, reunited under one Head, as one nation. It is the
resurrection of the nation, which was really dead and buried. But God
opens their graves, and places them again in their land restored to life
as a nation. The fact of their division before this operation of God is
recognised. But the result of the operation is Israel in their unity as
a people. One king should reign over them. This, under God's hand, is
the result of all their iniquity, and of the devices of the enemies who
had carried them into captivity. David (that is, Christ) should be their
king. They should be thoroughly cleansed by God Himself. They should
walk in His statutes and His judgments, and dwell for ever in their
land. The sanctuary of God should be in their midst for evermore; His
tabernacle, His dwelling-place, should be among them, He their God and
they His people. The heathen should know that Jehovah sanctified Israel,
when His sanctuary should be there for ever. It is the full national
blessing of Israel from the Lord Jehovah.
