### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 22 and 23.

Observe what grace raised up Hezekiah and Josiah, both of whom were born
of fathers given up to idolatry, and followed by sons who were equally
abandoned to it. But the sovereign grace of God towards Israel again
raised up this testimony, and manifested that He was always ready to
bless, even if Israel refused to be blessed, and chose their own ruin
instead. Without God, what is the heart of man? In all this the patience
of God's government was fully demonstrated; for, under Hezekiah, many
things still existed which escaped the king's eye and judgment, through
lack of watchfulness in the fear of the Lord.

That which distinguished Josiah was his carefulness to observe the law
of Moses, the book of which had been discovered in the temple; trust in
Jehovah had characterised Hezekiah; and in these respective
characteristics they are both unequalled as to their walk.

The kingdom of Assyria was declining, and Josiah exercises his royal
power through the whole extent of the country. The threat addressed to
Jeroboam of old is fulfilled. All the high places of Israel are
destroyed. Perhaps the heart of Josiah was lifted up. Be that as it may,
God performed His promise, and took him away from the evil, the dreadful
accomplishment of which was hastening onwards; for, whatever might be
the sincerity of Josiah's piety, all hearts were corrupted. Compare with
this [Ch2 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017.md), etc.-the account of
that which happened long before his reign.
