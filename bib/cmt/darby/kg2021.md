### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001.md)

When Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four, his son was but twelve
years old. Beguiled himself, Manasseh seduced the people, who were but
too willing to commit greater iniquity than the nations who knew not
God. The particular events of Manasseh's life are not related here. The
Holy Ghost, having given us the details, in that which precedes, of
God's public government in Israel, until He had said, "Lo-ruhamah," then
shews us God's dealings with Judah, governed by the conduct of their
kings, until God has said, "Lo-ammi." This had been already announced on
account of Manasseh's heinous sins; and Josiah's piety could not change
the just judgment of God. There was yet for Judah some prolongation of
tranquillity; but their repentance under Josiah was but outward \[See
Note \#1\], and evil regained the mastery immediately after his death.
Amon did but follow the evil ways of his father Manasseh.

Note \#1

See [Jer 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010.md). This passage teaches us
how seldom the heart, which is what God judges, corresponds with the
semblance of zeal for Him and for His glory, which appears on the
surface, when, moved by the Spirit of God, a man of faith presents
himself to promote His glory. See also under Hezekiah's reign the
condition of the people and God's judgment-Isaiah 22.
