### [Ezra Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr008.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 7 and 8.

Alas! this was not the end of the history. God, in His goodness, must
still watch over the unfaithfulness and the failures of His people, even
when they are but a small remnant who by His grace have escaped from the
ruin. He puts it into the heart of Ezra, a ready scribe in the law of
Moses, to think of the remnant in Jerusalem, to seek the law of Jehovah,
to teach it and cause it to be observed. Here again it is still the
Gentile king who sends him for this purpose to Jerusalem. All blessing
is of God, but nothing (except prophecy, in which God was sovereign, as
we have already seen in the case of Samuel at the time of the people's
downfall), nothing in point of authority comes immediately from God. He
could not pass by unrecognised the throne which He had Himself
established among the Gentiles upon the earth. And Israel was an earthly
people.

The character of this intervention of God by Ezra's mission is, I think,
a touching proof of His loving-kindness. It was exactly suited to the
wants of the people. It was not power. That had been removed to another
place. It was the knowledge of the will and the ordinances of God,-of
the mind of God in the word. The king himself recognised this ([Ezr
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#025).md). Guarded by the good hand of his
God, this pious and devoted man goes up with many others to Jerusalem.
