### [Nehemiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 9, 10, and 11.

On the twenty-fourth day, the people came together to humble themselves
in a manner that became their position, and they separated themselves
from all strangers. Beginning with the blessing promised to Abraham,
they relate all the tokens of God's grace bestowed upon Israel, the
frequent unfaithfulness of which they had afterwards been guilty, and
there is a true expression of heartfelt repentance; they acknowledge
without any disguise their condition ([Neh
9:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#036).md), and undertake to obey the
law (chap. 10), to separate themselves entirely from the people of the
land, and faithfully to perform all that the service of the house of God
required.

All this gives a very distinct character to their position.
Acknowledging the promise made to Abraham, and the bringing in of the
people to Canaan by virtue of this promise, and their subsequent
failure, they place themselves again under the obligations of the law,
while confessing the goodness of God who had spared them. They do not
see beyond a conditional and Mosaic restoration. Neither the Messiah nor
the new covenant has any place as the foundation of their joy or of
their hope. They are, and they continue to be, in bondage to the
Gentiles. This was Israel's condition until, in the sovereign mercy of
God, the Messiah was presented to them. The Messiah could have brought
them out of their position and gathered them under His wings, but they
would not. It is this position that the Book of Nehemiah definitely
brought out. It is the king's commandment that provides for the
maintenance of the singers. A Jew was at the king's hand in all matters
concerning the people ([Neh 11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#023).md).
