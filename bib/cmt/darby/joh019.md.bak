### [John Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001.md)

Pilate (chapter 19) gives way to his usual inhumanity. In the account,
however, given in this Gospel, the Jews are prominent, as the real
authors (as far as man was concerned) of the Lord's death. Jealous for
their ceremonial purity, but indifferent to justice, they are not
content to judge Him according to their own law; \[See Note \#66\] they
choose to have Him put to death by the Romans, for the whole counsel of
God must needs be accomplished.

It is on the repeated demands of the Jews that Pilate delivers Jesus
into their hands thoroughly guilty in so doing, for he had openly avowed
His innocence, and had had his conscience decidedly touched and alarmed
by the evident proofs there were that he had some extraordinary person
before him. He will not shew that he is touched, but he is so ([Joh
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#008).md). The divine glory that pierced
through the humiliation of Christ acts upon him, and gives force to the
declaration of the Jews that Jesus had made Himself the Son of God.
Pilate had scourged Him and given Him up to the insults of the soldiers;
and here he would have stopped. Perhaps he hoped also that the Jews
would be satisfied with this, and he presents Jesus to them crowned with
thorns. Perhaps he hoped that their jealousy with regard to these
national insults would induce them to ask for His deliverance. But,
ruthlessly pursuing their malicious purpose, they cry out, "Crucify him,
crucify him!" Pilate objects to this for himself, while giving them
liberty to do it, saying that he finds no fault in Him. Upon this they
plead their Jewish law. They had a law of their own, say they, and by
this law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.
Pilate, already struck and exercised in mind, is the more alarmed; and,
going back to the judgment hall again, questions Jesus. He makes no
reply. The pride of Pilate awakes, and he asks if Jesus does not know
that he has power to condemn or to release Him. The Lord maintains, in
replying, the full dignity of His Person. Pilate had no power over Him,
were it not the will of God to this He submitted. It heightened the sin
of those who had delivered Him up, to suppose that man could do anything
against Him, were it not that the will of God was thus to be
accomplished. The knowledge of His Person formed the measure of the sin
committed against Him. The not perceiving it caused everything to be
falsely judged, and, in the case of Judas, shewed the most absolute
moral blindness. He knew His Master's power. What was the meaning of
delivering Him up to man, if it were not that His hour was come? But,
this being the case, what was the betrayer's position?

But Jesus always speaks according to the glory of His Person, and as
being thereby entirely above the circumstances through which He was
passing in grace, and in obedience to His Father's will. Pilate is
thoroughly disturbed by the Lord's reply, yet his feeling is not strong
enough to counteract the motive with which the Jews press him, but it
has sufficient power to make him throw back upon the Jews all that there
was of will in His condemnation, and to make them fully guilty of the
Lord's rejection.

Pilate sought to withdraw Him from their fury. At last, fearing to be
accused of infidelity to Caesar, he turns with contempt to the Jews,
saying, "Behold your King"; acting although unconsciously under the hand
of God, to bring out that memorable word from their lips, their
condemnation, and their calamity even to this day, "We have no king but
Caesar." They denied their Messiah. The fatal word, which called down
the judgment of God, was now pronounced; and Pilate delivers up Jesus to
them.

Jesus, humbled and bearing His cross, takes His place with the
transgressors. Nevertheless He who would that all should be fulfilled
ordained that a testimony should be rendered to His dignity; and Pilate
(perhaps to vex the Jews, certainly to accomplish the purposes of God)
affixes to the cross as the Lord's title, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King
of the Jews": the twofold truth the despised Nazarene is the true
Messiah. Here, then, as throughout this Gospel, the Jews take their
place as cast off by God.

At the same time the apostle shews here, as elsewhere that Jesus was the
true Messiah, by quoting the prophecies which speak of that which
happened to Him in general, with regard to His rejection and His
sufferings, so that He is proved to be the Messiah by the very
circumstances in which He was rejected of the people.

After the history of His crucifixion, as the act of man, we have that
which characterises it in respect to what Jesus was upon the cross. The
blood and water flow from His pierced side.

The devotedness of the women who followed Him, less important perhaps on
the side of action, shines out in its own way nevertheless in that
perseverance of love which brought them nigh to the cross. The more
responsible position of the apostles as men scarcely allowed it to them,
circumstanced as they were; but this takes nothing from the privilege
which grace attaches to woman when faithful to Jesus. But it was the
occasion for Christ to give us fresh instruction, by shewing Himself
such as He was, and by setting His work before us, above all mere
circumstances, as the effect and the expression of a spiritual energy
which consecrated Him, as man, entirely to God, offering Himself also to
God by the eternal Spirit. His work was done. He had offered Himself up.
He returns, so to speak, into His personal relationships. Nature, in His
human feelings, is seen in its perfection; and, at the same time, His
divine superiority, personally, to the circumstances through which He
passed in grace as the obedient man. The expression of His filial
feelings shews, that the consecration to God, which removed Him from all
those affections that are alike the necessity and the duty of the man
according to nature, was not the want of human feeling, but the power of
the Spirit of God. Seeing the women, He speaks to them no longer as
Teacher and Saviour, the resurrection and the life; it is Jesus, a man,
individually, in His human relationship.

"Woman," He says, "behold thy son!" committing His mother to the care of
John, the disciple whom Jesus loved and to the disciple, "Behold thy
mother!" and thenceforth that disciple took her to his own home. Sweet
and precious commission! A confidence which spoke that which he who was
thus loved could alone appreciate, as being its immediate object. This
shews us also that His love for John had a character of human affection
and attachment, according to God, but not essentially divine, although
full of divine grace a grace which gave it all its value, but which
clothed itself with the reality of the human heart. It was this,
evidently, which bound Peter and John together. Jesus was their only and
common object. Of very different characters and so much the more united
on that account they thought but of one thing. Absolute consecration to
Jesus is the strongest bond between human hearts. It strips them of
self, and they have but one soul in thought, intent, and settled
purpose, because they have only one object. But in Jesus this was
perfect, and it was grace. It is not said, "the disciple who loved
Jesus"; that would have been quite out of season. It would have been to
take Jesus entirely out of His place, and His dignity, His personal
glory, and to destroy the value of His love to John. Nevertheless John
loved Christ, and consequently appreciated thus his Master's love; and,
his heart attached to Him by grace, he devoted himself to the execution
of this sweet commission, which he takes pleasure in relating here. It
is indeed love that tells it, although it does not speak of itself.

I believe that we again see this feeling (used by the Spirit of God, not
evidently as the foundation, but to give its colour to the expression of
that which he had seen and known) in the beginning of John's first
epistle.

We also see here that this Gospel does not shew us Christ under the
weight of His sufferings, but acting in accordance with the glory of His
Person as above all things, and fulfilling all things in grace. In
perfect calmness He provides for His mother; having done this, He knows
that all is finished. He has, according to human language, entire
self-possession.

There is yet one prophecy to be fulfilled. He says, "I thirst," and, as
God had foretold, they give Him vinegar. He knows that now there is not
one detail left of all that was to be accomplished. He bows His head,
and Himself gives \[See Note \#67\] up His spirit. Thus, when the whole
divine work is accomplished the divine man giving up His spirit, that
spirit leaves the body which had been its organ and its vessel. The time
was come for so doing; and by doing it, He secured the accomplishment of
another divine word "Not one of his bones shall be broken." But
everything bore its part in the fulfilment of those words, and the
purposes of Him who had pronounced them beforehand.

A soldier pierces His side with a spear. It is from a dead Saviour that
flow forth the tokens of an eternal and perfect salvation the water and
the blood; the one to cleanse the sinner, the other to expiate his sins.
The evangelist saw it. His love for the Lord makes him like to remember
that he saw Him thus unto the end; he tells it in order that we may
believe. But if we see in the beloved disciples the vessel that the Holy
Ghost uses (and very sweet it is to see it, and according to the will of
God), we see plainly who it is that uses it. How many things John
witnessed which he did not relate! The cry of grief and of abandonment
the earthquake the centurion's confession the history of the thief: all
these things took place before his eyes, which were fixed upon his
Master; yet he does not mention them. He speaks of that which his
Beloved was in the midst of all this. The Holy Ghost causes him to
relate that which belonged to the personal glory of Jesus. His
affections made him find it a sweet and easy task. The Holy Ghost
attached him to it, employing him in that which he was well suited to
perform. Through grace the instrument lent itself readily to the work
for which the Holy Ghost set it apart. His memory and his heart were
under the dominant and exclusive influence of the Spirit of God. That
Spirit employed them in His work. One sympathises with the instrument;
one believes in that which the Holy Ghost relates by his means, for the
words are those of the Holy Ghost.

Nothing can be more touching, more deeply interesting, than divine grace
thus expressing itself in human tenderness and taking its form. While
possessing the entire reality of human affection, it had all the power
and depth of divine grace. It was divine grace that Jesus should have
such affections. On the other hand, nothing could be farther from the
appreciation of this sovereign source of divine love, flowing through
the perfect channel which it made for itself by its own power, than the
pretension to express our love as reciprocal; it would be, on the
contrary, to fail entirely in that appreciation. True saints among the
Moravians have called Jesus "brother," and others have borrowed their
hymns or the expression; the word never says so. "He is not ashamed to
call us brethren," but it is quite another thing for us to call Him so.
The personal dignity of Christ is never lost in the intensity and
tenderness of His love.

But the rejected Saviour was to be with the rich and the honourable in
His death, however despised He may previously have been; and two, who
dared not confess Him while He lived, awakened now by the greatness of
the sin of their nation, and by the event itself of His death which the
grace of God, who had reserved them for this work, made them feel occupy
themselves with the attentions due to His dead body. Joseph, himself a
counsellor, comes to ask Pilate for the body of Jesus, Nicodemus joining
with him to render the last honours to Him whom they had never followed
during His life. We can understand this. To follow Jesus constantly
under reproach, and compromise oneself for ever on His account, is a
very different thing from acting when some great occasion happens in
which there is no longer room for the former, and when the extent of the
evil compels us to separate from it; and when the good, rejected because
it is perfect in testimony, and perfected in its rejection, forced us to
take a part, if through grace any moral sense exists in us. God thus
fulfilled His words of truth. Joseph and Nicodemus place the Lord's body
in a new sepulchre in a garden near the cross; for, on account of it
being the Jews' preparation, they could do no more at that moment.

Note \#66

It is said that their Jewish traditions forbade their putting any one to
death during the great feasts. It is possible that this may have
influenced the Jews; but however that might be, the purposes of God were
thus accomplished. At other times the Jews were not so prompt in
submitting to the Roman exigencies that deprived them of the right of
life and death.

Note \#67

This is the force of the expression; which is quite different from the
word translated expired. We learn from [Luk
23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md) that He did this when He had
said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." But in John, the
Holy Ghost is setting forth even His death as the result of a voluntary
act, giving up His spirit, and not saying to whom He committed (as man
with absolute and perfect faith) His human spirit, His soul, in dying.
It is His divine competency that is here shewn, and not His trust in His
Father. The word is never used in this way but in this passage as to
Christ, in either the New Testament or the LXX.
