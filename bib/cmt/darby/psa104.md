### [Psalms Chapter 104](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md)

Psalm 104, which celebrates Jehovah as Creator requires very few
remarks. It will be noticed that it is occupied almost entirely with the
earth. He is clothed with the glory of the heavens, which is described
in most beautiful language; but the earth is the subject. It is looked
at as existing as the abode of men, as it is, but all depended on
Jehovah's sovereign will. It is not the earth which is celebrated, but
Jehovah, the Creator of it. It is not paradise, but this earth, as we
see it in man's hand. But the psalm looks to sinners being consumed out
of it, and the wicked being no more. This gives the psalm, evidently, a
peculiar character, and connects it with the introduction of the
first-begotten into the world.
