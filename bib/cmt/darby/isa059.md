### [Isaiah Chapter 59](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 58 and 59.

But these moral considerations rouse the indignation of the Spirit at
the condition of Israel in the days of the prophecy-their sin and their
hypocrisy in pretending to serve Jehovah; and in chapters 58, 59 He
denounces their trust in outward forms, and places blessing on condition
of obedience. It was not that the arm of Jehovah was shortened, or His
ear grown heavy; but the iniquity of the people hindered blessing and
would bring judgment upon them. Yet, when all had failed and there was
no one to maintain righteousness, Jehovah Himself would intervene in His
sovereignty and might. He would crush His enemies and judge the isles;
so that His name should be feared throughout the whole earth. The
Redeemer should come to Zion and to those that turn from transgression
in Jacob. Blessing should then be permanent, and the presence of the
Holy Spirit abide with the seed of Jacob for ever.
