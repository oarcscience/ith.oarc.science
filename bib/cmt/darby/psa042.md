### [Psalms Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)

BOOK 2 - Psalms 42-72

In the second book, the remnant is viewed as outside Jerusalem, and the
city as given up to wickedness. This is seen throughout it. The covenant
connection of the Jews with Jehovah is lost, but God is trusted. When
Messiah comes in, all is changed. We have further, more distinctly, the
exaltation of Christ on high as the means of their deliverance, and His
rejection and sorrow when down here. It closes with the millennial reign
of Messiah in peace under the figure of Solomon. The spirit of the godly
man is tested by these circumstances. And, as all hope of finding good
in the people is given up, the soul of the believing remnant is more
entirely looking to God Himself and attached to Him. It is with this
that the book opens.

The godly man had been going with the multitude to the house of God, but
that is all over. He is driven away, and his cry is from Jordanthe land
of the Hermonites, and the hill Mizar. All God's waves are gone over
him. It was terrible to see an enemy in possession of the sanctuary, and
the true one of Jehovah cast out and His name blasphemed. The heathen,
as stated in Joel, had come in in power, and taunted those who had
trusted in Jehovah's faithfulness with the cry, "Where is thy God?"
([Joe 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#017).md). It was, of course, a
dreadful trial (so with Christ upon the cross; and with Him yet more,
for He declared He was forsaken); so that what God was to them by faith
was put to the test. This faith is what this psalm now expresses. The
heart of the godly pants after God. It was not merely for His blessings;
they were gone. The preciousness of what He Himself was, was only so
much the more vividly brought out. The main distress was the cry "Where
is thy God?" But if the saint is not in Jerusalem, God is the confidence
of the saint. Faith says, "I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance." The heart too can appeal to Him ([Psa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009).md), and, under the pressure of the
repeated taunt, hope in God Himself, and He will be the health of the
countenance of him that trusts in Him. The reader will remark that in
Verse 5 ([Psa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005).md) it is the help of
God's countenance: in Verse 11 ([Psa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#011).md) He becomes the health of the
countenance of him that trusts in Him. This making God Himself to become
everything by the deprivation of all blessings, and the exercise of
faith in it casting the soul entirely on God Himself, is very precious.
