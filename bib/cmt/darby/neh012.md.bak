### [Nehemiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 12 and 13.

We have already seen that gladness was the portion of the people; a joy
which acknowledged God, for God had preserved the people and had blessed
them. But the princes of the people had immediately relapsed into
unfaithfulness; and during Nehemiah's absence the chambers of the
temple, in which the offerings had been formerly kept, were given up to
Tobiah, that subtle and persevering enemy of God's people. But at the
dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the joy of the people and the
faithfulness of Nehemiah brought them back to the written word, and
Israel separated themselves again from the mixed multitude. Tobiah's
stuff is cast out of the chamber prepared for him in the temple. The
observance of the Sabbath is again enforced. Those who had married
strange wives, and whose children spake partly the language of strangers
and partly that of the Jews, are put under the curse and sharply rebuked
and chastised. The order and the cleansing, according to the law, are
re-established, and this leading thought of the book, as to the people's
condition, closes the narrative. That which we have said will give an
idea of the great principle of this book. I will add a few more remarks
in this place.
