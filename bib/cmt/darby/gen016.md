### [Genesis Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001)

Abram seeking, at Sarah's instigation, to anticipate the will of God and
the accomplishment of the promise in its time, we have the covenant of
the law in Hagar, the source of distress and disquietude. God, however,
takes care of the seed according to the flesh. The application of this
as a figure is clear from Galatians 4. The pride of man under the law is
marked in Hagar's spirit, yet her son cannot be heir. The haste of man,
who will not wait God's time, will not wait on Him as to means of
accomplishment (so was it with Jacob for the blessing) is full of moral
warning to us; it is ever the source of disquietude and sorrow. Hagar,
too, was an Egyptian a remembrance, also, of the want of faith in Abram.
The law and flesh, and indeed sin, ever go together (see [Joh
8:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034)); and in connection with the
unbelief of nature, that is, Egypt.

As regards the order of these chapters, I may add, 12, 13, 14 go
together, and are dependent on the double manifestation of God to Abram;
first, to call him, and then in Canaan. We have power, failure, return,
and enduring heavenly faith contrasted with worldliness, and thereto the
display of earthly power attached, to that faith, closing with victory;
God possessor of heaven and earth, and Melchisedec.

Though chapter 15 stands alone as a whole, chapter 16 is so far
connected with it, that it is the fleshly attempt on Sarah's part to
have the seed which was assured by the word of the Lord to Abram in the
beginning of chapter 15. Here all is failure; but the purposes of God
will be accomplished according to promise, and not of the flesh and
man's will.
