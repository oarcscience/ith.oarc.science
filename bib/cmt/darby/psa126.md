### [Psalms Chapter 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001)

Psalm 126. The heart of the godly now finds its center in Zion, when
deliverance has been learnt; for so it will be (compare [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004); [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007)). How low she was brought,
according to Psalm 124! ([Isa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004).
Compare [Isa 17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012), and other
passages). It was a dream so full, so unlooked-for, the joy. The very
heathen now owned Jehovah's hand. But the godly look for the full
blessing, and the captivity to be turned again in the fullness of
possessed blessing. Still God had manifested Himself; and to the
faithful, who had taken up His testimony in sorrow, and when it was
shame and reproach, it was now a harvest of joy. So it ever is; for full
joy only comes through sorrow: for the testimony of God is in a world of
evil.
