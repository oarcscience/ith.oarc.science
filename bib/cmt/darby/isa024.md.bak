### [Isaiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md)

Chapter 24 sets before us the overturning of everything in the earth.
The land of Israel is first in view. But there all the elements of all
the systems of this world will be gathered together and judged. We have
already remarked that this extends to the judicial overthrow of the
power of wickedness in the heavenlies, as well as of the kings of the
earth upon the earth: the succeeding chapters shew us with what intent.
Without it the evil would not be set aside and put a stop to. Hence when
Christ rides into Jerusalem in Luke it is said, "peace in heaven." For
till the power of evil is set aside thus, any blessing established on
the earth is soon corrupted and fades. Before examining them, let us
retrace the objects of the judgments we have spoken of; let us retrace
them in their moral order. We have Babylon, the power of organised
corruption, where the people of God are captive; the public open enemy
of God and His people-the Assyrian; the inward enemy-the Philistine;
then Moab, the pride of man. Damascus is that which has been the enemy
of God's people, but allied with the apostate part of that people
against the faithful part. From all these the people are delivered.
Afterwards we find, under judgment, Egypt, or the world in its state of
nature, the wisdom of which is lost in confusion; Babylon, now desert in
the midst of the nations; Dumah, the liberty, the independence, of man;
Jerusalem, the professing people; Tyre, the glory of the world; and,
finally, all that is on the earth, and, to sum up all power, spiritual
wickedness in the heavenly places, and the kings of the earth upon the
earth.
