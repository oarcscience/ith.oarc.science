### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#001.md)

And, first of all, the government of God, who forgets nothing, and with
whom everything has its results, is recalled to David and to his people
by means of the Gibeonites. It is no longer necessary for the
establishment of God's economy that David should pursue the house of
Saul. There is a righteous judgment, a moral principle of God, which is
above all economies. Saul in his formal and fleshly zeal, although it
was for God, had not acted in the fear of God. It is this which
especially distinguishes a godly zeal from a zeal for the outward
interests of His kingdom. Saul forgets the oaths which Israel made to
the Gibeonites. God remembers it, and does not despise the poor
Gibeonites. David also recognises its obligation; after having inquired
of Jehovah on account of the thrice repeated chastening upon Israel, he
submits to the demand of the Gibeonites \[See Note \#1\]. The whole
house of Saul perishes, except the little remnant attached to David.
With respect to the latter, the circumstances of Rizpah's touching and
faithful affection awaken in David's heart the remembrance of brighter
moments in poor Saul's career, and he pays the last honours to his
memory. After this God was entreated for the land.

If with a sling and a stone faith can overthrow its enemies, the flesh
is at fault before their attacks. David, when king, as we have clearly
seen, gave himself up more to his lusts and to his own will than David
suffering. Nevertheless it is beautiful to see that, where faith has
acted amid the people's ruin, it has stirred up many other instruments,
who-animated and encouraged by its success-act fearlessly with the same
power as that which wrought the first deliverance. It is well however to
observe, that to conquer valiant foes, when all Israel was flushed with
success and strengthened the hands of the mighty men, is a very
different thing from the faith which reckons upon God, when strength and
success are on the enemy's side and the people are fleeing before him.
The latter was David's case with Goliath; the former, that of the men
who slew the other giants.

Note \#1

However, in yielding to the Gibeonites, David did not consult Jehovah as
to what he should do. We see the government of God as to Saul's house,
and Saul's act towards those he had wronged; but though in its general
character righteous and upright, had he consulted Jehovah, some happier
way of being righteous might have been found.
