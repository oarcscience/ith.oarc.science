### [Hosea Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 9, 10, and 11.

In chapter 9 we have here that touching mixture of affection and
judgment which we find again and again in this prophet. Ephraim should
not remain in the land which was Jehovah's, for God would not abandon
His rights; whatever might be the iniquity of the people. They should go
into captivity, and come no more into the house of Jehovah. The prophet
and the spiritual man should no longer be a link between them and
Jehovah. God would confound them by means of that which should have
enlightened and guided them. The prophet should even be a snare to their
soul, although formerly a watchman from God. The corruption of Ephraim
was as deep as in the days of Gibeah, the history of which is related at
the end of the book of Judges; and they should be visited. God had
chosen Israel from among the nations to be His delight, and they had
gone after Baal-peor, even before they came into the land. If God is
longsuffering, He yet takes knowledge of everything. Ephraim should now
be a wanderer among the nations.

At the end of chapter 9 and in chapter 10 the Spirit reproaches Israel
with their altars and their golden calves. They should be carried into
captivity. Judah should also bear the yoke. The Assyrian should carry
away these calves in- which Israel had trusted. After all (chapter 11)
God still remembers His early love for Jacob; He puts them in mind of
all His lovingkindness, His goodness, His care for them. They should not
return to their former condition in Egypt; Assyria should be the place
of their captivity. But, however great the sin of Israel, the heart of
their God cannot forsake His people: He will not destroy them; He is
God, and not man; and, finally, He will place the people, trembling now
and submissive, once more in their dwellings.
