### [Psalms Chapter 98](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)

Psalm 98 is the result celebrated by Israel on earth. Jehovah has made
known His salvation, and remembered His mercy and truth towards Israel.
All the land (or earth) is summoned to celebrate Jehovah as king. The
heavens are not summoned here, as in Psalm 96. They are already filled
with His glory, and the angels have been called to worship; but the sea
and its fullness, and the world and its inhabitants are to rejoice
before Jehovah, who comes to judge the earth and the whole world.
