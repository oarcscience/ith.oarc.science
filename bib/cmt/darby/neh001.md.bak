[Nehemiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 1:1</span></span>

Through grace, faith had set up the altar, and the Gentiles had had
nothing to do with it, except by voluntary service; but when the city is
to be rebuilt, it is the governor appointed by the Gentiles who holds
the prominent place, God having touched the heart of these Gentiles and
disposed them to favour His people. We see in Nehemiah himself a heart
touched with the affliction of his people, a precious token of the grace
of God; and He who had produced this feeling disposed the king's heart
to grant Nehemiah all he desired for the good of the people and of
Jerusalem. We see also in Nehemiah a heart that habitually turned to
God, that sought its strength in Him, and thus surmounted the greatest
obstacles.
