### [Isaiah Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 44 and 45.

Jehovah now reasons with His people whom He had formed from the womb,
encourages them, promises them His Spirit. Their children shall spring
up as willows by the water-courses. They shall be witnesses for Him,
Jehovah, the King of Israel, and their Redeemer. He shews Israel the
folly of idolatry, reminds him that he is Jehovah's servant, and that He
will not forget them, and assures them of the entire pardon of all their
sins: even Jehovah, who is the disposer of all things, and who calls
Cyrus by name to rebuild Jerusalem. Chapter 45 enlarges upon the same
subjects, dwelling on the deliverance of Israel as an everlasting
deliverance, the result of which shall never be overthrown.
