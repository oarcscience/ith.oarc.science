### [Matthew Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001.md)

Chapter 23 clearly shews how far the disciples are viewed in connection
with the nation, inasmuch as they were Jews, although the Lord judges
the leaders, who beguiled the people and dishonoured God by their
hypocrisy. He speaks to the multitude and to His disciples, saying, "The
scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat." Being thus expositors of
the law, they were to be obeyed in all that they said according to that
law, although their own conduct was but hypocrisy. That which is
important here is the position of the disciples; it is in fact the same
as that of Jesus. They are in connection with all that is of God in the
nation, that is to say, with the nation as the recognised people of God
consequently, with the law as possessing authority from God. At the same
time the Lord judges, and the disciples also were practically to judge,
the walk of the nation, as publicly represented by their leaders. While
still forming part of the nation, they were carefully to avoid the walk
of the scribes and Pharisees. After having reproached these pastors of
the nation with their hypocrisy, the Lord points out the way in which
they themselves condemned the deeds of their fathers by building the
sepulchres of the prophets whom they had slain. They were, then, the
children of those who slew them, and God would put them to the test by
sending them also prophets and wise men and scribes, and they would fill
up the measure of their iniquity by putting these to death and
persecuting them condemned thus out of their own mouths in order that
all the righteous blood which had been shed, from Abel's to that of the
prophet Zechariah, should come upon this generation. Frightful amount of
guilt, accumulated from the beginning of the enmity which sinful man,
when placed under responsibility, has ever shewn to the testimony of
God; and which increased daily, because the conscience became more
hardened each time that it resisted this testimony! The truth was so
much the more manifest from its witnesses having suffered. It was a
rock, exposed to view, to be avoided in the people's path. But they
persisted in their evil course, and every step in advance, every similar
act, was the proof of a still increasing obduracy. The patience of God,
while graciously dealing in testimony, had not been unobservant of their
ways, and under this patience all had accumulated. All would be heaped
upon the head of this reprobate generation.

Remark here the character given to the apostles and christian prophets.
They are scribes, wise men, prophets, sent to the Jews to the ever
rebellious nation. This very clearly brings out the aspect in which this
chapter regards them. Even the apostles are "wise men," "scribes," sent
to the Jews as such.

But the nation Jerusalem, God's beloved city is guilty and is judged.
Christ, as we have seen, since the cure of the blind man near Jericho,
presents Himself as Jehovah the King of Israel. How often would He have
gathered the children of Jerusalem, but they would not! And now their
house should be desolate, until (their hearts being converted) they
should use the language of Psalm 118, and, in desire, hail His arrival
who came in the name of Jehovah, looking for deliverance at His hands,
and praying to Him for it in a word, until they should cry Hosanna to
Him that should come. They would see Jesus no more until, humbled in
heart, they should pronounce Him blessed whom they were expecting, and
whom they now rejected in short, until they were prepared in heart.
Peace should follow, desire precede, His appearing.

The last three Verses ([Mat 23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md)
exhibit clearly enough the position of the Jews, or of Jerusalem, as the
centre of the system before God. Long since, and many times, would
Jesus, Jehovah the Saviour, have gathered the children of Jerusalem
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they
would not. Their house should remain forsaken and desolate, but not for
ever. After having killed the prophets, and stoned the messengers sent
unto them, they had crucified their Messiah, and rejected and slain
those whom He had sent to proclaim grace unto them even after His
rejection. Therefore should they see Him no more until they had
repented, and the desire to see Him was produced in their hearts, so
that they should be prepared to bless Him, and would bless Him in their
hearts, and confess their readiness to do so. The Messiah, who was about
to leave them, should be seen of them no more until repentance had
turned their hearts unto Him whom they were now rejecting. Then they
should see Him. The Messiah, coming in the name of Jehovah, shall be
manifested to His people Israel. It is Jehovah their Saviour who should
appear, and the Israel who had rejected Him should see Him as such. The
people should thus return into the enjoyment of their relationship with
God.

Such is the moral and prophetic picture of Israel. The disciples, as
Jews, were viewed as part of the nation, though as a remnant spiritually
detached from it, and witnessing in it.
