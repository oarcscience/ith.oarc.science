### [1 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001.md)

David immediately thinks of the ark (see Psalm 132). He consults with
the captains of the thousands of Israel in order to bring it back
amongst them. Loving the people, and beloved by them, he acts with and
for them: but his zeal was still too much connected with his warlike
spirit; and, while giving himself up to joy, he did not sufficiently
consider Jehovah's ways. He imitates no doubt the means by which God had
glorified Himself, when the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines.
These were quite right in having nothing to do with it, and in leaving
God to act, and to testify of Himself, that He was the God of all
creation, exercising a power that overrules nature in His creatures.
This was faith in the Philistines; but it was not faith in Uzza to touch
the ark. Amongst God's people it is His word that must direct. God may
act in sovereignty outside of all this; but here the word rules.
Perez-Uzza is a witness that it cannot be neglected with impunity, and
that the order of His house in the midst of His people is a thing which
He will cause them to reverence. It was through having failed in this
reverence that David's joy was turned into sorrow and fear; but the
house of Obed-edom was nevertheless a proof that the presence of God
assuredly brings blessing.
