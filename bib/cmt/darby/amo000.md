Introduction to Amos

The prophecy of Amos is one of those that speak of the moral condition
of the people, and especially of Israel, who, as we have already seen in
the historical books, represents more particularly the people as such;
while Judah was but as an appanage of the house of David, although
containing always a remnant of the people.

This prophecy, which does not extend so far down in the history of
Israel as that of Hosea, is less fervent than the latter; sin is not
pursued with that consuming fire of jealousy and of moral revenge, which
characterises the burning and broken style of the prophet Hosea.
Nothing, doubtless, can be more decided against evil than Amos; but,
although very simple, he speaks, as it were, from higher ground. In
Hosea we see the anguish of heart produced by the Holy Ghost, in a man
who could not endure evil in the people whom he loved as being the
people of God; while in Amos there is more of the calmness of God's own
judgment. There is much less detail with respect to sin. Certain
prominent transgressions of a special character are pointed out, and the
most complete and absolute judgment is proclaimed.
