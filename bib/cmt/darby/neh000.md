Introduction to Nehemiah

The Book of Nehemiah will require but few remarks; but it is important
to establish its import. It is a necessary link in the history of God's
dealings, in the recital of His patience and loving-kindness towards
Jerusalem, which He had chosen.

In Ezra we have seen the temple rebuilt and the authority of the law
re-established among the people, who are again separated from the
Gentiles, and set apart for God.

In Nehemiah we witness the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, and the
restoration of what may be termed the civil condition of the people, but
under circumstances that definitely prove their subjection to the
Gentiles.
