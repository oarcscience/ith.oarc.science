### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)

The priests and the whole tribe of Levi have their portion assigned to
them. The people are forbidden to do after those abominations, on
account of which the nations which inhabited the land were driven out
before Israel, inquiring of those who used divination. Jehovah would
raise up a prophet like unto Moses, unto whom the people should hearken.
These ordinances foresee in the people the lack of the faith needful in
order to walk simply with the Lord. Christ is the true and only answer.
They were not to fear a prophet who gave a sign which did not come to
pass, for Jehovah had not spoken by him.

One word here as to the portion of the priests. First, the normal
condition of the people was that of being guided by the priests, and, in
case of need, by judges raised up in an extraordinary way; and to abide
under the keeping of God in the land, enjoying His blessing. It was,
properly speaking, theocracy. The laws of God directed the people; they
enjoyed the blessing of God; and the priests settled any questions which
arose, a judge being raised up in exceptional cases. The priests are
introduced here in connection with that which was necessary to the
enjoyment of the land, not as a means of drawing near to God.
Consequently, they were there to fulfil their ministry before God, and a
certain portion belonged to them.

The king was only thought of in the case when the people would ask one,
in order to be like the nations; and in that case he was to remain, as
much as possible, simple in the midst of Israel, that the law of God
might have its full authority. The people are always accounted to be
themselves responsible before God, and enjoying the land under this
responsibility, though for that reason subject to the decisions of the
priests. They had the land from God. The position spoken of here is not
that of drawing near to Him, but acknowledging His deliverance and His
goodness, as in the feasts which we have considered. Thus he who went up
to the place which Jehovah had chosen ate with his family, and sometimes
with the Levite, the stranger, etc., the tithes \[See Note \#1\] of each
year (in the third year there were some for the Levite and the poor),
the firstling of the herd and of the flock, the vows, the
free-will-offerings, and the heave-offerings, all before Jehovah. But at
the same time that they offered them to Jehovah, the offerer partook of
the enjoyment of them (see [Deu 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md);
[Deu 14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028.md); [Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md); [Deu
12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md); [Deu
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017).md); whilst, in chapter 18 the
priest had a certain portion of the sacrifice, the firstfruit of the
corn, of the wine, and the oil, and the first of the fleece of the
sheep.

The first part of these ordinances is so much the more remarkable that
in the book of Numbers (chap. 18), the firstborn, \[See Note \#2\] the
heave-offerings, all sorts of offerings for sin, and the meat-offerings,
are given to the priests, and the tithes to the Levites. But these are
assumed, not reordained here, that the true character of Deuteronomic
worship may be maintained, rejoicing before Jehovah in the enjoyment of
what He gives, not drawing near to Him in the holiest.

We may remark here the difference between that which was in this case
for the priests, and that which in Deuteronomy the people are to eat of
before the Lord, and in the other books what is given to the priests. We
have already pointed out the difference of position. In the three
preceding books, what is brought before the mind is drawing near to God,
and the priests alone are looked upon as able to do this; and thus, in
the relationship of priests, they ate in the holy place all that was
offered. They alone were near God, and that which was offered to God
(according to the force of the word, \[See Note \#3\] that which was
brought near to God) was theirs, as being near. They were all as one
company in the camp, and the whole was essentially typical.

Thus all the arrangements of the tabernacle were made for a people who
found themselves in the wilderness-strangers there; and it is to be
observed that Paul, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, never speaks of
anything but the tabernacle, never of the temple. The relationship he
speaks of is that of pilgrims with God. It is no longer thus in
Deuteronomy. There the dwelling of the people in the land of promise is
considered; and, consequently, the people are accounted, not as needing
to learn how to draw near to God, \[See Note \#4\] but as enjoying, from
God, the effect of His promise in His presence and before Him, so that
the people are directly concerned in the sacrifices. They are in the
enjoyment of the promises, in the presence of God, and they realise, in
the communion of Jehovah, all the means through which it is enjoyed, and
they partake, in communion, of all that is devoted to Him, as a sign of
the redemption through which this enjoyment was procured for them.

It is otherwise with regard to the firstfruits of the land-that which it
yields. Enjoying those fruits of the goodness of God, the people gave
Him back the firstfruits, as a testimony that all came from Him, and
that all was His, and that His grace had communicated it to them (see
chap. 26). Therefore the firstfruits were not for the people to eat:
they offered them to God, and ate of all the rest. It was the
recognition of God, while sharing His blessings. The firstfruits then
were offered to God, and thus fell into the hands of the priests as
their portion.

Note \#1

See note in chapters referred to; they were second tithes, not Levitical
ones. The people never paid tithes to the priests; but to the Levites at
home, they to the priests. The tithes of the third year (not Levitical)
were eaten at home. We have nothing of Levitical tithes in Deuteronomy.

Note \#2

Firstborn males. See notes to chapters 12 and 14.

Note \#3

The word translated "an offering" (that is, corban) comes from a word
which means "to draw near," and, in the form Hiphil (causative active
form), "to bring near."

Note \#4

This very important difference characterises the book. It is no question
how near we can get to the holiest, to God Himself, but communion in the
enjoyment of all the fruits of His promise in His presence and in the
spirit of grace. It is not wilderness connection with God, a yet deeper
principle of connection with Him.
