### [Psalms Chapter 101](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md)

Psalm 101 states the principles on which the King will govern His house
and the land when He takes the kingdom in the name of Jehovah. Psalm 93
is the thesis, Jehovah reigns: the rage of men, the supreme authority of
Jehovah, the holiness that becomes His house. Psalm 94 begins the series
with the cry of the remnant when iniquity is still on the throne. Psalm
95 Israel (the remnant) summoned in the closing day. Psalm 96 the
Gentiles called, Jehovah coming to judge the earth. Psalm 97 Jehovah is
on His way. Psalm 98 He has executed judgment on the earth and
remembered Israel. Psalm 99 He has taken His throne on earth in Zion.
Psalm 100 Israel is there as His people; but it is a call to worship
Jehovah. Still a house of prayer for all the earth: for Israel, mercy,
for they had sinned; truth, for God had promised, and, as said
elsewhere, they had now met together. Psalm 101 when the earthly throne
is taken up, it is mercy and judgment.
