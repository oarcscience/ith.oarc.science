### [Deuteronomy Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 22, 23, 24, and 25.

Chapter 22 appears to contain ordinances to guard the people from want
of benevolence and mercy, and of that which would offend the
sensibilities of nature, either with regard to tenderness or purity. So
also all mixture was forbidden in ploughing or sowing. We find the same
with regard to women: they were protected against the dishonour done to
them by a brutish, inconsiderate husband; whilst impurity was punished
with death.

Thus (chap. 23) the people are taught what sentiments became them,
according to God, with reference to the nations (taking the ways and
doings of those nations into consideration) in case of war. They are
also instructed in what was proper, as to the purity of the camp in case
of war, seeing God was there. So with regard to all sorts of things,
such as the slave that was escaped from his master; things morally
impure; even the neighbour's vineyard; and (chap. 24) a more serious
thing, divorce, and everything relative to it; delicacy towards the
poor, the hire of labourers, the gleaning for the poor. The spirit of
all these ordinances is very instructive, and the goodness and the
tenderness of God, who deigns to take knowledge of all these things, and
to teach His people delicacy, propriety, consideration for others,
sensitiveness, and those feelings which, by removing brutality, and
softening the hardness of the heart of man, fashion his ways according
to that love with which the Spirit of God clothes Himself when He acts
in the heart of man. Here, it is true, everything is imperfect. There
are things taken for granted here, which form the basis of these
ordinances, which the full operation of the Spirit of Christ would
entirely take away; divorce, for instance, and other things endured;
owing their existence to the hardness of man's heart. But the
limitations and conditions, assigned by the law of God, keep in check
the wickedness of that will which hardens itself, while it oppresses
others.

Chapter 25 adds ordinances which are a continuation of what we have
already read; taking care that none of their brethren should be
dishonoured in their eyes, and that no family should perish from among
the people (there being, at the same time, the maintenance of purity and
uprightness).

As to the inveterate enemies of God and His people, Israel was never to
seek peace with them. Human amiability is often enmity with God. This
ordinance is so much the more remarkable, because it follows so many
others which made provision for kindness, even to a bird.

Jehovah had taken care that an Egyptian should find the entrance into
the assembly of God; but those affections were to be in exercise towards
the Egyptians for the good of the souls of the Israelites themselves.
They were not to harden their hearts against those in whose midst they
had sojourned. But to spare the Amalekites (who came to meet Israel to
shut up their way and destroy the feeble ones among them) was to forget
what was due to God, who brought them back; and, as regarded the people,
it would have proved indifference of heart to evil, and not the effusion
of a natural affection; neither was it yielding to remembrances, with
which charity might mingle for good, by a becoming forgetfulness of
wrongs formerly received. \[See Note \#1\] Where there is nobleness of
sentiment, men who know (though they have injured) each other, still
will own one another when the evil is over.

But there is a spirit which claims nothing but disgust: to tolerate it
is only sparing oneself, and admitting that very spirit into one's heart
so as to partake of it. What is in question is not judging, but the
state of one's own heart. The distance of an Egyptian from God was
recognised; but if he were in relationship with Him during three
generations, why should he be kept at a distance? why should he remain a
stranger? But Amalek did not fear God-did not recognise Him. What then
could be recognised in such a nation? We must bring God into our
affairs-our relationships; and charity, firmness, justness in our
judgments, will each find its place, and be reproduced in all our ways.

Note \#1

The Egyptians were merely that in which Israel was held naturally. The
Amalekites were positive active enemies against them when the redeemed
people of God. One was really man, though fallen man without God-I
honour all men; the other, the positive direct power of the enemy.
