### [2 Corinthians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md)

Having received this ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit, the
foundation of which was Christ glorified beheld with open face, he not
only used great boldness of speech, but his zeal was not abated, nor his
faith enfeebled by difficulties. Moreover, with the courage which
through grace was imparted to him by this doctrine, he held back
nothing, weakened nothing of this glory; he did not corrupt the
doctrine; he manifested it in all the purity and brightness in which he
had received it. It was the word of God; such as he had received it, so
they received it from him, the unaltered word of God; the apostle thus
approving himself, commending himself to every man's conscience in the
sight of God. All could not say this. The glory of the Lord Jesus was
set forth by Paul's preaching in all the clearness and brightness of its
revelation to himself. If, therefore, the good news which he proclaimed
was hidden, it was not as in the case of Moses; not only was the glory
of the Lord fully revealed with open face in Christ, it was also
manifested without a veil in the pure preaching of the apostle. This is
the link established between the glory accomplished in the Person of
Christ, as the result of the work of redemption, and the ministry which,
by the power of the Holy Ghost acting in the instrument chosen of the
Lord, proclaimed this glory to the world, and made men responsible for
the reception of the truth responsible for submission to this glorious
Christ, who announced Himself in grace from heaven, as having
established righteousness for the sinner, and as inviting him to come
freely and enjoy the love and the blessing of God. Now there was no
other means of coming to God. To set up any other would be to put aside
and declare imperfect and insufficient that which Christ had done, and
that which Christ was, and to produce something better than He. But this
was not possible: for that which he announced was the manifestation of
the glory of God in the Person of the Son, in connection with the
revelation of perfect love, and of the making good perfect and divine
righteousness; so that the pure light was the happy abode of those who
by this means entered into it. There could not be anything more, unless
there was something more than God in the fulness of His grace and of His
perfection. If then this revelation was hidden, it was in the case of
those who were lost, whose minds were blinded by the god of this world,
lest the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image
of God, should shine into their hearts. This is translated "glorious
gospel." But we have seen that the fact of Christ's being in glory, the
glory of God being seen in His face, was the special subject of the
preceding Chapter. To that the apostle here alludes as characterising
the gospel which he preached. It was the proof of the sin Christ had
borne being utterly put away, of victory over death, of the introduction
of man into the presence of God in glory according to God's eternal
counsels of love. It was withal the full display of the divine glory in
man according to grace, which the Holy Ghost takes to shew to us in
order to form us after the same likeness. It was the glorious
ministration of righteousness, and of the Spirit, which opened the free
way for man to God, even into the holiest, in entire liberty. When
Christ was thus proclaimed, there was either the joyful acceptance of
the good news, submission of heart to the gospel, or else the blinding
of Satan. For Paul did not preach himself (which others did not fail to
do) but Jesus Christ the Lord, and himself their servant for Jesus'
sake. Because in fact (and this is another important principle) the
shining forth of this gospel of the glory of Christ is the work of God's
power of the same God who, by His word alone, caused the light
instantaneously to shine out of the midst of darkness. He had shone into
the apostle's heart to give forth the light of the knowledge of His own
glory in the face of Jesus Christ. The gospel shone forth by a divine
operation similar to that which had, in the beginning, caused the light
to shine out of darkness by a single word. The heart of the apostle was
the vessel, the lamp, in which this light had been kindled to shine in
the midst of the world before the eyes of men. It was the revelation of
the glory which shone in the Person of Christ by the power of the Spirit
of God in the heart of the apostle, in order that this glory should
shine out in the gospel before the world. It was the power of God which
wrought in it, in the same manner as when light was caused by the word
"Let there be light! and there was light." But the treasure of this
revelation of the glory was deposited, in earthen vessels, in order that
power which wrought in it should be of God alone, and not that of the
instruments. In all, the weakness of the instrument shewed itself in the
trying circumstances which God, for this very purpose (among others),
made the testimony pass through. Nevertheless the power of God was
manifested in it so much the more evidently, from the vessel's shewing
its weakness in the difficulties that beset its path. The testimony was
rendered, the work was done, the result was produced, even when man
broke down and found himself without resource in presence of the
opposition raised up against truth. Afflicted by the tribulation, this
was the vessel's part; not straitened, for God was with the vessel.
Without means of escape, that was the vessel; yet not without resource,
for God was with it. Persecuted, that was the vessel; not forsaken, for
God was with it. Cast down, that was the vessel; but not destroyed, for
God was with it. Always bearing about in his body the dying \[See Note
\#3\] of the Lord Jesus (made like Him, in that the man as such was
reduced to nothing), in order that the life of Jesus, which death could
not touch, which has triumphed over death, should be manifested in his
body, mortal as it was. The more the natural man was annihilated, the
more was it evident that a power was there which was not of man. This
was the principle, but it was morally realised in the heart by faith. As
the Lord's servant, Paul realised in his heart the death of all that was
human life, in order that the power might be purely of God through Jesus
risen. But besides this, God made him realise these things by the
circumstances through which he had to pass; for, as living in this
world, he was always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, in order that
the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh. Thus death
wrought in the apostle; what was merely of man, of nature and natural
life, disappeared, in order that life in Christ, developing itself in
him on the part of God and by His power, should work in the Corinthians
by his means. What a ministry! A thorough trial of the human heart, a
glorious calling, for a man to be thus assimilated to Christ, to be the
vessel of the power of His pure life, and by means of an entire
self-renunciation, even that of life itself, to be morally like unto
Jesus. What a position by grace! What a conformity to Christ! And yet in
a way in which it passed through man's heart to reach man's heart (which
indeed is of the essence of Christianity itself), not surely by man's
strength, but God's made good in man's weakness. Therefore it was that
the apostle could use the language of the Spirit of Christ in the
Psalms, "I believed, and therefore have I spoken." That is to say, 'At
whatever cost, in spite of everything, of all the danger, all the
opposition, I have spoken for God, I have borne my testimony. I have had
confidence enough in God to bear testimony to Him and to His truth,
whatever the consequences might be, even if I had died in doing it.'
That is, the apostle said, 'I have acted as Christ Himself did, because
I know that He who raised up Jesus would do the same for me, and would
present me, together with you, before His face in that same glory in
which Christ is now in heaven, and for my testimony to which, I have
suffered death like Him.' We must clearly distinguish here between
Christ's sufferings for righteousness and for His work of love, and His
sufferings for sin. The former it is our privilege to share with Him; in
the latter He is alone. The apostle said, "will present me with you,"
for, he adds, according to the heart and mind of Christ towards His own,
"all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might, through
the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God." And therefore it
was that he did not allow himself to be discouraged; but on the
contrary, if the outward man perished, the inward man was renewed day by
day. For the light affliction, which was but for a moment (for such he
esteemed it in view of the glory it was but the temporary affliction of
this poor dying body), worked out for him an eternal weight of glory
which was beyond all the most exalted expression of human thought or
language. And this renewing took place; and he was not disheartened come
whatmight, in that he looked not at the things that are seen, which are
temporal, but at the things that are not seen, which are eternal. Thus
the power of the divine life, with all its consequences, was developed
in his soul by faith. He knew the result of everything on God's part. It
was not only that there were things invisible and glorious. Christians
had their part in them. We know, the apostle says in their name, that if
this earthly house (passing away as it is) were destroyed and it had
very nearly been the case with himself-we have a building of God, a
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Precious certainty!
He knew it. Christians know it as a part of their faith. We know \[See
Note \#4\] a certainty which caused this glory, which he knew to be his,
to be a real and practical hope in the heart by the power of the Holy
Ghost a reality present by faith. He saw this glory as that which
belonged to him, with which he was to be invested. And therefore also he
groaned in his tabernacle, not (as so many do) because the desires of
his flesh could not be fulfilled; and because satisfaction of heart
cannot be found for man, even when those desires are fulfilled; nor
because he was uncertain whether he was accepted, and the glory his or
not; but because the body was a hindrance, tending to depress the divine
life, to deprive him of the full enjoyment of that glory which the new
life saw and desired, and which Paul saw and admired as his own. It was
a burden, this earthly human nature; it was no distress to him that he
could not satisfy its desires; his distress was to find himself still in
this mortal nature, because he saw something better. Not however that he
desired to be unclothed, for he saw in Christ glorified a power of life
capable of swallowing up and annihilating every trace of mortality; for
the fact that Christ was on high in the glory was the result of this
power, and at the same time the manifestation of the heavenly portion
that belonged to them that were His. Therefore the apostle desired, not
to be unclothed but clothed upon, and that that which was mortal in him
should be absorbed by life, that the mortality that characterised his
earthly human nature should disappear before the power of life which he
saw in Jesus, and which was his life. That power was such that there was
no need to die. And this was not a hope which had no other foundation
than the desire awakened by a view of the glory might produce: God had
formed Christians for this very thing. He who was a Christian was formed
for this, and not for anything else. It was God Himself who had formed
him for this this glory, in which Christ, the last Adam, was at the
right hand of God. Precious assurance! Happy confidence in the grace and
the mighty work of God! Ineffable joy to be able to attribute all to God
Himself, to be thus certified of His love, to glorify Him as the God of
love our Benefactor, to know that it was His work, and that we rest upon
a finished work the work of God. It is not here resting upon a work done
for us; but the blessed consciousness that God has wrought us for this:
we are His workmanship. Nevertheless something else was necessary to our
enjoying this, since we are not yet glorified in fact; and God has given
it the earnest of the Spirit. Thus, we have the glory before us, we are
wrought for it by God Himself, and we have the earnest of the Spirit
till we are there, and know that Christ has so entirely overcome death
that, if the time were come, we should be transformed into glory without
dying at all. Mortality would be swallowed up of life. This is our
portion through grace in the last Adam, through the power of life in
which Christ was raised. But next the apostle will treat of the effect
as to the natural portion of the first fallen man, death and judgment;
for the testimony here is very complete.

Note \#3

Or rather, "putting to death."

Note \#4

This "we know" is in fact a technical expression for the portion of
Christians, known to them as such. "We know that the law is spiritual,"
"we know that the Son of God is come," and so on.
