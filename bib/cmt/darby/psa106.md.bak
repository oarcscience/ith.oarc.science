### [Psalms Chapter 106](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)

Psalm 106. "Hallelujah. Give thanks to Jehovah, for it is good (or He is
good). His mercy endureth for ever." This last we have often seenthe
expression of this unfailing faithful mercy of Jehovah, which secures
Israel. It then recites the character of those that are blessed; and
personally looks, as in the mouth of a godly Israelite at the close, to
be remembered with the favor Jehovah shows His people desiring withal to
see the good of Jehovah's chosen, and rejoice in the gladness of His
nation and glory with His inheritance. It is the expression of genuine
piety, which then turns to confess the sinfulness of the people not they
have sinned, though that is owned, as showing how Jehovah's mercy has
endured; but "we have sinned with our fathers." It is the practical
piety which proves, in its own confession, enduring mercy. It then goes
through all the history of Israel with this view; and at the close shows
that, in spite of all, Jehovah, remembering His covenant, thought on
their affliction, and caused them to be pitied of the heathen, among
whom they were. For this mercy he now looks, that they may triumph in
the praise of Jehovah. This closes the fourth Book.

It will be remarked that, as we had seen in the third, the fourth also
speaks of all Israel, and, though the humiliation of Christ is brought
out and His eternal divinity contrasted with it in a remarkable way, yet
it does not enter into Jewish circumstances particularly, nor the
association of Christ with them, though His Spirit be in it all. In
Psalm 104 Antichrist is presented to us, but it is for his destruction
by the coming in of Messiah the King, as Jehovah the Judge.
