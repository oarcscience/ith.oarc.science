### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 11, 12, and 13.

The history of David and the wife of Uriah follows. David is no longer
acting by faith in God's service. When the time comes at which kings go
forth to war, he stays at home at his ease, and sends others in his
place to fight Jehovah's battles. At ease and in indolence he falls
readily into sin, as was the case when he sought for rest among the
Philistines. He was no longer standing by faith. The nearer David was to
God, the more ineffectual were his attempts to conceal his sin. Given up
to himself for the time in chastisement, he adds a second transgression
to the first; he completes it, and enjoys its fruit, now that the
removal of every obstacle gives a semblance of lawfulness to his course.
What a sad history! What unworthiness! He forgets his position as king,
and a king from God. Was it reigning in righteousness to take advantage
of his royal power to oppress Uriah? He makes himself a slave to the
wretched Joab by rendering him accessory to his crime. How degrading!
How much happier was he, when, though hunted like a partridge in the
mountains, he had a living faith and a good conscience! But who can shun
the eye of God? Accordingly God, who knows and loves him, fails not to
visit his sin. This was a very great sin: David committed it in secret;
God punishes it in the sight of all Israel. If David knew not how to
glorify God, nor-while reigning in His name-to maintain a true testimony
as to the nature of God's kingdom; if he had on the contrary falsified
its character, God Himself will know how, in the sight of all men, to
retrace its features through the chastisement He will send upon the man
who has thus dishonoured Him, and who had taken away the only witness to
His government which God had set up before men.

This history shews us how far sin can blind the heart, even while the
moral judgment continues sound; it shews also the power of the faithful
word of God. God manifests at the same time the sovereignty of His
grace; for although He chastened David by the child's death, it is
another son of Bathsheba who was the elect of God, who became king and
the head of the royal family, the man of peace and blessing, the beloved
of Jehovah. David submits himself under the hand of God; his heart bows
under it in the depth of its affections. He understands it better than
his servants do, although more guilty than they. He acts becomingly
according to spiritual intelligence. There was confidence in God and
intimacy with Him; and therefore David can lay open the tenderest part
of his heart to God, the part in which God had wounded him; but when the
will of God is manifest, he submits entirely. We see here the evident
work of the Spirit. It is the same Spirit who wrought in Jesus at
Gethsemane, although both the occasion and the extent of the suffering
were not only different, but far otherwise important; but the heart is
opened to God completely and the submission complete when God's will is
known.

The sin of David has been extremely great; but we can plainly see in him
the precious work of the Spirit. Confounded by the simple faithfulness
of Uriah, he cannot escape the hand of God! David is pardoned, for he
confesses his sin; but as to His government, God shews Himself to be
inflexible, and while sparing the king-for he deserved death-He
announces to him that the sword shall never depart out of his house. We
have seen a similar case in Jacob's unfaithfulness. David's punishment
also answers to his sins (compare [Sa2
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#010.md); [Sa2
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#012) with the history of Absalom.md). As
to David's affections, the chastisement was in the death of his child, a
chastisement which he deeply felt; and the public government of God was
manifested in that which was done, according to His word, before all
Israel and before the sun.

It is possible that the children of Ammon deserved severe judgment, and
that this period was the time of their judgment; they were the insolent
enemies of the king whom God had set up, and who had given proof of his
kind feeling towards them. But as to his personal condition, I know not
whether David would have treated his enemies in this manner when he was
walking in the narrow path of faith. As a type, this judgment brings to
mind the righteous judgment of the Messiah, and the dreadful
consequences of having despised and insulted Him even in His glory. We
learn from it also, that when a people are ripe for judgment, God will
bring it upon them, even although others may seek to act in grace.

When David had shewn that he had forgotten God, and had failed in his
entire dependence upon Him, the evils in his house soon broke out. He
had added to the number of his wives. The root of bitterness buds and
brings forth bitter fruits. Although in the main David's heart was
upright before God and deeply acknowledged Him, yet, when once out of
that path of humble dependence which is produced by faith and the sense
of God's presence, he embittered the remainder of his days through
following his own will in the midst of his blessings. There is sin in
his house, wrath on account of the sin, vacillation through partiality
for Absalom. Joab appears on the scene, as is the case every time that
these matters of intrigue and wickedness recur in the history. This is
all that need be said of the sorrowful story of Amnon and Absalom.
