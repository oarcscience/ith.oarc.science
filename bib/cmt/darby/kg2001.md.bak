[4 Kings (2 Kings) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 1:1</span></span>

If God has shewn that He took notice of His servant's fault, and did not
pass it lightly over, He did not fail towards him in either tenderness
or faithfulness. He acted towards him as towards a beloved and faithful
servant, even at the moment in which He made him sensible of his failure
in the energy of faith; for He did not make others aware of it, although
He has communicated it to us for our instruction. I said failure in the
energy of faith; for, with respect to the mass of the people, Elijah's
judgment was just. God reveals His thoughts and His intentions to him,
and even points out to him the agents He will employ; and, while
definitely replacing the prophet by Elisha, God nevertheless makes him
publicly re-enter His service, by commanding him to call Elisha to
accompany him in his work. Thus Elijah resumes his ministry in the midst
of Israel.

Now Ahaziah walked in the way of his father, and openly confessed Baal
to be his god by sending to consult Baal-zebub at Ekron. Sent to meet
the king's messengers, Elijah pronounces his sentence from the Lord.
Incensed at being opposed in his iniquity, Ahaziah sends men of his army
to take him. We find again here the same judicial character in Elijah's
miracles which was spoken of before-a character pointed out by Jehovah
Himself. He calls down fire from heaven to consume these men. The last
of those sent by the king, owning the authority and power of Elijah, has
his life spared. Elijah goes down with him to the king, to declare again
to him in person Jehovah's judgment which awaited him.
