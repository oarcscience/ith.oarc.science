### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001.md)

David is now driven away from the presence of Saul, and becomes a
wanderer in the earth. It is no longer entire submission to Saul, whilst
himself the vessel of the energy of God. Driven away by Saul, David had
returned to the source of God's testimony; and Saul had again dared to
seek his life, even when he was with Samuel. He has completely thrown
off the last restraint, and forgotten all that should have reminded him
of God, and stayed his hand. Seeking his own glory, and taking advantage
of his acquired position, the presence of Samuel has no longer any hold
upon his conscience. It is even no longer "Honour me before the elders
of my people"; he does not value the prophet at all; he comes, in spite
of himself, under an influence which he has despised. David is thus
shielded from his malice. He could not now return to Saul. It would have
been to unite himself with the despisal of God's testimony. For, what
can be done when a man prophesies, and yet runs counter to the power
which he cannot deny? David takes flight. But Saul's state is again
tested by this state of things. Jonathan can scarcely credit his
father's ill-will. But, before putting it to the proof, his devotion to
David is very plainly manifested. His faith and his heart acknowledge
that which the blinded Saul cannot receive ([Sa1
20:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#013).md).

Even when David is driven away, Jonathan's faith is not shaken; his
heart is not separated from the one whom his soul loved, when, radiant
with youth and the glory of his victory over Goliath, David replied to
Saul with a modesty that heightened its lustre. He loves him when
dishonoured and a fugitive. He acknowledges him as God's elect, and
links the hopes of his house with the glory of his beloved \[See Note
\#1\]. But Jonathan does not follow David, and he falls with Saul.
Whatever opinion we may entertain with respect to the typical meaning of
this part of his history, we see in him that whatever is allied to the
carnal system, which is outwardly connected with the interests of the
people and name of God, falls, as regards this world, with the system
that perishes entirely. David, informed by Jonathan of Saul's state of
mind, departs; and Jonathan returns into the city.

Note \#1

See [Sa1 23:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#016.md). But what Jonathan
proposed there could not be; that is, connection between the old system
in the flesh and God's grace and purpose. Jonathan, though loving David,
walked with the old, which God was going to judge.
