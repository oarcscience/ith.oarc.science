### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 14 and 15.

Chapter 14 forbids that the people, as being the children of the living
God, should imitate the profane customs which indicated the devotedness
of idolaters to the impure beings they worshipped. God had chosen Israel
for Himself. Neither were they to defile themselves by eating abominable
things. They were a holy people. The tithes and all the firstfruits were
to be offered to God.

Thus consecrated, each one might eat them in the place where God had put
His name. The same command had been given (chap. 12) with regard to the
place where they were to be eaten, with the addition that the children,
menservants, and maidservants, might partake of them, applying it also
to the vows, the free-will-offerings and the heave-offering. These
ordinances are very remarkable. \[See Note \#1\] Another, found at the
end of chapter 14, may be added here. The tithe of the third year was to
be laid up within their gates, and the Levite, the fatherless, and the
stranger, were to come and eat of it; and he who did thus would be
blessed of Jehovah in all the work of his hands. Here everything was
sanctified, as having been presented to Jehovah. There was thus the
recognition, on the one hand, that the people were His, on the other,
that all they had was of Him; but in giving Him back what He had given
them, they enjoyed, in fellowship with Him, and their families, the
things common to God and the people, given by Him, offered to Him, and
enjoyed in His presence in communion one with another, God Himself
partaking of them, for the whole was offered to Him. It was not here the
priests opening out a way for the people to draw near to God: God was
honoured by the offering. God enjoyed the piety of the people, and the
people themselves offered with joy. Seated before God Himself, in the
joy of communion with Him, as at the same table, it was the people who
enjoyed the privilege.

In the case of the tithe of the third year, it is not the family joy of
the people with God, but rather the grace that brought enjoyment to
those who were strangers or in want, and to the servants of God who had
no inheritance. It was within their gates that this took place. They had
the privilege of acting in grace from Jehovah, in communicating to His
poor what He had given them. They did not go to the house of Jehovah,
but they invited the widow, the orphan, and the Levite, to their house
to rejoice, and Jehovah blessed them. The immediate relationship of the
people with God in family fellowship and in grace here is very
remarkable. The priests are out of the scene; the Levites being the
objects of the liberality of the people, as having no inheritance
(compare [Deu 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#019).md).

Chapter 15 teaches each one among the people to consider with liberality
and grace their poor brethren (this consideration being besides made
sure to them by the year of release, which applied to debts and to the
Hebrew slaves). The dependence of him, who thus respected Jehovah in His
poor, was to be placed in God, who would bless him in thus acting
according to His commandment; for the poor were His poor.

Note \#1

It is generally explained that there was a double tithe; that is, that
this does not refer to the regular tithe paid to the Levites, as ordered
in the other places in the law, and that the Levitical tithes remained
as they were according to the previous prescriptions of the law; and it
is to be remarked they were to be locally paid to the Levites, not where
Jehovah had placed His name. Two years they carried the different
offerings to the place chosen of Jehovah, and ate and rejoiced, but the
third, invited the Levite and the poor at home. gives us historically
all these different tithes and offerings; only it appears that, the ten
tribes being in rebellion and apostasy, pious people carried the
Levitical tithes to Jerusalem. [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md) shews. there was some special
habit of tithing every third year, then at Bethel. At any rate what
characterises Deuteronomy is their enjoying God's goodness together, and
making the poor enjoy it with them, Levites and strangers; while
priests, though named, are on these points wholly ignored (see [Deu
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md); [Deu
12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#011.md); [Deu
12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md); [Deu
14:22-28](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022).md). The priests' portion is in
[Deu 18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md). But firstlings and
firstfruits in chapter 12 are not the same word; nor is [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023.md). But the whole tone of
Deuteronomy is fellowship and enjoyment only before the Lord, not
priestly or altar service.
