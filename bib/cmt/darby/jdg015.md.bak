### [Judges Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 14 and 15.

God makes use of Samson's marriage with a Philistine woman to punish
that people. Still, in the freshness of his strength, his heart with
Jehovah, and moved by the Holy Ghost, Samson acts in the might of this
strength in the midst of the enemies he has raised up against him; and,
in point of fact, he never marries this Philistine woman. I have said
that God used this circumstance. It is thus He may use this spiritual
strength of the assembly, so long as in heart it cleaves to Him,
although its walk may not be faithful or such as He can approve. For it
is evident that Samson's marriage with a daughter of Timnath was a
positive sin, a flagrant infringement of Jehovah's ordinances, which is
in no wise justified by the blessing which the Lord bestowed upon him
when wronged by the Philistines. It was not in his marriage he found
blessing, but quite the contrary. Accordingly Samson has not Israel with
him in the conflicts occasioned by his marriage; the Spirit of God does
not act upon the people as He did in the case of Gideon, of Jephthah, or
Barak.

Moreover, when Nazariteship is in question, opposition must be expected
from the people of God. A Nazarite is raised up in their midst, because
they are no longer themselves thus separated unto God. And this being
the case, they are without strength, and will allow the world to rule
over them, provided that outward peace is left them; and they would not
have any one act in faith, because this disquiets the world and incites
it against them. "Knowest thou not," said Israel, "that the Philistines
are rulers over us?" Even while acknowledging Samson as one of
themselves, the Israelites desire to give him up to the Philistines in
order to maintain peace. But in the part of Samson's life now before us
there are some details which require more attention.

His marriage was a sin. But the separation of God's people had no longer
that measure of practical application which the mind of God had assigned
it. The fact itself was inexcusable, because it had its origin in the
will of Samson, and he had not sought counsel from God. But, owing to
the influence of circumstances, he was not conscious at the time of the
evil he was committing, and God allowed him to seek peace and friendship
with the Canaanite world (that is to say, the world within the inclosure
of God's people), instead of making war against them; so that, as to the
Philistines, Samson had right on his side in the contentions which
followed.

Before his marriage Samson had slain the lion, and had found honey in
its carcase. He had strength from God while walking in his integrity.
This is the "riddle," the secret of God's people. The lion has no
strength against one who belongs to Christ. Christ has destroyed the
strength of him that had the power of death. By the might of the Spirit
of Christ our warfare is victory, and honey flows therefrom. But this is
carried on in the secret of communion with the Lord. David maintained
this place better in the simplicity of duty. Samson did not keep himself
from those connections with the world to which the condition of the
people easily led. This is always a Christian's danger. But whatever may
be their ignorance, if the children of God make any alliance with the
world, and thus pursue a line of conduct opposed to their true
character, they will assuredly find disappointment. They do not keep
themselves apart for God; they do not keep their secret with God, a
secret which is only known in communion with Himself. Their wisdom is
lost, the world beguiles them, their relationship with the world becomes
worse than before, and the world despises them, and goes on its own way,
regardless of their indignation at its behaviour towards them.

What had Samson to do there? His own will (chap. 15) is in exercise, and
takes its share in the use of that strength which God had given him
(like Moses when he slew the Egyptian). We always carry a little of the
world with us when, being children of God, we have mingled with it. But
God makes use of this to separate us forcibly and thoroughly from it,
making union impossible by setting us in direct conflict with the world
even in those very things which had formed our connection with it. We
had better have remained apart. But it is necessary that God should thus
deal with us, when this union with the world becomes an habitual and a
tolerated thing in the church \[See Note \#1\]. The most outrageous
circumstances pass unnoticed. Think of a Nazarite married to a
Philistine! God must break off such a union as this by causing enmities
and hostilities to arise, since there is no intelligence of that moral
nearness to God which separates from the world, and gives that quietness
of spirit which, finding its strength in God, can overcome and drive
away the enemy, when God leads into conflict by the plain revelation of
His will. But if we are linked with the world, it will always have
dominion over us; we have no right to resist the claims of any
relationship which we ourselves have formed. We may draw nigh to the
world, because the flesh is in us. The world cannot really draw nigh to
the children of God, because it has only its own fallen and sinful
nature. The approximation is all on one side and always in evil,
whatever the appearance may be. To bear testimony in the midst of the
world is another thing.

We cannot therefore plead the secret of the Lord, the intimate
relationship of God's people to Himself, and the feelings they produce;
for the secret and the strength of the Lord are exclusively the right
and the strength of His redeemed people. How could this be told to his
Philistine wife? What influence would the exclusive privileges of God's
people have over one who is not of their number? How can we speak of
these privileges when we disown them by the very relationship in which
we stand? We disown them by imparting this secret; for we then cease to
be separated and consecrated to God, and to confide in Him as we can do
in no other. This experience should have preserved Samson, for the
future, from a similar step. But in many respects experience is useless
in the things of God, because we need faith at the moment; for it is God
Himself whom we need. Nevertheless Samson here still retains his
strength. The sovereign will of God is fulfilled in this matter, in
spite of very serious faults which resulted from the general state of
things in which Samson participated. Once in the battlefield, he
exhibits the strength of Jehovah who was with him; and in answer to his
cry Jehovah supplies him with water for his thirst (chap. 15).

It is here that this general history of Samson ends. We have seen that
the people of God, his brethren, were against him-the general rule in
such a case. It is the history of the power of the Spirit of Christ
exercised in Nazariteship, in separation from the world unto God; but in
the midst of a condition entirely opposed to this separation; and in
which he who is upheld by the power of this Spirit, finding himself
again in his habitual sphere, is always in danger of being unfaithful;
and so much the more so (unless he lives very near to God in the repose
of obedience) from his consciousness of strength.

Christ exhibited the perfection of a heavenly walk under similar
circumstances. We see that no one understood the source of His power, or
His authority. He must have given up all hope of satisfying men with
respect to the principles by which He was guided. They must have been
like Him to comprehend Him, and then they would not have needed to be
convinced. To walk before God and leave His justification with God was
all that could be done. He silenced His enemies by the well-known
principles of God and of all good conscience; but He could not reveal
the secret between Him and the Father, the element of His life, and the
spring of all His actions. If the truth came out, when Satan pushed
things so far that nothing else could be said, His enemies treated Him
as a blasphemer, and He openly denounced them as the children of Satan.
We find this particularly in John's Gospel (see chap. 8). But at that
time Jesus held no longer the same relationship to the people. Indeed,
from the beginning of this Gospel, they are treated as rejected, and the
Person of the Son of God is brought forward.

From the commencement of His ministry, He maintained the place of an
obedient servant, not entering on public service until called of God,
after having taken the lowest place in John's baptism. This was the
point at issue when He was tempted in the wilderness. The tempter
endeavoured to make Him come out of His place as the obedient man,
because He was the Son of God. But the strong man was bound there: to
remain in obedience is the only way to bind the adversary. Christ ever
walked in this perfect separation of the inner man, in communion with
His Father, and entire dependence upon Him in obedience without a single
moment of self-will. Therefore was He the most gracious and accessible
of men: we observe in His ways a tenderness and a kindness never seen in
man, yet we always feel that He was a stranger. Not that He came to be a
stranger in His relationship with men; but that which lay deepest in His
own heart-that which constituted His very nature, and consequently
guided His walk by virtue of His communion with the Father-was entirely
foreign to all that influences man. He abode emphatically alone. It is
striking that not once His disciples understood what He said. The one
only trace of a heart going with Him was Mary at Bethany; and that had
to be told to the whole world. In Him, sympathy for every sorrow; for
His, none.

This spirit of self-denial, entire renunciation of His own will,
obedience, and dependence upon His Father, is seen throughout the life
of Jesus. After John's baptism He was praying when He received the Holy
Ghost. Before calling the apostles He spent the whole night in prayer.
After the miracle of feeding the five thousand with five loaves He went
up into a mountain apart to pray. If the request is made to sit on His
right hand and on His left in His kingdom, it is not His to give, but to
them for whom it is prepared of His Father. In His agony of Gethsemane,
His expectation and dread of death is all laid before His Father; and
the cup which His Father has given Him, shall He not drink it? The
effect is that all is calm before men. He is the Nazarite, separated
from men by His entire communion with His Father, and by the obedience
of a Son who had no other will than to fulfil the good pleasure of His
Father. It was His meat to do the will of Him that sent Him, and to
finish His work.

But it was when man would not receive Him, and there was no longer any
relationship whatever between man and God that Jesus fully assumed His
Nazarite character, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens.
It is Christ in heaven who is the true Nazarite, and who, having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, has sent Him forth
upon His disciples, in order that, by the power of the Holy Ghost, they
might maintain the same position on the earth, through communion with
Him and with His Father; walking in the separateness of this communion,
and capable therefore of using this power with a divine intelligence
that enlightens and sustains the obedience for which they are set apart
unto the glory of Christ, and for His service. "If ye abide in me," said
He to His disciples, "and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you." They were not of the world, even
as He was not of the world. The assembly, which was formed of His
disciples, should walk as separated from the world and set apart unto
Himself in a heavenly life.

Christ is then the antitype of Samson's history, as to the principle it
contains. But its detail proves that this principle of strength has been
entrusted to those who were alas! but too capable of failing in
communion and obedience, and thus of losing its enjoyment.

Note \#1

In this union, when it takes place between the world and true
Christians, or those at least who profess the truth the world always
rules; when, on the contrary, it is with the hierarchy that the world is
connected, it is then a superstitious hierarchy that rules, for this is
necessary in order to restrain the will of man by religious bonds
adapted to the flesh.
