### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001)

The answer which God gives establishes the house as the place in which
He has set His name for ever. His eyes and His heart shall be there
perpetually; but, at the same time, for the enjoyment of the granted
blessing, the dynasty of Solomon, the people of Israel, and even the
house itself, are subjected to the condition of faithfulness to Jehovah
on the part of Solomon and his children. If he, or his posterity, should
turn away to serve other gods, Israel should be cut off; and the house
should become a testimony of the judgment of God to every one that
passed by. We see here to what an extent the fate of Israel hung upon
their king.
