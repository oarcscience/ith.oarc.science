### [Exodus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 19 through 23.

But having thus terminated the course of grace, the scene changes
entirely. They do not keep the feast on the mountain, whither God, as He
had promised, had led them-had "brought them, bearing them, as on
eagles' wings, to himself." He proposes a condition to them: If they
obeyed His voice, they should be His people. The people-instead of
knowing themselves, and saying, "We dare not, though bound to obey,
place ourselves under such a condition, and risk our blessing, yea, make
sure of losing it"-undertake to do all that the Lord had spoken. The
blessing now took the form of dependence, like Adam's, on the
faithfulness of man as well as of God. Still farther was it from being,
as ours, based on a fulfilled and accomplished redemption; it was not
even based on an unconditional promise, as in the case of Abraham \[See
Note \#1\]. The people, however, are not permitted to approach God, who
hid Himself in the darkness. In fact they undertook obedience far from
God, in a state in which they could not approach Him in that majesty to
which obedience was due. Nevertheless God gave all possible solemnity to
the communication of His law, and sees it good that the people should
fear before Him; but what can fear do towards giving power at a distance
from Him? The feeling may, perhaps, be proper; but it is not proper to
undertake to obey in such a state. Terror, and the condition of
obedience when the people are far from God-such is the character of the
law, a rule sent out to man, taken in its largest character, when man
cannot approach God, but a barrier is set up, and the question of
righteousness as the way of life raised and claimed from man when man is
a sinner.

Moses, when God had spoken to the people, and the people dared no more
to hearken, drew near to the thick darkness, and received the
instructions of God for the people-moral and general
instructions-relating to their possession of the land, in case they
should enter upon it according to the covenant of the law. Two things
are pointed out as to worship-the work of man, and his order, in which
his nakedness will certainly be made manifest; and they are equally and
together prohibited by God.

We have (as we may observe by the way) a beautiful type (chap. 21) of
the devotedness of Christ to the church and to His Father, and His love
to us. Having served already faithfully His full service as man, during
His lifetime, He would remain a servant even in death for the sake of
the Father, the church, and His people. He made Himself a servant for
ever. (Compare John 13 for the present time, and Luke 12 even for
glory).

Note \#1

It is important for us to see that our standing before God does not rest
on promise, but on accomplished redemption. All that concerned that and
the basis of our assurance of faith is accomplished promise. Glory is in
hope.
