### [Acts Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md)

A work and a workman of another character begin now to dawn upon the
scene.

We have seen the inveterate opposition of the heads of Israel to the
testimony of the Holy Ghost, their obstinacy in repelling the patient
grace of God. Israel rejected all the work of the God of grace in their
behalf. Saul makes himself the apostle of their hatred to the disciples
of Jesus, to the servants of God. Not content with searching them out at
Jerusalem, he asks for letters from the high priest, that he may go and
lay hands on them in foreign cities. When Israel is in full opposition
to God, he is the ardent missionary of their malice in ignorance, no
doubt, but the willing slave of his Jewish prejudices.

Thus occupied, he approaches Damascus. There, in the full career of an
unbroken will, the Lord Jesus stops him. A light from heaven shines
round about him, and envelopes him in its dazzling brightness. He falls
to the earth, and hears a voice saying unto him, "Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?" The glory which had thrown him to the ground left
no doubt accompanied as it was by that voice that the authority of God
was revealed in it. His will broken, his pride overthrown, his mind
subdued, he asks, "Who art thou, Lord?" The authority of the One who
spoke was unquestionable; Saul's heart was subject to that authority:
and it was Jesus. The career of his self-will was ended for ever. But
moreover the Lord of glory was not only Jesus; He also acknowledged the
poor disciples, whom Saul desired to carry prisoners to Jerusalem, as
being Himself.

How many things were revealed in those few words! The Lord of glory
declared Himself to be Jesus, whom Saul persecuted. The disciples were
one with Himself. The Jews were at open war with the Lord Himself. The
whole system which they maintained, all their law, all their official
authority, all the ordinances of God, had not prevented their being at
open war with the Lord. Saul himself, armed with their authority, found
himself occupied in destroying the name of the Lord and His people from
off the earth: a terrible discovery, completely overwhelming his soul,
all-powerful in its effects, not leaving one moral element of his soul
standing before its strength. Extenuation of the evil was fruitless;
zeal for Judaism was zeal against the Lord. His own conscience had only
animated that zeal. The authorities constituted of God, surrounded with
the halo of centuries of honour, enhanced by the present calamities of
Israel which had now nothing but her religion these authorities had but
sanctioned and favoured his efforts against the Lord. The Jesus whom
they rejected was the Lord. The testimony which they endeavoured to
suppress was His testimony. What a change for Saul! What a new position,
even for the minds of the apostles themselves who remained at Jerusalem,
when all were dispersed faithful indeed in spite of the opposition of
the rulers of Israel, but themselves in connection with the nation.

But the work went deeper yet. Misguided no doubt, but his conscience in
itself for he thought he ought to do many things against the name of
Jesus of Nazareth left him the enemy of the Lord. Blameless
righteousness according to law, as man could measure it, more than left
him hardened in open opposition to the Lord. His superiors, and the
authorities of the ancient religion all his soul was based on morally as
well as religiously all was smashed within him for ever. He was broken
up in the whole man before God. Nothing remained in him but discovered
enmity against God, save as his own will was also broken in the process,
he who an hour before was the conscientious, blameless, religious man!
Compare, though the revelation of Christ carried him much farther, [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md); Philippians 3; [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md); [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); and a multitude of passages.

Other important points are brought out here. Saul had not known Jesus on
earth. He had not a testimony because he had known Him from the
beginning, declaring that He was made Lord and Christ. It is not a Jesus
who goes up into heaven where He is out of sight; but the Lord who
appears to him for the first time in heaven, and who announces to him
that He is Jesus. A glorious Lord is the only one whom he knows. His
gospel (as he expresses it himself) is the gospel of the glory. If he
had known Christ after the flesh, he knows Him thus no more. But there
is yet another important principle found here. The Lord of glory has His
members on earth. "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest." It was Himself:
those poor disciples were bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh. He
looked upon them and cherished them as His own flesh. The glory and the
oneness of the saints with Jesus, their Head in heaven, are the truths
connected with the conversion of Saul, with the revelation of Jesus to
him, with the creation of faith in his heart, and that in a way which
overthrew Judaism in all its bearings in his soul; and that in a soul in
which this Judaism formed an integral part of its existence, and gave it
its whole character.

Another point, borrowed from his account of the vision later in the
book, which is remarkable in connection with his career: "Separating
thee," says the Lord, "from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I
now send thee." This moral end of Saul separated him from both of course
from the Jews, but did not make a Gentile of him either and united him
with a glorified Christ. He was neither a Jew nor a Gentile in his
spiritual standing. All his life and ministry flowed from his
association with a heavenly glorified Christ.

Nevertheless he comes into the assembly by the usual means like Jesus in
Israel humbly taking his place there where the truth of God was
established by His power. Blind for three days and fully engrossed as
was natural with such a discovery, he neither eats nor drinks; and
afterwards, besides the fact of his blindness, which was a quiet,
continual, and unequivocal proof of the truth of that which had happened
to him, his faith must have been confirmed by the arrival of Ananias,
who can declare to him from the Lord that which had happened to him,
although he had not been out of the city a circumstance so much the more
striking because, in a vision, Saul had seen him come and restore his
sight. And this Ananias does: Saul receives sight, and is baptised. He
takes food and is strengthened. The conversation of Jesus with Ananias
is remarkable, as shewing with what distinct evidence the Lord revealed
Himself in those days, and the holy liberty and confidence with which
the true and faithful disciple conVersed with Him. The Lord speaks as a
man to his friend in details of place and circumstances, and Ananias
reasons in all confiding openness with the Lord in regard to Saul; and
Jesus answers him, not in harsh authority, though of course Ananias had
to obey, but with gracious explanation, as with one admitted to His
confidence, by declaring that Saul is a chosen vessel to bear His name
before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel; and that He will
shew him how great things he must suffer for His sake.

Saul makes no delay in confessing and declaring his faith; and that
which he says is eminently worthy of notice. He preaches in the
synagogue that Jesus is the Son of God. It is the first time that this
is done. That He was exalted to the right hand of God that He was Lord
and Christ had been already preached; the rejected Messiah was exalted
on high. But here it is the simple doctrine as to His personal glory;
Jesus is the Son of God.

In the words of Jesus to Ananias, the children of Israel come last.

Saul does not yet begin his public ministry. It is, so to speak, only
the expression of his personal faithfulness, his zeal, his faith, among
those that surrounded him, with whom he was naturally connected. It was
not long before opposition manifested itself, in the nation that would
have no Christ, at least according to God, and the disciples sent him
away, letting him down by the wall in a basket; and through the agency
of Barnabas (a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith, whom
grace had taught to value the truth with regard to the new disciple) the
dreaded Saul found his place among the disciples even at Jerusalem.
\[See Note \#16\] Wonderful triumph of the Lord! Singular position for
himself there, had he not been absorbed by the thought of Jesus. At
Jerusalem he reasons with the Hellenists. He was one of them. The
Hebrews were not his natural sphere. They seek to put him to death; the
disciples bring him down to the sea, and send him to Tarsus, the place
of his birth. The triumph of grace has, under God's hand, silenced the
adversary. The assemblies are left in peace, and edify themselves
walking in the fear of God and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, the two
great elements of blessing; and their numbers increase. Persecution
accomplishes the designs of God. The peace which He grants gives
opportunity for ripening in grace and in the knowledge of Himself. We
learn the ways and government of God in the midst of the imperfection of
man.

Peace being established through the goodness of God sole resource of
those who truly wait upon Him in submission to His will Peter passes
throughout all parts of Israel. The Spirit of God relates this
circumstance here, between the conversion of Saul and his apostolic
work, to shew us, I doubt not, the apostolic energy in Peter existing at
the very time when the call of the new apostle was to bring in new
light, and a work that was new in many important respects (thus
sanctioning as His own work, and in its place, that which had been done
before, whatever progress in accomplishment His counsels might make);
and in order to shew us the introduction of the Gentiles into the
assembly as it was at first founded by His grace in the beginning,
preserving thus its unity, and putting His seal upon this work of
heavenly grace.

The assembly existed. The doctrine of her oneness, as the body of
Christ, outside the world, was not yet made known.The reception of
Cornelius did not announce it, although paving its way.

Note \#16

This was, it would appear, later, but is noticed here to put him, so to
speak, in his place among Christians.
