### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 4 through 31.

As to the friends of Job, they do not call for any extended remarks.
They urge the doctrine that God's earthly government is a full measure
and manifestation of His righteousness, and of the righteousness of man,
which would correspond with it: a doctrine which proves a total
ignorance of what God's righteousness is, and of His ways; as well as
the absence of all real knowledge of what God is, or man as a sinner. We
do not see either that the feelings of their hearts were influenced by
communion with God. Their argument is a false and cold estimate of the
exact justice of His government as an adequate manifestation of His
relationship with man, though they say many true commonplace things
which even the Spirit of God adopts as just. Although Job was not before
God in his estimate of himself, he judges rightly in these respects. He
shews that although God shews His disapprobation of the wicked, yet the
circumstances in which they are often found overthrow the arguments of
his friends. We see in Job a heart which, although rebellious, depends
upon God, and would rejoice to find Him. We see, too, that when he can
extricate himself, by a few words, from his friends, who, he is quite
sensible, understands nothing of his case, nor of the dealings of God,
he turns to God (although he does not find Him, and although he
complains that His hand is heavy upon him), as in that beautiful and
touching chapter 23, and the reasonings as to divine government,
chapters 24, 21. That is to say, we see one who has tasted that God is
gracious, whose heart, wounded indeed and unsubdued, yet claims those
qualities for God-because it knows Him-which the cold reasonings of his
friends could not ascribe to Him; a heart which complains bitterly of
God, but which knows that, could it once come near Him, it would find
Him all that it had declared Him to be, and not such as they had
declared Him to be, or were themselves-could he find Him, he would not
be as they were, He would put words in his mouth; a heart which repelled
indignantly the accusation of hypocrisy; for Job was conscious that he
looked to God, and that he had known God and acted with reference to
Him, though God thought fit to bring his sin to remembrance.
