### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md)

It is rather, to my mind, the house of Solomon that prefigures the
church, as such, in connection with Christ; the temple, the Father's
house on high, where we are brought to dwell. "We are his house"; as the
house of the forest of Lebanon prefigures His glory among the Gentiles.
The porch of judgment characterises this glorious reign. The glory was
not all on the outside. The inner court was equally beautiful. The glory
was not hidden either. The outer court, as well as the inner, exhibited
His royal glory who built the whole. It was the same thing also towards
the great outer court. Thus even the great court, as well as the inner
court of the house of Jehovah, was built with costly stones and with
cedar. The house itself had its peculiar glory. Everything manifested
the glory, the riches, and the power of the great king. With respect to
this outward glory, Pharaoh's daughter had a house similar to the
king's. This outward glory of the walls, of the courts of Jehovah, of
the king's house, and of all the others, exhibits the connection between
these things in Christ in the day of His manifested glory.

The vessels of Jehovah's house were made on a much larger scale then
those of the tabernacle; but they were the same, although greater in
number. The only new things were the pillars, Jachin and Boaz; that is
to say, "He will establish," and, "in Him is strength" (names which make
the meaning of these pillars evident). I doubt not that the passage in
[Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md) alludes to these pillars. We
find here also the union of Jews and Gentiles recognised; and the latter
employed in the work for the temple of Jehovah.

The ark is not altered. It was put in the temple, which was but a house
for its reception, as the seat of His presence who dwelt between the
cherubim. As to the token of God's presence, and of the establishment of
His throne on the earth, the ark had entered into its rest, as well as
Jehovah whose seat it was (compare [Psa
132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008).md).
