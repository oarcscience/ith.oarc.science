### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)

Elisha goes also beyond the borders of Israel in dispensing the blessing
of which he is the instrument; and, when the king of Israel is troubled
at Naaman's coming, Elisha heals the leprosy of this Gentile, who is
brought to acknowledge Jehovah, the God of Israel, as the only true God.
The Lord Jesus points out the sovereign grace of God on this occasion,
which, overstepping the narrow limits of Israel, and, owning no longer
their rights, acts towards the Gentiles in the way of election.

As it has been frequently remarked, the means used were simple, and
humbling to the flesh and to the pride of man, having their efficacy in
full apprehension of, and full submission of heart and faith to, death,
which is become life unto man, and that which heals him and cleanses him
from sin. The man who was the most closely connected with Elisha, a prey
to covetousness, suffers the painful consequences of a hardened heart;
and that from which the Gentile had been freed comes irremediably upon
him. Such is the position of Israel, outwardly nearer to Jehovah, but
morally afar from Him.
