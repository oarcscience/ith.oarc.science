### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)

In chapter 16 Jehovah teaches Jeremiah to avoid all family relationships
with this people, and to cease from all testimonies of interest in what
was going on among them. For He Himself had entirely broken off with
them, and would cause all His testimonies to cease among them, and would
drive them out of the land. But, after all, through the greatness of the
evil which He would bring upon them, He would cause their deliverance
out of Egypt to be forgotten in their yet greater deliverance from this
evil. For at length God will pardon and comfort His people But before
this He will recompense their iniquity. Afterwards the Gentiles
themselves shall come and acknowledge the true God, the God of Israel.
