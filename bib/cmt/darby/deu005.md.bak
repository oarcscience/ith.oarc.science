### [Deuteronomy Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 5, 6, and 7.

In chapter 5 Moses reminds them of the ten commandments given in Horeb;
and it is to be remarked, that the deliverance out of Egypt (not the
rest of God after the work of creation) is the reason he gives for the
sabbath: it became a sign of His covenant with Israel (compare Ezek.
20). These were the basis of a regular covenant; and God here, as we
have seen, governs the people in the land of promise according to their
responsibility, as a jealous God. Mercy, beyond law, only comes in in
chapter 30. There had been mercy (chap. 10) in giving them back the law,
and placing them under sparing mercy Still. These chapters give us the
great principles of God's government in the land; chapters 12-29 the
terms of it.

He reminds them of their fear in the presence of the Lord engages them,
in chapter 6, to love God with all their heart, and exhorts them to
remember His words in every way, and to keep them, when they should
enjoy the land, having nothing to do with other gods. When they should
have cast out their enemies, as Jehovah had spoken, and when their
children should ask the meaning of the ordinances, they were to tell
them of the deliverances and of the signs wrought in Egypt.

They were to destroy every vestige of false gods, being a people holy to
Jehovah. Nor did God set His love upon them on account of their own
importance, but because of the election and love of God. He assures them
that their faithfulness would also be the channel of blessing, for God
would recompense them according to their ways. Neither ought they to
fear, after all the signs they had seen. Thus they were a people
separate to Jehovah. As to Him all was sovereign grace, but sure
faithfulness. As to them the ground they were on was the government of
God; hence all then depended on their holding fast to Jehovah, and
faithful obedience.
