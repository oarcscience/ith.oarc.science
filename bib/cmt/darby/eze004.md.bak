### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

Besides the general judgment that God pronounced upon the condition of
Israel, Jerusalem-on whom lay all the iniquity of the people now come to
its height-appears before God whom she had despised. The prophet, in
representing the siege of Jerusalem, was also to point out the years of
iniquity that had led to this judgment: for Israel in general, 390; for
Judah, 40. It is certain that these dates do not refer to the duration
of the kingdom of Israel apart from Judah, nor to that of Judah, because
the kingdom of Israel only lasted about 254 years, while that of Judah
continued about 134 years after the fall of Samaria. It would appear
that the longer period mentioned is reckoned from the separation of the
ten tribes under Rehoboam, counting the years as those of Israel,
because from that moment Israel had a separate existence, and comprised
the great body of the nation; while Judah was everything during the
reign of Solomon, which lasted forty years. After his reign Judah would
be comprised in the general name of Israel according to Ezekiel's usual
habit, although on certain occasions he distinguishes them on account of
the position of Zedekiah and of God's future dealings. The reason for
using this name of Israel for the whole is plain enough, namely, that
the captivity had placed the whole nation in the same condition and
under one common judgment, and Israel was the name of the whole people.
The entire nation was now set aside, and a Gentile kingdom established.
Judah is sometimes distinguished, because there was still a remnant at
Jerusalem-judged indeed yet more severely than the mass, but which
nevertheless existed, and which will have distinct circumstances in
their history until the last days. The same thing happens in the New
Testament. In the language of the apostles the twelve tribes are
blended. Nevertheless, as a matter of history, the Jews-that is to say,
those of Judah-are always distinct. In the main, Ezekiel prophesied
under the same circumstances. Hence, in part, as we have said, his title
of "son of man," given also to Daniel, as well as that of "man greatly
beloved." The man of power was Nebuchadnezzar. But he who represented
the race before God was an Ezekiel, as the man of desire was a Daniel, a
man beloved of God. With respect to the date, it is certain that the 390
years are almost exactly the time of Israel's duration from the death of
Solomon to the destruction of the temple. Some persons have wished to
reckon the forty years of Judah from Josiah's passover down to the same
period, supposing that the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar
took place four or five years after the captivity of Zedekiah; but this
was not the case-it was a month later in the same year. Jehoiachin was
carried into captivity in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012).md). Zedekiah reigned eleven years
([Jer 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001).md). In the nineteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzar-adan burnt the house of Jehovah, and, reading
from [Eze 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md), we see that it was a
month after in the same year. In taking the forty years of Judah to be
the reign of Solomon, it would be saying that Israel had done nothing
but sin ever since the establishment of the kingdom, for it was only in
the days of Solomon that there was a peaceful reign. David founded the
kingdom. The responsibility of his family began with Solomon (2 Samuel
7).
