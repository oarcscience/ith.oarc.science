Introduction to Exodus

In the Book of Exodus we have, as the general and characteristic
subject, the deliverance and redemption of the people of God, and their
establishment as a people before Him, whether under the law, or under
the government of God in longsuffering-of a God who, having so brought
them to Himself, provided for His unfaithful people; not indeed entrance
into His own presence, but a way of approaching Him, at least at a
distance, although they had failed. But the veil was unrent: God did not
come out to them, nor could they go in to God. And this is of all
possible importance, and characteristic of the difference of
Christianity. God did come amongst sinful men in love in Christ, and man
is gone in to God, in righteousness, and withal the veil is rent from
top to bottom. The law required from man what man ought to be as a child
of Adam; life was put as the consequence of keeping it, and there was a
curse for him if it was not kept. God's relationship with the people had
at first been in grace; but this did not continue, and the people never
entered thereinto with intelligence, nor understood this grace like
persons who stood in need of it as sinners. Let us examine the course of
these divine instructions.
