### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#001.md)

We find here again in a figure the principle with which Israel's
deliverance, and that of all men, is connected-a principle pointed out
in Elisha, and accomplished in Jesus. Hezekiah is raised as from the
dead. He had been sick unto death; but Jehovah heard his prayer, and, on
his humiliation, revokes the sentence which He had pronounced through
Isaiah.

But man can scarcely bear exaltation. Blessed of Jehovah he boasts
himself of that which he has received. After having displayed all his
riches to the ambassadors of the king of Babylon, who were sent to
congratulate him on his recovery, he is warned that they shall all be
carried away even to Babylon The king of Babylon felt, perhaps, some
satisfaction in allying himself with one who had not yielded to the
power of the king of Assyria; but the world's wisdom, which cultivates
profitable connections with the people of God, is always a snare to them
Hezekiah might have made known the source and giver of all this; but he
acted as a man. Nevertheless he submits graciously and humbly to the
word of Jehovah, which was spoken to him on this occasion.

But, at this period, the people had deeply corrupted themselves, and the
impulse which God had given disappeared entirely with the man in whom it
acted. The son of Hezekiah was a model of wickedness. God was about to
transfer power to the Gentiles; and, even while making it manifest that
certain blessing attended faithfulness and trust in Himself, He allowed
the house of David to give themselves up to debasement.
