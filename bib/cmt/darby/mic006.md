### [Micah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)

After having thus declared the counsels of God in grace, the Spirit
returns to His pleadings with Israel in respect of their moral
condition, calling the whole earth as audience to hear His controversy;
for Jehovah had a controversy with His people. In a touching appeal to
their heart and conscience He asks what they could have against Him. He
had redeemed them from Egypt, had led them by the hands of Moses, Aaron,
and Miriam; He had refused to hearken to Balak and Balaam, who had done
their utmost to curse Israel. If they would but consider, they would
know His faithfulness. After this He lays before them, in detail, the
universal wickedness that reigned among them, contrasting their
ceremonies with practical righteousness: therefore also the judgment
must surely fall upon them ([Mic
6:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#013)). Still the man of wisdom
would know it as the discipline of Jehovah, and see Jehovah's name in
it-a deeply important and also precious principle. They bore the
reproach of His people.
