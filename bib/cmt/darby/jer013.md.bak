### [Jeremiah Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md)

Chapter 13, bringing to mind how God had bound Israel to His heart,
announces the terrible judgment with which the people shall, as it were,
be drunken; and, on the ground of this judgment, calls them to
repentance. He relates their hopeless evil, and the unfeigned grief of
the prophet at their obstinacy. Compare [Luk
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md). This zeal for Jehovah's glory
against the evil and the people who dishonoured Him, and touching
affection to them as Jehovah's people, is everywhere a striking mark of
the working of the Spirit of Christ. Compare Moses ([Exo
32:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027.md); [Exo
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031), and sequel.md); so Paul (Romans 9;
[Th1 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015).md): only here, under grace,
there is no call for judgment; so even Christ Himself (compare [Mat
23:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031).md).
