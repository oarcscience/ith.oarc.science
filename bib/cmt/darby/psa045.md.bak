### [Psalms Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md)

Psalm 45 introduces Messiah, and, as we shall see, changes everything. I
know not, interesting and full of bright energy as the psalm is, that I
have much to note upon it, by reason of its force being so very plain.
It will be remarked that it is Messiah in judgment and taking the
throne. He had already proved that He loved righteousness and hated
iniquity was fit to govern. He is saluted as God. Yet His disciples (the
remnant) are called His fellows (compare [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md), where He is seen in His
humiliation and smitten, but owned to be Jehovah's fellow). I apprehend
the queen is Jerusalem. Tyre and others own her with presents. She is
gloriously received into the chambers of the king himself. This, I
apprehend, is the force of within. She is in the closest relationship
with the king. The virgins her companions are, I suppose, the cities of
Judah. The glory of Israel is no longer now their fathers. The presence
of Messiah (the fulfiller of promise) has eclipsed the depositaries of
promise of old. Instead of fathers, they have children to be made
princes in all lands. The coming in of Messiah in glory and judgment,
brings in the full triumph and glory, amongst the nations, of Jerusalem
and the Jewish people. The psalm is full of Messiah, and exclusively,
yet as man, and God is only alluded to as his God. But Messiah is God.
