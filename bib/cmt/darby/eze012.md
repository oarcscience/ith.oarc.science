### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001)

Chapter 12 announces the fight and the capture of Zedekiah, who would be
carried to Babylon though he would. not see it. All the force of Judah
would be dispersed, and the land laid desolate; a small remnant of
captives would declare among the heathen the abominations which had
brought the judgment; and the judgment was soon to come, for God's
patience with His people had led to the unbelieving comment that God
would not interfere, but now the effect of His words would not be
delayed.
