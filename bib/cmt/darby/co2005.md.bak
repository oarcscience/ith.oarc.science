### [2 Corinthians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)

What then is the effect of the possession of life in Christ as applied
to death and judgment, the two natural objects of men's fears, the fruit
of sin? If our bodies are not yet transformed; and if that which is
mortal is not yet swallowed up, we are equally full of confidence,
because, being formed for glory, and Christ (who has manifested the
victorious power that opened the path of heaven to Him) being our life,
if we should leave this tabernacle and be absent from the body before we
are clothed upon with the glory, this life remains untouched; it has
already in Jesus triumphed over all these effects of the power of death.
We should be present with the Lord; for we walk by faith, not by the
sight of these excellent things. Therefore we prefer to be absent from
the body, and to be present with the Lord. For this reason we seek to be
well-pleasing to Him, whether we are found absent from this body, or
present in this body, when Christ shall come to take us to Himself and
make us share His glory. And this leads on to the second point judgment.
For we must all be manifested before the tribunal of Christ, in order
that each may receive according to that which he shall have done in the
body, be it good or evil. A happy and precious thought, after all,
solemn as it may be; for, if we have really understood grace, if we are
standing in grace, if we know what God is, all love for us, all light
for us, we shall like to be in the full light. It is a blessed
deliverance to be in it. It is a burden, an encumbrance, to have
anything concealed, and although we have had much sin in us that no one
knows (perhaps even some that we have committed, and which it would be
no profit for any one to know), it is a comfort if we know the perfect
love of God that all should be in perfect light since He is there. This
is the case by faith and for faith, wherever there is solid peace: we
are before God as He is, and as we are all sin in ourselves alas! except
so far as He has wrought in us by quickening us; and He is all love in
this light in which we are placed; for God is light, and He reveals
Himself. Without the knowledge of grace, we fear the light: it cannot be
otherwise. But knowing grace, knowing that sin has been put away as
regards the glory of God, and that the offence is no longer before His
eyes, we like to be in the light, it is joy to us, it is that which the
heart needs, without which it cannot be satisfied, when there is the
life of the new man. Its nature is to love the light, to love purity in
all that perfection which does not admit the evil of darkness, which
shuts out all that is not itself. Now to be thus in the light, and to be
manifested, is the same thing, for the light makes everything manifest.
We are in the light by faith when the conscience is in the presence of
God. We shall be according to the perfection of that light when we
appear before the tribunal of Christ. I have said that it is a solemn
thing and so it is, for everything is judged according to that light;
but it is that which the heart loves, because thanks to our God! we are
light in Christ. But there is more than this. When the Christian is thus
manifested, he is already glorified, and, perfectly like Christ, has
then no remains of the evil nature in which he sinned. And he now can
look back at all the way God has led him in grace, helped, lifted up,
kept from falling, not withdrawn His eyes from the righteous. He knows
as he is known. What a tale of grace and mercy! If I look back now, my
sins do not rest on my conscience; though I have horror of them, they
are put away behind God's back. I am the righteousness of God in Christ,
but what a sense of love and patience, and goodness and grace! How much
more perfect then, when all is before me! Surely there is great gain as
to light and love, in giving an account of ourselves to God; and not a
trace remains of the evil in us. We are like Christ. If a person fears
to have all out thus before God, I do not believe he is free in soul as
to righteousness being the righteousness of God in Christ, not fully in
the light. And we have not to be judged for anything: Christ has put it
all away. But there is another idea in the passage retribution. The
apostle does not speak of judgment on persons, because the saints are
included, and Christ has stood in their place for all that regards the
judgment of their persons: "There is no condemnation for those who are
in Christ." They do not come into judgment. But they shall be manifested
before His tribunal, and receive that which they have done in the body.
The good deserves nothing: they received that by which they have wrought
what is good grace produced it in them; nevertheless they shall receive
its reward. What they have done is counted as their own act. If, by
neglecting grace and the witness of the Spirit in them, the fruits which
He would have produced have been turned aside, they will bear the
consequences. It is not that, in this case, God will have forsaken them;
it is not that the Holy Ghost will not act in them with regard to the
condition they are in; but it will be in their conscience that He acts,
judging the flesh which has prevented the man's bearing the natural
fruit of His presence and operation in the new man. So that the Holy
Ghost will have done all that is necessary with respect to their state
of heart; and the perfect counsel of God with regard to the person will
have been accomplished, His patience manifested, His wisdom, His ways in
governing, the care which He deigns to take of each one individually in
His most condescending love. Each one will have his place, as it was
prepared for him of the Father. But the natural fruit of the presence
and operation of the Holy Ghost in a soul which has (or, according to
the advantages it has enjoyed, ought to have had) a certain measure of
light, will not have been produced. It will be seen what it was that
prevented. It will judge, according to the judgment of God, all that was
good and evil in itself, with a solemn reverence for that which God is,
and a fervent adoration on account of what He has been for us. The
perfect light will be appreciated; the ways of God known and understood
in all their perfection, by the application of the perfect light to the
whole course of our life and of His dealings with us, in which we shall
thoroughly recognise that love perfect, sovereign above all things has
reigned, with ineffable grace. Thus the majesty of God will have been
maintained by His judgment, at the same time that the perfection and
tenderness of His dealings will be the eternal recollection of our
souls. Light without cloud or darkness will be understood in its own
perfection. To understand it is to be in it and to enjoy it. And light
is God Himself. How wonderful to be thus manifested! What love is that
which in its perfect wisdom, in its marvellous ways overruling all evil,
could bring such beings as we are to enjoy this unclouded light beings
knowing good and evil (the natural prerogative of those only of whom God
can say "one of us"), under the yoke of the evil which they knew, and
driven out by a bad conscience from the presence of God, to whom that
knowledge belonged, having testimony enough in their conscience as to
the judgment of God, to make them avoid Him and be miserable, but
nothing to draw them to Him who alone could find a remedy! What love and
holy wisdom which could bring such to the source of good, of pure
happiness, in whom the power of good repels absolutely the evil which it
judges! With regard to the unrighteous, at the judgment-day they will
have to answer personally for their sins, under a responsibility which
rests entirely on themselves. However great the happiness of being in
the perfect light (and this happiness is complete and divine in its
character), it is on the side of conscience that the subject is here
presented. God maintains His majesty by the judgment which He executes,
as it is written, "The Lord is known by the judgment that he executeth":
there, in His government of the world; here, final, eternal, and
personal judgment. And, for my part, I believe that it is very
profitable for the soul to have the judgment of God present to our
minds, and the sense of the unchangeable majesty of God maintained in
the conscience by this means. If we were not under grace, it would be it
ought to be insupportable; but the maintenance of this sentiment does
not contradict grace. It is indeed only under grace that it can be
maintained in its truth; for who otherwise could bear the thought, for
an instant, of receiving that which he had done in the body? None but he
who is completely blinded. But the authority, the holy authority of God,
which asserts itself in judgment, forms a part of our relationship with
Him; the maintenance of this sentiment, associated with the full
enjoyment of grace, a part of our holy spiritual affections. It is the
fear of the Lord. It is in this sense, that "Happy is he who feareth
always." If this weakens the conviction that the love of God rests
fully, eternally, upon us, then we get off the only possible ground of
any relation whatever with God, unless perdition could be so called.
But, in the sweet and peaceful atmosphere of grace, conscience maintains
its rights and its authority against the subtle encroachments of the
flesh, through the sense of God's judgment, in virtue of a holiness
which cannot be separated from the character of God without denying that
there is a God: for if there is a God, He is holy. This sentiment
engages the heart of the accepted believer, to endeavour to please the
Lord in every way; and, in the sense of how solemn a thing it is for a
sinner to appear before God, the love that necessarily accompanies it in
a believer's heart urges him to persuade men with a view to their
salvation, while maintaining his own conscience in the light. And he who
is now walking in the light, whose conscience reflects that light, will
not fear it in the day when it shall appear in its glory. We must be
manifested; but, walking in the light in the sense of the fear of God,
realising His judgment of evil, we are already manifested to God:
nothing hinders the sweet and assured flow of His love. Accordingly the
walk of such a one justifies itself in the end to the consciences of
others; one is manifested as walking in the light. These are therefore
the two great practical principles of the ministry: to walk in the
light, in the sense of God's solemn judgment for every one; and, the
conscience being thus pure in the light, the sense of the judgment
(which in this case cannot trouble the soul for itself, or obscure its
view of the love of God) impels the heart to seek in love those who are
in danger of this judgment. This connects itself with the doctrine of
Christ, the Saviour, through His death upon the cross; and the love of
Christ constrains us, because we see that, if one died for all, it is
that all were dead. This was the universal condition of souls. The
apostle seeks them in order that they may live unto God by Christ. But
this goes farther. First, as regards fallen man's lot, death is gain.
The saint, if absent from the body, is present with the Lord. As to
judgment, he owns the solemnity of it, but it does not make him tremble.
He is in Christ will be like Christ; and Christ, before whom he is to
appear, has put away all the sins he had to be judged for. The effect is
the sanctifying one of bringing him fully manifested into the presence
of God now. But it stimulates his love as to others, nor is it only by
fear of judgment to come for them; Christ's love constrains him love
manifested in death. But this proves more than the acts of sin which
bring judgment: Christ died because all were dead. The Spirit of God
goes to the source and spring of their whole condition, their state, not
merely the fruits of an evil nature all were dead. We find the same
important instruction in [Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md),
"He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath
everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment \[that which applies
to sins\] , but is passed from death unto life"; he has come out of the
whole state and condition, as an already lost one, into another and
different one in Christ. This is a very important aspect of the truth.
And the distinction, largely developed in Romans, is found in many
passages. The work of manifestation before God in the light is already
true, in so far as we have realised the light. Cannot I, being now in
peace, look back at what I was before conversion, and at all my failures
since my conversion, humbled but adoring the grace of God in all He has
done for me, but without a thought of fear, or imputation of sin? Does
not this awaken a very deep sense of all that God is in holy grace and
love, in unbounded patience towards me, both keeping and helping and
restoring? Such will be the case perfectly when we are manifested, when
we shall know as we are known. That this point may be still more clear,
for it is an important one, let me add some further observations here.
What we find in this passage is the perfect manifestation of all that a
person is and has been before a throne characterised by judgment,
without judgment as to the person in question being guilty. No doubt
when the wicked receives the things done in the body, he is condemned.
But it is not said "judged" here, because all then must be condemned.
But this manifestation is exactly what brings all morally before the
heart, when it is capable of judging evil for itself: were it under
judgment, it could not. Freed from all fear, and in the perfect light
and with the comfort of perfect love (for where we have the conscience
of sin, and of its not being imputed, we have the sense, though in a
humbling way, of perfect love), and at the same time the sense of
authority and divine government fully made good in the soul, all is
judged by the soul itself as God judges it, and communion with Himself
entered into. This is exceedingly precious. We have to remember that, at
our appearing before the judgment-seat of Christ, we are already
glorified. Christ has come Himself in perfect love to fetch us; and has
changed our vile body according to the resemblance of His glorious body.
We are glorified and like Christ before the judgment takes place. And
mark the effect on Paul. Does the thought of being manifested awaken
anxiety or dread? Not the least. He realises all the solemnity of such a
process. He knows the terror of the Lord; he has it before his eyes; and
what is the consequence? He sets about to persuade others who are in
need of it. There are, so to speak, two parts in God's nature and
character: His righteousness, which judges everything; and His perfect
love. These are one for us in Christ, ours in Christ. If indeed we
realise what God is, both will have their place: but the believer in
Christ is the righteousness which God, from His very nature, must have
before Him on His throne, if we are to be with Him and enjoy Him. But
the Christ, in the judgment-seat, before whom we are, is our
righteousness. He judges by the righteousness which He is; but we are
that righteousness, the righteousness of God in Him. Hence this point
can raise no question in the soul, will make us adore such grace, but
can raise no question, only enhance the sense we have of grace
ourselves, make us understand it, as suited to man as he is, and feel
the solemn and awful consequences of not having part in it, since there
is such a judgment. Hence that other and indeed essential part of the
divine nature, love, will work in us towards others; and, knowing the
terror of the Lord, we shall persuade men. Thus Paul (it is conscience
in view of that most solemn moment) possessed the righteousness which he
saw in the Judge, for that which judged was His righteousness; but then
he consequently seeks others earnestly, according to the work which had
thus brought him near to God, to which he then turns ([Co2
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013).md). But this view of judgment
and our complete manifestation in that day, has a present effect on the
saint according to its own nature. He realises it by faith. He is
manifested. He does not fear being manifested. It will unfold all God's
past ways towards him when he is in glory; but he is manifested now to
God, his conscience exercised in the light. It has thus a present
sanctifying power. Observe here the assemblage of powerful motives, of
pre-eminently important principles; contradictory in appearance, but
which, to a soul which walks in light, instead of clashing and
destroying each other, unite to give its complete and thoroughly
furnished character to the christian minister and ministry. First of
all, the glory, in such a power of life, that he who realises it does
not desire death, because he sees in the power of life in Christ that
which can absorb whatever in him is mortal, and he sees it with the
certainty of enjoying it such a consciousness of possessing this life
(God having formed him for it, and given him the earnest of the Spirit),
that death if it arrive to him is but a happy absence from the body in
order to be present with the Lord. Now the thought of ascending to
Christ gives the desire of being acceptable to Him, and presents Him
(the second motive or principle that gives a form to this ministry) as
the Judge who will render to every one that which he has done. The
solemn thought of how much this judgment is to be feared takes
possession of the apostle's heart. What a difference between this
thought and the "building of God," for which he was waiting with
certainty! Nevertheless this thought does not alarm him; but, in the
solemn sense of the reality of that judgment, it impels him to persuade
others. But here a third principle comes in, the love of Christ with
reference to the condition of those whom Paul sought to persuade. Since
this love of Christ's shews itself in His death, there is in it the
witness that all were already dead and lost. Thus we have here set
before us glory, with the personal certainty of enjoying it, and death
become the means of being present with the Lord; the tribunal of Christ,
and the necessity of being manifested before it; and the love of Christ
in His death, all being already dead. How are such diverse principles as
these to be reconciled and arranged in the heart? It is that the apostle
was manifested to God. Hence the thought of being manifested before the
tribunal produced, along with the present sanctification, no other
effect on him than that of solemnity, for he was not to come into
judgment; but it became an urgent motive for preaching to others,
according to the love which Christ had manifested in His death. The idea
of the tribunal did not in the least weaken his certainty of glory.
\[See Note \#5\] His soul, in the full light of God, reflected what was
in that light, namely, the glory of Christ ascended on high as man. And
the love of this same Jesus was strengthened in its active operation in
him by the sense of the tribunal which awaits all men. What a marvellous
combination of motives we find in this passage, to form a ministry
characterised by the development of all that in which God reveals
Himself, and by which He acts on the heart and conscience of man! And it
is in a pure conscience that these things can have their force together.
If the conscience were not pure, the tribunal would obscure the glory,
at least as belonging to oneself, and weaken the sense of His love. At
any rate one would be occupied with self in connection with these
things, and ought to be so. But when pure before God, it only sees a
tribunal which excites no sense of personal uneasiness, and therefore
has all its true moral effect, as an additional motive for seriousness
in our walk, and a solemn energy in the appeal which the known love of
Jesus impels it to address to man. As to how far our own relations with
God enter into the service which we have to render to others, the
apostle adds another thing that characterised his walk, and that was the
result of the death and resurrection of Christ. He lived in an entirely
new sphere, in a new creation, which had left behind, as in another
world, all that belonged to a natural existence in the flesh here below.
The proof that Christ had died for all proved that all were dead; and
that He died for all in order that those who live should live no longer
to themselves but to Him who died for them and rose again. They are in
connection with this new order of things in which Christ exists as
risen. Death is on everything else. Everything is shut up under death.
If I live, I live in a new order of things, in a new creation, of which
Christ is the type and the head. Christ, so far as in connection with
this world below, is dead. He might have been known as the Messiah,
living on the earth, and in connection with promises made to men living
on the earth in the flesh. The apostle no longer knew Him thus. In fact
Christ, as bearing that character, was dead; and now, being risen, He
has taken a new and a heavenly character. Therefore if any one is in
Christ, he belongs to this new creation, he is of the new creation. He
belongs no more at all to the former; the old things have passed away;
all things are I become new. The system is not the fruit of human nature
and of sin, like all that surrounds us here below, according to the I
flesh. Already, looked at as a system existing morally before God, in
this new creation, all things are of God. All that is found in it is of
God, of Him who has reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ. We live in
an order of things, a world, a new creation, entirely of God. We are
there in peace, because God, who is its centre and its source, has
reconciled us to Himself. We enjoy it, because we are new creatures in
Christ; and everything in this new world is of Him, and corresponds with
that new nature. He had also committed to the apostle a ministry of
reconciliation, according to the order of things into which he had been
himself introduced. Being reconciled, and knowing it by the revelation
of God who had accomplished it for him, he proclaimed a reconciliation,
the effect of which he was enjoying . All this flowed from an immense
and all-powerful truth. God was in Christ. But then, in order that
others might have a part with him, and the apostle be the minister of
this, it was also necessary that Christ should be made sin for us. One
of these truths presents the character in which God has drawn nigh to
us, the other, the efficacy of that which has been wrought for the
believer. Here is the first of these truths, in connection with the
apostle's ministry, which form the subject of these Chapters. God was in
Christ (that is to say, when Christ was on earth). The day of judgment
had not been waited for. God had come down in love into the world
alienated from Him. Such was Christ. Three things were connected with
and characterised this great and essential truth: reconciling the world,
not imputing transgression, and putting the word of reconciliation into
the apostle. As the result of this third consequence of the incarnation,
the apostle assumes the character of ambassador for Christ, as though
God exhorted by his means, he besought men, in the name of Christ, to be
reconciled to God. But such an embassy supposed the absence of Christ;
His ambassador acted in His stead. It was in fact based upon another
truth of immeasurable importance, namely, that God had made Him who knew
no sin to be sin for us, in order that we should be made the
righteousness of God in Him. This was the true way to reconcile us, and
that entirely, to God, according to the perfection of God fully
revealed. For He had set His love upon us where we were, giving His Son,
who was without spot or motion or principle of sin; and making Him (for
He offered Himself to accomplish the will of God) sin for us, in order
to make us in Him who in that condition had perfectly glorified Him the
expression of His divine righteousness, before the heavenly
principalities through all eternity; to make us His delight, as regards
righteousness; "that we should be the righteousness of God in him." Man
has no righteousness for God: God has made the saints, in Jesus, His
righteousness. It is in us that this divine righteousness is seen fully
verified of course in Christ first, in setting Him at His right hand,
and in us as in Him. Marvellous truth! which, if its results in us cause
thanksgiving and praise to resound when looking at Jesus, silences the
heart, and bows it down in adoration, astonished at the sight of His
wonderful acts in grace. \[See Note \#6\]

Note \#5

The truth is, the judgment-seat is what most brings out our assurance
before God; for as He is, so are we in this world; and it is when Christ
shall appear we shall be like Him.

Note \#6

It should be observed that, in Verse 20 ([Co2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020).md), the word "you" ought to be
omitted. It was the way in which the apostle fulfilled his ministry to
the world.
