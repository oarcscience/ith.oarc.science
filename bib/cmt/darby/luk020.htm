<p>It will be remarked here that, as He draws nigh to Jerusalem, the Lord weeps over the city. It is not now as in Matthew, where, while discoursing with the Jews, He points it out to them as that which having rejected and slain the prophets  Emmanuel also, the Lord, who would so often have gathered her children under His wings, having been ignominiously rejected  was now given up to desolation until His return. It is the hour of her visitation, and she has not known it. If only she had, even now, hearkened to the call of the testimony of her God! She is given up into the hands of the Gentiles, her enemies, who will not leave her one stone upon another. That is to say, not having known this visitation of God in grace in the Person of Jesus, she is set aside  the testimony goes no farther  she gives place to a new order of things. Thus the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus is here prominent. It is the moral character of the temple also of which the Lord here speaks. The Spirit does not notice here that it is to be the temple of God for all nations. It is simply (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016">Luk 20:16</A>) the vineyard is given to others. They fell upon the stone of stumbling then: when it falls on them  when Jesus comes in judgment  it will grind them to powder.
<p>In His reply to the Sadducees, three important things are added to that which is said in Matthew. 1st, It is not only the condition of those who are raised, and the certainty of the resurrection; it is an age, which a certain class only, who are accounted worthy of it, shall obtain, a separate resurrection of the just (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035">Luk 20:35</A>). 2nd, This class is composed of the children of God, as being the children of the resurrection (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036">Luk 20:36</A>). 3rd While waiting for this resurrection, their souls survive death, all live unto God, although they may be hidden from the eyes of men (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038">Luk 20:38</A>).
<p>The parable of the wedding feast is omitted here. In chapter 14 of this Gospel we find it with characteristic elements, a mission to the lanes of the city, to the despised of the nations, which is not in Matthew, who gives us the judgment of Jerusalem instead, before announcing the evangelisation of the Gentiles. All this is characteristic. In Luke it is grace, a moral condition of man before God, and the new order of things founded on the rejection of Christ. I will not dwell upon those points which Luke relates in common with Matthew. They naturally meet in the great facts that relate to the Lord's rejection by the Jews, and its consequences.
<p>If we compare Matthew 23 and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045">Luk 20:45-47</A>, we shall see at once the difference. In Luke the Spirit gives us in three Verses that which morally puts the scribes aside. In Matthew their whole position with respect to the dispensation is developed; whether as having a place, so long as Moses continued, or with reference to their guiltiness before God in that place.
