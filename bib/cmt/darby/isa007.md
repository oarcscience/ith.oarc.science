### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 7, 8, and 9:1-7.

But this requires further development; and it is given in a remarkable
manner in the next prophecy, comprised in chapters 7, 8, 9 to the end of
Verse 7 ([Isa 9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001).md). Certain promises
were attached to the family of David, in which-as we saw when examining
the Books of Samuel-God had renewed the hopes of Israel, when the links
between Himself and the people were broken by the taking of the ark, and
He had forsaken His place at Shiloh. Now the house of David, the last
sustainment of the people in responsibility, has also failed in
faithfulness. Ahaz has forsaken Jehovah, and set up the altar of a
strange god in the temple of Jehovah. In chapter 7 the Spirit of God
directs the prophet to the king, and addresses him. Isaiah was to go and
meet him, with Shear-jashub his son-a symbolical child whose name
signifies "the remnant shall return." But the Lord seeks first, as He
did with respect to the people in chapter 1, to encourage this branch of
David to act in faith, and thus to glorify God. He announces to the king
that the designs of Rezin and Pekah shall come to nought, and even
proposes to him to ask a sign. But Ahaz is too far from the Lord to
avail himself of this, though he replies with forms of piety. And again,
as He had done with respect to the people, Jehovah declares that which
shall happen to the family of David, and to the people under their rule.
The two points of this prophetic announcement are-the gift of Immanuel,
the virgin's son; and the complete desolation of the land by the
Assyrian. These indeed are the keys to the whole prophecy of Isaiah.
Nevertheless there shall be a remnant. Verse 16 ([Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016).md) refers to Shear-jashub; but this
prophecy goes farther. In chapter 8 the second prophetic child announces
by his name the approaching appearance of this enemy and his ravages;
and then, since the people despised the promises made to the family of
David and rejoiced in the flesh, Jehovah would take the thing in hand.
Consequently we have the whole sequel of the people's history, of the
directions given to the remnant, and of God's intervention in power for
the establishment of full blessing in the Person of the Messiah.

In chapter 7, where the responsibility of the family of David is the
subject, Immanuel is promised as a sign; but the success of the Assyrian
is complete without any reverse. Immanuel once brought in, all is
changed; the land is His. The Assyrian reaches even to the neck, because
the waters of Shiloah had been despised. But Immanuel secured all. Thus
the prophetic Spirit passes on to the events of the last days, of which
Sennacherib was but a type. He exhibits all the designs and
confederacies of the nations brought to nought because of Immanuel-God
(is) with us. It is the complete deliverance of Israel in the last days
([Isa 8:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#005).md). And as to the remnant,
what course are they to follow? ([Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011), and following..md) They are not to
be troubled by the fear of the people, nor to join them in their
confederacies, but to sanctify Jehovah of hosts Himself, and give Him
all His true importance in their hearts. He will be their sanctuary in
the day of their trouble.

But who then is this Immanuel, this Jehovah of hosts? We well know. This
brings in then the whole history of the rejection of Christ, and the
position of the remnant and of the nation in consequence, and of the
final intervention of the power of God. The passage is too clear to need
much explanation. I will point out its principal subjects. Christ
becomes personally a stumbling-stone. \[See Note \#1\] In consequence of
this the testimony of God is deposited exclusively in the hands and the
hearts of His disciples, God's elect remnant. He hides His face from
Jacob; but, according to the Spirit of prophecy, this remnant waits for
Him and seeks Him. Meanwhile Christ and the children whom Jehovah has
given Him are for signs to the two houses of Israel (compare [Rom
11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)). Those (the nation.md) who reject
the stone are in rebellion and anguish in Immanuel's land; they are
given up to desolation. Nevertheless this distress is not like the
former ravages of the Assyrian, because the Messiah, having appeared,
has taken in hand the cause of His people, according to the counsels of
God. The Spirit of prophecy passes at once, as is constantly the case,
from His appearance as light, to the results of the deliverance which He
will accomplish in the last days (from [Isa
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002).md). For the church was a mystery
hid in God, and not the subject of prophecy or promise. The yoke of the
Assyrian being broken, all the brightness of the glory of the divine
Person of the Messiah shines out in the blessing of His people.

These two subjects, the Messiah and the Assyrian, form the basis of all
the prophecy that speaks of Israel, when this people are the recognised
object of God's dealings. It may be noticed that the Assyrian appears
here twice-the second time in connection with a gathering together of
the nations. The first time, chapter 7, he is Jehovah's instrument for
the chastisement of Israel, and he does his own will without any
question of his being broken. The second time, chapter 8, he fills the
land; but the assembly of the nations gathered together against Israel
is broken and brought to nothing. This expectation of Jehovah's
intervention (without sharing the fears of the world in the last days,
or seeking that strength which the world think to find in confederation,
but, on the contrary, resting absolutely on Jehovah alone) contains in
principle a valuable instruction for the present day.

\[Note: [Isa 9:8-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md) is discussed in
the next chapter.\]

Note \#1

The beginning of Verse 17 is the passage quoted in Hebrews 2, along with
Verse 18 ([Isa 9:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017).md), to prove the
humanity of the Lord and His connection with the remnant.
