### [Psalms Chapter 105](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

Psalm 105 offers thanksgiving to Jehovah, and calls on the seed of
Abraham and Jacob to remember Him and glory in His name. Verses 7-8
([Psa 105:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007).md) give the occasion. He
is Jehovah, their God. His judgments are in all the earth. And He has
remembered His covenant for ever. It was to be permanent. It was
commanded to a thousand generations. He had now remembered it. The psalm
then recites how God had cared for the fathers, and judged Egypt for the
deliverance of His people; and, in spite of bondage, there was not a
feeble person among their tribes. "He remembered his holy promise, and
Abraham his servant, \[See Note \#1\] and he brought forth his people
with joy and his chosen with gladness, and gave them the lands of the
heathen, that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws." All
their subsequent failure is not touched on. For now again ([Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008).md) He had remembered His covenant
with Abraham and had delivered His people by judgments; for it is the
accomplishment of promise. And the gifts and calling of God are without
repentance. The following psalm will tell us Israel's ways, but only so
to bring out His mercy and never-failing goodness; for this is the
theme.

Note \#1

The difference of a reference to the promises to Abraham, and those to
Moses, the blessings of which depended on the faithfulness of the
people, is a marked feature in all the renewals of mercy to the people
and the faith that referred to one or the other.
