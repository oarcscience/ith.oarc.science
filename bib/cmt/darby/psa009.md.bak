### [Psalms Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Psalms 9 and 10.

In Psalms 9 and 10 we enter historically on the circumstances of the
remnant in the last days in the land. The great principles having been
laid down (the remnant Messiah trial in the midst of Israel through His
rejection a path He had learnt in person glory in the Son of man), we
get in these a preface as regards the circumstances, a laying of them
down, that the scene of the exercises, the state of things which gives
rise to these, and the deliverance wrought by the judgment of God, may
be plainly before us.

We may remark here, in confirmation of previously expressed judgments,
that the righteous man, Messiah, according to the counsels of God, but
rejected (with the consequent sorrows of the remnant into which He thus
enters), and in result glorified as Son of man, and set over all the
works of God's hands, having been brought before us in the first eight
psalms, we find ourselves at once (when entering on the historical
detail of circumstances) in the last days, the righteous remnant being
under the oppression of the wicked and the heathen. Messiah, in Spirit,
in the oppressed remnant, owns the righteousness of Jehovah, in
judgment, sitting on the throne judging right.

Remark the great difference here, in passing, between the celebration of
the righteousness of God, sitting in the throne, judging right, and
vindicating the righteous man from the oppressor, and Christ on the
cross, who was not vindicated on the earth, but declares Himself
forsaken of God (His enemies, outwardly, having all their will against
Him), and then righteousness being established in a heavenly way, God's
righteousness in setting Him at His own right hand in the heavenly
places. "Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no
more." As regards this righteousness, He was taken completely out of the
world, so that the disciples as in flesh, as was the case with the Jews
saw Him no more. He had glorified God, and was glorified in God, as God
has been in Him. The righteousness which judged the oppressor, though
executed by God who alone is really righteous and has power, had its
sphere and measure in earthly government, and in discerning the
righteous and the wicked among men, the oppressed and the oppressor. It
was connected with the righteous government of God. The clear
apprehension of this difference is a key to the whole frame of thought
in the Psalms.

Another point, it may be useful to remark, is this. In the English
translation several words are translated people: Am \[See Note \#1\] in
the singular, people, or Ammi \[See Note \#2\] my people (Israel): Goim
\[See Note \#3\] heathens or nations, that is, those outside, who are in
contrast with Israel as the people of God. Israel is so designated to
mark its guilt, [Psa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md). Leummim
\[See Note \#4\] the peoples and nations in general on the earth, the
various races of mankind; 'Ammim peoples in the plural, I think the
nations viewed in connection with Israel restored and taken into
relationship with Jehovah.

To turn now to the psalms before us: Psalm 9 presents to us Jehovah, the
Most High (the names of God which connect themselves with the Jews, and
the millennial accomplishment of the promises made to Abraham),
delivering the people by judgment from the oppression of the heathen,
and destroying the wicked. The delivered Jew celebrates this goodness
which has maintained the right and cause of the righteous. The Spirit of
Christ speaks fully in this, as having taken up their interests. It is
really His right. If the Jew has any, it is through Him. If they say it,
He has put the words in their mouth. Indeed, if Christ had not entered
into their sorrow, and given them these words, they could not have said,
My right.

Let us consider this (as to circumstances) first leading psalm with
somewhat more detail. The humble and oppressed one praises God with his
whole heart, under the double name of Jehovah and Most High. \[See Note
\#5\] The turning back of his enemies is not merely a human victory.
They fall and perish before the presence of Jehovah Elohim. But this was
to maintain the right and cause of the godly one really the right and
cause of Christ, who had thus thrown Himself into their portion in
gracious sympathy. In Verse 6 ([Psa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006).md) a very important principle is
brought out for faith at all times, then to be verified in fact. The
efforts of the enemy here are for time. He can destroy, if God allow,
present prosperity. The Lord endures for ever. We have only to do His
will by the way. He has always His way at the end. That will which we do
by the way, perhaps in sorrow and suffering then, will surely reign at
the end of the way. Destructions were now to come to a perpetual end the
cities and their memory had been destroyed. Jehovah endures for ever.

We have heard of the patience of Job that was by the way; we have seen
the end of the Lord that is the ground for faith. It walks with Him who
certainly has the end at His command. He shall endure for ever has
prepared His throne for judgment. He will judge the world universal in
righteousness, and minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. This
was the public character of Jehovah. But there was a private part of His
character, so to speak, the making of which however also public, is the
great subject of the psalm; and indeed with that first public one, the
great subject of all the psalms. Both are known only to faith, but are
celebrated beforehand. This second part is this: Jehovah is a refuge for
the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. The result is confidence in
Jehovah at all times on the part of those who know His name. The
intervention of Jehovah in that day in favor of those that seek Him will
make good this name everywhere.

Another point is brought out also. Jehovah dwells in Zion as thus
revealing Himself. His doings, what He does for the display of His name
through judgment in favor of the remnant, are to be declared among the
peoples \[See Note \#6\] another word than that often used, and
signifying, I apprehend, the peoples that He owns that they may be able
thus to trust in Him. He is returned thus to Zion at the close. Verses
13-14, ([Psa 9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013).md), are the cry of
the remnant, and on the ground of mercy, that their hearts may praise
Jehovah in Zion, as well as because of His judgments; Verse 15 ([Psa
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015).md) celebrates the judgment; and the
moral, so to speak, is told in Verse 16 ([Psa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md). Jehovah is known by the
judgment which He executes. The way in which this psalm serves as a
preface for understanding the scope of the book, and its application to
the last days, is evident. Once seized, it largely helps in the
intelligence of the whole book. In Verse 17 ([Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md) the wicked, \[See Note \#7\] be
they who they may, Jew as well as Gentile, and indeed particularly the
Jew, and all the nations who forget God, \[See Note \#8\] are shown to
be rejected and judged, and to have their place in Hades by judgment.
And in this God remembers the needy, for the destruction of the wicked
is their deliverance. Hence for this, for Jehovah to arise, is the cry
of the remnant. This feature explains certain expressions in the psalms
to which I have before alluded the demand for judgment. Compare the
characters of the judged ones in Romans 1-2. Only there the wrath is
from heaven, not governmental on earth from Zion; and a greater moral
development will be found, as was to be expected, and not the external
judgment of nations. \[See Note \#9\]

The body of Psalm 10 depicts the state of things in the last days, until
Jehovah arises to judgment, and more especially the character of the
wicked, for he is known by his character, and is especially to be found
in the Jew. Compare Isaiah 40-48 and 49-58: in the one passage, the
question being particularly idolatry and Babylon; in the second, the
rejection of Messiah (the two capital sins which bring the Jews to
judgment Jehovah, and His Anointed). The wicked in his pride acts upon
that which is seen; as the righteous by faith on the character of
Jehovah, faith in Him. The wicked boasts himself in his heart's desire,
and blesses him (counts him happy, that is) whom Jehovah abhors. He
pursues his plans without conscience, seeking to destroy the humble by
craft, and reckons that God has forgotten him. How well Christ could
help them here! The humble cry under the oppression. Why does Jehovah
stand afar off, and hide Himself in the time of trouble?

They were far indeed from being where Christ was, yet the shadow, so to
speak, of that sorrow was passing over them, but they could hope in God.
So in Verse 12 ([Psa 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012).md). They call
upon God to lift up His hand not forget the humble: why should the
wicked contemn God? Jehovah has seen it and will requite; the poor
committed himself to Him. Verse 16 to the end ([Psa
10:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#016).md) celebrates Jehovah's coming
in reply, and its results. Jehovah is King for ever; the heathen are
perished out of His land. There is the public judgment; now the secret
of the Lord. Jehovah has heard the desire of the humble. He prepared
their heart, and then hearkened; and that hearing will be in judging, in
being Judge for the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the
earth, he who had his strength and hope there, should no more oppress.

One or two remarks are required on both psalms. There are two parties,
and in a certain sense three, besides the poor humbled remnant who wait
upon God: the heathen (Goim), strangers to Israel, who oppress them,
enemies of God; and the wicked, then more especially among the Jews, as
we have seen. I have said three, because the wicked are spoken of in a
double way. In general, indeed exclusively so in Psalm 10 and each time
it is used in Psalm 9, except Verse 17 ([Psa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md), it is in the singular. In Verse
17 ([Psa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#017).md) it is plural, to show
that all of them will be cast down into Sheol. In the singular it is, I
judge, characteristic; yet I doubt not, there will be one special wicked
one The Lawless One, [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md); the
Antichrist, but known here certainly by his character, not by a distinct
prophecy of his person. The lawlessness is manifested, but not The
Lawless One, and it is not confined to one. The analogy of this, with
the circumstances in which Christ was in His rejection on earth, is very
plain, as is the case with all the forms of wickedness. The very Trinity
is imitated in mischief in the Apocalypse. There is the city of
corruption, as the bride of Christ; and so on.

Up to this, save as the Messiah of God's counsels was brought out in
Psalm 2, the righteous man was given characteristically, and here it was
necessary to characterize the whole party opposed to Jehovah and His
Christ, though one may be the concentrated expression of this character.
The remnant were to judge by this character morally. Next, remark, these
wicked ones are judged with the heathen; they all come together under
the same judgment. The wicked shall be turned into "Sheol," and all the
heathen who forget God. So Verse 5 ([Psa
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#005).md): "Thou hast rebuked the heathen,
thou hast destroyed the wicked." Psalm 9 is, as we have seen, the
general view of Jehovah's intervention in judgment. In Psalm 10 we have
particularly the position of the sorrow and trial of the remnant within.
Hence we find the wicked (man), not the heathen until on the execution
of judgment they are found too to have perished out of Jehovah's land,
so as to identify the judgment with the general statements of Psalm 9.
How completely this all answers to the history we have of the latter
days, I need not say.

Note \#1

[Psa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md).

Note \#2

[Psa 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md) (here "thy people," the same
practically).

Note \#3

[Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md). The Hebrew references are to
the Verses in Hebrew.

Note \#4

[Psa 7:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#007.md).

Note \#5

These names are not without importance. One is the abiding name of God
in Israel, His memorial for ever; the other, the millennial name of God
introduced by the judgments spoken of in the psalm. Compare Psalm 91 and
[Gen 14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019.md).

Note \#6

Ammim, ([Psa 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011).md). Leummim, ([Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009).md).

Note \#7

Here in the plural. The difference is sometimes important, because, as
Paul says, there is that wicked one.

Note \#8

Had not liked to retain God in their knowledge.

Note \#9

In Revelation 4 are found the characters of the seraphim as well as of
the cherubim, as prefacing, I believe, the judgments there, as
characterized as being according to the holy nature of God as well as
governmental. It is true the application of Isaiah 6, where alone the
seraphim are found, is to a governmental judgment, because grace
preserved a remnant. But the incompatibility of Jehovah and uncleanness
with man in himself is what the prophet sees.
