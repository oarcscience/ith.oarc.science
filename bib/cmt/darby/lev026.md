### [Leviticus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001)

Chapter 26. We have a touching picture of the ways of God in patience
and in chastisement, if Israel walked contrary to Him. When they
acknowledged their fault, then He would remember the covenant made with
their fathers, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This was a covenant made
without condition, and with the land. Then He would remember the
covenant made with their ancestors, under His name of Jehovah, when they
came out of Egypt \[See Note \#1\]. God will take these two titles on
their restoration: Almighty, the name of His relationship with the
fathers; and Jehovah, the name of His relationship with the people,
viewed as taken to Himself at their coming out of Egypt.

Note \#1

I take this to be the covenant of Exodus 6, not the law. It connected
itself directly with the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
adding the name of Jehovah, and taking up the people under that name.
