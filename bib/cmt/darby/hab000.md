Introduction to Habakkuk

How diverse and perfect is the development of the ways of God in His
word! Not only does it contain the great events that establish the fact
of His government, and the character of that government-not only the
proofs of His fidelity to His people, and His estimate of the evil that
led to judgment, but also His answer to every feeling caused by the
series of events by which He chastised them, the relief which He affords
to the anguish that must be felt by one who is faithful, on account of
the affliction of God's beloved people, together with the profitable
exercise of his faith. The perfect ways of God are unfolded on the one
side, and on the other the heart is formed to the intelligence of those
ways, and to the enjoyment of the full effect of the faithfulness of the
God of love; while, during the expectation of this effect, confidence in
God Himself is established, and the links of the heart with God are
abundantly strengthened.

It is of the latter part, the development of faith and of spiritual
affections amid the trial, that Habakkuk treats in his prophecy. It
speaks of the exercise of the heart of one who, full of the Spirit, is
attached to the people of God. Still, it is Israel that is brought
before us.
