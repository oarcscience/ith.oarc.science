### [John Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#001.md)

We come now to the testimony which the Father renders to Jesus in answer
to His rejection. In this chapter the power of resurrection and of life
in His own Person are presented to faith. \[See Note \#40\] But here it
is not simply that He is rejected: man is looked upon as dead, and
Israel also. For it is man in the person of Lazarus. This family was
blessed; it received the Lord into its bosom. Lazarus falls sick. All
the Lord's human affections would be naturally concerned. Martha and
Mary feel this; and they send Him word that he whom He loved was sick.
But Jesus stays where He is. He might have said the word, as in the case
of the centurion, and of the sick child at the beginning of this Gospel.
But He did not. He had manifested His power and His goodness in healing
man as he is found on earth, and delivering him from the enemy, and that
in the midst of Israel. But this was not His object here far from it or
the limits of what He was come to do. It was a question of bestowing
life, or raising up again that which was dead before God. This was the
real state of Israel; it was the state of man. Therefore He allows the
condition of man under sin to go on and manifest itself in all the
intensity of its effects down here, and permits the enemy to exercise
his power to the end. Nothing remained but the judgment of God; and
death, in itself, convicted man of sin while conducting him to judgment.
The sick may be healed there is no remedy for death. All is over for
man, as man here below. Nothing remains but the judgment of God. It is
appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment. The Lord
therefore does not heal in this instance. He allows the evil to go on to
the end to death. That was the true place of man. Lazarus once fallen
asleep, He goes to awaken him. The disciples fear the Jews, and with
reason. But the Lord, having waited for His Father's will, does not fear
to accomplish it. It was day to Him.

In fact, whatever might be His love for the nation, He must needs let it
die (indeed it was dead), and wait for the time appointed by God to
raise it up again. If He must die Himself to accomplish it, He commits
Himself to His Father.

But let us follow out the depths of this doctrine. Death has come in; it
must take effect. Man is really in death before God; but God in grace
comes in. Two things are presented in our history. He might have healed.
The faith and hope of neither Martha, Mary, nor the Jews, went any
farther. Only Martha acknowledges that, as the Messiah, favoured of God,
He would obtain from Him whatsoever He asked. But He had not prevented
the death of Lazarus. He had done so many times, even for strangers, for
whosoever desired it. In the second place, Martha knew that her brother
would rise again at the last day; but true as it was, this truth availed
nothing. Who would answer for man, dead through judgment on sin? To rise
again and appear before God was not an answer to death come in by sin.
The two things were true. Christ had often delivered mortal man from his
sufferings in flesh, and there shall be a resurrection at the last day.
But these things were of no value in the presence of death. Christ was,
however, there; and He is, thanks be to God! the resurrection and the
life. Man being dead, resurrection comes first. But Jesus is the
resurrection and the life in the present power of a divine life. And
observe that life, coming by resurrection, delivers from all that death
implies, and leaves it behind \[See Note \#41\] sin, death, all that
belongs to the life that man has lost. Christ, having died for our sins,
has borne their punishment has borne them. He has died. All the power of
the enemy, all its effect on mortal man, all the judgment of God, He has
borne it all, and has come up from it, in the power of a new life in
resurrection, which is imparted to us; so that we are in spirit alive
from among the dead, as He is alive from among the dead. Sin (as made
sin, and bearing our sins in His own body on the tree), death, Satan's
power, God's judgment, are all past through and left behind, and man is
in a wholly new state, in incorruption. It will be true of us, if we die
(for we shall not all die), as to the body, or, being changed, if we do
not die. But in the communication of His life who is risen from the
dead, God has quickened us with Him, having forgiven us all our
trespasses.

Jesus here manifested His own divine power to this effect; the Son of
God was glorified in it, for we know He had not yet died for sin; but it
was this same power in Him that was manifested. \[See Note \#42\] The
believer, even if he were dead, shall rise again; and the living who
believe in Him shall not die. Christ has overcome death; the power for
this was in His Person, and the Father bore Him witness of it. Are any
that are His alive when the Lord exercises this power? They will never
die death exists no more in His presence. Have any died before He
exercises it? They shall live death cannot subsist before Him. All the
effect of sin upon man is completely destroyed by resurrection, viewed
as the power of life in Christ. This refers of course to the saints, to
whom life is communicated. The same divine power is, of course,
exercised as to the wicked; but it is not the communication of life from
Christ, nor being raised with Him, as is evident. \[See Note \#43\]
Christ exercised this power in obedience and in dependence on His
Father, because He was man, walking before God to do His will; but He is
the resurrection and the life. He has brought the power of divine life
into the midst of death; and death is annihilated by it, for in life
death is no more. Death was the end of natural life to sinful man.
Resurrection is the end of death, which has thus no longer anything in
us. It is our advantage that, having done all it could do, it is
finished. We live in the life \[See Note \#44\] that put an end to it.
We come out from all that could be connected with a life that no longer
exists. What a deliverance! Christ is this power. He became this for us
in its full display and exercise in His resurrection.

Martha, while loving Him and believing in Him, does not understand this;
and she calls Mary, feeling that her sister would better understand the
Lord. We will speak a little of these two presently. Mary, who waited
for the Lord's own calling her to Him, modestly though sorrowfully
leaving the initiative with Him, believing thus that the Lord had called
her, goes to Him directly. Jews and Martha and Mary all had seen
miracles and healings that had arrested the power of death. To this they
all refer. But here life had passed away. What now could help? If He had
been there, His love and power they could have counted on. Mary falls
down at His feet weeping. On the point of resurrection power she
understood no more than Martha; but her heart is melted under the sense
of death in the presence of Him who had life. It is an expression of
need and sorrow rather than a complaint that she utters. The Jews also
weep: the power of death was on their hearts. Jesus enters into it in
sympathy. He was troubled in spirit. He sighs before God, He weeps with
man; but His tears turn into a groan, which was, though inarticulate,
the weight of death, felt in sympathy, and presented to God by this
groan of love which fully realised the truth; and that in love to those
who were suffering the ill that His groan expressed.

He bore death before God in His spirit as the misery of man the yoke
from which man could not deliver himself, and He is heard. The need
brings His power into action. It was not His part now patiently to
explain to Martha what He was. He feels and acts upon the need to which
Mary had given expression, her heart being opened by the grace that was
in Him.

Man may sympathise: it is the expression of his powerlessness. Jesus
enters into the affliction of mortal man, puts Himself under the burden
of death that weighs upon man (and that more thoroughly than man himself
can do), but He takes it away with its cause. He does more than take it
away; He brings in the power that is able to take it away. This is the
glory of God. When Christ is present, if we die, we do not die for
death, but for life: we die that we may live in the life of God, instead
of in the life of man. And wherefore? That the Son of God may be
glorified. Death came in by sin; and man is under the power of death.
But this has only given room for our possessing life according to the
second Adam, the Son of God, and not according to the first Adam, the
sinful man. This is grace. God is glorified in this work of grace, and
it is the Son of God whose glory shines brightly forth in this divine
work.

And, observe, that this is not grace offered in testimony, it is the
exercise of the power of life. Corruption itself is no hindrance to God.
Why did Christ come? To bring the words of eternal life to dead man. Now
Mary fed upon those words. Martha served cumbered her heart with many
things. She believed, she loved Jesus, she received Him into her house:
the Lord loved her. Mary listened to Him: this was what He came for; and
He had justified her in it. The good part which she had chosen should
not be taken from her.

When the Lord arrives, Martha goes of her own accord to meet Him. She
withdraws when Jesus speaks to her of the present power of life. We are
ill at ease when, although Christians, we feel unable to apprehend the
meaning of the Lord's words, or of what His people say to us. Martha
felt that this was rather Mary's part than hers. She goes away and calls
her sister, saying, that the Master (He who taught observe this name
that she gives Him) was come, and called for her. It was her own
conscience that was to her the voice of Christ. Mary instantly arises
and comes to Him. She understood no more than Martha. Her heart pours
out its need at the feet of Jesus, where she had heard His words and
learnt His love and grace; and Jesus asks the way to the grave. To
Martha, ever occupied with circumstances, her brother stank already.

Afterwards (Martha served, and Lazarus was present), Mary anoints the
Lord, in the instinctive sense of what was going on; for they were
consulting to put Him to death. Her heart, taught by love to the Lord,
felt the enmity of the Jews; and her affection, stimulated by deep
gratitude, expends on Him the most costly thing she had. Those present
blame her; Jesus again takes her part. It might not be reasonable, but
she had apprehended His position. What a lesson! What a blessed family
was this at Bethany, in which the heart of Jesus found (as far as could
be on earth) a relief that His love accepted! With what love have we to
do! Alas, with what hatred! for we see in this Gospel the dreadful
opposition between man and God.

There is an interesting point to be observed here before we pass on. The
Holy Ghost has recorded an incident, in which the momentary but guilty
unbelief of Thomas was covered by the Lord's grace. It was needful to
relate it; but the Holy Ghost has taken care to shew us, that Thomas
loved the Lord, and was ready, at heart, to die with Him. We have other
instances of the same kind. Paul says, "Take Mark, and bring him with
thee; for he is profitable to me for the ministry." Poor Mark! this was
necessary on account of what took place at Perga. Barnabas also has the
same place in the apostle's affection and remembrance. We are weak: God
does not hide it from us; but He throws the testimony of His grace over
the feeblest of His servants.

But to continue. Caiaphas, the chief of the Jews, as high priest,
proposes the death of Jesus, because He had restored Lazarus to life.
And from that day they conspire against Him. Jesus yields to it. He came
to give His life a ransom for many. He goes on to fulfil the work His
love had undertaken, in accordance with His Father's will, whatever
might be the devices and the malice of men. The work of life and Or
death, of Satan and of God, were face to face. But the counsels of God
were being accomplished in grace, whatever the means might be. Jesus
devotes Himself to the work by which they were to be fulfilled. Having
shewn the power of resurrection and of life in Himself, He is again,
when the time comes, quietly in the place to which His service led Him;
but He no longer goes in the same manner as before into the temple. He
goes thither indeed; but the question between God and man was morally
settled already.

Note \#40

It is very striking to see the Lord in the lowliness of obedient
service, allowing evil to have its full way in man's failure (death) and
Satan's power, till His Father's will called Him to meet it. Then no
danger hinders, and then He is the resurrection and the life in personal
presence and power, and then giving Himself being such, up to death for
us.

Note \#41

Christ took human life in grace and sinless; and as alive in this life
He took sin upon Him. Sin belongs, so to speak, to this life in which
Christ knew no sin, but was made sin for us. But He dies He quits this
life. He is dead to sin; He has done with sin in having done with the
life to which sin belonged, not in Him indeed but in us, and alive in
which He was made sin for us.Raised up again by the power of God, He
lives in a new condition, into which sin cannot enter, being left behind
with the life that He left. Faith brings us into it by grace. It has
been pretended that these thoughts affect the divine and eternal life
which was in Christ. But this is all idle and evil cavil. Even in an
unconverted sinner, dying or laying down life has nothing to do with
ceasing to exist as to the life of the man within. All live to God, and
divine life in Christ never could cease or be changed. He never laid
that down, but in the power of that, laid down His life as He possessed
it here as man, to take it up in an entirely new way in resurrection
beyond the grave. The cavil is a very evil cavil. In this edition I have
changed nothing in this note, but have added a few words in the hope
that it may be clear to all. The doctrine itself is vital truth. In the
text I have erased or altered a part for another reason, namely, that
there was confusion between the divine power of life in Christ, and
God's raising Him viewed as a dead man from the grave. Both are true and
blessedly so, but they are different and were here confounded together.
In Ephesians Christ as man is raised by God. In John it is the divine
and quickening power in Himself.

Note \#42

Resurrection has a double character: divine power, which He could
exercise and did exercise as to Himself ([Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).md), and here as to Lazarus, both
the proof of divine sonship; and the deliverance of a dead man from his
state of death. Thus God raised Christ from the dead, so here Christ
raises Lazarus. In Christ's resurrection both were united in His own
Person. Here, of course, they were separate. But Christ has life in
Himself and that in divine power. But He laid down His life in grace. We
are quickened together with Him in Ephesians 2. But it seems avoided
saying, He was quickened, when speaking of Him alone in chapter 1.

Note \#43

The cavil I have referred to in the note to page 345 sanctions (most
unwittingly, I gladly admit) the pestiferous doctrine of annihilation,
as if laying down life, or death, that is the end of natural life, were
ceasing to exist. I notice it, because this form of evil doctrine is one
very current now. It subverts the whole substance of Christianity.

Note \#44

Observe the sense which the apostle had of the power of this life, when
he says, "That mortality might be swallowed up of life." Consider, in
this point of view, the first five chapters of 2 Corinthians.
