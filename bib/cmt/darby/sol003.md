### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)

In chapter 3 we have another attitude, another state of heart. She is
alone and in darkness. She seeks her Beloved, but finds Him not. There
is affection, but no joy. She questions the watchmen in Jerusalem who go
about the city. As soon as she passes from them, she finds Him. Again He
will have her rest in His love. But all this is only prophetically and
in testimony, for the comfort of those who have not yet found Him, by
shewing them what He is for them. The Spirit of prophecy then exhibits
the Bridegroom coming up out of the wilderness with His bride, where
(like Moses) He had been with her in spirit. The chapter confirms the
application to Israel. In her solitary state she seeks the Messiah, and,
after inquiring of those who watched, soon found Him her soul loved, and
brought Him into the place of Israel, for to Israel the Son was born,
\[See Note \#1\] though in a new relationship. There He maintains her
rest, and there, the other side of the picture, the true Solomon comes
up out of the wilderness, crowned now in the day of His espousals, and
in the day of the gladness of His heart, by the Israel that had rejected
Him.

Note \#1

So Naomi, and Revelation 12.
