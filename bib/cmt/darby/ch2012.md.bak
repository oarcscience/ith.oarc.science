### [2 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 10, 11, and 12.

Solomon's faults are not related here for reasons which we have already
pointed out; but the history of Rehoboam shows us the immediate fall of
the kingly power which God had established. The king's folly occasioned
it, but it was only the fulfilment of the Lord's word by Ahijah.

The war which Rehoboam began against the revolted tribes was prevented.
Rehoboam submits to the man of God's prohibition. He is blessed and
fortifies himself in Judah. The Levites repair to Jerusalem as well as a
great number of the faithful, who would not forsake the true worship of
Jehovah to bow down before golden calves, to which His name had been
attached. Thus Judah was strengthened; for, during three years, the king
walked in the ways of David and Solomon. But soon he forsook the law of
Jehovah, and, secure against revolted Israel, he is chastised by
unexpected enemies, and all the riches amassed by Solomon fall into
their hands. Nevertheless he humbled himself, and the wrath of Jehovah
was turned from him.

In the history which we are about to consider we shall find the ways of
God more immediate and direct with those who were in direct and avowed
relationship with Him, according to His grace towards David, and in
connection with the house that had been dedicated to His name. When
their kings were faithful, all went on well.
