### [Acts Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

Paul's address to king Agrippa furnishes us with the most complete
picture of the entire position of the apostle, as he himself looked at
it when his long service and the light of the Holy Ghost illuminated his
backward glance.

He does not speak of the assembly that was a doctrine for instruction,
and not a part of his history. But everything that related to his
personal history, in connection with his ministry, he gives in detail.
He had been a strict Pharisee; and here he connects the doctrine of
Christ with the hopes of the Jews. He was in bonds "for the hope of the
promise made unto the fathers." No doubt resurrection entered into it.
Why should the king think resurrection impossible, that God was not able
to raise the dead? This brings him to another point. He had verily
thought with himself that he ought to do many things against Jesus of
Nazareth, and had carried them out with all the energy of his character,
and with the bigotry of a devout Jew. His present condition, as a
witness among the Gentiles, depended on the change wrought in him by the
revelation of the Lord when he was engaged in seeking to destroy His
name. Near Damascus a light brighter than the sun struck them all to the
earth, and he alone heard the voice of the Righteous One, so that he
knew from His own mouth that it was Jesus, and that He looked upon those
who believed in Him as Himself. He could not resist such a testimony.
But as this was the great grievance to the Jews, he shews that his own
position was formally marked out by the Lord Himself. He was called to
give ocular evidence of the glory which he had seen; that is, of Jesus
in that glory; and of other things also, for the manifestation of which
Jesus would again appear to him. A glorious Christ known (personally)
only in heaven was the subject of the testimony committed to him. For
this purpose He had set Paul apart from the Jews as much as from the
Gentiles, his mission belonging immediately to heaven, having its origin
there; and he was sent formally by the Lord of glory to the Gentiles, to
change their position with respect to God through faith in this glorious
Jesus, opening their eyes, bringing them out of darkness into light,
from the power of Satan to God, and giving them an inheritance among the
sanctified. This was a definite work. The apostle was not disobedient to
the heavenly vision, and he had taught the Gentiles to turn to God, and
to act as those who had done so. For this cause the Jews sought to kill
him.

Nothing more simple, more truthful, than this history. It put the case
of Paul and the conduct of the Jews in the clearest light. When called
to order by Festus, who naturally thought it nothing more than
irrational enthusiasm, he appeals with perfect dignity and quick
discernment to Agrippa's knowledge of the facts upon which all this was
based: for the thing had not been done in a corner.

Agrippa was not far from being convinced; but his heart was unchanged.
The wish that Paul expresses brings the matter back to its moral
reality. The meeting is dissolved. The king resumes his kingly place in
courtesy and condescension, and the disciple that of a prisoner; but,
whatever might be the apostle's position, we see in him a heart
thoroughly happy and filled with the Spirit and love of God. Two years
of prison had brought him no depression of heart or faith, but had only
set him free from his harassing connection with the Jews, to give him
moments spent with God.

Agrippa, surprised and carried away by Paul's clear and straightforward
narrative, \[See Note \#33\] relieves himself from the pressure of
Paul's personal address by saying, 'In a little you are going to make a
Christian of me.' Charity might have said, "Would to God that thou
wert!" But there is a spring in the heart of Paul that does not stop
there. "Would to God," says he, "that not only thou, but all those that
hear me, were ... altogether such as I am, except these bonds!" What
happiness and what love (and in God these two things go together) are
expressed in these words! A poor prisoner, aged and rejected, at the end
of his career he is rich in God. Blessed years that he had spent in
prison! He could give himself as a model of happiness; for it filled his
heart. There are conditions of soul which unmistakably declare
themselves. And why should he not be happy? His fatigues ended, his work
in a certain sense finished, he possessed Christ and in Him all things.
The glorious Jesus, who had brought him into the pains and labour of the
testimony, was now his possession and his crown. Such is ever the case.
The cross in service by virtue of what Christ is is the enjoyment of all
that He is, when the service is ended; and in some sort is the measure
of that enjoyment. This was the case with Christ Himself, in all its
fulness; it is ours, in our measure, according to the sovereign grace of
God. Only Paul's expression supposes the Holy Ghost acting fully in the
heart in order that it may be free to enjoy, and that the Spirit is not
grieved.

A glorious Jesus a Jesus who loved him, a Jesus who put the seal of His
approbation and love upon his service, a Jesus who would take him to
Himself in glory, and with whom he was one (and that known according to
the abundant power of the Holy Ghost, according to divine
righteousness), a Jesus who revealed the Father, and through whom he had
the place of adoption was the infinite source of joy to Paul, the
glorious object of his heart and of his faith; and, being known in love,
filled his heart with that love overflowing towards all men. What could
he wish them better than to be as he was except his bonds? How, filled
with this love, could he not wish it, or not be full of this large
affection? Jesus was its measure.

Note \#33

It is hardly to be read "almost." Relieving himself, Agrippa says,
"You'll soon be making a Christian of me," covering his feelings, as I
have said, by a slighting speech. But I have no doubt his mind was
greatly wrought upon.
