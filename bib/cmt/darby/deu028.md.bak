### [Deuteronomy Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 28 and 29.

In chapter 28 we have the principles of God's government in the midst of
that people, and the immediate consequences of obedience or
disobedience-consequences so solemnly fulfilled in the fate of that
unhappy people, still beloved for the fathers sakes. The consequences of
the violation of the law as a principle of relationship with God, as to
the point of a righteousness which was adequate ground of God's
acceptance, must not be confounded with the temporary consequences of
disobedience under the government of God. It is to these latter that
chapter 28 has reference. We may notice for ourselves the deep
instruction of Verses 47, 48 ([Deu
28:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047).md). As to Israel, universal
history presents to us the accomplishment of the threats of the chapter.

Chapter 29 is the personal application to the conscience of the people,
both collectively and individually, of all that precedes, that there may
be no bitter root of sin (compare [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015.md), the application of this
exhortation to the discipline and the loving care of saints now). Verse
29 ([Deu 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029).md) requires to be
noticed. We find in it the contrast between the consequences thus
revealed of obedience and disobedience, and the purposes of God in
behalf of the people, notwithstanding their disobedience-purposes which
evidently could not be a rule for their conduct. The rule was found in
the ordinance of the law. The meaning of this Verse has been so twisted,
that it is worth while thus to point out its force. The secret things
are the purposes of God with regard to the people, though they should
have been disobedient and driven out of the land; but, although they are
not the rule of conduct, they are revealed and are of deep interest. In
what follows, God begins already to present them to our attention, and
surely it becomes us to consider them.

Thus we have, in these chapters, the relationship of the pious Jew with
God, grounded upon the accomplishment of the promises made to the
fathers, in the present enjoyment of the land; the relationship of the
people with God, in view of the curse pronounced upon the violation of
the law; the relationship of the people with God, according to the
principles of His government, the consequences brought in, either by
their obedience or disobedience: and, finally, after the disobedience,
and when this has produced its fruit, the designs of God according to
His purpose, which nothing could alter.
