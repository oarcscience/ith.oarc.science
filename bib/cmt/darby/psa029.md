### [Psalms Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)

Psalm 29 summons the mighty to hear the mightier voice of Jehovah, to
own Him and worship before Him according to the holy order of His house,
celebrating the power of His voice in universal creation; but there is a
place of intelligent worship where His glory is understood His temple
where men are to come. But this Jehovah is above the haughty raging of
the surges of created strength; He sits King for ever above and in spite
of all. And He, this mighty Jehovah, will give strength to His people
and bless them with peace. It is a positive encouragement for the
faithful; not their complaint or appeal, but a testimony for them to
encourage their hearts in presence of the mighty. He that cares for them
is mightier than they.
