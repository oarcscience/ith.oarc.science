### [Psalms Chapter 82](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md)

Psalm 82. We find God assuming the government into His own hands. He had
set up authority in the earth and especially in Israel. Directed by His
word in judgment and armed with His authority, the judges in Israel had
born the name of God (Elohim). But none would understand or deal
righteously. All the foundations of the earth were out of course. All
magistrates had received power and authority of God the Jewish, His word
also; but even these would not know or understand. They were men, and
would die like men, and fall like one of the uncircumcised princes of
this world. God who had given the authority judged among the gods He
must have righteousness. This judgment the Spirit of prophecy then calls
for in the understanding one. "Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou
shalt inherit all nations."
