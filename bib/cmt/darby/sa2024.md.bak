### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#001.md)

Chapter 24 leads us into a subject which requires particular notice. The
wrath of God is kindled again against Israel. It is not in the mind of
the Spirit to inform us on what occasion this took place, but to lay
open God's dealings both in government and grace. In the preceding
chapter God "writeth up" the mighty men who prefigure the companions of
the true David in glory. Here it is His grace in staying His anger and
bringing in His blessing.

God punishes the pride and rebellion of Israel by leaving them to the
consequences of the impulse of David's natural heart. Joab's habitual
cleverness and good sense made him perceive its folly. The flesh, when
it is in another, is easily discerned. Joab felt that it was not worth
while to despise God when nothing was to be gained by it; for in this
way the flesh fears God. But the thing was of Jehovah, and Satan gains
his point. When in truth can man's good sense avail in opposition to the
will of God in chastening, and to Satan's malice? It is an awful thing
to be given up to his power. Nine months of sin on David's part, and of
patience on God's part, shew us the fatal influence of the enemy; but
the sin accomplished only awakens David's conscience. The enjoyment of
the fruit of our sin undeceives us. It is the pursuit of it which
allures our hearts. When Satan has succeeded in inducing the children of
God to commit the evil to which he tempts them, he cares no longer to
conceal from them its emptiness and folly. Happily, where there is life,
conscience resumes its power in such a case.

Nevertheless chastening must follow sin which has been carried out in
spite of so much long-suffering. But God, who reaches His servant's
conscience, brings into play the sincere affections of his heart, in
order to bring about His own sovereign purpose. David exhibits that
never-failing token of a heart that knows the Lord-confidence in God
above all, and at whatever cost. "Let me fall into the hand of Jehovah."
Sweet and precious thought of what the Lord is unto His people! and well
He knows how to fill the heart with the certainty that He deserves its
confidence. Even while chastening, God is more loving, more faithful,
more worthy of confidence than any other. The plague breaks out; but in
the midst of judgment Jehovah remembers mercy, and commands the
destroying angel, when he had reached Jerusalem, to stay his hand. It is
Jerusalem, the city of His affections, that attracts His attention. God
chooses it for the place where His altar shall be built, and His grace
shewn forth-His appointed mercy-seat. It is there that His wrath, justly
kindled against Israel, ceases; and sin gives occasion to the
establishment of the place and of the work in which He and His people
shall meet, according to that grace which has put away the sin. This
characterises the cross of Christ; this will stay the plague in Israel,
and introduce the reign of the true Prince of Peace. David stands in the
breach to deliver the people; and at his own cost ([Sa2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017).md), and, typically according to
the counsels of God, he offers the sacrifice of appeasement.

The thoughts on the First Book of Chronicles will contain a fuller
examination into this latter part of David's history. But it is a
striking close to this book, after all the governmental history of
David, that it closes with the atoning sacrifice which stops the wrath
through grace, and lays the foundation of the meeting-place of God with
Israel and the place of their worship.
