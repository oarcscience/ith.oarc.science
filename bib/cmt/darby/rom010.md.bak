### [Romans Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md)

Having touched on this subject, the apostle, who deeply loved his nation
as the people of God, pours out his heart with respect of the doctrine
which was a stumbling-stone to them. His desire, the aim of his heart's
affection, was their salvation. The object of his affections, they were
clothed in his eyes with their zeal for God, ignorant as it was;
ignorant, alas! on the side of that which God taught. Being ignorant of
God's righteousness, they sought in their zeal to establish their own
righteousness, and did not submit themselves to that of God. For Christ
is the end of law for righteousness to every believer. There was found
the righteousness of God, there the stumblingstone to Israel.

Nevertheless the apostle establishes his argument clearly and firmly. He
establishes it on his own part; but Deuteronomy supplies him with an
unexpected proof of the great principle. He quotes a passage from that
book which speaks on the subject of Israel's condition, when they should
have broken the law and be suffering its consequences. "Secret things,"
the lawgiver had said, "belong to our God; but those that are revealed"
are for the people. That is to say, the law was given as a condition to
the enjoyment of the blessing, plainly and positively; what God might do
in grace, when Israel should be under the consequences of the broken
law, remained in the secrecy of His supreme will. Upon this, however,
another principle is distinctly revealed, namely, that when the
fulfilment of the law was impossible, and when Israel had been driven
out of their land for having broken it, if then their heart turned to
God in that far country, He would accept them. It was all over with the
law as a condition of relationship with God. Israel was driven out
according to the Chapter we are looking at (Deut. 30) was Lo-ammi, no
longer the people of God. The testimony of God was nevertheless
addressed to them: they might turn to Him in spirit, and by faith. It
was no longer the law, it was faith. But, says the apostle, if so, it is
Christ who is its object. No Jew would have denied that the testimony of
God was the hope of every true Israelite when all was ruined.

This passage then in Deuteronomy when Moses has done with the law, and
has supposed other counsels of God, and on them founds the principle of
turning in heart to God when all is over with regard to the law, and
Israel is in a place where it would be impossible to keep it, being in
captivity among the Gentiles this passage has remarkable significance in
the argument of the apostle; and its being quoted is an extraordinary
proof, that in his reasonings it is the Holy Ghost who acts. It is the
apostle who introduces Christ; but the combination of the truths of the
different positions of Israel, of the law, and of the return in heart
when they were lost under the law a combination of which Christ was the
key-stone and alone could be exhibits a comprehensive view of the
oneness of all God's ways, morally and in His dispensations, of which
the Spirit of God alone is capable, and which evidently expresses His
thoughts. See Deuteronomy 29 (at the end) and 30.

The word of faith then set forth as being the hope of Israel, was that
which the apostle announced that if any one confessed with his mouth the
Lord Jesus, and believed in his heart that God had raised Him from the
dead, he should be saved. Precious, simple, and positive assertion! and
borne out, if that were needed, by the testimony of the Old Testament:
"Whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed." The words heart and
mouth are in contrast with the law. In the case Deuteronomy supposes,
Israel could not fulfil the law; the word of their God, Moses told them,
could be in their heart and in their mouth. Thus now for the Jew (as for
every one) it was the belief of the heart.

Observe, it does not say, If you love in your heart, or, If your heart
is what it ought to be towards God; but, If you believe in your heart. A
man believes with his heart, when he really believes with a heart
interested in the thing. His affections being engaged in the truth, he
desires, when grace is spoken of, that that which is told him should be
the truth. He desires the thing, and at the same time he does not doubt
it. It is not in his having part in it that he believes, but in the
truth of the thing itself, being concerned in it as important to
himself. It is not the state of his affections (a very serious
consideration, however, in its place) that is the subject here, but the
importance and the truth of that which is presented by the word its
importance to himself, as needing it for his salvation, a salvation that
he is conscious of needing, that he cannot do without a truth of which
he is assured, as a testimony from God Himself. God affirms to such a
one that salvation belongs to him, but it is not that which he has to
believe in as the object of faith; it is that of which God assures every
one who does believe.

Moreover thus faith is manifested by the proof it gives of its sincerity
by confession of the name of Christ. If some one were convinced that
Jesus is the Christ, and refused to confess Him, his conviction would
evidently be his greater condemnation. The faith of the heart produces
the confession of the mouth; the confession of the mouth is the
counterproof of the sincerity of the faith, and of honesty, in the sense
of the claim which the Lord has upon us in grace. It is the testimony
which God requires at the outset. It is to sound the trumpet on earth in
face of the enemy. It is to say that Christ has conquered, and that
everything belongs in right to Him. It is a confession which brings in
God in answer to the name of Jesus. It is not that which brings in
righteousness, but it is the public acknowledgment of Christ, and thus
gives expression to the faith by which there is participation in the
righteousness of God, so that it may be said, 'He believes in Christ
unto salvation; he has the faith that justifies.'

I have entered here a little more into detail, because this is a point
on which the human heart perplexes itself; and perplexes itself so much
the more because it is sincere, as long as there is any unbelief and
self-righteousness remaining. It is impossible that an awakened soul
should not feel the necessity of having the heart set right and turned
to God; and hence, not submitting to the righteousness of God, he thinks
to make the favour of God depend on the state of his own affections,
whereas God loves us while we are yet sinners. The state of our
affections is of all importance; but it supposes a relationship already
existing, according to which we love. We love too because we are loved
of God. Now His love has done something has done something according to
our necessities, and according to the divine glory. It has given Jesus;
and Jesus has accomplished what was required, in order that we may
participate in divine righteousness; and thus He has placed every one
who (acknowledging that he is a lost sinner) believes in Him, in the
secure relationship of a child and of a justified soul before God,
according to the perfection of the work of Christ. Salvation belongs to
this soul according to the declaration of God Himself. Loved with such
love, saved by such grace, enjoying such favour, let it cultivate
affections suitable to the gift of Jesus, and to the knowledge it has of
Him and of His goodness.

It is evident that, if it is "whosoever" believes in Jesus, the Gentile
comes in as well as the Jew. There is no difference; the sameLord is
rich unto all that call upon Him. It is beautiful to see this form of
expression, "There is no difference," repeated here. The apostle had
used it before with the addition "for all have sinned." Sin puts all men
on a level in ruin before God. But there is also no difference, "for the
same Lord over all is rich unto all," for every one who calls upon His
name shall be saved.

On this declaration, the apostle founds another argument; and by it he
justifies the ways of God that were accomplished in his ministry. The
Jewish scriptures declared that every one who called upon the name of
the Lord should be saved. Now, the Jews acknowledged that the Gentiles
did not know the name of the true and living God. It was needful
therefore to proclaim Him, in order that they might call upon Him, and
the whole ministry of the apostle was justified. Accordingly it was
written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of
peace." For, in dealing with these questions among the Jews, he
naturally rests on the authority of their own scriptures.

But he applies this principle for evangelisation to the Jews as well as
to the Gentiles (for the law was not the announcement of good news). He
quotes Isaiah to the same purpose. It was in a proclamation a truth thus
publicly preached that Israel had not believed; so that there ought to
be faith in a truth thus preached, in the word proclaimed. Verse 18
([Rom 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018).md) presents some difficulty.
It is certain that the apostle intends to explain that a proclamation of
the truth on God's part had taken place. Israel was without excuse, for
the report had even gone out everywhere, the words which announced God
unto the ends of the earth. The testimony then was not confined to the
Jews The Gentiles had heard it everywhere. This is plain. But does the
apostle merely borrow the words (which in the passage quoted apply to
the testimony of creation), or does he mean to speak of the testimony of
nature itself? I believe that he uses the passage to shew that God had
the Gentiles in view in His testimonies; that he wishes quietly to
suggest this to the Jews by a quotation from their own scriptures, that
not only have they, the Jews, heard, but that the testimony has gone
everywhere, and that this was in the mind of God. Paul does not quote
the passage as a prophecy of that which was taking place; he borrows the
words, without that form of speech, to shew that this universal
testimony was in the mind of God, whatever might be the means employed.
And then, stating the thing with more precision for the Jew, he adds,
Did not Israel know? Was not the nation apprised of this extension to
the Gentiles, of the testimony of this proclamation of grace to them, of
the reception of the testimony by the Gentiles, so as to bring them into
relationship with God? Yes; Moses had already said, that God would
provoke Israel to jealousy by a people without knowledge. And Isaiah had
spoken boldly, formally declaring that God should be found by a nation
that sought Him not; and to Israel, that all day long He had stretched
forth His hands to a rebellious and gainsaying people; in a word, that
the Gentiles should find Him, and Israel be perverse and disobedient.
Thus, the testimony borne to their relative positions although the
apostle approaches it gradually and quietly is distinct and formal: the
Gentiles received; Israel at enmity.
