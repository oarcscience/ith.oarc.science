### [Deuteronomy Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#001.md)

Verse 18 \[from Chapter 16\] ([Deu
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018).md) begins a new subject: the pains
taken, and the instruments used, to preserve the blessing and execute
the judgments necessary to that effect. The thought is still to maintain
the people in relationship with God alone. They were to appoint judges
and officers in their gates. Whatever led to idolatry was forbidden; he
who enticed them to it was to be stoned (chap. 17). If the matter were
too hard, they were to come to the priests and the judges, and the
people were to abide by their judgment.

The case of the people desiring a king is anticipated; and they are told
that he must be of the people, and not act so as to open the way for
intercourse with Egypt, nor so as to lead the people to idolatry; but he
is to write a copy of the book of the law with his own hand, and read
therein all the days of his life, being subject to it, so as not to
despise his brethren.
