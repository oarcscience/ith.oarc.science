### [Psalms Chapter 60](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001)

In Psalm 60 the remnant acknowledge God's having cast them off. Their
only hope is, that He will turn to them again. This is exactly the point
of Israel's righteousness as a nation: no going for help elsewhere no
spirit of rebellion. They accept the punishment of their iniquity. Still
God had put His ensign among the faithful in Israel. He was their
Jehovah-nissi. They now look to Him. The end of the psalm is God
asserting His title to the land of promise. Victory will be to Israel
through Him.
