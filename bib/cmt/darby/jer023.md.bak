### [Jeremiah Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 21, 22, and 23.

On the occasion of Zedekiah's request to Jeremiah to know if the Lord
would interfere in favour of the people against Nebuchadnezzar, the
Spirit of God has brought the testimonies together that were given with
respect to all the members of David's family who presided, so to say, at
the ruin of Jerusalem-Jehoahaz ([Jer
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010).md), Jehoiakim ([Jer
22:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md), Jeconiah ([Jer
22:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020).md). The judgment of Zedekiah
had been pronounced (chap. 21); and after having declared, as we have
seen, that the door was always open to repentance, and that blessing
always attended a godly walk ([Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md); [Jer
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#001).md), judgment is again pronounced,
and a sentence from God upon the different kings. Finally (chap. 23) the
expression of Jehovah's indignation against these evil pastors gives
rise to the declaration that He will raise up a Shepherd after His own
heart, namely, the true Son of David, the Messiah. The just indignation
and the judgment of God are expressed in the strongest terms.
