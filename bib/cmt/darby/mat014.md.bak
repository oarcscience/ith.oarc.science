### [Matthew Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001.md)

Our Gospel resumes the historical course of these revelations, but in
such a manner as to exhibit the spirit by which the people were
animated. Herod (loving his earthly power and his own glory more than
submission to the testimony of God, and more bound by a false human idea
than by his conscience, although in many things he appears to have owned
the power of the truth) had cut off the head of the forerunner of the
Messiah, John the Baptist; whom he had already imprisoned, in order to
remove out of the sight of his wife the faithful reprover of the sin in
which she lived.

Jesus is sensible of the import of this, which is reported to Him.
Accomplishing in lowly service (however personally exalted above him),
together with John, the testimony of God in the congregation, He felt
Himself united in heart and in His work to him; for faithfulness in the
midst of all evil binds hearts very closely together; and Jesus had
condescended to take a place in which faithfulness was concerned (see
[Psa 40:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009).md). On hearing therefore of
John's death He retires into a desert place. But while departing from
the multitude who thus began to act openly in the rejection of the
testimony of God, He does not cease to be the supplier of all their
wants, and to testify thus that He who could divinely minister to all
their need was amongst them. For the multitude, who felt these wants and
who, if they had not faith, yet admired the power of Jesus, follow Him
into the desert place; and Jesus, moved with compassion, heals all their
sick. In the evening His disciples beg Him to send the multitude away
that they may procure food. He refuses and bears a remarkable testimony
to the presence, in His own Person, of Him who was to satisfy the poor
of His people with bread (Psalm 132). Jehovah, the Lord, who established
the throne of David, was there in the Person of Him who should inherit
that throne. I doubt not the twelve baskets of fragments refer to the
number which, in scripture, always designates the perfection of
administrative power in man.

Remark also here, that the Lord expects to find His twelve disciples
capable of being the instruments of His acts of blessing and power,
administering according to His own power the blessings of the kingdom.
"Give ye them," said He, "to eat." This applies to the blessing of the
Lord's kingdom, and to the disciples of Jesus, the twelve, as being its
ministers; but it is likewise an all-important principle with regard to
the effect of faith in every intervention of God in grace. Faith should
be able to use the power that acts in such intervention, to produce the
works which are proper to that power, according to the order of the
dispensation and the intelligence it has respecting it. We shall find
this principle again elsewhere more fully developed.

The disciples wished to send the multitude away, not knowing how to use
the power of Christ. They should have been able to avail themselves of
it in Israel's behalf, according to the glory of Him who was among them.

If now the Lord demonstrated with perfect patience by His actions that
He who could thus bless Israel was in the midst of His people, He does
not the less bear testimony to His separation from that people in
consequence of their unbelief. He makes His disciples get into a ship to
cross the sea alone; and, dismissing the multitude Himself, He goes up
into a mountain apart to pray; while the ship that contained the
disciples was tossing on the waves of the sea with a contrary wind: a
living picture of that which has taken place. God has indeed sent forth
His people to cross the stormy sea of the world alone, meeting with an
opposition against which it is hard to strive. Meanwhile Jesus prays
alone on high. He has sent away the Jewish people, who had surrounded
Him during the period of His presence here below. The departure of the
disciples, besides its general character, sets before us peculiarly the
Jewish remnant. Peter individually, in coming out of the ship, goes in
figure beyond the position of this remnant. He represents that faith
which, forsaking the earthly accommodation of the ship, goes out to meet
Jesus who has revealed Himself to it, and walks upon the sea a bold
undertaking, but based on the word of Jesus, "Come." Yet remark here
that this walk has no other foundation than, "If it be Thou," that is to
say, Jesus Himself. There is no support, no possibility of walking, if
Christ be lost sight of. All depends on Him. There is a known means in
the ship; there is nothing but faith, which looks to Jesus, for walking
on the water. Man, as mere man, sinks by the very fact of being there.
Nothing can sustain itself except that faith which draws from Jesus the
strength that is in Him, and which therefore imitates Him. But it is
sweet to imitate Him; and one is then nearer to Him, more like Him. This
is the true position of the church, in contrast with the remnant in
their ordinary character. Jesus walks on the water as on the solid
ground. He who created the elements as they are could well dispose of
their qualities at His pleasure. He permits storms to arise for the
trial of our faith. He walks on the stormy wave as well as on the calm.
Moreover the storm makes no difference. He who sinks in the waters does
so in the calm as well as in the storm, and he who can walk upon them
will do so in the storm as well as in the calm that is to say, unless
circumstances are looked to and so faith fail, and the Lord is
forgotten. For often circumstances make us forget Him where faith ought
to enable us to overcome circumstances through our walking by faith in
Him who is above them all. Nevertheless, blessed be God! He who walks in
His own power upon the water is there to sustain the faith and the
wavering steps of the poor disciple; and at any rate that faith had
brought Peter so near to Jesus that His outstretched hand could sustain
him. Peter's fault was that he looked at the waves, at the storm (which,
after all, had nothing to do with it), instead of looking at Jesus, who
was unchanged, and who was walking on those very waves, as his faith
should have observed. Still the cry of his distress brought the power of
Jesus into action, as his faith ought to have done; only it was now to
his shame, instead of being in the enjoyment of communion and walking
like the Lord.

Jesus having entered the ship, the wind ceases. Even so it will be when
Jesus returns to the remnant of His people in this world. Then also will
He be worshipped as the Son of God by all that are in the ship, with the
remnant of Israel. In Gennesaret Jesus again exercises the power which
shall here after drive out from the earth all the evil that Satan has
brought in. For when He returns, the world will recognise Him. It is a
fine picture of the result of Christ's rejection, which this Gospel has
already made known to us as taking place in the midst of the Jewish
nation.
