### [Mark Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

In chapter 13 the Lord takes up much more the service of the apostles in
the circumstances that would surround them, than the development of the
dispensations and the ways of God with respect to the kingdom a point of
view more presented in Matthew, who treats of this subject.

It will be observed, that the disciples' question takes only a general
view of the subject which pre-occupied them. They ask when the judgment
upon the temple and all these things shall be fulfilled. And from Verses
9-13 ([Mar 13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009).md), although some
circumstances found in Matthew 24 are included, the passage relates even
more to that which is said in Matthew 10. It speaks of the service which
the disciples would accomplish in the midst of Israel, and in testimony
against persecuting authorities, the gospel being preached in all
nations before the end came. They were, as preachers, to fill the place
which Jesus had occupied among the people, only that the testimony was
to extend much farther. It would be in the face of all possible
suffering and most trying persecutions.

But there would be a moment when this service should end. The well-known
sign of the abomination that maketh desolate would point it out. They
were then to flee. These would be the days of unparalleled distress, and
of signs and wonders, which, if it were possible, would deceive the very
elect. But they were forewarned. Everything should be shaken after that
time, and the Son of man should come. Power should take the place of
testimony, and the Son of man should gather together His elect (of
Israel) from all parts of the earth.

It appears to me that in this Gospel, more than in any other, the Lord
brings together the judgment on Jerusalem then at hand, and that which
is yet to come, carrying the mind on to the latter, because He is here
more occupied with the conduct of His disciples during those events.
Israel, the whole system into which the Lord had come, was to be set
aside provisionally, in order to bring in the assembly and the kingdom
in its heavenly character, and afterwards the millennium that is, the
assembly in its glory and the kingdom established in power when the
legal system and Israel under the first covenant should be finally set
aside. At these two periods the general position of the disciples would
be the same; but the events of the latter period would be definitive and
important, and the Lord speaks especially of them. Nevertheless that
which was the most imminent, and which, for the present, set aside
Israel and the testimony, required that a warning should be addressed to
the disciples on account of their immediate danger; and they receive it
accordingly.

The effort of the Jews to re-establish their system at the end, in
despite of God, will but lead to open apostasy and definitive judgment.
This will be the time of unequalled affliction, of which the Lord
speaks. But from the time of the first destruction of Jerusalem by Titus
until the coming of the Lord, the Jews are considered as set aside and
under this judgment, in what degree soever it may have been
accomplished.

The disciples are commanded to watch, for they know not the hour. It is
the conduct of the disciples in this respect which is here especially
before the eyes of the Lord. It is of this great day, and the hour of
its arrival, that the angels and even the Son, as Prophet, know not. For
Jesus must sit at the right hand of God until His enemies are made His
footstool, and the time of His rising up is not revealed. The Father has
kept it, says Jesus, in His own power. See Acts 3, where Peter proposes
to the Jews the Lord's return. They rejected his testimony; and now they
wait for the full accomplishment of all that has been spoken. Meantime
the servants are left to serve during the Master's absence. He commanded
the porter in particular to watch. They knew not at what hour the Master
would come. This applies to the disciples in their connection with
Israel, but at the same time it is a general principle. The Lord
addresses it to all.
