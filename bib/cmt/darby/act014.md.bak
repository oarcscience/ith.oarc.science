### [Acts Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)

Their missionary labours continue in Iconium with the same opposition
from the Jews who, incapable themselves of the work, stir up the
Gentiles against those who are performing it. As long as it was only
opposition, it was but a motive for perseverance; but, being warned in
time of an assault that was planned against them, they depart to Lystra
and Derbe. There, having healed a cripple, they excite the idolatrous
respect of these poor pagans; but, filled with horror, they turn them
from their error by the energy of the Holy Ghost faithful to the
testimony of their God. Hither also the Jews follow them. Now, if man
will not ally himself with the idolatry of the heart, and accept
exaltation from men, the power of his testimony, which they began by
admiring as long as they thought they could elevate man and acquire
importance through their flatteries being accepted, ends by exciting the
hatred of their hearts. The Jews bring this hatred into action and stir
up the people, who leave Paul for dead. But he rises up and re-enters
the city, remaining tranquilly there another day, and on the morrow he
goes with Barnabas to Derbe.

Afterwards they revisit the cities through which they had passed, and at
Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, they confirm the disciples in the faith,
and teach them that they must pass through tribulation to inherit the
kingdom. They choose elders for them; and passing through some other
cities to the place where they had disembarked, they return to Antioch,
from whence they had been commended to God for the work, causing great
joy to the disciples there in that the door of faith was opened to the
Gentiles. This is the first formal mission among the Gentiles where
assemblies are formed, elders appointed by the apostles, and the
hostility of the Jews to the grace of God, outside their nation and
independently of their law, is distinctly marked. The word assumes a
positive character among the Gentiles, and the energy of the Holy Ghost
displays itself to this end, constituting and forming them into
assemblies, establishing local rulers in them, outside and independently
of the action of the apostles and assembly at Jerusalem, and the
obligation of the law which was still maintained there.

A question concerning this (that is, whether it could be allowed) is
soon raised at Antioch. It is no longer the opposition of the Jews
hostile to the gospel, but the bigotry of those who had embraced it,
desiring to impose the law on the converted Gentiles. But the grace of
God provides for this difficulty also.
