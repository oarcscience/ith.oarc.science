### [Psalms Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001)

Such is the general basis of the godly man's confidence and walk; but
they are not insensible to the evil, but can present it to the Lord.
This is the subject of Psalm 12, "Help, Jehovah, for the godly man
ceaseth." Jehovah will cut off the proud and deceitful lips. It is the
character of the wicked. He knows no check, no bridle to his will says,
Who is Lord over us? But it is just for his oppression of the poor that
Jehovah arises. God's word, on which these had relied, and which
promised help as the necessary witness of Jehovah's character to which
they looked, is a sure and well-tried word. It will bear infallibly its
promised fruit. There is nothing deceitful in it. Jehovah will keep His
poor from the generation of the wicked. But the wicked have full scope
when the worthless are exalted on high.
