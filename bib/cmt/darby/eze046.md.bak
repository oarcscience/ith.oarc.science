### [Ezekiel Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 45 and 46.

The portion of the priests in the land is assigned them-close to that of
the sanctuary. The portion of the Levites was to adjoin that of the
priests, and then came the possession of the city and its suburbs. That
which remained of the breadth of the land was for the Prince and for the
inheritance of His children, in order that the people should no longer
be oppressed. All the rest of the land was for the people. Provision is
also made for the daily offerings, and for those of the Sabbath. The
other appointed offerings were to be made by the Prince.

Some details require one or two remarks. The cleansing of the sanctuary
commences the year. It is no longer an atonement at the end of seven
months to take away the defilements that have been accumulating. The
year opens with an already accomplished cleansing. Afterwards, in order
that all may have communion with the sufferings of the Paschal Lamb, an
offering is made on the seventh day of the month for every one that
erreth, and every one that is simple ([Eze
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020).md). During the feast they offered
seven bullocks instead of two. The character of worship will be perfect.
The sense of Christ's acceptance as the burnt-offering will be perfect
in that day. The feast of Pentecost is omitted-a circumstance of great
significance, for this feast characterises our present position. Not
that the Spirit will not be given in the world to come, when Christ
shall establish His kingdom. But this gift is not that which, connecting
us with a heavenly Christ and the Father in Christ's absence,
characterises that period as it does the present time. For Christ will
be present.

We have observed that the prophet sees everything in a point of view
connected with Israel. Thus the remembrance of redemption, the passover,
the basis of all, and the enjoyment of rest celebrated at the feast of
the tabernacles, will characterise the position of Israel before God.
The two feasts are celebrated in the recognition of the full value of
the burnt offering presented to God. Another circumstance which
distinguishes the worship of this millennial day is, that the two feasts
which are types of that period are marked out in the worship-the
Sabbath, and the new moon, rest and re-establishment, Israel appearing
anew in the world. The inner gate on the side of the east was open on
that day, and the Prince worshipped at the very threshold of the gate
and the people before the gate (chap. 46). The other days it was shut.
They stood thus before Jehovah in the consciousness of the rest which
God had given to Israel and of His grace in again manifesting His people
in the light. Nevertheless it still remains true that neither the people
nor the Prince entered within. Those who are the most blessed on the
earth in that day of blessing will never have that access into God's
presence which we have, by the Spirit, through the veil. Pentecost
belongs to, and links itself with, the rending of the veil; and gives us
to walk in all liberty in the light, as God Himself is in the light,
having entered into the holy place by the new and living way which He
has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh. The
Prince entered by the outer door on the side of the east, and he went
out by the same door. In the solemn feasts, the people went in by the
north gate and came out by the south gate, and the Prince in their
midst. When he went in alone, as a voluntary worshipper, he entered and
retired again by the eastern gate. These ordinances, while giving
remarkable honour to the Prince, in connection with the glory of God,
who gave him his place among the people, equally secured that which
follows ([Eze 46:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#016).md) of the
brotherly and benevolent relations between him and the people of God,
and took away all opportunities of oppression.
