### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

Chapter 9 presents Jehovah Himself as directing the judgment in such a
manner that Israel should in no wise escape it, God treating them as He
would the nations that were strangers to Him, as the Philistines or the
Syrians, whom, in His providence, He had brought from other lands.
Nevertheless God did not forget Israel. He executed the judgment
Himself, so that, while Israel should be sifted among all the nations,
not one grain should be lost. The wicked who did not believe in the
judgment should be overtaken by it.

In that day (that is, in the day of Jehovah's final judgment) He would
not raise up the tabernacle of Jeroboams and of Jehus, although He had
given them a place for a time during His longsuffering government; but
(fulfilling His own purposes of grace) He would raise up the tabernacle
of David His elect, and rebuild it in its glory. He would raise it
entirely from its ruins, that His seed might possess the remnant of Edom
and of all the heathen that are brought to know the name of Jehovah.
\[See Note \#1\] At that time Jehovah would also bring Israel back from
their captivity, and re-establish them in full blessing. They should
enjoy the fruits of their land. Jehovah would plant His people upon
their land, and they should be no more pulled up. It was the land which
He Himself had given them.

Thus we find, in the prophet Amos, the judgment of the kingdom of
Israel; but this judgment applied to the whole of Israel as a nation,
and their assured restoration, in connection with the re-establishment
of the house of David in the last days-a re-establishment accomplished
by God, which nothing should again overthrow. He would plant them, and
none should pluck them up: a testimony which assuredly has never been
fulfilled, and as assuredly will be; Israel shall be in their own land
and never again removed. In general, then, this prophet sets before us,
not great public events in the government of God, but the ways of God
with His people, in view of their moral condition; the ten tribes, or
the kingdom of Israel, being looked at as representing all Israel as a
responsible nation, the link of their condition at that time with their
original position (when, through the grace and power of Jehovah, they
had come up out of Egypt), being the golden calves of Sinai and of
Bethel. The prophecy closes, as we have seen, with the re-establishment
in blessing of the whole people, under the house of David, according to
the sovereign grace of God who changes not. It should be, for the whole
nation, the sure mercies of David.

Note \#1

This passage is quoted by the apostle James in Acts 15. Here (in Amos)
it is quite clear that it applies to the last days, and it has sometimes
been attempted to apply it to the same period in Acts also, laying
stress on the words, "After this." But I am persuaded that those who do
so have not rightly apprehended the meaning of the apostle's argument.
He quotes this passage for one expression alone, without dwelling on the
remainder; and this is the reason, I doubt not, that he is satisfied
with the translation of the Septuagint. This expression is, "All the
Gentiles upon whom my name is called." The question was, whether
Gentiles could be received without becoming Jews. After having affirmed
this principle, he shews that the prophets agreed with his declaration.
He does not speak at all of the fulfilment of the prophecy; he only
shews that the prophets sanction the principle, that Gentiles should
bear the name of Jehovah-"All the Gentiles upon whom my name is called."
There would then be such. God knew all His works from the beginning of
the world, whatever might be the time of their manifestation.
