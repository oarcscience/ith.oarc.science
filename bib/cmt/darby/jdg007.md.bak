### [Judges Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

Thirty-two thousand men followed Gideon. But Jehovah will not have so
many. He alone must be glorified in their deliverance. Their faith was
indeed so weak, even while the Spirit of God was at work, that, when in
the presence of the enemy, twenty-two thousand men were content to
return at Gideon's invitation. The movement produced by the faith of
another is quite a different thing from personal faith. But ten thousand
men are still too many. Jehovah's hand alone must be seen. Those only
may remain who do not stop to quench their thirst at their ease, but who
refresh themselves hastily, as opportunity offers, more occupied with
the combat than with their own comforts by the way. This was what was
needed for Israel-that Jehovah should have His place in their hearts and
faith; and it suited the just judgment of God in Israel that they
should, as to their place in the work, be left out of the glory of it.

Gideon now displays entire confidence in God. Previously, the weakness
of his faith had made him look too much at himself, instead of simply
looking to God. His deep sense of Israel's condition prevented his
hesitating for a moment because the people were not with him; what could
be done with this people? In the mistrust which arose from a disposition
to look too much to himself, what he needed was the certainty that
Jehovah was with him. But, having now the assurance that Jehovah will
deliver Israel by his means, he trusts entirely to Him.

Jehovah throws terror and alarm into the midst of the enemy; and
acquaints Gideon with this. It is affecting to see the care which God
takes to impart confidence to His servant, suitably to the need which
the state of things had created. Already the name of Gideon resounded
with dread in the numerous army of the Midianites. Then,
terror-stricken, they destroy each other. The confidence of the
Midianites, founded only on Israel's want of power, melted away before
the energy of faith; for the enemy's instruments have always a bad
conscience. It is Jehovah who does everything. The trumpets and the
lamps alone announce His presence, and that of His servant Gideon. The
multitude of Israel pursue the enemy, profiting by the work of faith,
although without faith themselves: the usual result of such a movement.
