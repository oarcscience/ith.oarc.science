### [Numbers Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 32 and 33.

There is another thing connected with this: if we have occasioned wars
out of Canaan, it is also through the indispensable wars of the people
of God against those who opposed their march through the wilderness,
that they have acquired a good land, and, up to a certain point, rest,
on this side Jordan, that river of death which serves as a boundary to
the true land of promise. Having possessions down here to which the
heart clings, the heart clings also to the blessings which are on this
side Jordan, to that measure of rest which the people of God have
acquired out of Canaan. "Bring us not," they say, "over Jordan." Moses
felt the bearing of this wish. If he could not enter the land, according
to the government of God, his heart was there nevertheless. He recalls
the contempt of the pleasant land at Kadesh-barnea, and severely rebukes
Reuben and Gad.

However, the tribes engaging to go equally forward until the land were
conquered, he grants their request and settles them in the land, with
the half-tribe of Manasseh. Nevertheless, the history of the holy book
shews us that these tribes were the first to suffer, and to fall into
the hands of the Gentiles. "Know ye not," says Ahab, "that Ramoth in
Gilead is ours, and the Syrians possess it?" Happy they who patiently
wait for the blessings of God, till they have gone over Jordan, and who,
in the meanwhile, take patience for their portion, rather than the
blessings which are on this side! Though they are the gifts of the
providence of God, they are less secure; and even spiritual blessings,
if the assembly take this world as the seat of them, though real, yet
deceive the hopes of the saints. There are no frontiers like Jordan,
appointed by God as such in His counsels of grace.

If God numbers His people name by name, He shews, at the same time, His
government and His faithfulness; for, though He had kept them, as a
people, yet there were none of the first numbering left, save Caleb and
Joshua. He remembers, also, all their long journey through the
wilderness; each stage is before His eyes and in His memory; and now He
lays down, in principle, the possession of the land by the people, and
the total destruction of the inhabitants, who were to be entirely driven
away and not to abide in the midst of Israel: else those who were left
would be a torment for the people, and God also would do unto Israel, as
He had done to those nations. It is a dangerous charity, then, that
which spares the enemies of God, or rather which spares itself, through
unbelief, in its conflicts with them, and which is soon led to form with
them connections that bring the judgment which those enemies have
inherited, and themselves also deserved.
