<p>On the occasion of renewed iniquity the prophet announces the certain ruin of the people. Nevertheless Zedekiah, though carried captive to Babylon, should die there in peace. [See Note #1] In the succeeding chapters we have some details of the obstinate rebellion which led to the destruction of Jerusalem and of all Judah.
<p>Note #1
<p>God's ways in this are remarkable. He had broken the oath of Jehovah, and he is judged as profane. It was mainly through the influence of others (for he was disposed to listen to Jeremiah), and therefore mercy is extended to him.
