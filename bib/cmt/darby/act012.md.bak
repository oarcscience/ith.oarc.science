### [Acts Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001.md)

Herod, to please the Jews, begins to persecute the assembly in that
city. We may remark here, that the company of believers at Antioch are
also called the assembly (church), which is the case nowhere else as
yet. All were accounted as forming a part integrally of the work at
Jerusalem, \[See Note \#18\] even as all Jews were in connection with
that centre of their religious system, however numerous their synagogues
or great the influence of their rabbis. Every Jew, as such, sprang from
Jerusalem. Barnabas and Saul assemble with the church or assembly at
Antioch. A local assembly, conscious of its existence distinct from,
while connected with, Jerusalem has been formed; and assemblies without
a metropolis begin to appear.

To return to Jerusalem. Herod, an impious king, and in certain respects
a type of the adversary king at the end, begins to persecute the
faithful remnant at Jerusalem. It is not only the Jews who are opposed
to them. The king whom, as Jews, they detested unites himself to them by
his hatred to the heavenly testimony, thinking to win their favour by
this means. He kills James, and proceeds to take Peter and put him in
prison. But God preserves His servant, and delivers him by His angel in
answer to the prayers of the saints. He allows some to be slain (happy
witnesses to their heavenly portion in Christ), and preserves others to
carry on the testimony on earth, in spite of all the power, apparently
irresistible, of the enemy a power which the Lord baffles by the
manifestation of that which belongs to Him and to Him alone, and which
He employs when He will and how He will. The poor saints, although
praying fervently (they had prayer-meetings in those days), can hardly
believe, when Peter comes to the door, that God had really granted their
prayer. The desire presents itself sincerely to God; faith can scarcely
reckon upon Him.

Herod, confounded by the power of Him whom he resisted, condemns the
instruments of his hatred to death, and goes away to the Gentile seat of
his authority. There displaying his glory, and accepting the adulatory
homage of the people, as thoughhe were a god, God Himself smites him,
and shews that He is the governor of this world, however great the pride
of man. But the word of God extends through His grace; and Barnabas and
Saul, having fulfilled their ministry, return to Antioch, taking with
them John whose surname was Mark.

Note \#18

There is a question of the reading in [Act
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md), which does not however affect
the general thought, that a local assembly, distinct from Jerusalem,
composed primarily of Gentiles, was now formed.
