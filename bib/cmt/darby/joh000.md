Introduction to John

The Gospel of John has a peculiar character, as every Christian
perceives. It does not present the birth of Christ in this world, looked
at as the Son of David. It does not trace His genealogy back to Adam, in
order to bring out His title of Son of man. It does not exhibit the
Prophet who, by His testimony, accomplished the service of His Father in
this respect here below. It is neither His birth, nor the commencement
of His gospel, but His existence before the beginning of everything that
had a beginning. "In the beginning was the Word." In short, it is the
glory of the Person of Jesus, the Son of God, above all dispensation a
glory developed in many ways in grace, but which is always itself. It is
that which He is; but making us share in all the blessings that flow
from it, when He is so manifested as to impart them.
