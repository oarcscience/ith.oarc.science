### [Psalms Chapter 94](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#001.md)

Psalm 94 gives us this cry, which is at the same time the expression of
the fullest intelligence of their position, of the dealings of God, of
the position of the wicked, and the result about to be produced, and, as
all the psalms in this book, founded on known relationship with Jehovah.
We have seen that Psalm 91 is Christ's taking this place with the
people, that full blessing may come on them as thus associated with Him.
Psalm 94 addresses itself to Jehovah as the God of vengeance, and
demands that He should show Himselflift Himself up as Judge of the earth
and give a reward to the proud. The "how long" is made pressing and
urgent. The conduct and impiety of the wicked is stated. Verses 4-11
([Psa 94:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#004).md) address the unbelieving
Israelites on the folly of this. Verses 12-15 ([Psa
94:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012).md) give a most instructive
explanation of the ways of Jehovah Blessed is the man whom Jehovah
chastens and teaches out of His law. This is the position of the
suffering remnant, to give him quiet from the days of evil until the pit
be digged for the ungodly.

No doubt, as indeed is expressed in the Psalms, the godly had sometimes
well-nigh forgotten this (Psalm 73), not always ([Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005).md); but faith does not, and this is
the true meaning of the remnant's sorrowsof ours too under our Father.
The heart in the midst of evil has to say to God, not only in
submission, but as a cup given of Jehovah (of our Father). Hence the
distraction and distress felt in meeting man's will in our will without
resource is gone; and God, the will being subdued (the great hindrance),
teaches the submissive heart, which is in a true position before Him.
\[See Note \#1\] For faith it was withal a settled thing that Jehovah
would never cast off His people. But judgment would return to
righteousness, and the upright in heart would follow it. This is the
great and all-important principle of the change which takes place in
these psalms. Judgment, long separated from righteousness, now returns
to it. Judgment was in Pilate, righteousness in Christ. There the
opposition was perfect more or less everywhere else. Suffering for
righteousness' sake and divine righteousness established in the heavens
may be, and assuredly is, a yet better portion. It is Christ's as man,
now glorified, but it is not the maintenance of righteousness on the
earth. This will now be effectually maintained. But who shall be found
to make it good? Who will take up the cause of the godly one, or stand
up for the remnant against the mighty workers of iniquity? If Jehovah
had not, their souls had soon gone down to silence. How true this was
(as to men) of Christ, how fully He can enter into this, I need hardly
say. Even when the remnant feared falling, Jehovah helped them. And in
the overwhelming of thought, where all the power of evil was, Jehovah's
comforts delighted his soul. In Verse 20 ([Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020).md) a most remarkable appeal is
made. Were the throne of iniquity and Jehovah's throne about to join
together? If not, the days of the throne of iniquity were numbered. That
wickedness was there, was now patent. But Jehovah, the defence of the
godly, the Judge of the wicked, whose iniquity He would bring on
themselves Jehovah would cut them off. Thus the fullest review, as I
have said, of the whole position and of Jehovah's ways is remarkably
given to us in this psalm.

Note \#1

Christ, however deeply feeling what was before Him, was just the
opposite of this struggling of will, being perfect in subjection (John
12 and Gethsemane). Peter would have resisted, but Christ took the cup
as His Father's will.
