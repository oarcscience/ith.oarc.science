### [Psalms Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)

What the righteous remnant are to do when the power of evil is thus
dominant in Emmanuel's land, Psalm 11 treats of. Psalms 11-15, as I have
already remarked, give the thoughts and feelings of the remnant at that
time (that is, consequent on the state of things spoken of in Psalms 9,
10). I will now trace the outline of these five psalms. Psalm 11
presents to us the righteous repelling the idea of quailing, as void of
resource, before the godless wickedness of those who fear not God. He
trusts in Jehovah. Still the wicked, with all will, seek the destruction
of those who are true of heart. And if all human resource fails all that
was a ground on which hope could be built for the earth, what was the
righteous to do? Jehovah is as stable as ever. He is in His holy temple
has His place on earth, which faith owns, let it be ever so desolate;
and His throne is in heaven: no evil can enter there, and it rules over
all.

But there is more than this. If He abide in sure repose, because
Almighty and far above all evil, in heaven, He looks on the earth He
governs it, for this, not the assembly's heavenly portion, is our
subject here and indeed in all the Old Testament. His eyes behold, His
eyelids try, the children of men. This is a most solemn and consoling
truth for those in trial. But the ways of God in government are still
further revealed. The Lord tries the righteous: so the history of Job, a
picture of what happens to Israel, teaches us. The present state of
things is not in any way a revelation of the government of God. Faith
knows God has the upper hand, and that all things work together for good
to those that love Him; but immediate government, so that the present
state of things should show the result of God's estimate of good and
evil here below, is not in exercise. If it were so, no evil could be
allowed. The righteous would flourish, and all he does prosper. But it
is not so. The assembly, meanwhile, has her portion out of the world,
has her place of abode where Christ has gone to prepare her one. She
suffers with Him and will reign with Him. But as to all His saints, He
tries them; as to the wicked, whom He abhors, upon them He will rain
judgment, snares, and fire and brimstone; for the righteous Jehovah
loves righteousness, His countenance beholds the upright. Here is the
clear ground for faith then, when the remnant are in trial. God beholds
He tries the righteous, and will in due time execute judgment. It
involves this: the righteous Jehovah loves righteousness.
