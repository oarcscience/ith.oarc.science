### [Isaiah Chapter 53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)

Chapter 53. Israel's unbelief is declared. The structure of this most
interesting chapter is as follows. As we have seen, in the Psalms and
elsewhere, the full repentance of Israel comes after their deliverance.
That is, when (as judged of Jehovah) their chastening is over, the
glorious manifestation of Christ as their deliverer produces the deep
sense of their sin in having rejected Him. This is Psalm 130. It is the
affliction of the day of atonement. This chapter (53) expresses it.
After Verse 1 ([Isa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)) the Spirit
speaks by the mouth of the escaped remnant of Israel. They confess their
sin in having despised Him. Nevertheless there is faith now in the
efficacy of His work ([Isa 53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)).
Verse 1 ([Isa 53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)) shews that the
testimony of Christ, addressed to faith, had been rejected. They believe
when they see Him. I need not comment on this chapter, which is engraved
on every true Christian's heart. We, by the work of the Holy Ghost sent
down from heaven, have anticipated, and more than anticipated, their
faith in the value of that work which is here spoken of; and their sin,
which, as far as the nation was concerned in it, they here acknowledge.
They had esteemed Him smitten, rejected of God, but the meaning of this
is now seen. In Verse 11 ([Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)),
it is my belief that the two parts of Christ's work are distinguished.
By His knowledge He shall bring many to righteousness, or instruct many
in righteousness, and He shall bear their iniquities.
