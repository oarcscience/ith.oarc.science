### [1 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

He makes himself houses in Jerusalem, and prepares a place for the ark
of God, pitching a tent for it. Warned by the calamity \[See Note \#1\]
which his neglect had brought upon Uzza, the first time he undertook to
bring back the ark, David now gathers, not only all Israel together, but
also the Levites and the children of Aaron. This gives occasion to the
setting forth of the whole order of Levitical service as it had been
appointed by David, and of the relation between the priesthood and
royalty; that is, that the former is subordinated to the latter, the
king being Jehovah's anointed, although the service of the sanctuary
belonged to the priesthood.

As the head, David orders everything and appoints psalmody for the
service of God. Then by the help of God, the ark is brought from the
house of Obed-edom into the tent prepared for it in Zion, with offerings
to God who helped the Levites by His power, and with joy and songs of
triumph. David himself, clothed with a robe of fine linen and an ephod,
dances and plays before the ark of Jehovah who was going up to His place
in Zion. This action-unintelligible to the unbelieving Michal, to whom
the king's behaviour was therefore unintelligible also-was of very great
importance. It identified kingly power in Zion (that is to say, the
kingly power of Christ, as deliverer in grace) with the token of
Jehovah's covenant with Israel-a token established there in grace, when
Israel had already failed entirely under the law, and even after their
rejection of God as their King.

The Aaronic priesthood was not able to maintain the people's
relationship with their God, and consequently the outward order had
completely failed. The altar at which the priests were to sacrifice was
elsewhere (at Gibeon), and not before the tent which contained the ark.
And the ark, which was the sign of the covenant and of the throne of
Jehovah, was at a distance from the altar at which the priests
ministered.

The covenant of Jehovah is connected with the kingly power, and that in
Zion-the place which He had chosen for His rest. David himself assumes
somewhat of the Melchisedec character, but only in testimony and by
anticipation ([Ch1 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001).md). In these
Verses the priests do not appear. In order to apprehend more clearly the
import of the removal of the ark to Zion, it will be well to consider
[Psa 78:60-72](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060.md) and Psalm 132, and to
compare [Ch1 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#008.md) of the latter with
what Moses said during Israel's journey in the wilderness ([Num
10:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035).md). It is interesting to see
that each petition in the earlier part of Psalm 132 is exceeded by its
fulfilment at the close.

The circumstance of the ark not being taken to the tabernacle at Gibeon
was also of deep significance. It was completely judging the whole
system connected with this tabernacle. The tabernacle was still in
being, as well as the altar, and the priests offered sacrifices there;
but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had been taken away from it. The
king disposed of the latter by his authority, placing it elsewhere. Ever
since the ruin of Shiloh this judgment had continued as a chastisement
executed by the enemy; but, now that God interposes by means of David
and acts in power, this power places the visible sign of His covenant
with His people elsewhere. The kingly power is established at Jerusalem,
and the sign of God's covenant is taken away from the tabernacle of the
congregation to be placed on Mount Zion, the seat of the kingly power.
When the people were to journey, Moses said \[See Note \#2\], "Rise up,
Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee
flee before thee." This was when the ark went before them to search out
a resting-place for them. When it rested, he said, "Return, O Jehovah,
unto the ten thousand thousands of Israel." But, when God had up to a
certain point given rest to Israel, they knew not how to enjoy it. They
took the ark out of its place to carry it into the camp of Israel, when
defeated on account of their unfaithfulness by their enemies; but this
was not now the place for the ark. Neither the one nor the other of
Moses's expressions was suitable to this transfer of the ark to the
midst of the camp. The ark was taken, and, as we have seen elsewhere,
Ichabod was pronounced upon the people \[See Note \#3\]. But the
faithfulness of God is abiding; and, now that He has interposed in grace
and power, and that the throne is established as the vessel of this
power and grace, another word is given: "Arise, O Jehovah, into thy
rest, thou and the ark of thy strength" ([Psa
132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008).md). Israel, the camp, and the
priesthood were no longer the rest of God.

Note \#1

It is to be observed, that, although this had its origin in the guilty
forgetfulness of David, it nevertheless gave occasion through grace to
his being set in his true position for the regulation and appointment of
all that concerned the Levites' service. It is always thus with regard
to faith, for the purposes of God are fulfilled in favour of it. Man in
his zeal may depart from the will of God, and God will chasten him, but
only to bring him into more honour, by setting him more completely in
the position which God has purposed, and in the understanding of His
ways, according to which He will magnify His servant.

Note \#2

Thus in the wilderness, it was Israel journeying, who were seeking their
rest, who were to find enemies on their way, and whose faith recognised
these enemies as the enemies of Jehovah; or Israel carefully surrounding
the token of the presence of their God, when He gave a temporary rest
unto His people.

Note \#3

Expressed in these words, He has "delivered his strength into captivity,
and his glory into the enemy's hand" (Psalm 78).
