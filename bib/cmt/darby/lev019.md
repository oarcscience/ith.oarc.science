### [Leviticus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 19 and 20.

Chapters 19, 20, carry us somewhat farther. They were to be holy, for
Jehovah was holy. Chapter 19 takes up rather the side of good, though
keeping themselves from all that was profane, or profaning what was
holy; but we find what is good and kind and comely, what ought to be
their conduct, in various details, in the relationship they sustain one
with the other, either with regard to various dangers to which they were
exposed in their walk, in their every-day circumstances: for they had to
do with God, and Jehovah was their God. The people of God were, in all
their ways, to walk in a manner worthy of this relationship, and even to
understand what was suitable to man, to every relationship in which they
were found, according to God. Thus, though it was not here priesthood,
it was the practical maintenance of this relationship with Him who dwelt
among them, and to whom they drew nigh, by guarding against defilements
unsuited to those who were in it. It is here we find the precept to love
our neighbour as ourselves.

Chapter 20 guards more against the evil and corruption which was found
amongst the nations. In both they are called to be holy, in chapter 19
more in conformity to the character of God, in chapter 20 to keep apart
from idols and evil because Jehovah had sanctified them to Himself. It
insists upon purity in every respect.
