### [Matthew Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)

chapter 19 carries on the subject of the spirit that is suited to the
kingdom of heaven, and goes deep into the principles which govern human
nature, and of what was now divinely introduced. A question asked by the
Pharisees for the Lord had drawn nigh to Judea gives rise to the
exposition of His doctrine on marriage; and turning away from the law,
given on account of the hardness of their hearts, He goes back \[See
Note \#58\] to God's institution, according to which one man and one
woman were to unite together, and to be one in the sight of God. He
establishes, or rather re-establishes, the true character of the
indissoluble bond of marriage. I call it indissoluble, for the exception
of the case of unfaithfulness, is not one; the guilty person had already
broken the bond. It was no longer man and woman one flesh. At the same
time, if God gave spiritual power for it, it was still better to remain
unmarried.

He then renews His instruction with respect to children, while
testifying His affection for them: here it appears to me rather in
connection with the absence of all that binds to the world, to its
distractions and its lusts, and owning what is lovely, confiding, and
externally undefiled in nature; whereas, in chapter 18, it was the
intrinsic character of the kingdom. After this, He shews (with reference
to the introduction of the kingdom in His Person) the nature of entire
devotedness and sacrifice of all things, in order to follow Him, if
truly they only sought to please God. The spirit of the world was
opposed at all points, both carnal passions and riches. No doubt the law
of Moses restrained these passions; but it supposes them, and, in some
respects, bears with them. According to the glory of the world, a child
had no value. What power can it have there? It is of value in the Lord's
eyes.

The law promised life to the man that kept it. The Lord makes it simple
and practical in its requirements, or, rather, recalls them in their
true simplicity. Riches were not forbidden by the law; that is to say,
although moral obligation between man and man was maintained by the law,
that which bound the heart to the world was not judged by it. Rather was
prosperity, according to the government of God, connected with obedience
to it. For it supposed this world, and man alive in it, and tested him
there. Christ recognises this; but the motives of the heart are tested.
The law was spiritual, and, the Son of God there; we find again what we
found before man tested and detected, and God revealed. All is intrinsic
and eternal in its nature, for God is revealed already. Christ judges
everything that has a bad effect on the heart, and acts upon its
selfishness, and thus separates it from God. "Sell that thou hast," says
He, "and follow me." Alas! the young man could not renounce his
possessions, his ease, himself. "Hardly," says Jesus, "shall a rich man
enter into the kingdom." This was manifest: it was the kingdom of God,
of heaven; self and the world had no place in it. The disciples, who did
not understand that there is no good in man, were astonished that one so
favoured and well disposed should be still far from salvation. Who then
could succeed? The whole truth then comes out. It is impossible to men.
They cannot overcome the desires of the flesh. Morally, and as to his
will and his affections, these desires are the man. One cannot make a
negro white, or take his spots from the leopard: that which they exhibit
is in their nature. But to God, blessed be His name! all things are
possible.

These instructions with regard to riches give rise to Peter's question,
What shall be the portion of those who have renounced everything? This
brings us back to the glory in chapter 17. There would be a
regeneration; the state of things should be entirely renewed under the
dominion of the Son of man. At that time they should sit on twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. They should have the first
place in the administration of the earthly kingdom. Every one, however,
should have his own place; for whatever any one renounced for Jesus'
sake, he should receive a hundredfold and everlasting life. Nevertheless
these things would not be decided by appearance here; nor by the place
men held in the old system, and before men: some that were first should
be last, and the last first. In fact, it was to be feared that the
carnal heart of man would take this encouragement, given in the shape of
reward for all his labour and all his sacrifices, in a mercenary spirit,
and seek to make God his debtor; and, therefore, in the parable by which
the Lord continues His discourse (chapter 20), He establishes the
principle of grace and of God's sovereignty in that which He gives, and
towards those whom He calls, in a very distinct manner, and makes His
gifts to those whom He brings into His vineyard depend on His grace and
on His call.

Note \#58

The connection is here traced between the new thing and nature, as God
had originally formed it, passing over the law as something merely come
between. It was a new power, because evil had come in, but it recognised
God's creation, while proving the state of the heart, not yielding to
its weakness. Sin has corrupted what God created good. The power of the
Spirit of God, given to us through redemption, raises man and his path
wholly out of the whole condition of flesh, introduces a new divine
power by which he walks in this world, after the example of Christ. But
with this there is the fullest sanction of what God Himself originally
established. It is good, though there may be what is better. The way the
law is passed over to go back to God's original institution, where
spiritual power did not take the heart wholly out of the whole scene,
though walking in it, is very striking. In marriage, the child, the
character of the young man, what is of God and lovely in nature is
recognised of the Lord. But the state of man's heart is searched out.
This does not depend on character but motive, and is fully tested by
Christ (there is an entire dispensational change, for riches were
promised to a faithful Jew), and a rejected Christ the path to heaven
everything, and the test of everything, that is of the heart of man. God
made man upright with certain family relationships. Sin has wholly
corrupted this old or first creation of man. The coming of the Holy
Ghost has brought in a power which lifts, in the second Man, out of the
old creation into the new, and gives us heavenly things only not yet as
to the vessel, the body; but it cannot disown or condemn what God
created in the beginning. That is impossible. In the beginning God made
them. When we come to heavenly condition, all this, though not the
fruits of its exercises in grace, disappears. If a man in the power of
the Holy Ghost has the gift to do it, and be entirely heavenly, so much
the better; but it is entirely evil to condemn or speak against the
relationships which God originally created, or diminish or detract from
the authority which God has connected with them. If a man can live
wholly above and out of them all, to serve Christ, it is all well; but
it is rare and exceptional.
