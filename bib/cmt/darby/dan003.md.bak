### [Daniel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)

After this general picture, we have, historically, the characteristic
features of these empires, marking the condition into which they fall,
through their departure from God-primarily and principally Babylon. In
chapter 3 we have the first characteristic feature of man invested with
imperial power, but whose heart is afar from God-a distance augmented by
the very possession of power. He will have a god of his own, a god
dependent on the will of man; and, in this case, dependent on the
depositary of the imperial power. This is man's wisdom. The religious
instincts of men are gratified in connection with the supreme power; and
the influences of religion are exercised in binding all the members of
the empire in one blended mass around the head, by the strongest bond,
without any appearance of authority. For the religious wants of man are
thus connected with his own will; and his will is unconsciously subject
to the centre of power. Otherwise religion, the most powerful motive of
the heart, becomes a dissolvent in the empire. But the will of man
cannot make a true god; and consequently Nebuchadnezzar, although he had
confessed that there was none like the God of the Jews, forsakes Him and
makes a god for himself. The Gentile government rejects God, the source
of its power; and the true God is only acknowledged by a faithful and
suffering remnant. The empire is idolatrous.

This is the first great feature that characterises the dominion of
Babylon. But the faithfulness that opposes this wise system which binds
the most powerful motive of the whole people to the will of their head,
uniting them in worship around that which he presents to
them-faithfulness like this touches the mainspring of the whole
movement. The idol is not God at all; and, however powerful man may be,
he cannot create a god. The man of faith, subject indeed to the king, as
we have seen, because appointed of God, is not subject to the false god
which the king sets up, denying the true God who gave him his authority,
and who is still acknowledged by the man of faith. But power is in the
king's hands; and he will have it known that his will is supreme.
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are cast into the fiery furnace. But it
is in the sufferings of His people that God in the end appears as God.
He allows their faithfulness to be tried in the place where evil exists,
that they may be with Him in the enjoyment of happiness in the place
where His character and His power are fully manifested, whether on this
earth, or in a yet more excellent manner in heaven.

We may observe that faith and obedience are as absolute as the will of
the king. Nothing can be finer and more calm than the answer of the
three believers. God is able to deliver, and He will deliver; but,
happen what may, they will not forsake Him. The king in his fury defies
God. "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?" God
allows him to take his own way. The effect of his headlong rage is that
the instruments of his vengeance are destroyed by the fierce flames
prepared for the faithful Hebrews. The latter are cast into the furnace,
and (outwardly) the king's will is accomplished. But this is only to
manifest more brightly the power and the faithfulness of God, who comes,
even into the midst of the fire, to prove the interest He takes in the
fidelity of His servants. The effect, to them, of the fire is that their
bands are consumed, and that they have His presence whose form is like
the Son of God, even in the eyes of the king who denied His almighty
power. The result is a decree forbidding the whole world to speak
against the God of the Jews, the glory of that weak and captive people.
Remark here that the remnant are characterised by their faithfulness and
obedience. They manifest their faithfulness by refusing to have any god
but their own God: no concession-it would be to deny Him. For, to
acknowledge the true God, He alone must be acknowledged. Truth is but
the full revelation of Him and can only recognise itself. To put itself
on a level with falsehood would be saying it was not truth.

We find three principles marked out with respect to the remnant. They do
not defile themselves by partaking of that which the world bestows-the
king's meat. They have understanding in the mind and revelations of God.
They are faithful in refusing absolutely to acknowledge any god but
their own, who is the true God. The first principle is common to them
all. The second is the Spirit of prophecy, of which Daniel is here the
vessel. The third is the portion of every believer, although there may
be no Spirit of prophecy. The nearer we are to the power of the world,
the more likelihood there is of suffering if we are faithful. It must be
observed that all this is connected with the position and the principles
of the Jews.

Remark also that the Gentile will and power recognise God in two ways,
and by different means; both being the privileges granted to the
remnant. The first of these privileges is having the mind of Jehovah,
the revelation of His thoughts and counsels. This leads the Gentile to
own the God of Daniel as God of gods and Lord of kings. That is His
position in respect of all that was exalted above the earth. He was
supreme in heaven and earth. The second is that He interests Himself in
the poor remnant of His people, and has power to deliver them in the
tribulation into which rebellious and idolatrous (and thus apostate)
power has thrown them. The result here is that He is acknowledged, and
His faithful ones are delivered and exalted. The first is more general
and Gentile-the Gentiles' own recognition of God; the second, the effect
of deliverance for this Jewish remnant. The establishment of idolatrous
unity in religion, and the pride of human power, are the characteristics
here given of Babylon. This folly, which does not know God, fills the
whole course of time allotted to this power-"seven times." At the end
the Gentile owns for himself and praises and blesses the Most High. This
chapter then gives the Gentile power's own relationship with God, not
merely his connection with the God and people of the Jews. Hence the
title of God, in chapter 4, is the Most High that ruleth in the kingdom
of men; in chapter 3 it was 'our God' for the heart of the faithful
remnant, and 'the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,' for the world
that saw the deliverance.
