### [Psalms Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md)

In Psalm 30 we have the contrast between trust in prosperity even in
that given of God and in God Himself. He has come in and lifted up the
poor, and not left him to his foes. His favor is life. If angry, it is
but for a little moment, and for the good of His saints: the favor is
for ever. In the morning it is light, if heaviness endure for a night.
He may let them down as to the grave's mouth, but only to show His power
in infallible deliverance. He, the godly man, Israel themselves, as a
people, had trusted in given prosperity. Now, in the depth of adversity,
he has found Jehovah in deliverance. The power of evil overcome is
better than good we may lose. It is security, and in the blessing and
arms of Jehovah for us; for He is the deliverer. We see plainly here
that it is a living people to be blessed on earth ([Psa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003.md); [Psa
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#009).md). And though there may be
analogous mercies in all times, for there is a government of God as
regards Christians, to apply it to the saints now would be a dangerous
mistake. It speaks of temporal deliverance for peace in this world
(compare [Isa 64:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md). No mountain,
even if we own it to be made strong by Jehovah, is like Jehovah Himself,
even if I am at the pit's mouth. It is my mountain for my heart when I
think of it.
