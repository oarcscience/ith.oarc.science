### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md)

Man, He was come for men. He will associate others (chapter 5) with
Himself in this glorious work. He has a right to do it. If He is in
grace a servant, He is so according to the full power of the Holy Ghost.
He works a miracle well adapted to strike those whom He would call, and
which made them feel that everything was at His disposal, that all
depended on Him, that where man could do nothing He could do everything.
Peter, stricken in conscience by the presence of the Lord, confesses his
unworthiness, but drawn by grace goes to Christ. Grace raises him up,
and appoints him to speak of itself to others to fish for men. Already
it was not a preacher of righteousness among the people of God, but one
who drew into His net those that were afar off. He attracted to Himself
as the manifestation on earth of the power and the character of God. It
was grace which was there.

He was there with the will and the power to heal that which was a figure
of sin, and incurable but by the intervention of God. But God had
intervened; and in grace He can say, and says, to one who acknowledged
His power but doubted His will, "I will, be thou clean." \[See Note
\#13\] Yet He submitted to Jewish ordinances as one obedient to the law.
Jesus prayed, as a man dependent on God. This was His perfection as a
man born under the law. Moreover, He must needs acknowledge the
ordinances of God, not yet abrogated by His rejection. But this
obedience as man became a testimony; for the power of Jehovah alone
could heal leprosy, and He had healed it, and the priests were to
acknowledge that which had been done.

But He brings pardon as well as cleansing. He gives a proof of this by
removing all infirmity, and imparting strength to one who had none. This
was not the doctrine that God could pardon. They believed that. But God
had intervened, and pardon was present. They would no longer have to
wait for the last day, nor for a day of judgment, to know their
condition. A Nathan would not be required to come and proclaim it on the
part of a God who was in heaven while His people were on earth. Pardon
was come, in the Person of the Son of man come down to earth. In all
this, Jesus gave proofs of the power and the rights of Jehovah. In this
instance it was the fulfilment of [Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md); but, at the same time, He gives
these proofs as accomplished by the power of the Holy Ghost, without
measure in man, in His own Person the true Son of God. The Son of man
has power on earth to forgive sins: in fact, Jehovah was come, a man on
earth. The Son of man was there before their eyes, in grace, to exercise
this power a proof that God had visited them.

In both these instances \[See Note \#14\] the Lord, while displaying a
power fitted to extend, and that was to extend, beyond this sphere,
displays it in connection with Israel. The cleansing was a proof of the
power of Jehovah in the midst of Israel, and the pardon was in
connection with His government in Israel, and therefore proved itself by
the perfect cure of the sick man, according to the psalm already quoted.
\[See Note \#15\] No doubt, these rights were not limited to Israel, but
at that moment they were exercised in connection with this nation. He
cleansed, in grace, that which Jehovah alone could cleanse. He pardoned
that which Jehovah alone could pardon, taking away all the consequence
of their sin. It was, in this sense, a governmental pardon; the power of
Jehovah present, fully to restore and re-establish Israel wherever, at
least, faith could profit by it. Afterwards, we shall find pardon for
peace of soul.

The call of Levi, and that which follows, shews that not only was this
power of grace to extend beyond Israel, but that the old vessel was not
able to bear it. It must form a vessel for itself.

We may also remark here, on the other hand, that faith is characterised
by perseverance. In the consciousness of the evil, an evil without
remedy, and in the assurance that One able to heal is there, it does not
allow itself to be discouraged does not put off the relief of its need.
Now, the power of God was there to meet this need.

This terminates that part of the narrative which reveals, in a positive
way, divine power, visiting the earth in grace, in the Person of the Son
of man, and exercised in Israel, in the condition in which it found
them.

That which follows characterises its exercise in contrast with Judaism.
But that which we have already examined is divided into two parts,
having distinct characters which deserve to be noticed. First, from [Luk
4:31-41](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#031.md), it is the power of the Lord
manifesting itself on His part, as triumphing (without any particular
connection with the mind of the individual) over all the power of the
enemy, whether in sickness or in possession. The power of the enemy is
there: Jesus casts it out, and heals those who are suffering from it.
But, secondly, His occupation is to preach. And the kingdom was not only
the manifestation of a power which casts out all that of the enemy, but
of a power which brought souls also into connection with God. We see
this in [Luk 5:1-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001.md). Here their
condition before God, sin, and faith, are in question in a word, all
that belonged to their relationship with God.

Here, consequently, we see the authority of the word of Christ upon the
heart, the manifestation of His glory (He is owned as Lord), conviction
of sin, just jealousy for His glory, in the sense of His holiness which
should keep itself inviolate; the soul taking God's part against itself,
because it loves holiness and respects the glory of God, even while
feeling the attraction of His grace; so that, owing to this, everything
is forgotten fish, nets, boat, danger: "one thing" already possesses
the. soul. The Lord's answer then dispels all fear, and He associates
the freed soul with Himself in the grace which He had exercised towards
it, and in the work which He wrought in behalf of men. It was already
delivered morally from all that was around it; now, in the full
enjoyment of grace, it is set free by the power of grace, and wholly
given to Jesus. The Lord perfect manifestation of God in creating new
affections by this revelat ion of God, separates the heart from all that
bound it to this world, to the order of the old man, in order to set it
apart for Himself for God. He surrounds Himself with all that is
delivered, becoming its centre; and, indeed, delivers by being so.

He then cleanses the leper, which none but Jehovah could do. Still He
does not come out of His position under the law; and, however great His
fame, He maintains His place of perfect dependence as man before God.
The leper, the unclean, may return to God.

He next forgives. The guilty one is no longer so before God; he is
pardoned. At the same time he receives strength. Nevertheless it is
still the Son of man who is there. In both cases faith seeks the Lord,
bringing its need before Him.

The Lord now exhibits the character of this grace in connection with its
objects. Being supreme, being of God, it acts in virtue of its rights.
Human circumstances do not hinder it. It adapts itself by its very
nature to human need, and not to human privileges. It is not subject to
ordinances, \[See Note \#16\] and does not come in through them. The
power of God by the Spirit was there, and acted for itself, and produced
its own effects, setting aside that which was old that to which man was
attached, \[See Note \#17\] and to which the power of the Spirit could
not be confined. The scribes and Pharisees would not have the Lord
associate with the wicked and disreputable. God seeks those who need Him
sinners in grace.

When they ask why His disciples do not observe the customs and the
ordinances of John and the Pharisees, by which they guided the legal
piety of their disciples, it is that the new thing could not be
subjected to the forms that belonged to that which was old, and which
could not sustain the strength and energy of that which came from God.
The old were the forms of man after the flesh; the new, the energy of
God, according to the Holy Ghost. Moreover it was not the time for a
piety that took the form of self-mortification. What else could man do?
But the Bridegroom was there.

Nevertheless, man would prefer that which was old, because it was man,
and not the energy of God.

Note \#13

If a man touched a leper, he was unclean. But here grace works, and
Jesus undefilable touches the leper (God in grace, undefilable, but a
man touching the defiled thing to cleanse it.

Note \#14

The call of Peter is more general in this respect, that it is connected
with the Person of Christ. Nevertheless, although he was a fisher of men
(a word used evidently in contrast with the fishes he was occupied
with), he exercised his ministry more particularly with regard to
Israel. But it was power in the Person of Christ that governed his
heart; so that it was fundamentally, the new thing, but as yet in its
connection with Israel, while extending beyond them. It is at the end of
chapter 7 and in chapter 8 that we enter on ground beyond the narrow
limits of Israel.

Note \#15

Compare [Job 33:36](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#036.md) and [Jam
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md) the first outside
dispensations, and James under Christianity. In Israel, it is the Lord
Himself in sovereign grace.

Note \#16

Christ, born under the law, was subject to them; but that is a different
thing. Here it is a divine power acting in grace.

Note \#17

But here also the Lord, in giving the reasons why the disciples did not
follow the ordinances, and the institutions, of John and of the
Pharisees, connects them with the two principles already pointed out His
position in the midst of Israel, and the power of grace which went
beyond its limits. The Messiah, Jehovah Himself, was among them, in this
grace (in spite of their failure under the law, in spite of their
subjection to the Gentiles) according to which Jehovah named Himself "I
am the Lord that healeth thee." At least, He was there in the supremacy
of grace for faith. Those therefore who owned Him as the Messiah, the
husband of Israel, could they fast while He was with them? He would
leave them: without doubt that would be their time to fast. Moreover,
secondly, it is always impossible. He could not adapt the new cloth of
Christianity to the old garment of Judaism, in its nature incapable of
receiving its energy, or adapting itself to grace, worn out withal as a
dispensation by sin, and under which Israel was, in judgment, made
subject to the Gentiles. Besides, the power of the Spirit of God in
grace could not be restricted to the ordinances of the law. It would
destroy them by its very strength. The call of Levi violated, and most
openly, all the prejudices of the Jews. Their own fellow-countrymen were
the instruments of their masters' extortion, and reminded them in the
most painful manner of their subjection to the Gentiles. But the Lord
was there in grace to seek sinners. That which the Holy Ghost sets
before us is the presence of the Lord, and the rights which are
necessarily attached to His Person and to His sovereign grace, which had
come into Israel, but necessarily went beyond its limits (setting aside,
consequently, the legal system which could not receive the new thing).
This is the key to all these narratives. Thus, also, in that which
follows respecting the sabbath, the one case shews the supremacy which
His glorious Person gave Him over that which was the sign of the
covenant itself; and the other, that the goodness of God cannot abdicate
its rights and its nature. He would do good even on a sabbath-day.
