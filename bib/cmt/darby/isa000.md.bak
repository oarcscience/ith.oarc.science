Introduction to Isaiah

Isaiah takes the first place; and in fact he is the most complete of all
the prophets, and perhaps the most rich. The whole circle of God's
thoughts with respect to Israel is more given here. Other prophets are
occupied with certain portions only of the history of this people.

We will give here the division of this book into subjects. There is in
the beginning an appearance of confusion; nevertheless it helps to
explain the moral bearing of the book.

And here what a scene presents itself to our view!-sorrowful in one
aspect, yet at the same time lovely and glorious, like the first
glimmerings of dawn after a long and cold night of darkness, telling of
the bright day which soon will rise over a scene, the beauties of which
are faintly perceived, mingled with the darkness that still obscures
them-a scene that shall be vivified by the sun that will soon enlighten
it. One rejoices in this partial light: it tells of the goodness, the
energy, and the intentions of that God who has created all things for
the accomplishment of His purposes of grace and glory. But one longs for
the manifestation of the fulness of this accomplishment, when all will
repose in the effects of this goodness.

Such is prophecy. It is sorrowful, because it unveils the sin, the
ungrateful folly, of God's people. But it reveals the heart of One who
is unwearied in love, who loves this people, who seeks their good,
although He feels their sin according to His love. It is the heart of
God that speaks. These two characters of prophecy throw light upon the
two-fold end it has in view, and help us to understand its bearing.
First of all, it addresses itself to the actual state of the people, and
shews them their sin; it always therefore supposes the people to be in a
fallen condition. When they peacefully enjoy the blessings of God, there
is no need of displaying their condition to them. But, in the second
place, during the period in which the people are still acknowledged, it
speaks of present restoration on their repentance, to encourage them to
return to Jehovah; and it proclaims deliverance. And in this, the law
and so the blessings connected with it, have their place as that to
which they should return. Of this the last prophetic word from God
(Malachi 4) is an expressive instance. But God well knew the hearts of
His people, and that they would not yield to His call. To sustain the
faith of the remnant, faithful amidst this unbelief, and for the
instruction of His people at all times, He adds promises which will
assuredly be fulfilled by the coming of Messiah. These promises are
sometimes connected with the circumstances of a near and partial
deliverance, sometimes with the consummation of the people's iniquity in
the rejection of Christ come in humiliation. It is important to be able
to distinguish between that part of a passage which refers to those
circumstances which were near at hand, and that which speaks of full
deliverance shewn in perspective through those circumstances. This is
the difficult part of the interpretation of prophecy.

I would add that, although the subject of prophecy is not a figure, yet
figures are not only largely used, but they are often intermingled with
literal expressions; so that in explaining the prophetic books one
cannot make an exact rule to distinguish between figure and letter. The
aid of the Holy Ghost is necessary, as is always the case in the study
of the sacred word, to find the true sense of the passage. What I have
said is equally applicable to other parts of scripture, and in the most
solemn circumstances. Psalm 22, for instance, is a continual mixture of
figures, which represent the moral character of certain facts, with
other facts recited in the simplicity of the letter. There is no
difficulty in understanding it. "Dogs have compassed me; the assembly of
the wicked have inclosed me, they pierced my hands and my feet." The
word dogs gives the character of those present. This way of speaking is
found in all languages. For instance, it would be said, "He drew a fine
picture of virtue." Drew a picture is a figure. I say this in order that
a difficulty may not be made of that which belongs to the nature of
human language.

I come now to the contents of this important book of prophecy. It is
thus divided:-The first four chapters are apart, forming a kind of
introduction. The fifth also in itself stands alone. It judges the
people in view of the care that God has bestowed upon them. But we shall
find this judgment resumed in detail in verse 8 of chapter 9 ([Isa
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008).md). In chapter 6 we have the
judgment of the people in view of the Messiah's coming glory;
consequently there is a remnant acknowledged. \[See Note \#1\] Chapter 7
formally introduces the Messiah, Immanuel, the Son of David, and the
judgment upon the house of David after the flesh; so that there is an
assured hope in sovereign grace, but at the same time judgment upon the
last human support of the people. In chapter 8 we have the desolating
Assyrian who overruns the land, but also Immanuel (previously announced
in chapter 7) who finally brings his schemes to nought. Meantime there
is a remnant, separate from the people, and attached to this Immanuel;
\[See Note \#2\] and the circumstances of anguish through which the
apostate people must pass are alluded to, which terminate in the full
blessing flowing from Immanuel's presence. This closes with verse 7 of
chapter 9 ([Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007).md); so that we have
here in fact the whole history of the Jews in relationship with Christ.
In verse 8 of chapter 9 ([Isa 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008).md) the
Spirit resumes the general national history from chapter 5, interrupted
by this essential episode of the introduction of Immanuel. He resumes it
from the time then present, pointing out the different judgments of
Jehovah, until He introduces the last instrument of these judgments-the
Assyrian, the rod of Jehovah. And here the immediate deliverance is
presented as an encouragement to faith, and as prefiguring the final
destruction of the power that will be the rod of Jehovah in the last
days. Jehovah, having smitten the desolator, presents (chapter 11) the
Offspring of David, at first in His intrinsic moral character, and then
in the results of His reign as to full blessing, and the presence of
Jehovah established again in Zion in the midst of Israel. Thus the whole
history of the people is given us in its grand features, until their
establishment in blessing as the people of God, having Jehovah in their
midst. Only that it is to be remarked that nothing is given of
Antichrist, nor of the power of the beast, nor of the time of
tribulation as such, because that is the period during which the Jews
are not owned, though they be dealt with, while our prophecy speaks of
the time when they are owned. It is stated in general terms that God
would hide His face from the house of Jacob, and the righteous in spirit
wait for Him.

From chapter 13 to the end of chapter 27 we find the judgment of the
Gentiles; whether Babylon or the other nations, especially of those
which were at all times in relationship with Israel; the position of
Israel, not only in the midst of them, but of all the nations in the
last days (this is chapter 18); and, finally, the judgment of the whole
world (chapter 24), and the full millennial blessing of Israel (chapters
25-27). From chapters 28 to 35 we have the detail of all that happens to
the Jews in the last days. Each revelation closes with a testimony to
the glory of God in Israel.

In chapters 36 to 39 the Spirit relates the history of a part of
Hezekiah's reign. It contains three principal subjects:-the resurrection
of the Son of David as from death; the destruction of the Assyrian,
without his having been able to attack Jerusalem; and the captivity in
Babylon. These are the three grand foundations of the whole history and
state of the Jews in the last days.

From chapter 40 to the end is a very distinct part of the prophecy, in
which God reveals the consolation of His people and their moral
relations with Himself, and the double ground of His controversy with
them, whether in view of the position in which He has placed the nation
as His elect servant-the witness of Jehovah the one true God, in the
presence of the Gentiles, and their idolatrous failure-or in respect to
their rejection of Christ the only true elect Servant \[See Note
\#3\]who has fulfilled His will. This gives occasion to the revelation
of a remnant who hearken to this true Servant, as well as to the history
of the circumstances that this remnant pass through, and therefore at
the same time to that of the people's condition in the last days, ending
with the manifestation of Jehovah in judgment. The position of Israel
with respect to the idolatrous nations gives occasion also to the
introduction of Babylon, of its destruction, and the deliverance of
captive Judah by Cyrus. This idolatry is one of the subjects on which
Jehovah pleads with His people. The other and yet graver subject is that
of the rejection of Christ. For more detail we must wait till these
chapters come under examination.

Prophecy supposes that the people of God are in a bad condition, even
when they are still acknowledged, and prophecy addressed to them. There
is no need of addressing powerful testimony to a people who are walking
happily in the ways of the Lord, nor of sustaining the faith of a tried
remnant by hopes founded on the unchangeable faithfulness and the
purposes of God, when all are enjoying in perfect peace the fruits of
His present goodness-attached, as a consequence, to the faithfulness of
the people. The proof of this simple and easily understood principle is
found in each of the prophets. It does not appear that the prophets,
whose prophecies we possess in the inspired volume, wrought any
miracles. \[See Note \#4\] For the law was then in force, its authority
outwardly acknowledged; there was nothing to establish; and Jehovah's
authority was the basis of the public system of religion in the land
according to the institutions appointed by Himself in connection with
the temple. It was on practical duty that the prophets insisted. In the
midst of the ten apostate tribes Elijah and Elisha wrought miracles to
re-establish the authority of Jehovah. Such is the faithfulness of
Jehovah, and His patience towards His people. A new object of faith
requires miracles. That which is founded on the already acknowledged
word, and which does not demand; the reception of it as a new object,
requires none, whatever the increase of light or claim on conscience may
be. The word commends itself to the conscience in those who are taught
of God; and if there are new revelations, they are to the comfort of
those who have received the practical testimony, and have thus
recognised the authority of one who speaks on the part of God.

We will now examine the contents of the prophecy itself in a more
detailed way.

Note \#1:

Note here, the two great dealings of God with the conscience to convict
it of sin exemplified in these two chapters. First, the state of
blessing in which God had first set the person judged, and his departure
from it (so man in his innocence); and second, the meeting of the Lord
in glory. Are we in a state to do so?

Note \#2:

This is largely brought out in the Gospel of Matthew. The passage itself
is quoted in Hebrews 2. What is spoken of in [Isa
8:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md) is in fact the gospel history
breaking in upon the scene. Peter quotes [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014); Paul (Romans 9.md) the stumbling
stone; Matthew quotes [Isa 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md) for
Christ's apparition in Galilee.

Note \#3:

This term "servant" is a kind of key to this whole prophecy: first
Israel, then in chapter 49 the Lord takes Israel's place, at the end the
remnant. But of this more hereafter.

Note \#4:

The dial of Ahaz in this prophet may be thought an exception, but Ahaz
was really departed from God. It is also noteworthy that the apostles
never wrought miracles for their own comfort. Trophimus have I left at
Miletus sick. Epaphroditus "was sick nigh unto death, but God had mercy
on him, and not on him only but on me also."
