### [Jeremiah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001.md)

Chapter 14 refers to a famine which took place in the land. The
desolation of Jerusalem by the sword and by famine is again declared.
But observe here the touching intercession of [Jer
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#007.md); and again in [Jer
14:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017.md), the deep affliction of the
Spirit of Christ which expresses itself in the prophet's mouth. "For in
all their affliction he was afflicted." Observe also another element of
their condition, pointed out by the Apostle Peter, and by the Lord
Himself, with reference to the last days-namely, false prophets.
