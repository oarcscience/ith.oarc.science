### [Matthew Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001.md)

In chapter 22, their conduct with respect to the invitations of grace is
presented in its turn. The parable is therefore a similitude of the
kingdom of heaven. The purpose of God is to honour His Son by
celebrating His marriage. First of all the Jews, already invited, are
bidden to the marriage feast. They would not come. This was done during
Christ's lifetime. Afterwards, all things being ready, He again sends
forth messengers to induce them to come. This is the mission of the
apostles to the nation, when the work of redemption had been
accomplished. They either despise the message or slay the messengers.
\[See Note \#64\] The result is the destruction of those wicked men and
of their city. This is the destruction that fell upon Jerusalem. On
their rejection of the invitation, the destitute, the Gentiles, those
who were outside, are brought in to the feast, and the wedding is
furnished with guests. Another thing is now presented. It is true, that
we have seen the judgment of Jerusalem in this parable, but, as it is a
similitude of the kingdom, we have the judgment of that which is within
the kingdom also. There must be fitness for the occasion. For a wedding
feast there must be a wedding garment. If Christ is to be glorified,
everything must be according to His glory. There may be an outward
entrance into the kingdom, a profession of Christianity; but he who is
not clothed with that which appertains to the feast will be cast out. We
must be clothed with Christ Himself. On the other hand, all is prepared
nothing is required. It was not the guest's part to bring anything; the
King provided all. But we must be imbued with the spirit of that which
is done. If there is any thought of what was suitable to a wedding
feast, the need of a wedding garment to appear in would surely be felt:
if not, the honour of the King's Son has been forgotten. The heart was a
stranger to it; the man himself shall become so by the judgment of the
King when He takes cognizance of the guests who have come in.

Thus also grace has been shewn to Israel, and they are judged for
refusing the invitation of the great King to the marriage of His Son.
And then the abuse of this grace by those who appear to accept it is
also judged. The bringing in of the Gentiles is declared.

Here concludes the history of the judgment of Israel in general, and of
the character which the kingdom would assume.

After this ([Mat 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015), et seq..md) the
different classes of the Jews come forward, each in turn. First, the
Pharisees and the Herodians (that is, those who favoured the authority
of the Romans, and those who were opposed to it) seek to entangle Jesus
in His talk. The blessed Lord answers them with that perfect wisdom that
ever displayed itself in all He said and all He did. On their part, it
was pure wickedness manifesting a total want of conscience. It was their
own sin that had brought them under the Roman yoke a position contrary
indeed to that which should have belonged to the people of God on earth.
Apparently therefore Christ must either become an object of suspicion to
the authorities, or renounce His claim to be the Messiah and
consequently the Deliverer. Who had occasioned this dilemma? It was the
fruit of their own sins. The Lord shews them that they had themselves
accepted the yoke. The money bore the mark of this: let them render it
then to those unto whom it belonged, and let them also which they were
not doing render unto God the things that were God's. He leaves them
under the yoke which they were obliged to confess they had accepted. He
reminds them of the rights of God; which they had forgotten. Such might
moreover have been Israel's state according to the establishment of
power in Nebuchadnezzar, as a "spreading vine of low stature."

The Sadducees come next before Him, and question Him as to the
resurrection, thinking to prove its absurdity. Thus, as the condition of
the nation had been exhibited in His discourse with the Pharisees, the
unbelief of the Sadducees is displayed here. They thought only of the
things of this world, seeking to deny the existence of another. But
whatever the state of degradation and subjection into which the people
had fallen, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, changed not. The
promises made to the fathers remained sure, and the fathers were living
to enjoy these promises hereafter. It was the word and the power of God
which were in question. The Lord maintains them with power and evidence.
The Sadducees were silenced.

The lawyers, struck with His reply, ask a question, which gives the Lord
occasion to extract from the whole law, that which, in the sight of God,
is its essence, presenting thus its perfection, and that which by
whatever means it may be reached forms the happiness of those that walk
in it. Grace alone rises higher.

Here their questioning ceases. All is judged, all is brought to light
with respect to the position of the people, and the sects of Israel; and
the Lord has laid before them the perfect thoughts of God respecting
them, whether on the subject of their condition, of His promises, or of
the substance of the law.

It was now the Lord's turn to propose His question in order to bring out
His own position. He asks the Pharisees to reconcile the title of Son of
David with that of Lord which David himself gave Him, and that in
connection with the ascension of this same Christ to sit at the right
hand of God until God had made all His enemies His footstool, and
established His throne in Zion. Now this was the whole of Christ's
position at that moment. They were unable to answer Him, and no man
durst ask Him any more questions. In fact, to understand that Psalm,
would have been to understand all the ways of God with respect to His
Son at the time they were going to reject Him. This necessarily closed
these discourses by shewing the true position of Christ, who, although
the Son of David, must ascend on high to receive the kingdom, and, while
waiting for it, sit at the right hand of God according to the rights of
His glorious Person David's Lord, as well as David's Son.

There is another point of interest to be remarked here. In these
interviews and these discourses with the different classes of the Jews,
the Lord brings out the condition of the Jews on all sides with respect
to their relations with God, and then the position which He took
Himself. He first shews their national position towards God, as under
responsibility to Him, according to natural conscience and the
privileges belonging to them. The result would be their cutting off, and
the bringing in of others into the Lord's vineyard. This is [Mat
21:28-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md). He then exhibits their
condition with regard to the grace of the kingdom, and the introduction
of Gentile sinners. Here also the result is the cutting off and the
destruction of the city. \[See Note \#65\] Afterwards the Herodians and
the Pharisees, the friends of the Romans and their enemies, the
pretended friends of God, bring out the true position of the Jews with
respect to the imperial power of the Gentiles and to God. In His
interview with the Sadducees, He shews the certainty of the promises
made to the fathers, and the relationship in which God stood to them in
respect of life and resurrection. After this He puts the real meaning of
the law before the scribes; and then the position which He took, Himself
the Son of David, according to Psalm 110, which was linked with His
rejection by the leaders of the nation who stood around Him.

Note \#64

Contempt and violence are the two forms of the rejection of the
testimony of God, and of the true witness. They hate the one and love
the other, or cleave to the one and despise the other.

Note \#65

Observe here, that from chapter 21:28 to the end, we have the
responsibility of the nation looked at as in possession of their
original privileges, according to which they ought to have borne fruit.
Not having done so, another is put in their place. This was not the
cause of the judgment which was, and yet is in a more terrible way to
be, executed on Jerusalem, and which even then accomplished the
destruction of the city. The death of Jesus, the last of those who had
been sent to look for fruit, brings judgment on His murderers ([Mat
21:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md). The destruction of
Jerusalem is the consequence of the rejection of the testimony to the
kingdom sent to call them in grace. In the first case, the judgment was
upon the husbandmen the scribes, and chief priests, and leaders of the
people. The judgment executed on account of the rejection of the
testimony to the kingdom goes much farther (see [Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007).md). Some despise the message,
others ill treat the messengers; and, grace being thus rejected, the
city is burned up, and its inhabitants cut off. Compare [Mat
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036.md), and see the historical prophecy
in Luke 21. The distinction is maintained in all three gospels.
