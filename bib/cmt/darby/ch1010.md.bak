### [1 Chronicles Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1010.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 10, 11, and 12.

A brief recital of the ruin of Saul's house introduces Jehovah's
establishment of the house of David. All that took place before the
people gathered themselves to David at Hebron, and before the kingdom
was established in his house over all Israel at Jerusalem, is passed
over in silence.

After this we find, as a general subject, the order of the kingly power,
and of the kingdom as established in the house of David-the kingdom,
looked at as ordained of God in blessing, rather than the historical
account of all that took- place;-excepting, so far as was necessary to
furnish this picture. There is not perfection here; but there is the
order which God appointed. The faults and the sufferings of David,
whether before or after he was made king, are consequently passed over
in silence.

After having mentioned the king himself, anointed by Samuel according to
the word of Jehovah to rule over all Israel, the history begins with
that which constituted the strength and glory of David's kingdom. The
high priest no longer occupies the foreground. Jehovah's anointed is
essentially a man of war, although it is not always to be so. Joab and
the mighty men who had been David's companions in arms come immediately
after the king. The first place next to the king is his who delivered
Zion out of the enemy's hands \[See Note \#1\]; and this spot, chosen of
Jehovah, becomes the city of David and the seat of royal power. We are
then told how David's companions in arms successively joined him, though
yet for a long time rejected and pursued by Saul, mean as yet in
appearance, a fugitive and without power to resist.

The first who are pointed out as having come to him-a proof that God and
the knowledge of His will had more value in their eyes than parentage
and the advantages which flow from thence-are from among the brethren of
Saul (that is, of the tribe of Benjamin), and men of the greatest skill
in handling the bow and the sling, the weapons with which Saul was slain
in the battle in which he was overthrown. There were some who came from
beyond Jordan to David, while he was still concealed in the wilderness;
for faith and the manifestation of God's power tend to bring into play
the energy and strength of those who connect themselves with it. He with
whom God is attracts those with whom God is working; and their energy
develops itself in proportion to the manifestation of His presence and
favour. Many of these had been with Saul, but when with him they were
not mighty men; many also had never been with him. Yet even in Saul's
camp David had been able to slay the Philistines when all Israel was in
terror. After that, similar achievements become almost common. At the
beginning such things required immediate communion with God, so as to
shut out the influence of all that surrounded the man who enjoyed this
communion. Afterwards the surrounding influence was favourable, and, in
this sense, faith propagates itself. These were but the chief of the
mighty men whom David had. When God acts in power, He gives strength to
the weak, and produces, by the energy of faith and of His Spirit, an
army of heroes. In those who came from Benjamin and Judah we see that
there was this link of faith ([Ch1
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#016).md). They knew that David's God
helped him. David committed himself to God with respect to those who
joined him, for he was in a very difficult position towards the end of
his career of trial and affliction. Those to whom God had given energy
and strength came to him in great numbers; for everything was ripe for
his elevation to the throne of Israel, and for the transfer of Saul's
kingdom to him.

There were various characteristics in this army of God: all famous for
their valour, some among them had understanding of the times to know
what Israel ought to do, and, in this case, all their brethren were at
David's command; others were armed for battle; others had all
instruments for war, and were not of a double heart. And these things
were according to the gift of God, and they all came with one heart to
make David king; their brethren had prepared everything in abundance,
for there was joy in Israel. It is always thus when Christ is really
magnified by upright hearts who only seek His glory.

Note \#1

David having built the city from Millo round about, Joab repaired the
rest of the city. We may observe that Shammah the Harorite is not
mentioned here. Perhaps it is Shammah in [Ch1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#027.md): but this is doubtful (see [Sa2
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#025).md). It may also be observed that
the exploits of these mighty men consisted especially of victories over
the Philistines, the enemies by whom Saul, who had been raised up for
the purpose of destroying them, was overcome. Whatever may have been
their subsequent achievements, it was there they learnt to conquer, and
that they acquired the reputation which procured them a place in the
archives of God. It is well that the reader should remember the
connection between this whole history, and the establishment of the
power of Christ, the Son of David, on the earth.
