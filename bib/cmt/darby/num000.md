Introduction to Numbers

The Book of Leviticus contains the revelation of God sitting upon the
throne, where He places Himself that He may be approached by the people,
as far as they could come; that of the priesthood brought into proximity
to the throne, as far as men could have access to it; and then the
promulgation of the commandments relative to these two great facts, in
that which concerned the generality of the people.

In Numbers we have the service and walk of the people, figuratively of
the saints through this world: and, consequently, that which relates to
the Levites, and the journey through the wilderness. Now, as Leviticus
ended with regulations and warnings respecting the possession of the
land, and that with regard to the rights of God, and consequently to the
rights of His people, the Book of Numbers brings us through the
wilderness to the moment before the entrance of the people into the land
at the end of the wilderness journey, and speaks of that grace which
justifies the people at the close, notwithstanding all their
unfaithfulness.

It is important to keep in mind that as to the efficacy of redemption
the people were brought to God at Sinai ([Exo
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#013.md) and [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004).md). All in this respect was
complete (compare the thief on the cross and [Col
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#012).md). The wilderness journey is a
distinct thing; no part of the purpose of God, but of His ways with us.
Hence it is here "if" comes in and the time of testing. Jordan
coalescing with the Red Sea, coming out and going in (only the ark was
in Jordan), there was no question of judgment or enemies. It is the
experimental realisation of our death and resurrection with Christ. But
as to the journey we must reach the goal to get in.
