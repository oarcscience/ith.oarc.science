### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001.md)

But there is another element in the history of the king of glory, in
which he oversteps the limits of the king of Israel's legitimate
position; he allies himself with the Gentiles, and marries Pharaoh's
daughter. Neither the house of Solomon, nor that of Jehovah, was yet
built; but the daughter of Pharaoh, whom the king espouses in grace,
dwells in the place where the suffering and victorious king had
provisionally placed the ark of the covenant, which secures blessing to
the people, and which, when placed in the temple, will form the source
of blessing for Israel. This ark was not a covenant made with Pharaoh's
daughter; but she dwelt where the symbol of the covenant was hidden, and
she was placed under the safeguard, and sheltered by the power, of Him
who had made this covenant, and who could not break it, whatever might
be the unfaithfulness of a people who ought always to have enjoyed its
benefits. I doubt not, that hereafter a remnant of the Jews will find
themselves through sovereign grace in the same position \[See Note \#1\]
(before the glory of the kingdom, and of the house of God, is
established) under shelter of the covenant attached to the city of
David, the seat of royal grace, but the provisional seat in anticipation
of the full and entire result of the king's power. But we confine
ourselves here to recognising the principle of the bringing in of the
Gentiles, manifested in the reception of Pharaoh's daughter as Solomon's
bride.

It is well to remark, that the passage we are considering does not
introduce the light and intelligence of the heavenly places, but only,
in connection with the kingdom, the principle through which the position
of those who enjoy that grace is established. And therefore, while
admitting the Gentiles, the principle applies to this Jewish remnant of
the latter days, who are intelligent and faithful according to their
intelligence, a remnant which will be admitted according to the same
principles of grace. The people in general do not enter into this
thought. The kingdom itself even, and the blessing of the kingdom, are
not established on that footing. All doubtless will be founded on the
new covenant, and that by the presence of the Mediator of this covenant.
Still, even then, the connection of the people with God, as an earthly
people, will not be established on the efficacy of a faith which enters
into the enjoyment of the grace of the covenant while the mediator of it
is hidden, and which anticipates the public establishment of it as made
with Judah and Israel, but on the positive enjoyment of its results,
when the king shall have settled everything by his power. The brazen
altar was not in the sanctuary but in the court, marking indeed a
rejected one lifted up from the earth (and on this the future blessings
of Israel depend), but not gone into heaven and hidden, save to faith,
there. It is by that the people will approach God. It is the earth which
is the scene of the development of their religious affections and the
knowledge of God manifested on the earth. The efficacy of the cross, as
the means of approaching God on the earth, will be known to them.
Without it they could not approach Him. They will mourn when they shall
see Him whom they have pierced, but see Him as manifested down here to
those below. Blessing, pardon, new life, will be brought them down here.
They will not enter into the power of these things as hidden within the
veil. Being established on the earth, it would not even be suitable for
them to do so.

To return to our history: if the ark is on Mount Zion, there are two
ways of approaching God-before the ark, and at the altar which in fact
is confounded with the high places. Until the temple is built, the
people are on the high places, earthly and carnal even when approaching
the true God \[See Note \#2\]. God bears with it. Solomon himself goes
thither, and God hears him there. The temple is not built. If it had
been, it ought to have been the only centre of service and worship. That
God bears with a thing, until power shall act, is quite another thing
from sanctioning it after power has acted. We must remember that, if
Solomon went to Gibeon, it is because the tabernacle and the brazen
altar were there; and it was there that, according to the law, the
priests performed their functions ([Ch1
16:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036).md). The ark of the covenant was
not there. David had placed it in a tent in the city of David. These
latter points are more developed in the Chronicles (and I refer the
reader to that which will be said in the examination of that book); but
the passage we are considering would hardly have been understood without
some anticipation of what is found there.

As to the responsibility of the moment, the state of the people in this
respect appears to me to be set before us as a sorrowful state; and
Solomon himself is but on a level with the existing state of things-a
state borne with indeed by God in grace, but not after His heart. The
king thought neither of the ark nor of the hidden blessing of the
covenant, as that from which all his thoughts and actions should spring
\[See Note \#3\], and as the only means of his connection with Jehovah.
He loved Jehovah. It was given him to accomplish all that was requisite
for the manifestation of His glory; but his heart rose not to the height
of that faith which reckoned upon the secret of God's love, when the
glory was not manifested, and which discerned it through all the
existing things, even while God still bore with them. It was this which
formed the strength of David personally. The ark of the covenant in the
city of David was the symbol of this and for the time its expression.
Solomon walked no doubt in the statutes of David, and he loved Jehovah;
but he approached Him without rising above the level of the people. Only
our chapter says that he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
This continued until Hezekiah. The lustre of a great blessing often
keeps out of sight something which God bears with, as we have said, but
which produces disastrous effects when the energy which gave rise to the
blessing has disappeared. Better to be little and despised at the ark,
than to possess the glory of the kingdom and to worship on high places.

Moreover, although loving Jehovah, if we are not by faith in the secret
of the covenant at the ark, we shall always let in something which is
not according to integrity even in our own path. Before we are in the
glory, we are never on a level with the position we hold, while we have
only this position to sustain us. We must look above our path to be able
to walk in it. A Jew, who had the secret of Jehovah and who waited for
the Messiah, was pious and faithful according to the law. A Jew, who had
only the law, assuredly did not keep it. A Christian, who has heaven
before him and a Saviour in glory as the object of his affections, will
walk well upon the earth; he who has only the earthly path for his rule
will fail in the intelligence and motives needed to walk in it; he will
become a prey to worldliness, and his christian walk in the world will
be more or less on a level with the world in which he walks. The eyes
upward on Jesus will keep the heart and the steps in a path conformable
to Jesus, and which consequently will glorify Him and make Him known in
the world. Seeing what we are, we must have a motive above our path to
be able to walk in it. This does not prevent our needing also for our
path the fear of the Lord to pass the time of our sojourning here in
fear, knowing that we are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.

Solomon goes to Gibeon to offer burnt-offerings. Jehovah appears to him
there in a dream. Solomon is conscious that he needs the help of Jehovah
to fulfil the duties before him; and, through the grace of God, he
manifests a state of heart with respect to this, which is pleasing to
Jehovah. The sense of the difficulty of performing the duties of his
position, towards a people who belong to Jehovah, makes him feel his own
littleness; and the desire of not failing in the task entrusted to him
of God is uppermost in his heart, and leads him to ask for the wisdom
requisite to accomplish it. The genuineness of this sentiment is so much
the more evident, from its being in a dream that he replies to God. God
adds glory and riches to the fulfilment of this prayer. The sense of
God's goodness and the joy of his heart, bring him before the ark of His
covenant who had thus revealed Himself to him beyond his expectation.
God's answer places the king immediately under the condition of
obedience. The wisdom he had asked for is manifested in the judgment he
gives, and the people acknowledge that it comes from God. Strict justice
in vengeance had cut off the wicked at the beginning; now it is the
justice which maintains order and blessing among the people of Jehovah.
Thus will it be also with Jesus.

Note \#1

Consider here [Rev 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), and [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md).

Note \#2

The position of Solomon is morally worthy of attention He loves Jehovah;
he walks in the statutes of David; but he does not cleave to the ark
which David had placed in Zion; he offers sacrifices in the high places.
How often Christians, who do not walk outwardly in sin, do not seek in
Christ the secret of His will according to the revelation He has made of
Himself while hidden! For us the temple is not built. We may draw nigh
to the ark-Christ rejected and gone up on high; or to the brazen altar
and the high places, for this altar is confounded with them.

Note \#3

He drew nigh to it, under the influence of granted blessings, to render
thanks to God ([Kg1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#015).md).
