### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

Samuel begins to act, by his testimony, upon the conscience of the
people, and to put away that which weakened them by dishonouring God. He
tells them that, if they will turn to Jehovah with all their heart, they
must put away the strange gods, and serve Jehovah alone. A mingled
worship was intolerable. Then would Jehovah deliver them. The prophet
Samuel is now the meeting-point between the people and God. God now
acknowledges him alone.

The ark is not found again in its place until the king chosen of God is
established on the throne; it is only placed entirely in God's order
when the son of David rules in peace and in strength at Jerusalem \[See
Note \#1\]. It is consulted once ([Sa1
14:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018).md), but its presence is without
effect and without power. It exists, but in connection with those in
whom faith and integrity were no longer found, so that nothing resulted
from it. It the rather proved that God was elsewhere, or at least that
He wrought elsewhere.

But we will pursue the history. At Samuel's call the strange gods are
put away. The people gather around him, that he may pray for them. They
offer no sacrifice; they draw water and pour it out upon the ground in
token of repentance (see [Sa2 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014).md);
they fast and confess their sin. Samuel judges them there. But if Israel
assembles, even for humiliation, the enemy at once bestirs himself in
opposition; he will tolerate no act which places the people of God in a
position which recognises Him as God. The Israelites are alarmed, and
have recourse to Samuel's intercession. Samuel offers a sacrifice \[See
Note \#2\], token of entire surrender of self to the Lord, and of the
people's relationship with Him; but it is not before the ark. He
entreats Jehovah, his prayer is heard, and the Philistines are smitten
before Israel. And it was not an exceptional case, although they lost
nothing of their formidable character, or of their hatred for Israel.
Samuel brings down God's blessing upon the people, and the hand of
Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.

The cities of Israel were restored. There was peace between Israel and
the Amorites. Samuel judged Israel at Ramah and built an altar there.
All this is an exceptional and extraordinary position for Israel, in
which they depended entirely on Samuel, who, while living himself as a
patriarch, as though there were no tabernacle, becomes, through his own
relationship with God, by faith, the support and upholder of the people,
who in fact had no other.

Note \#1

Compare [Psa 78:60-61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#060.md); Psalm 132. The
ark is in connection with Sion, the seat of kingly grace. Solomon only,
as the man of peace, could build the house.

Note \#2

That is to say, a burnt-offering. This is remarkable. It was not
sacrifice for sin, but sacrifice which recognised the relationship
existing between the people and God. Christ only, as we have seen
elsewhere, is the true burnt-offering.
