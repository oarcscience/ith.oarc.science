### [Ezekiel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md)

In chapter 10 the whole city is given up to be consumed. The glory of
Jehovah presides over the judgment and commands it. He stands upon the
threshold of His house which He fills with His glory in judgment, as He
had formerly done in blessing. The throne of Jehovah was apart. We have
a renewed description of all its parts. Jehovah left His throne and
stood on the threshold of the house. This is an interesting element of
this judgment. The cherubim and the terrible wheels instinct with living
energy and full of eyes could have accomplished all. But Jehovah leads
the prophet to take personal cognisance of the various and abominable
sins and idolatries by which they profaned His sanctuary. No doubt His
providential government wrought in power to carry out His judgment, but
it was the Jehovah of the defiled house who stood personally on its
threshold to direct the judgment of the city, and personally have a mark
put on the godly and secure them in the hastening judgment ([Eze
9:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md), following, and from beginning
of chap. 8). This personal intervention of Jehovah, both to shew the
evil well known to Him, to mark and spare the mourners, and to direct
the judgment, is full of interest.
