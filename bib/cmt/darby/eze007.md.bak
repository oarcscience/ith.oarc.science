### [Ezekiel Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#001.md)

Finally (chap. 7), the whole land of Israel is under the sentence of
God, "the four corners of the land." Those who escape the general
judgment mourn alone upon the mountains, having forsaken all in
despair-having no power for resistance. The worst of the heathen should
possess the land. And the ornament of the majesty of Jehovah, which He
had established in glory, having been profaned by their abominations,
should be given up into the hands of strangers to be profaned by them.
The secret place of His holiness should be polluted. Mischief should
come upon mischief, and there should be no remedy. Jehovah would judge
the people according to their deserts. Solemn judgment was thus
pronounced on the whole nation. All is desolate, and with respect to the
relations of Israel with God-whether on the part of the people
themselves, or by means of the house of David which was responsible for
the maintenance of these relations-all was finally lost. Grace may act;
but the people and the house of David had totally failed. The name of
God had been blasphemed through His people, instead of being glorified.
The execution of judgment is now the only testimony rendered to Him. The
judgment is complete, it has fallen on the four corners of the land, and
Israel is no longer a nation. What a solemn thought it is, that judgment
should be the only testimony that can be given to God! Chapter 7 closes
this first prophecy, which is one of vast importance, as declaring the
judgment to be fully executed upon the people of God on earth.
