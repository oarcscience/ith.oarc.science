### [Numbers Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001.md)

The question is not here to conduct the people with patience through the
wilderness, where the flesh manifested itself; but there are enemies and
difficulties to be met; for there are difficulties distinct from the
conduct and the patience of life. The Israelites fight with the
Canaanites in the south, though they have not got into the land. But the
king of the Canaanites has been informed of their coming by the presence
of the spies. This was another fruit of the want of boldness of faith
which had caused them to be sent. How little we gain by the prudence of
unbelief! It gives occasion to the power and attacks of the enemy.
However, though these enemies seem to prevail at first when Israel allow
themselves to be attacked, when the Israelites are ready utterly to
destroy them God delivers them up to them. Take notice of this. But the
people, wearied, murmur again, for the way was long. They were fighting
with the Canaanites without yet possessing the land; the question was
only about destroying their power and yet possessing nothing. It was the
power of evil and that only, and resisted and put down as such. It was
for God's sake and His glory only. On their murmurs God interferes and
makes them feel all the power of the enemy, the old serpent. Christ made
sin for us is the only perfectly efficacious remedy. The mere sight of
that wonder procures healing, for the efficacy is in the thing itself
before God. Faith sees Christ made sin for us. The question is not here
about leading the people, but of answering the judgment of God, either
final or in the way of chastening, and the power of the enemy against us
in the face of that judgment, and even as the effect of that judgment.
In such a case the question is between our souls and God; it is a
question of death, or simply of the death of Jesus. We must submit to
that, as being in an irremediable condition, and, submitting to God's
righteousness, look to His ordinance-that is, to Christ lifted up for
us.

Next, Israel goes forward, but they are not yet in the land. God
relieves and refreshes them of His own free grace, without their
murmuring. He gathers the people. Israel celebrates anew, close by the
land, the wells which are found in the wilderness. They can now say
themselves, "Spring up, O well"; no more rock to smite, no more
murmurings near the land. Life at the end of their course is no longer
the question: it is salvation from the deadly wound of the serpent. They
are healed; they walk and drink with joy and songs of praise. They
dug-for their activity displayed itself in the presence of the grace of
God-and the water sprang up in the wilderness.

We meet with people with whom we do not wish to have war, but they will
not let us pass peaceably. Our warfare is with the possessors of our
inheritance beyond Jordan. If we are attacked, we must defend ourselves;
but we are not to be aggressors. Israel wishes to pass quietly through
the land of the Amorites; but these will not allow it, and they suffer
the consequences of the war they had sought against the people of God.
Israel takes their cities, and begins already on this side Jordan to
realise, as if beforehand, the possession of the promise.
