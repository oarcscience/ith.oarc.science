### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

Jerusalem is reduced to the last extremity. But this time Jehovah
appears for her deliverance, and the multitude of her enemies disappear
as a dream of the night. Everything is dark and gloomy as to the people;
all is morally overturned, and soon God will overturn everything by His
power, and change the forest into Carmel (that is, a fruitful field).
Henceforth Jacob shall no more be weak and feeble. The meek shall be
blessed, the deaf shall hear the word. The terrible one and the
blasphemer shall be consumed before Jehovah. There are two parts then in
this history, two attacks. The first succeeds against Ephraim and
against Jerusalem. The second does not succeed. Jerusalem is brought
very low, but Jehovah appears and she is delivered. The spirit of scorn
and unbelief was marked in chapter 28; the spirit of blindness in
chapter 29.
