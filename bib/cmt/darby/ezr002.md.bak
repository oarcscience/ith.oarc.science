### [Ezra Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001.md)

Nevertheless, God still gives the people-guilty under the law-an
opportunity for the exercise of faith. Let us examine the principles
that characterise the energy of the Holy Ghost in the people at the time
of their return. The first thing to be observed is that, having felt
what it was to have to do with the Gentiles, and having experienced the
power and wickedness of those whose help they had formerly sought (the
unclean spirit was, in this respect, gone out of them), the children of
the captivity resolve that Israel shall be an unmingled Israel, and
proved to be so. They are most careful in verifying the genealogies of
the people, and of the priests, in order that none but Israel should be
engaged in the work. Formerly one priest succeeded another without
previous examination; genealogy was not verified, and children came into
their father's place in the enjoyment of the privileges which God had
granted them. But Israel now, through the great grace of God, had to
recover their position. This was neither the beginning of their history,
nor the power suited to the beginning; it was a return, and the disorder
that sin had brought in was not henceforth to be endured. They were
escaping from the fruits of it, at least in part. What had any but
Israel to do there? To mark out the family of God was now the essential
thing. Deliverance from Babylon was their deliverance. It was this
family, or a small remnant of it, which God had brought, or was
bringing, out from thence. Thus, even amongst those who had come back to
Judea, whoever could not produce his genealogy was set aside; and every
priest with whom this was the case was put away from the priesthood as
polluted, whatever, as it appears, might be the reality of his
qualification. Divine discernment might, perhaps, recognise them and
their rights another day; but the people who had returned from captivity
could not do so. They were a numbered and recognised people. They dwelt
each in his own city. It was weakness, no priest with Urim and Thummim,
but it was faithfulness.
