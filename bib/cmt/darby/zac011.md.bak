### [Zechariah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md)

In connection with the judgments that should attend it, the Spirit
enters into more detail with respect to the rejection of the Messiah,
and the particular circumstances of the last days, in consequence of
this rejection. It is the history of Israel in connection with Christ.

I think that the beginning of chapter 11 speaks of the invasion of
Israel by the Gentiles. The first three Verses ([Zac
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001).md) give a picture of the general
condition of the land. In [Zac 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#004.md)
Jehovah takes up the case of His devastated flock. Their Gentile
possessors only made a spoil of them. Their own shepherds pitied them
not. Jehovah, while giving up the nation to the fruit of their iniquity,
was moved with compassion for the poor of the flock, and cares for the
oppressed. It is the spirit of the life of Christ in Israel.

The two staves represent His authority, as uniting all the nations under
Him, and binding Judah and Israel together-the double effect of the
presence of Christ. But the shepherds of Israel are cut off; and Christ,
grieved with the wicked and corrupt people, Himself abhorred by them,
leaves them to themselves and to the consequences of their behaviour. As
the result of this, He renounces for that time the inheritance of the
nations, since it is in Israel that He is to take possession of it. But
the poor of the flock have recognised in His ways the fulfilment of the
word of prophecy: they have not waited for the manifestation of the
Messiah's public glory in Israel, but have attached themselves to Him
personally, in consequence of the proofs He gave of His mission from
God. It appears to me that this comprises the apostolic work in Israel,
as well as the life of Christ. The prophecy only speaks of the fact
itself. Verses 12 and 13 ([Zac
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#012).md) relate the price at which
the nation estimated their King and their Saviour. The fulfilment of
this is known to all. The prophet here performs the thing prophetically,
marking that so it was to be according to the counsels of God. We see
also that Christ appears here as Jehovah Himself. The connection between
[Zac 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#006.md) and [Zac
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#009.md) brings out the same truth. The
thoughts of Jehovah with respect to that which He will do find their
accomplishment in the Person of Jesus. The union between Judah and
Israel, of which Christ should be the bond, is also deferred. In [Zac
11:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015.md) the prophet is seen assuming
the features of the Antichrist, to represent him in type (as previously,
the actions of Judas), in order to announce that foolish shepherd who
should be raised up in judgment from God, and who should himself suffer
the judgment he deserved. Christ came in the name of the Father-He was
not received. Another should come in his own name, and him the people
would receive.
