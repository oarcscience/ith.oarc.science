### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

The Spirit of God takes the opportunity afforded by an unparalleled
scarcity, caused by the invasion of innumerable armies of insects, to
rouse the attention of the people with respect to the day of Jehovah;
that great and terrible day which was to come, and in which His power
should be manifested in judgment-in which He, who had shewn long
patience, would at length interpose to vindicate the glory of His name,
and deliver it from the reproach cast thereon by the sin of His people,
and to take vengeance on all that magnified itself against Him. That
which is here presented to us as the rod of Jehovah is the northern
army-the same that we so often find in the prophets-the Assyrian. But,
in the end, it is God Himself who, after having chastised His people by
means of this enemy, intervenes for his destruction, and for the
judgment of all the nations gathered round Jerusalem. In examining the
prophecy, the reader may observe that it distinguishes between the
famine that ushered in the day of Jehovah, and that day itself. We have
only to compare [Joe 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md); and [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md); [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md). The state of famine and
desolation, interpreted by the Spirit of prophecy, calls on the people
to present themselves before Jehovah, because the day of Jehovah was at
hand.
