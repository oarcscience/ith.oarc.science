### [Psalms Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md)

Psalm 4 differs in this respect from Psalm 3, of which we shall see
other examples, that it is not simple confidence, but appeals to
righteousness against the sons of men, who turn all the glory that
belongs to the people of Jehovah, and especially to their king, into
shame; but Jehovah has chosen the godly. The light of Jehovah's
countenance is his resource. In [Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md), and [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md), the experienced mercy of Jehovah
is referred to.
