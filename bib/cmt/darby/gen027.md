### [Genesis Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001)

Jacob's history now begins \[See Note \#1\]. Heir of the promises, and
valuing them, he uses means to have them, evil and low in character. God
answers his faith, and chastens his evil and unbelief. God could have
brought the blessing in His own way (or made Isaac cross his hands as He
did Jacob); Jacob, led by his mother, followed his own way, and did not
wait for God. But the blessing was prophetic, and not to be recalled.
The ways of God and His purpose were not to be changed. Isaac was
guilty, and Jacob more so: all was overruled to answer faith and chasten
evil in the believer. Esau had deliberately given up the right, when he
had the choice: God was not in his thoughts: he cannot receive the
blessing when the consequences are there. Man must act by faith alone,
when the consequences are not seen, in order to be blessed, when the
time for blessing comes.

Note \#1

In general, Abraham is the root of all promise and the picture of the
life of faith: Isaac, of the heavenly man, who receives the church; and
Jacob, of Israel, heir of the promises according to the flesh.
