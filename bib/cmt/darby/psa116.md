### [Psalms Chapter 116](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#001.md)

Psalm 116 celebrates this deliverance when they were at the very point
of death. Jehovah had heard them, and they would walk before the Lord in
the land of the living. In this view it is a continual recital of the
gracious mercy of Jehovah: they were brought low and He helped them. It
drew out their love to Him. Such was Jehovah's character. He preserves
the simple. The soul so sorely tried could return to its rest. The death
of His saints was precious in His sight; and now, before all His people,
in the courts of Jehovah's house, in the midst of Jerusalem, he would
pay the vows made in his distress when he called on Jehovah. He would
offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving. The quotation of the apostle shows
how these psalms can be used as containing holy principles of life for
every saint. In spite of suffering and trial, trust in Jehovah opened
the mouth of the believer. The passage does not apply to Paul, nor did
he say in his haste that all men were liars, though there be something
like it in "all seek their own;" but the general and important principle
the apostle can adopt. The word, translated "haste," is not haste in the
sense of moral defect, hastiness, but in distressrather sudden distress
or alarm from the pressure of circumstances, and hence hasting away.
