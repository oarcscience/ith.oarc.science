### [Psalms Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)

Psalm 57 looks more at the evil and the feet being kept, leaning on the
word. This psalm, while crying to God in the same spirit and
circumstances, and under the same title, is more the expression of
confidence in God as a refuge. His wings are a covert till the evil be
overpast, and full deliverance is looked for by His gloriously putting
an end to the trial. God will send from heaven and deliver. Hence the
end of the psalm is more triumphant than that of Psalm 56. He will
praise among the peoples and various tribes of the earth, for God's
mercy and truth are great. God's publicly exalting Himself above heaven
and over all the earth is looked for. No help was on earth, none to be
looked for; but this cast more entirely on God, and thus brought out a
fuller confidence in His safeguard, and in the final display of power in
deliverance. So it ever is. God would send from heaven. How this directs
the remnant upwards, and links them with a heavenly deliverance. Then
Jehovah is praised.
