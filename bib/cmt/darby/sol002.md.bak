### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md)

The first six Verses (omitting the second) of chapter 2 ([Sol
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001.md); [Sol
2:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003).md) appear to me to be the voice of
the bride. They have been differently understood, but (I think) wrongly.
Observe here that Christ is the apple-tree. This will help us
afterwards. Moreover the bride speaks of herself. In theory she
apprehends her relationship, and speaks chiefly of herself; but there is
real affection. The Bridegroom will not allow her to be disturbed \[See
Note \#1\] when she rests with full confidence in His love. His own
voice, the only one to which she now hearkens, shall waken her. He
Himself tells her to arise, that the winter is past-the time of mourning
and sorrow. He desires also to hear her voice. Thus her heart is
re-assured: her Beloved is hers. How truly all this gives the awakening
of divine affections and confidence in the remnant which had so long
learned what it was to have Jehovah's face hidden, and how fully the
inextinguishable love of Him who wept over Jerusalem is in the
blessedest way in exercise to awaken this confidence and assure the
heart of the afflicted people! It is to me singularly beautiful, not
instruction as to circumstances nor in connection with responsibility,
but grace-Christ's (Jehovah's) own relationship with Israel.

Note \#1

Read "nor awaken love till it please."
