### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)

Psalm 114 is of the highest style of poetry, but is important to us as
directly connecting the ancient deliverance of Israel out of Egypt with
the present deliverance of the people, and seeing the same Jehovah in
both calling the earth to tremble at the presence of Jehovah. It was
right in those days. At Jacob's deliverance then, the sea fled and
Jordan was driven back. What was this? Was it affright before the
presence of man? The earth was now to tremble before Him who appeared
for the deliverance of His people then, and for their sakes turned the
sea into dry land, and the flint stone into a springing well.
