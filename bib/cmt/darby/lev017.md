### [Leviticus Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#001.md)

After this quite special instruction of the day of atonement come some
directions, not to purify from defilements, but to preserve from them
either the people or the service of the priests (chap. 17). It is to
maintain them as a people holy to God, and keep them from all that would
dishonour Him in their relations with Him, and themselves in their
relations with others. Life belongs to God. And where it is taken, it
must be offered in sacrifice and in sacrifice of course to God. The
blood must be sprinkled, and the fat burned on the altar. Thus the
danger of secret departure of the heart to demons was guarded against,
and God's title to life, and the truth of sacrifice were maintained-all
vital truths. Thus God was owned and honoured, and man's relationship
with Him.
