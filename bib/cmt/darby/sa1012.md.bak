### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#001.md)

Samuel (chap. 12) receives the people's testimony to his fidelity. He
sets before them the ways of God towards them, their ingratitude and
foolishness in having asked for a king and rejected God. Nevertheless,
while giving a sign from God which added the weight of God's own
testimony to his words, he declares to the people that, if henceforth
they would obey Jehovah, both the king and the people should continue to
follow Jehovah (that is, they would walk under His blessing and
guidance); but if not, Jehovah would be against them. For Jehovah would
not forsake them, and he himself (Samuel) would assuredly not cease to
pray for them, and would teach them the good and the right way: that is
to say, he places the people, as to their public conduct, in the
position they had chosen, and set them under their own responsibility
before Jehovah; but at the same time, full of love to them as the people
of God, their rejection of himself does not for a moment suggest the
thought to him of giving up his intercession or his testimony for their
welfare. Beautiful picture of a heart near the Lord, which, in
forgetfulness of self, can love His people as its own! To fail in this
would have been to sin against the Lord (compare [Co2
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015).md).

Here then is Saul established in his place, and his authority confirmed
by the blessing of God. Samuel retires, confining himself to his
prophetic office, and Saul is now called to prove himself faithful and
obedient in his present position, surrounded by all the advantages which
the blessing of God and the solemn act of His prophet could confer upon
him.

Let us now recapitulate the history we have been examining. Israel,
unfaithful, no longer maintain their relationship with God under
priesthood. The ark is taken, the priest dies, and Ichabod is written on
the condition of the people. God raises up a prophet, who becomes the
means of communication between Himself and the people; but, threatened
by the Ammonites, the people at length demand a king. God grants their
request, testifying at the same time His displeasure, since He Himself
was their King. The Spirit of prophecy continues nevertheless to be the
channel of divine communication to the people. Signs, which indicate the
state of the people, are given to Saul, the elected and anointed king:
first of all, some faithful ones who own the God of Bethel-that is to
say, the faithful God of Jacob, who had promised not to leave him till
He had performed all that He had promised him; and, next, the hill of
God-the seat of authority among the people-in possession of the
Philistines, the power of the enemy in the land of promise. The Spirit
of prophecy comes upon Saul, shewing him where God was amid these
circumstances; and Samuel tells him to wait for him at Gilgal. Meantime,
as we have seen, he is strengthened by the blessing of God upon his
undertakings.
