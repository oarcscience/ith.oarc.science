### [Psalms Chapter 148](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001)

Psalm 148 calls first on heaven, and all in it, to take their part in
the great Hallelujah, and praise Jehovah who had created and sustains
them in their place; and then on the earth, with all in it, to join in
praising Him whose name alone is excellent, and His glory above the
earth and heaven, but who exalts the horn of His people, the praise of
His saints (the godly ones we have seen throughout, but who now are
fully Israel), a people near to Him. The great Creator whom heaven and
earth must praise is the God of Israel, and Israel His people.
