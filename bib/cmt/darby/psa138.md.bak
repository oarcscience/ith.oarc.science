### [Psalms Chapter 138](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)

Psalm 138 gives the ground of faith God's word; and now the godly turns
to own it in worship; and when that word reaches the kings of the earth,
they shall turn and praise Jehovah and sing in His ways. Nor is His
truth all. Though so high, He has respect to the lowly; He revives,
protects, and perfects all that concerns the believing righteous. "His
mercy endureth for ever."
