### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)

Psalm 96 summons all the earth to come in, in the spirit of the
everlasting gospel. They are to own Jehovah; the gods of the nations are
mere vanity. Psalm 95 invites as of the company "Come, let us sing." Now
it is said to those who are afar off, Sing unto Jehovah, and His glory
is to be declared among the nations. Jehovah is Creator ([Psa
96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005).md). His excellency is then spoken
of, but He is known in the sanctuary in Israel on the earth ([Psa
96:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007).md). They are again summoned to
own Him there, to worship Him according to the order of His house on the
earth, for Jehovah reigns and the world is established, and Jehovah will
judge the peoples righteously. This introduces a summons to a chorus of
celebration of all this created world to rejoice before Jehovah, who
comes to judge the world with righteousness and His people with truth;
for Israel had the place of promise and the revelation of His ways.
