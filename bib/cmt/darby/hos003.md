### [Hosea Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)

Chapter 3 reveals another detail of the people's history during the time
of their rejection, a rejection followed by their return to God. Israel
should remain for a long time apart to wait for their God. They should
have neither true God nor false god, neither king, nor priest, nor
sacrifice; but afterwards they should return, and should seek Jehovah
their God, and David their king. That is to say, all Israel should seek
the true royalty originally bestowed by God, of which Christ is the
fulfilment. They should bow their heart before Jehovah and His goodness
in the latter days.
