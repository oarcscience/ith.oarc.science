Introduction to 2 Samuel

The Second Book of Samuel sets before us the definitive establishment of
David in the kingdom; and afterwards, the miseries of his house, when
prosperity had opened the door to self-will.

The path of faith and its difficulties, is that in which we walk with
God, and in which we celebrate the triumph which His presence secures to
us. A state of prosperity makes it evident how little man is able to
enjoy it without its becoming a snare to him. Prosperity not being the
path of faith, that is to say, of strength, the evil of the heart comes
out in the walk. Compare 2 Samuel 22 (the psalm by which David closes
the path of difficulty) with chapter 23, which contains his last words,
after his experience of the enjoyment of the prosperity and glory in
which faith had placed him.
