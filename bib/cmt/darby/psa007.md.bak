### [Psalms Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)

Psalm 7 appeals to Jehovah, on the ground of the righteous and more than
righteous dealing of the godly with their enemies, that Jehovah may
arise and awake to the judgment He has commanded, and that thus, by the
deliverance of the remnant by judgment, the congregation of the various
nations of the earth would compass Him about. He would then judge the
peoples, thus distinctly bringing out the future judgment. Another point
is brought out here. The Lord judges the righteous man. If a man turn
not, but go on in his wickedness, His wrath will follow him.

In all this we have the Spirit of Christ as it associates itself with
the Jewish remnant, and in certain respects Christ Himself called to
mind; that is, as passing through the circumstances which enabled Him to
enter into theirs with truth (for we have seen that the effect on His
soul personally was never what it is in the remnant). It is not His
history, but His sympathy with them. There are two principles which
connect Christ on earth and the remnant in the latter days: He takes
them in grace into His place as on earth, \[See Note \#1\] and He enters
into theirs. As to the nature and principles of their life, the
righteous have the sentiments of the Spirit of Christ as it would work
in their state. Their appeals are the expression of this. And God allows
their claims (though they have not clear intelligence respecting this),
furnishing in the Psalms expressions to them. It is a need and a desire
too which the life that is in them legitimates to His heart who can take
account of the ground Christ has laid for blessing, which makes Him
righteous in forbearance, though the righteousness, as to the Jews, be
not yet manifested. Their knowledge of what Jehovah is as respects
integrity and oppression what He has ever been makes them look for a
deliverance which seems impossible. \[See Note \#2\]

There is another expression to note here "how long?" It expresses the
expectation of faith. God cannot reject His people for ever: how long
will He deal with them as if He did, and take no notice of oppression?
Hence in one place He says, There is none that knoweth how long. As a
whole, then, these psalms are a general exhibition of the state of the
remnant of the Jews before God in the latter day, and the principles on
which their souls stand as godly not as yet the strong outpouring of
their feelings under the trial of circumstances. Is Christ then absent
from them all? Surely not, or the Psalms were not here. Christ entered
in sympathy into their condition, forms the faith of their hearts in it
by His Spirit, is thus fully found in their low estate in the best way.
His own personal feelings when on earth they do not express, \[See Note
\#3\] though He has learnt by His own sorrows in like circumstances
blessed truth to have a word in season for him that is weary.

Note \#1

See [Mat 17:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024.md), already when here
below. This may seem in a measure anticipation: still, He revealed the
Father's name to them.

Note \#2

[Lev 9:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md) strikingly shows this.
The acceptance of the sacrifice by God was not manifested till Moses and
Aaron had come out after going in ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md) Christ as priest and king. Then
the people worship, but Aaron blessed from the offering before. We know
by the Holy Ghost come out that the offering has been accepted, while
the priest is yet within the veil. And hence the full value of divine
righteousness.

Note \#3

I do not mean by this that none of the psalms do. We know this is not
so, as Psalm 22 notably shows; nor that no sentence is found in psalms
which are not wholly of Him which does express feelings He had. I have
referred to several in the course of these notes and stated the
principle of their application already; but I here speak of the psalms I
am treating of (Psalms 3-7).
