### [1 Corinthians Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001.md)

The apostle proceeds by answering a question in connection with the
subject he had been treating the will of God with regard to the
relationship between man and woman. They do well who remain outside this
relationship in order to walk with the Lord according to the Spirit, and
not to yield in anything to their nature. God had instituted marriage
woe to him who should speak ill of it! but sin has come in, and all that
is of nature, of the creature, is marred. God has introduced a power
altogether above and outside nature that of the Spirit. To walk
according to that power is the best thing; it is to walk outside the
sphere in which sin acts. But it is rare; and positive sins are for the
most part the effect of standing apart from that which God has ordained
according to nature. In general then for this reason, every man should
have his own wife: and the union once formed, he had no longer power
over himself. As to the body, the husband belonged to his wife, the wife
to her husband. If, by mutual consent, they separated for awhile that
they might give themselves to prayer and to spiritual exercises, the
bond was to be immediately acknowledged again, lest the heart, not
governing itself, should give Satan occasion to come in and distress the
soul, and destroy its confidence in God and in His love lest he should
tempt by distressing doubts (it is for,not by incontinency) a heart that
aimed at too much, and failed in it.

This permission, however, and this direction which recommended
Christians to marry, was not a commandment from the Lord, given by
inspiration, but the fruit of the apostle's experience an experience to
which the presence of the Holy Ghost was not wanting. \[See Note \#8\]
He would rather that every one were like himself; but every one had, in
this respect, his gift from God. To the unmarried and the widows, it is
good, he says, to abide as he himself was; but if they could not subdue
their nature and remain in calm purity, it was better to marry.
Unsubduedness of desire was more hurtful than the bond of marriage. But
as to marriage itself, there was no longer room for the counsel of
experience, the commandment of the Lord was positive. The woman was not
to separate from the man, nor the man from the woman; and if they
separated, the bond was not broken; they must remain unmarried or else
be reconciled.

But there was a case more complicated, when the man was converted and
the wife unconverted, or vice versa. According to the law a man who had
married a woman of the Gentiles (and was consequently profane and
unclean) defiled himself, and was compelled to send her away; and their
children had no right to Jewish privileges; they were rejected as
unclean (see [Ezr 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#003).md). But under
grace it was quite the contrary. The converted husband sanctified the
wife, and vice versa, and their children were reckoned clean before God;
they had part in the ecclesiastical rights of their parent. This is the
sense of the word "holy," in connection with the question of order and
of outward relationship towards God, which was suggested by the
obligation under the law to send away wife and children in a similar
case. Thus the believer was not to send away his wife, nor to forsake an
unbelieving husband. If the unbeliever forsook the believer
definitively, the latter (man or woman) was free "let him depart." The
brother was no longer bound to consider the one who had forsaken him as
his wife, nor the sister the man who had forsook her as her husband. But
they were called to peace, and not to seek this separation, for how did
the believer know if he should not be the means of the unbeliever's
conversion? For we are under grace. Moreover every one was to walk as
God had distributed to him.

As regarded occupations and positions in this world, the general rule
was that every one should continue in the state wherein he was called;
but it must be "with God" doing nothing that would not be to His glory.
If the state was in itself of a nature contrary to His will, it was sin;
clearly he could not remain in it with God. But the general rule was to
remain and glorify God in it.

The apostle had spoken of marriage, of the unmarried and of widows; he
had been questioned also with respect to those who had never entered
into any relationship with woman. On this point he had no commandment
from the Lord. He could only give his judgment as one who had received
mercy of the Lord to be faithful. It was good to remain in that
condition, seeing what the world was and the difficulties of a christian
life. If they were bound to a wife, let them not seek to be loosed. If
free, they would do well to remain so. Thus if they married, they did
well; not marrying, they did better. He who had not known a woman did
not sin if he married, but he should have trouble after the flesh in his
life here below. (It will be observed, that it is not the daughter of a
Christian that is here spoken of, but his own personal condition.) If he
stood firm, and had power over his own will, it was the better way; if
he married, he still did well; if he did not marry, it was better. It
was the same with a woman; and if the apostle said that according to his
judgment it was better, he had the Spirit of God. His experience if he
had no commandment had not been gained without the Spirit, but it was
that of a man who could say (if any one had a right to say it) that he
had the Spirit of God.

Moreover the time was short: the married were to be as having no wives;
buyers, as having no possession; they who used the world, not using it
as though it were theirs. Only the apostle would have them without
carefulness or distraction, that they might serve the Lord. If by
reckoning themselves dead to nature this effect was not produced, they
gained nothing, they lost by it. When married they were pre-occupied
with things below, in order to please their wives and to provide for
their children. But they enjoyed a repose of mind, in which nature did
not claim her rights with a will that they had failed to silence, and
holiness of walk and of heart was maintained. If the will of nature was
subjugated and silenced, they served the Lord without distraction, they
lived according to the Spirit and not according to nature, even in those
things which God had ordained as good with respect to nature.

As to the slave, he might console himself as being the Lord's free-man;
but (seeing the difficulty of reconciling the will of a pagan or even an
unspiritual master with the will of God) if he could be made free, he
should embrace the opportunity.

Two things strike us here in passing: the holiness which all these
directions breathe with regard to that which touches so closely the
desires of the flesh. The institutions of God, formed for man when
innocent, are maintained in all their integrity, in all their authority,
a safeguard now against the sin to which man is incited by his flesh.
The Spirit introduces a new energy above nature, which in no wise
weakens the authority of the institution. If any one can live above
nature in order to serve the Lord in freedom, it is a gift of God a
grace which he does well to profit by. A second very important principle
flows from this Chapter. The apostle distinguishes accurately between
that which he has by inspiration, and his own spiritual experience that
which the Spirit gave him in connection with the exercises of his
individual life spiritual wisdom, however exalted it might be. On
certain points he had no commandment from the Lord. He gave the
conclusion at which he had arrived, through the help of the Spirit of
God, in a life of remarkable faithfulness, and aided by the Spirit whom
he but little grieved. But it was not a commandment of the Lord. On
other points that which he did not except in this manner was to be
received as the commandment of the Lord (compare [Co1
14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037).md). That is to say, he affirms the
inspiration, properly so called, of his writings they were to be
received as emanating from the Lord Himself-distinguishing this
inspiration from his own spiritual competency, a principle of all
importance.

Note \#8

Note here, we have formally distinguished, what infidels of the modern
school have sought to confound, spiritual thoughts as a man, and
inspiration. The apostle gives his thoughts and judgment as a spiritual
man, his mind animated and guided by the Spirit, and contrasts it with
inspiration and what the Lord said. How wonderfully the Lord has
provided in scripture for everything! Compare Verse 25 ([Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025).md).
