### [Exodus Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#001.md)

For their consecration they were all washed. Aaron and his sons together
always represent the church, not as gathered in a body (a thing hidden
in the Old Testament), but in varied positions sustained individually
before God. There is only one sanctification for all-divine life. Christ
is the spring and the expression of it. We are made partakers of it, but
it is one \[See Note \#1\]. Both He that sanctifieth and they who are
sanctified are all of one. But Aaron is first anointed separately
without sacrifice, without blood. But his sons are then brought and with
him are sprinkled with blood upon the ear, the thumb of the right hand,
the great toe of the right foot \[See Note \#2\]; obedience, action, and
walk, being measured and guarded, both through the price, and according
to the perfection of the blood of Christ. And then they were sprinkled
with blood and with the oil of consecration, that is to say, set apart
by the blood and by the unction of the Holy Ghost. The washing is the
Spirit's work in the sanctifying power of the word; the anointing, His
personal presence and energy in intelligence and power-God working in
us.

And it is important to remark here that the seal of the Holy Ghost
follows on the sprinkling with the blood, not on the washing with the
water. That was needed. We must be born again, but it is not that
cleansing which, by itself, puts us in a state God can seal: the blood
of Christ does. We are thereby perfectly cleansed as white as snow, and
the Spirit comes as the witness of God's estimate of the value of that
blood-shedding. Hence, too, all were sprinkled with Aaron The blood of
Christ, and the Holy Ghost have set us in association with Christ, where
He is according to the acceptableness of that perfect sacrifice (it was
the ram of consecration), and the presence, liberty, and power of the
Holy Ghost.

All the sacrifices were offered. That for sin, the burnt-offering of a
sweet-smelling savour, the ram of consecration (which had the character
of a peace-offering), accompanied by the meat-offering. These sacrifices
have been explained elsewhere, and I only recall their import: Christ
made sin for us, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree; first
need of the soul, the sin-offering; Christ obedient unto death, devoting
Himself to the glory of His Father-but according to God's nature, and
the existence of sin, and that in us-and to us as belonging to the
Father, the burnt-offering; the communion of God, of the Saviour, of the
worshipper, and of the whole church, the peace-offering; and Christ
devoted in holiness of life upon the earth, but proved even to death,
the meat-offering.

It is to be observed that, when Aaron and his sons were sprinkled and
anointed, the sons were anointed with him, and their garments also, and
not he with them. Everything is connected with the Head. Aaron and his
sons ate the things with which the atonement had been made. Such is our
portion in Christ, the food of God whereby we dwell in Christ and Christ
in us.

Then, connected with this priesthood, comes the perpetual sweet-smelling
savour of the burnt-offering, in which the people present themselves
before God-sweet-smelling savour which is found there, as it were in the
midst of the people, according to the efficacy of which they stand in
His presence round about. There God met the people. With the mediator He
met above the ark without veil, and gave him commandment for the people
according to His own perfection. Here He puts Himself on a level with
the people, though speaking with the mediator. The dwelling of God in
the midst of the people is sanctified by His glory. The tabernacle, the
altar, the priests, are sanctified, and He dwells in the midst of the
people surrounding Him. For this purpose had He brought them out of
Egypt ([Exo 29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046).md): a blessed picture
of how, in a far higher and better way, God dwells in the midst of us
\[See Note \#3\]. He never dwelt with man, we may moreover remark, till
redemption was accomplished: not with Adam innocent, nor with Abraham,
or others; but, so soon as redemption is accomplished, He says, "They
shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them" ([Exo
29:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#046).md).

Note \#1

Aaron is always united to his sons in such types, for Christ cannot be
separated from His own or they would become nought. But he had been
anointed personally without blood, a thing that has been verified in
Christ's history. He was anointed while on earth; His disciples after
His death. He received the Spirit for the church in a new way ([Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033).md), when He was risen from among
the dead in the power of the blood of the eternal covenant: for it is
according to the efficacy of that blood in behalf of His people, that He
has been raised as their Head. In Christ's anointing on earth the Holy
Ghost was witness to Christ's own personal righteousness and sonship; in
ours He is the witness of our being clean through His blood, the
righteousness of God in Him, and sons by adoption.

Note \#2

Aaron is first simply anointed with the anointing oil poured upon his
head ([Exo 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#007).md). Then the sons are
brought, and the ram of consecration brought, and some of its blood put
upon Aaron's ear, and then on the tip of the ear of his sons, their
right thumb and the great toe of the right foot. It might be supposed
that it was only on Aaron's ear, but comparing with [Lev
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023.md) it would seem that "their," in
[Exo 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#020.md) here, includes Aaron. The
great principle is our association with the blessed Lord; but He was
obedient unto death, and no act or walk needed to be purified. The great
principle for us is, that nothing should pass into the thought, no act
be done, nothing occur in our walk which is not according to the
perfection of consecration in Christ's sacrifice: we have its value upon
us as to imputation, but here it is consecration, for both are in His
blood.

Note \#3

He dwells in us both individually and collectively by the Holy Ghost,
Christ being gone up on high as man; so that the body of the sealed
saint is a temple, and we are builded together for a habitation of God
through the Spirit. The last runs out now to all Christendom.
