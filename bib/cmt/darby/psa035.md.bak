### [Psalms Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001.md)

Psalm 35 is an urgent appeal for the judgment of Jehovah against
relentless and insidious persecutors who seek after the soul of the
righteous. Insult, craft, violence, all were used against him. They
pretended to have found him out. Deliverance is sought that Jehovah may
be praised in the great congregation, that is, the full assembly of
restored Israel. In Verses 13-14 ([Psa
35:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#013).md), we see the grace in which
the godly (Christ Himself) dealt with these enemies. Though generally
true of the godly, Christ specially comes in here in spirit.
