Introduction to 1 Samuel

We have seen that the Book of Ruth occupies, in its purport, an
intermediate place between the end of the period in which Israel was
governed by God Himself, who interposed from time to time by means of
judges, and the setting up of the king whom He selected for them. This
period, alas! came to an end through the people's failure, and their
inability to make a right use, by faith, of their privileges.

The Books of Samuel contain the account of the cessation of Israel's
original relationship with God, founded on their obedience to the terms
of the old covenant, and the special prescriptions of the Book of
Deuteronomy; the sovereign interference of God in prophecy; and the
setting up of the king whom God Himself had prepared, with the
circumstances which preceded this event. It is not merely that Israel
failed under the government of God: they rejected it.

Placed under the priesthood, they drew nigh to God in the enjoyment of
privileges which were granted them as a people acknowledged by Jehovah.
We shall see the ark-which, as it was the nearest and most immediate, so
was it the most precious link between Jehovah Elohim and the people-fall
into the hands of the enemy. What could a priest do, when that which
gave his priesthood all its importance was in the enemy's hands, and
when the place where he drew near to Jehovah (the throne of God in the
midst of Israel, the place of propitiation by which in mercy Israel's
relationship with God, through the sprinkled blood, was maintained) was
no more there?

It was no longer mere unfaithfulness in the circumstances in which God
had placed them. The circumstances themselves were entirely changed
through God's judgment upon Israel. The outward link of God's connection
with the people was broken; the ark of the covenant, centre and basis of
their relationship with Him, had been given up by the wrath of God into
the hands of their enemies. Priesthood was the natural and normal means
of maintaining the relationship between God and the people: how could it
now be used for this purpose?

Nevertheless God, acting in sovereignty, could put Himself in
communication with His people, by virtue of His grace and immutable
faithfulness, according to which His connection with His people existed
still on His side, even when all acknowledged relationship between Him
and them was broken off by their unfaithfulness. And this He did by
raising up a prophet. By his means God still communicated in a direct
way with His people, even when they had not maintained their
relationship with Him in their normal condition. The office of the
priest was connected with the integrity of these relations; the people
needed him in their infirmities. Still under the priesthood the people
themselves drew nigh to God through the medium of the priest, according
to the relationship which God had established and which He recognised.
But the prophet acted on the part of God outside this relationship, or
rather above it, when the people were no longer faithful.

The setting up of a king went much farther. It was a new order of
relationship which involved most important principles. The relationship
of God with the people was no longer immediate. An authority was set
over Israel. God expected faithfulness from the king. The people's
destiny depended upon the conduct of the one who was responsible before
Jehovah for the maintenance of this faithfulness.

It was God's purpose to establish this principle for the glory of
Christ. I speak of His kingdom over the Jews and over the nations, over
the whole world. This kingdom has been prefigured in David and in
Solomon. To ask for a king, rejecting God's own immediate government,
was folly and rebellion in the people. How often are our follies and our
faults the opportunity for the display of the grace and wisdom of God
and for the fulfilment of His counsels hidden from the world until then!
Our sins and faults alone have conduced to the glorious accomplishment
of these counsels in Christ.

These are the important subjects treated of in the Books of Samuel, so
far at least as the establishment of the kingdom. Its glorious condition
and its fall are related in the two Books of Kings.

It is the fall of Israel which puts an end to their first relationship
with God. The ark is taken; the priest dies. Prophecy introduces the
king-a king despised and rejected, man having set up another, yet a king
whom God establishes according to the might of His power. Such are the
great principles unfolded in the Books of Samuel.

History shews us here, as everywhere, that there is but One who has
remained faithful-an humbling result for us of the trial to which God
has subjected us, but one well adapted to keep us humble.

If we have spoken of the fall of the priesthood, we must not infer from
it that priesthood ceased to exist. It was always necessary to a people
full of weakness (as it is to ourselves on earth); it interposed in the
things of God to maintain individual relationship to Him in them, but it
ceased to form the basis of relationship between the whole people and
God. The people were no longer capable of enjoying this relationship
through this means alone; and the priesthood itself could suffice no
longer, having so deeply failed in its standing. We shall do well to
dwell a little on this, which is the turning-point of the truths we are
considering.

In Israel's primitive state, and in their constitution generally, as
established in the land given to them, priesthood was the basis of their
relationship with God; it was that which characterised and maintained it
(see [Heb 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#011).md). The high priest was
their head and representative before God, as a nation of worshippers;
and in this character (I speak here neither of redemption from Egypt nor
of conquests, but of a people before God, and in relationship with Him),
on the great day of atonement he confessed their sins over the
scape-goat. It was not merely intercession. He stood there as head and
representative of the people, who were summed up in him before Jehovah.
The people were acknowledged, although faulty. They presented themselves
in the person of the high priest, that they might be in connection with
a God, who, after all veiled Himself from their eyes. The people
presented everything to the priest; the high priest stood before God.
This relationship did not imply innocence. An innocent man should have
stood himself before God. "Adam, where art thou?" This question brings
out his fall.

Still the people were not driven away, though the veil was between them
and God; the high priest, who sympathised with the infirmities of the
people, being one with them, maintained the relationship with God. They
were a very imperfect people, it is true; yet by this means they stood
themselves in connection with the Holy One. But Israel was not able to
maintain this position; not only was there sin (the high priest could
remedy that), but they sinned against Jehovah, they turned away from
Him, and that even in their leaders. The priesthood itself, which should
have maintained the relationship, wrought for its destruction by
dishonouring God and repelling the people from His worship, instead of
attracting them to it.

I pass over the preparatory circumstances; they will be considered in
detail in their place. God then sets up a king, whose duty it was to
preserve order and to secure God's connection with the people by
governing them, and by his own faithfulness to God. This is what Christ
will accomplish for them in the ages to come; He is the anointed. When
the king is established, the priest walks before him ([Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035).md). It is a new institution, the
only one capable of maintaining the relationship of the people with God.
Priesthood is no longer here an immediate relationship. It provides
indeed, in its own functions, for the wants of the people. The king
watches over it, and secures order and blessing.

Now the assembly's position is altogether different. The saint now
approaches God directly. Together with the priesthood, which is
exercised for the saints on earth, to maintain them in their walk here
and in the enjoyment of their privileges, it is united to the Anointed;
the veil exists no longer. We sit in the heavenly places in Christ, made
accepted in the Beloved. The favour of God rests upon us, members of the
body of Christ, as upon Christ Himself. That which has unveiled the
holiness of God has disclosed all the sin of man, and has taken it away
\[See Note \#1\].

Thus in Christ, members of His body, we are perfect before God, and
perfectly accepted. The priest seeks neither to give us this position,
nor to maintain relationship with God as to those who are not in this
position. The work of Christ has placed us in it. How intercede then for
perfection? Can intercession make the Person and the work of Christ more
perfect in the sight of God? Certainly not. But we are in Him. In what
manner then is this priesthood exercised for us? In maintaining
mercy-needing creatures in their walk, and so in the realisation of
their relationship with God \[See Note \#2\]. The Christian indeed
enters into a still clearer manifestation of God and more absolute
relationship with God, that of being in the light as God is in the
light. We are seated in the heavenly places, made accepted in the
Beloved, loved as He is loved, the righteousness of God in Him. He is
our life; He has given us the glory that was given Him. Now the Holy
Ghost, who came down from heaven after that Jesus was glorified, has
introduced us consciously into the unveiled presence of God.
Nevertheless we, though without excuse in doing it, fail and pick up
defilement here below. Through the advocacy of Him who is in the
presence of God for us our feet are washed by the Spirit and the word,
and we are rendered capable of maintaining a communion (of which
darkness knows nothing) with God in that light. Hereafter, in the
presence of Jesus the King, priesthood will no doubt sustain the
connection of the people with God, whilst He will bear the weight of
government and of blessing for the people in every sense.

Note \#1:

I refer here to that of His believing people.

Note \#2:

There is a shade of difference between the priesthood and the advocacy
of Christ. The priesthood is in Christ appearing in the presence of God
for us; but this as to our place before God is perfection. It does not
therefore refer to sin in its daily exercise, but mercy and grace to
help in time of need. We enter boldly into the holiest. Advocacy refers
to our sinning, because the question, where it is spoken of ([Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002).md), is communion, and this is wholly
interrupted by sin.
