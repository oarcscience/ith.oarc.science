### [Psalms Chapter 74](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001.md)

Psalm 74 complains of the hostile desolation of the sanctuary, when
rebuilt in the land. God's enemies, as faith here calls them, roar in
the congregations. Man's ensigns, not God's, are the signs of power. All
public Jewish worship was laid low. Not only this what might have been a
comfort in such a time fails. There are no signs from God to meet it, no
prophets, none that know how long (know, that is, by the teaching of
God, when He will come in in power). Still there is here faith that God
will not forsake His people, and that word, How long? if there be no
answer as to it, turns into a cry. It cannot be for ever. God's
faithfulness is trusted in. Heretofore He had smitten Egypt and
delivered His people through a divided sea. All power in creation was
His. The enemy had reproached the name of Jehovah. Israel is still held
to be, in the remnant, as God's turtledove. He is entreated to have
respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth (or land) are
full of the habitations of cruelty. The oppressed, the poor, the needy,
are, as ever, presented to the eye and heart of God. We have them ever
come before us as those of whom God thinks, in whom Christ delighted in
the land. And so it is even as to the spirit we have to be of. He calls
on God to arise and plead His own cause. The tumult of those who rose up
against Him daily increased. While looked at as the poor and oppressed,
it is remarkable how faith identifies the interests of the godly remnant
and of God, and pleads their cause with Him. It is spoken of as from
without. God is addressed: only God is reminded that His name in Israel
has been blasphemed. This name recalls ([Psa
74:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019).md) the covenant relationship
with, and tender love of Jehovah towards, His people.
