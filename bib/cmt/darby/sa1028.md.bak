### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#001.md)

Saul, as well as Israel at present, was in a still worse position,
having succour neither from God nor from the enemy. Saul is forsaken of
God. Samuel is dead; so that Israel is no longer in connection with God
through him. David, who at least made head against the Philistines, was,
through Saul's own doings, in their midst. The outward zeal of the king
had put down all those who had the spirit of witchcraft. He seeks
direction from God, but obtains no answer. He has now neither conscience
nor faith. The case is urgent; and he throws himself, not into outward
service to God, as formerly (he has the sad and solemn conviction that
it belongs to him no more), but into those things which he had condemned
and cut off as evil when he maintained a religious character-things
which he still knew were evil. But the Philistines were there, and his
heart greatly trembles. He seeks out a woman who had a familiar spirit.
God meets him here. Samuel ascends, but in such a manner as to terrify
the woman. She recognises the presence of a power superior to her
enchantments. Samuel declares to Saul, without reserve and without any
sympathy (for this was no longer possible), the solemn judgment of God.
