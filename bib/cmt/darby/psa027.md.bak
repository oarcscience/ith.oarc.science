### [Psalms Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md)

In Psalm 27 we have two distinct parts, and, I apprehend, then in the
last two Verses ([Psa 27:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#021).md) the
result for the mind of the saint as taught of God. The first part,
Verses 1-6 ([Psa 27:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001).md), is the
confidence of the believer, and that absolutely, whatever enemies there
were. In the second part, 7-12 ([Psa
27:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007).md), we find the cry of distress.
In the former, singleness of eye lays the ground of confidence; in the
second, the call of Jehovah to seek His face. Enemies without or
oppressors within (for the remnant of the Jews will find both against
them), a host and war arising, awake no fear Jehovah is the light and
salvation of the soul; its only desire, dwelling in the house of Jehovah
to see His beauty and inquire in His temple. He had known Him casting
confusion on the enemies of the faithful. He sought Him as the desire of
his heart. In the time of trouble He would hide him, and the assault of
foes would only be the occasion of lifting up his head above them, and
then he would offer sacrifices of joy.

From the seventh Verse ([Psa 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007).md)
things are otherwise. It is not his state, as thinking of the Lord in
faith; distress is there, and he cries. Here he appeals, not to his
integrity, but that Jehovah had said, Seek my face. Was He going after
that to turn it away? He looks to be guided in a straight path. There is
integrity, but he looks to the call of God. Finally, he looks for, and
trusts for temporal deliverance in the land of the living; meanwhile he
must wait on Jehovah. He would interfere at the right time; He would
strengthen the heart meanwhile. It is an additional and instructive
picture of the state of the faithful remnant; their abstract confidence
and their ground of hope in distress when Jehovah must be waited for.
