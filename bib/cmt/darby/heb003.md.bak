### [Hebrews Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)

Thus the Lord is set before us as the Apostle and High Priest of
believers from among the Jews, the true people. I say,"from among the
Jews," not that He is not our Priest, but that here the sacred writer
places himself among the believing Jews, saying "our;" and, instead of
speaking of himself as and apostle, he points out Jesus as the Apostle;
which He was in Person among the Jews. In principle, it is true of all
believers. That which He has said is the Lord's word, and He is able to
succour us when we are tempted. We are His house.

For we have here a third character of Christ. He is a "Son over his
house." Moses was faithful in all the house of God as a servant, in
testimony to the things that were afterwards to be proclaimed. But
Christ is over God's house; but it is not as a servant but as a Son. He
has built the house, He is God.

Moses identified himself with the house, faithful therein in all things.
But Christ is more excellent; even as he who builds the house is more
excellent than the house. He who builds all things is God. And this is
what Christ did.For in fact the house (that is, the tabernacle in the
wilderness) was a figure of the uniVerse; and Christ passed through the
heavens, as the high priest passed into the sanctuary. All was cleansed
with blood, even as God will reconcile all thins by Christ in the
heavens and on the earth. In a certain sense this universe is the house
of God. He deigns to inhabit it. Christ created it all. But there is a
house which is more properly His own. We are His house, taking it for
granted that we persevere to the end.

The Hebrew Christians were in danger being attracted by their former
habits, and by a law and ceremonies which God Himself had established of
forsaking a Christianity, in which Christ was not visible, for things
that were visible and palpable. The Christ of Christians, far from being
a crown of glory to the people, was only an object of faith, so that, if
faith failed, He was deprived of all importance to them. A religion that
made itself seen (the "old wine") naturally attracted those that had
been accustomed to it.

But in fact Christ was much more excellent than Moses, as he who has
built the house had more honour than the house, Now this house was the
figure of all things, and He who had built them was God. The passage
gives us this view of Christ and of the house, and also says, that we
are this house. And Christ is not the servant here; He is the Son over
God's house.

We must always remember that which has been already remarked, namely,
that in this epistle we have no the assembly as the body of Christ in
union with Himself; nor even the Father either, except as a comparison
in Chapter 12. It is God, a heavenly Christ (who is the Son of God), and
a people, the Messiah being a heavenly Mediator between the people and
God. Therefore the proper privileges of the assembly are not found in
this epistle they flow from our union with Christ; and here Christ is a
Person apart who is between us and God, on high while we are here.

There are still a few remarks which we may add here in order to throw
light on this point, and to assist the reader in understanding the first
two Chapters, as well as the principle of the instructions throughout
the epistle.

In Chapter 1, Christ accomplishes by Himself as a part of His divine
glory the purification of sins, and seats Himself at the right hand of
God. This work, observe, is done by Himself. We have nothing to do with
it, save to believe in and enjoy it. It is a divine work which this
divine Person has accomplished by Himself; so that it has all the
absolute perfection, all the force, of a work done by Him, without any
mixture of our weakness, of our efforts, or of our experiences. He
performed it by Himself, and it is accomplished. Thereupon He takes His
seat. he is not placed there He seats Himself upon the throne on high.

In Chapter 2 we see another point which characterises the epistle the
present state of the glorified Man. He is crowned with glory and honour;
but it is with a view to an order of things which is not yet
accomplished. It is the Person of the Man Christ which is presented, not
the assembly in union with Him, even when He is beheld as glorified in
the heavens, This glory is viewed as a partial accomplishment of that
which belongs to Him, according to the counsels of God, as the Son of
man. hereafter this glory will be complete in all its parts by the
subjugation of all things.

The present glory therefore of Christ makes us look forward to an order
of things yet future, which will be full rest, full blessing. In a word,
bedsides the perfection of His work, the epistle sets before us the
sequel of that which belongs to Christ in Person, the Son of man, not
the perfection of the assembly in Him. And this embraces the present
time, the character of which, to the believer, depends on Christ's being
now glorified in heaven while waiting for a future state, in which all
things will be subjected to Him.

In this Chapter 2 we see also that He is crowned. He is not seen sitting
there as in His original right, though He had that glory before the
world was, but, having been made a little less than the angels, God
crowns Him. We also plainly see that although the believing Hebrews are
especially in view, and even all Christians are classed under the title
of Abraham's seed on the earth, yet that Christ is viewed nevertheless
as the Son of man, and not as the Son of David; and the question is put,
"What is man?" The answer (the precious answer for us) is, Christ
glorified, once dead on account of man's condition. In Him we see the
mind of God with regard to man.

The fact that Christians themselves are viewed as the seed of Abraham
plainly shews the way in which they are considered as forming part of
the chain of the heirs of promise on earth (as in Rom 11), and not as
the assembly united to Christ as His body in heaven.

The work is perfect; it is the work of God. He has by Himself made
purification of sins. The full result of the counsels of God with regard
to the Son of man is not yet come. Thus the earthly part can be brought
in, as a thing foreseen , as well as the heavenly part, although the
persons to whom the epistle is addressed had part in the heavenly glory
participated in the heavenly calling in connection with the present
position of the Son of man.

The remnant of the Jews, as we have said, are considered as continuing
the chain of the people blessed on earth, whatever heavenly privileges
they may also possess or whatever their especial state may be in
connection with the Messiah's exaltation to heaven. We have been grafted
into the good olive-tree, so that we share all the advantages here
spoken of. Our highest position, and the privileges belonging to it, are
not here in view. Accordingly, as writing to Hebrews and as one among
them, he addresses them, that is to say, Christians and believing
Israelites. This is the force of the word "us" in the epistle; we must
bear it in mind, and that the Hebrew believers always form the word "us"
of which the writer is also a part.

No one ought to harden his heart; but this word is especially addressed
to Israel, and that until the day when Christ shall appear. In speaking
of it, the author returns to the word that had formerly been addressed
to Israel; not now in order to warn them of the danger they would incur
by neglecting it. but of the consequences of departing from that which
they had acknowledged to be true. Israel, when delivered out of Egypt,
had provoked God in the wilderness (it was indeed the case also of
Christians in this world), because they were not at once, and without
difficulty, in Canaan.Those to whom he wrote were in danger of forsaking
the living God in the same way; that is, the danger was there before
their eyes. They should rather exhort each other, while it was still
called to-day, in order that they might not be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.This word "to-day" is the expression of the patient
activity of God's grace towards Israel even unto the end. The people
were unbelieving; they have hardened their hearts; they have done so,
and will alas! do so to the end, until judgment come in the Person of
the Messiah-Jehovah, whom they have despise. But until then God loves to
reiterate, "Today, if ye will hear my voice." It may be that only a few
will hearken; it may be that the nation is judicially hardened, in order
to admit the Gentiles; but the word "today" still resounds for every one
among them who has ears to hear, until the Lord shall appear in
judgment. It is addressed to the people according to the long-suffering
of God. For the remnant who had believed it was an especial warning not
to walk in the ways of the hardened people who had refused to hearken
not to turn back to them, forsaking their own confidence in the word
which had called them, as Israel did in the wilderness.

As long as the "today" of the call of grace should continue, they were
to exhort one another, lest unbelief should glide into their hearts
through the subtlety of sin. It is thus that the living God is forsaken.
We speak thus practically, not with reference to the faithfulness of
God, who certainly will not allow any of His own to perish, but with
regard to practical danger, and to that which would draw us away as to
our responsibility from God, and for ever, if God did not intervene,
acting in the life which He has given us, and which never perishes.

Sin separates us from God in our thoughts; we have no longer the same
sense either of His love, His power, or His interest in us. Confidence
is lost, Hope, and the value of unseen things, diminish; while the value
of things that are seen proportionately increases. The conscience is
bad; one is not at ease with God. The path is hard and difficult; the
will strengthens itself against Him. We no longer live by faith; visible
things come in between us and God and take possession of the heart.
Where there is life, God warns by His Spirit (as in this epistle), He
chastises and restores. Where it was only an outward influence, a faith
devoid of life, and the conscience not reached, it is abandoned.

It is the warning against so doing that arrests the living. The dead
they whose consciences are not engaged, who do not say, "To whom shall
we go? thou has the words of eternal life" despise the warning and
perish. This was the case with Israel in the wilderness, and God sware
unto them that they should not enter into His rest. ([Num
14:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021).md) And why? They had given up
their confidence in Him. Their unbelief when the beauty and excellence
of the land had been reported to them deprived them of the promised
rest.

The position of the believers to whom this epistle is addressed was the
same as this, although in connection with better promises. The beauty
and excellence of the heavenly Canaan had been proclaimed to them. The
had, by the Spirit, seen and tasted its fruits; they were in the
wilderness; they had to persevere to maintain their confidence unto the
end.

Observe her for Satan and our own conscience when it has not been set
free, often make use of this epistle that doubting Christians are not
here contemplated, or persons who have not yet gained entire confidence
in God: to those who are in this condition its exhortations and warnings
have no application. These exhortations are to preserve the Christian in
a confidence which he has, and to preserve, not to tranquillise fears
and doubts. This use of the epistle to sanction such doubts is but a
device of the enemy. Only I would add here that, although the full
knowledge of grace (which in such a case the soul has assuredly not yet
attained) is the only thing that can deliver and set it free from its
fears, yet it is very important in this case practically to maintain a
good conscience, in order not to furnish the enemy with a special means
of attack.
