### [Psalms Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)

In Psalm 20 we have, in the midst of sorrows and evil come in as regards
the two preceding testimonies, the faithful witness, the living witness
Himself. He is seen in the day of His distress, for He is come down into
the midst of an ungodly people. The remnant is prophetically designated
by the fact that they in heart enter into His distress, assured that
Jehovah will hear His Anointed.

Conscience then characterizes the remnant, truth in the inward parts in
presence of the law, and taking that law spiritually; interest of heart
in Messiah, when He is the despised and rejected of men. Still we are in
Israel, and the help is sought from the God of Israel, and still as
dwelling amongst them, having His sanctuary there.

In Psalm 16 the Lord identified Himself with the remnant. Here they
associate themselves in heart with Him thus suffering, and in His
conflict here, though they may see as but the outside of it, yet be
assured of His acceptance with Jehovah. They look for His offerings to
be accepted, the desire of His heart and His counsels to be fulfilled,
all His petitions accomplished. Their joy is in the full deliverance of
this blessed but dependent One. In Verse 6 ([Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006).md) we have the assurance of faith
as to it, that from heaven itself Jehovah has heard, the mighty are
fallen, the poor of the flock are raised up and maintained before Him.

In Verse 9 ([Psa 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009).md) Messiah takes
another place. While Jehovah had delivered Him as the dependent One in
the day of His distress, the remnant now look to His hearing them when
they call. Jehovah is still looked to as the Savior, but Messiah the
king is invoked. They now know that the Anointed is exalted. No part of
scripture opens out the Person of Christ as the Psalms do, unless the
first two chapters of Hebrews, which quote and serve as a key to them:
here Messiah connected with the remnant in the dependent One, but
exalted too as the king to be invoked of Israel. A little farther on we
shall find that He is Jehovah Himself. I see no reason to alter the text
according to the Septuagint, followed by others, such as the Latin. The
Targum, and Syriac, and all Jewish interpretations, read as it is read
in English. The other reading is, "Jehovah save the king hear us," etc.
Already in Psalm 21 Jehovah and the king are associated in judgment, as
indeed we have seen they were already in Psalm 2. It is the very main
point of instruction in the Psalms the mystery of the manifestation of
Christ in flesh.
