### [Revelation Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#001.md)

Chapter 15 is a new vision. It unrolls before the prophet another scene,
the last plagues or judgments of God, and specially that of Babylon,
before Christ comes. The main object of the vision was the seven angels,
having the seven last plagues; but, as ever, the saints who have to do
with this scene are seen in security before the judgments begin. They
have been purified, but have come through the fire of tribulation too.
They stand on a sea mingled with fire. They have belonged to the time
when the beast and his image were in power, but they had got the victory
over it. They seemed perhaps to have succumbed it was real victory.

Their song is very peculiar. The song of Moses is triumph over the power
of evil by God's judgments. The song of the Lamb is the exaltation of
the rejected Messiah, of the suffering One, like whom they had suffered;
for it is the slain remnant amidst unfaithful and apostate Israel whom
we find here. The song celebrates God and the Lamb, but by victorious
sufferers who belong to heaven. What they celebrate are the works of
Jehovah Elohim Shaddai (the God of the Old Testament), but who has
manifested Himself in judgment, known by His works that are public for
the people. He shewed His ways unto Moses, His works unto the children
of Israel. His works are celebrated now. They are the works of Jehovah
Elohim Shaddai, the Judge of all the earth. But His ways are celebrated
too. There was intelligence of them, as far at least as righteous
judgment went. These ways in judgment were just and true. Israel would
understand deliverance, and how it came; but Moses knew God's ways. But
this is all. It is not merely celebration of qualities and attributes,
as the angels do, nor the full knowledge of God's work in salvation by
the blood of the Lamb. It is not the heart going up in the sense of its
own relationship, but a celebration of the glory of the Lord, who would
now be worshiped by the nations for His judgments were manifested. It
was intelligence when judgments were manifested, not when all was yet to
be learned within the veil.

This celebration of what was just bursting forth being made, the temple
of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, not merely the
temple with the ark of the covenant seen. That secured the result for
faith, when evil was raging in power on earth; the ark of God's covenant
secured Israel. It was a testimony opened out, not a covenant which
secured in the hour of evil, but a testimony which made good what the
ark of the covenant secured; for the temple was opened, and the
messengers of judgment came forth God's judgment for the restoration and
blessing, of Israel, by the judgment of the Gentiles and all who
corrupted the earth. Cleanness in God's sight and divine righteousness,
characterised and animated this judgment clean linen pure and white, and
golden girdles: I apprehend the former, in answer to corruption in what
should have had this Babylon. (compare [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)..md) That is, it was a judgment
which required it, and was according to it, and also to divine
righteousness. It is not brass burning in the fire simply execution of
judgment in dealing with men, though that took place but God making good
His own nature and character against corruption, the essential character
of the eternal God, which the assembly ought to have displayed; whereas
Babylon was entirely the contrary, and the beast too. The seven angels
judge all according to these characters of God, because it was really
the avenging of what God was, as fully revealed to the assembly; but the
white linen refers, I doubt not, specially to Babylon, though the men
with the mark of the beast would come under the judgment. One of the
four living creatures gives the vials; for it is the judicial power of
God in creation, not yet the Lamb. God's glory in judgment filled the
temple; and no man could have to say to Him in worship, or approaching
Him, while these plagues were executing. It was the full display of God
in judgment.

The first four plagues have the same objects as the judgments of the
first four trumpets the whole circle of symbolic nature, but here
directly as regards men earth, sea, rivers, and sun; the ordered
prophetic sphere of God's dealings, the masses of peoples as such viewed
as unorganized, the moral principles which give an impulse to their
movements, and sovereign authority. But it is not a third here (that is,
the Roman earth), but in general.
