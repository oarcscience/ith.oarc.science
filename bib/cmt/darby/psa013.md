### [Psalms Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)

In Psalm 13 the righteous is reduced to the lowest point of distress as
far as evil from men goes. It is as if God had entirely and definitely
forgotten him. His enemy was exalted over him, and he taking counsel in
his heart; but then he cries looks to Jehovah to hear lest he should
perish on the one hand, and his enemy on the other have to say he had
prevailed. But he is heard, and sings to Jehovah, in whose mercy he had
trusted, and who deals bountifully with him at last.
