### [Psalms Chapter 146](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)

Psalm 146 introduces the full final praises: the first, the outpouring
of the heart in praise to Him as the God of Jacob, celebrating what He
is, and the comfort of trusting Him, the Creator, the Helper of the
oppressed, the Comforter of the lowly, the Lover of the righteous, who
turns the way of the wicked upside down. He shall reign for ever, even
Zion's God to all generations. The character of this praise, after what
we have gone through, is most simple.
