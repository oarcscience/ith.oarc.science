### [Jeremiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001.md)

Chapter 2 contains a most touching appeal to the people at Jerusalem. It
requires no explanation, but deserves the heart's serious attention. It
testifies in the most striking manner to the kindness and tender love of
the Lord. Only that we have here only the comparison of what they had
originally been as planted by the Lord, and His ways of love, not any
reference to the coming of the Lord. Christ is not in view nor the
counsels of God as in Isaiah, though we shall find it further on; but
their responsibility under God's touching ways of grace with them is
much more fully brought out, and final blessing is spoken of in the
following chapter.
