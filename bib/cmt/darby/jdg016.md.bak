### [Judges Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#001.md)

Samson sins again through his intercourse with "the daughter of a
strange god"; he connects himself again with women of the Philistines,
amongst whom his father's house and the tribe of Dan were placed. But he
retains his strength until the influence of these connections becomes so
great that he reveals the secret of his strength in God. His heart, far
from God, places that confidence in a Philistine which should have
existed only between his soul and God (chap. 16). To possess and keep a
secret proves intimacy with a friend. But the secret of God, the
possession of His confidence, is the highest of all privileges. To
betray it to a stranger, be he who he may, is to despise the precious
position in which His grace has placed us; it is to lose it. What have
the enemies of God to do with the secret of God? It was thus that Samson
gave himself up to his enemies. All attempts were powerless against him
so long as he maintained his Nazariteship. This separation once lost,
although Samson was apparently as strong, and his exterior as goodly as
before, yet Jehovah was no longer with him. "I will go out as at other
times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that Jehovah was
departed from him."

We can scarcely imagine a greater folly than that of confiding his
secret to Delilah, after having so many times been seized by the
Philistines at the moment she awoke him. And thus it is with the
assembly: when it yields itself to the world, it loses all its wisdom,
even that which is common to man. Poor Samson! his strength may be
restored, but he has lost his sight for ever. But who has ever hardened
himself against the Lord, and prospered? [Job
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004.md).

The Philistines ascribe their success to their false god. God remembers
His own glory, and His poor servant humbled under the chastisement of
his sin. The Philistines assemble to enjoy their victory and glorify
their false gods. But Jehovah had His eye on all this. In his
humiliation, the thought of the Lord had more power over the heart of
Samson; his Nazariteship was regaining strength. He makes his touching
appeal to God. Who would fear a blind and afflicted prisoner? but who
amongst this world knows the secret of Jehovah? A slave and for ever
deprived of sight, his condition affords an opportunity, which his
strength had not been able to obtain, before his unfaithfulness deprived
him of it. But he is blind and enslaved, and he must perish himself in
the judgment which he brings upon the impiety of his enemies. He had
identified himself with the world by hearkening to it, and he must share
the judgment which falls upon the world \[See Note \#1\]. If the
unfaithfulness of the assembly has given the world power over it, the
world has on the other hand assailed the rights of God by corrupting the
assembly, and therefore brings down judgment upon itself at the moment
of its greatest triumph: a judgment which, if it puts an end to the
existence, as well as to the misery of the Nazarite, destroys at the
same time in one common ruin the whole glory of the world. In the
details of prophecy this applies to the closing history of the Jewish
people \[See Note \#2\]. Only there the remnant is preserved, to be
established on a new base for the accomplishment of the purposes of God.

Note \#1

There was something of this, though in a very different form and manner,
in Jonathan. His faith was not perfect. He held the world with one hand
and David with the other, though the excuse of natural relationship
might be there.

Note \#2

As to the professing church it is somewhat different, because the saints
are taken away to glory, and the rest, being apostate, are judged; but
the fact of judgment on the world is identical.
