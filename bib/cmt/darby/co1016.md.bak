### [1 Corinthians Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md)

The apostle, in his letter, had treated of the disorder that reigned
among these believers, and his spirit was to a certain degree relieved
by fulfilling this duty towards them; for, after all, they were
Christians and an assembly of God. In the last Chapter he speaks to them
in the sense of this, although he could not make up his mind to go to
Corinth, for he had intended to visit them in going to Macedonia, and a
second time in returning thence. He does not say here why he did not go
thither on his way to Macedonia, and he speaks with uncertainty as to
his sojourn at Corinth when he should arrive there on his return from
Macedonia; if the Lord permitted, he would tarry awhile with them. The
second epistle will explain all this. In their existing state his heart
would not allow him to visit them. But he treats them tenderly,
nevertheless, as still beloved Christians, giving them directions suited
to the circumstances of the moment. They were to make a collection for
the poor saints at Jerusalem, as had been arranged with the apostles
when Paul left Jerusalem as the recognised apostle of the Gentiles. This
was not to be done in haste when he came, but by laying up every week in
proportion to their prosperity. He would send persons chosen by the
Corinthians, or take them with him if he went himself to Jerusalem. He
thought of remaining till Pentecost at Ephesus, where a great door was
opened to him and there were many adversaries. If these two things go
together, it is a motive for remaining; the open door is an inducement
on the part of God, the activity of adversaries makes it necessary with
regard to the enemy. A closed door is a different thing from opposition.
People do not hearken if the door is shut; God does not act to draw
attention. If God is acting, the assiduity of the enemy is but a reason
for not abandoning the work. It appears ([Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md) that Paul had already suffered
much at Ephesus, but he still continued his work there. He could not
pour out his heart on the subject to the Corinthians, seeing the state
they were in. He does it in the second Epistle, when the first had
produced the effect he desired. There was a tumult afterwards at
Ephesus, stirred up by the craftsmen, in consequence of which Paul left
the city (Acts 19). Verses 21, 22, of this Chapter in Act ([Act
19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021).md)s shew us the period at which
he wrote this letter. The danger to his life had preceded it, but he
remained at Ephesus after that. The tumult closed the door and sent him
away.

In [Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md) we see that he had sent
Timothy into Macedonia. In our epistle he supposes that he might go on
as far as Corinth. If he came, the Corinthians were to receive him as
they would have received Paul. He had begged Apollos to go to them; he
had already been made a blessing to them; and Paul thought he might be
so again. He did not fear that Apollos would displace him in the heart
of the Corinthians. But Apollos shared the apostle's feeling; he was not
inclined to recognise, or by his presence to have the appearance of
upholding, that which prevented Paul going thither; and the more so
because there were some in the assembly at Corinth who wished to use his
name as the standard of a party. Free in his movements, he would act
according to the judgment which the Lord would enable him to form.

After speaking of Apollos, the apostle's mind turns again to his
children in the faith, dear to him, whatever their faults might be.
Verses 13, 14 ([Co1 16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013).md), are the
effusion of a heart which forgot these faults in the ardent desire of a
charity that only thought of their blessingaccording to the Spirit.
Three Corinthians had brought him supplies; it does not appear to have
been on the part of the assembly, nor that it was any testimony of its
love which had refreshed the apostle's heart. He would have the
Corinthians to rejoice at it. He does not doubt that they loved him
enough to be refreshed because it was so. Their charity had not thought
of it beforehand; but he expresses his conviction that they took
pleasure in the thought of his heart being refreshed. It is touching to
see here, that the apostle's charity suggests that which grace would
produce on the heart of the Corinthians, communicating that which they
probably would not otherwise have known of the active charity of three
brethren of the assembly; and, in love uniting them to his joy, if they
had not been united to that which occasioned it. The flame of charity
communicates itself by rising above coldness, and reaching the depths of
divine life in the heart; and, once communicated, the soul, before
unkindled, glows now with the same fire.

We find in this Chapter four channels, so to speak, of ministry.
Firstly, the apostle, sent direct from the Lord and by the Holy Ghost.
Secondly, persons associated with the apostle in his work, and acting at
his desire, and (in the case of Timothy) one pointed out by prophecy.
Thirdly, an entirely independent labourer, partly instructed by others
(see [Act 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026).md), but acting where he
saw fit, according to the Lord and to the gift he had received.
Fourthly, one who gives himself to the service of the saints, as well as
others who helped the apostle and laboured. Paul exhorts the faithful to
submit themselves to such, and to all those who helped in the work and
laboured. He would also have them acknowledge those who refreshed his
heart by their service of devotedness. Thus we find the simple and
important principle according to which all the best affections of the
heart are developed, namely, the acknowledgment of every one according
to the manifestation of grace and of the power of the Holy Ghost in him.
The christian man submits to those who addict themselves to the service
of the saints; he acknowledges those who manifest grace in a special
way. They are not persons officially nominated and consecrated who are
spoken of here. It is the conscience and the spiritual affection of
Christians which acknowledges them according to their work a principle
valid at all times, which does not permit this respect to be demanded,
but which requires it to be paid.

We may remark, here, that this epistle, although entering into all the
details of the interior conduct of an assembly, does not speak of elders
or of any formally established officers at all. It is certain, that in
general there were such; but God has provided in the word for the walk
of an assembly at all times, and, as we see, principles which oblige us
to acknowledge those who serve in it through personal devotedness
without being officially appointed. General unfaithfulness, or the
absence of such established officers, will not prevent those who obey
the word from following it in all that is needful for christian order.
We see moreover that, whatever might be the disorder, the apostle
recognises the members of the assembly as being all real Christians; he
desires them to acknowledge one another by the kiss of love, the
universal expression of brotherly affection. This is so entirely the
case that he pronounces a solemn anathema on every one who loved not the
Lord Jesus. There might be such, but he would in no way recognise them.
If there were any, let them be anathema. Is this an allowed mixture? He
will not believe it, and he embraces them all in the bonds of christian
love ([Co1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024).md).

The last point is important. The state of the assembly at Corinth might
give room for some uncertainty as to the Christianity of certain
members, or persons in connection with them although not dwelling at
Corinth. He admonishes them; but in fact, in cases of the most grievous
sin where the discipline of God was exercised, or that of man was
required, the guilty are looked upon as Christians. (See Chapter 10 for
the warning; [Co1 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md) for the Lord's
discipline; for that of man, [Co1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md)
in this epistle; for the principle, [Co2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008).md). Besides, he denounces with an
anathema those who do not love the Lord Jesus. Discipline is exercised
towards the wicked man who is called a brother. He who calls himself a
Christian, yet does not really love the Lord for there may be such is
the subject of the most terrible anathema.

It is sweet to see that, after faithfully (although with anguish of
heart) correcting every abuse, the spirit of the apostle returns by
grace into the enjoyments of charity in his relationship with the
Corinthians. The terrible Verse 22 ([Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022).md) was not felt to be inconsistent
with the love that dictated the other Verses. It was the same spirit,
for Christ was the sole spring of his charity.

We may notice ([Co1 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021).md) that the
apostle, as other passages testify, employed some one to write for him.
The Epistle to the Galatians is an exception. He verified his epistles
to the assemblies by writing the salutation at the end with his own
hand, marking the importance he attached to the exactitude of the verbal
contents, and confirming the principle of an exact inspiration. His
heart flows out ([Co1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024).md), and he
comforts himself in being able to acknowledge them all in love.
