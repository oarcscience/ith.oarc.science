### [Amos Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001)

Chapter 8 renews the declaration, that the end of Israel was come on
account of their iniquity. God would no longer pass it over. The prophet
announces likewise the distress the people should come into from being
deprived of all guidance from Jehovah. They who trusted in the vanities
that Israel had set up for themselves should fall, and never rise again.
