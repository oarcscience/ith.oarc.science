### [Micah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)

The prophet again denounces the heads and princes of Jacob. They should
cry unto Jehovah. But He would not hear them. No prophet should
enlighten them with the light of His word. The seers should be
confounded; there should be no answer from God ([Mic
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001)). It was not thus with the
prophet, full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah to declare unto Jacob
his transgression and unto Israel his sin ([Mic
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#008)). This he does by again denouncing
the chiefs among the people who judged for reward, and the prophets who
divined for money, while they claimed the privilege of Jehovah's
presence, granted indeed exclusively to this people. Nothing can be more
offensive to Jehovah than that those who have the name of His people
should clothe themselves with the privilege of His presence, and use
this pretension to honour self and justify evil, or maintain a divine
claim in spite of it. Therefore should Zion be plowed as a field, and
the mountains, now ornamented with palaces, should be made like the
heights of a forest ([Mic 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009)).
