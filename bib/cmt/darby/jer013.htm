<p>Chapter 13, bringing to mind how God had bound Israel to His heart, announces the terrible judgment with which the people shall, as it were, be drunken; and, on the ground of this judgment, calls them to repentance. He relates their hopeless evil, and the unfeigned grief of the prophet at their obstinacy. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041">Luk 19:41</A>. This zeal for Jehovah's glory against the evil and the people who dishonoured Him, and touching affection to them as Jehovah's people, is everywhere a striking mark of the working of the Spirit of Christ. Compare Moses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#027">Exo 32:27-28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#031">Exo 32:31</A>, and sequel); so Paul (Romans 9; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015">Th1 2:15-16</A>): only here, under grace, there is no call for judgment; so even Christ Himself (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031">Mat 23:31-37</A>).
