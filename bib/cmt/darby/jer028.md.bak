### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 27 and 28.

Chapters 27 and 28 go together. Their chief subject is the submission to
the head of the Gentiles, which God requires of the Jews. But before
dwelling on this, I would call attention to the care which God bestows
on His people, warning them again at each new phase of their career
towards judgment. We remember that Zedekiah brought down this judgment
by rebelling against the king of Babylon. At the beginning of his reign
the Lord sent His word by Jeremiah to warn all the kings around, as well
as Zedekiah, that they must submit. If they submitted, they should dwell
in their land in peace; if not, they should be driven out and perish.
Let us now observe the place which, as Creator of the earth, of man and
beast, God gives to the king of Babylon. God has given the nations, and
even the beasts of the field, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar for a
certain time. God establishes the central and universal power, and the
nation that refuses to submit to it would be in rebellion against
Himself, and should be consumed. Compare [Dan
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038.md), which adds the fowls of the
heaven to his dominion. All on earth was subjected to this king of the
earth-the imperial head taken from among the Gentiles. It was a
government appointed of God, who had forsaken Jerusalem, and would no
longer protect her unless she submitted to this government. It appears
that the kings of the surrounding countries were plotting with Zedekiah
to throw off the yoke of the king of Babylon, and that the mission of
their ambassadors was the occasion on which this prophecy was given, God
declaring that He would have all submit to this yoke, for it was He
Himself that imposed it.

This fact-that God has committed power in this world to a man-is very
remarkable. In the case of Israel man had been tried on the ground of
obedience to God, and had not been able to possess the blessing that
should have resulted from it. Now God abandons this direct government of
the world (while still the sovereign Lord above); and, casting off
Israel whom He had chosen out from the nations, grouping the latter
around the elect people and His own throne in Israel, He subjects the
world to one head, and committing power unto man, He places him under a
new trial, to prove whether he will own the God who gave him power, and
make those happy who are subjected to him, when he can do whatever he
will in this world. do not enter here into the details of the history of
this trial: they belong to the Book of Daniel. We know that man failed
in it. Senseless and presumptuous, he ravaged the. world and oppressed
the people of God, trod down His sanctuary, and prepared for himself a
judgment so much the more terrible that Satan will induce him to resist
it, and will aid him in his rebellion. Nebuchadnezzar alone answers in
all points to that which we have just said. He is the head of gold. God
had committed immediately to him the government of the world. Cyrus had
personally a more peculiar place, and one more honourable in some
respects. But as an empire, the Persians only took the place of one that
already existed; and the sources and character of power continually
deteriorated, in proportion as their distance from God and His gift
increased.

False prophets as well as false teachers oppose the truth in this very
point on which God tries His people. They can use all other parts of
truth in order to deceive, and appear to have increased faith in them.
It is manifest that the secret of the Lord is never with them. But
whatever appearances may be, they neither stop nor turn away God from
the path He takes. Yet the true prophet's position is a painful one. He
may seem for the time to be reduced to silence; for the popular
falsehood possesses the hearts of the people. Jeremiah had to go away.
Nevertheless in the combat between truth and error God often intervenes
by a striking testimony, and so it was here. The function of the
prophet, with respect to the government of the world and of the people's
walk, is always a testimony to the judgment which hangs over
unfaithfulness.
