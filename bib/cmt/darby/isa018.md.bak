### [Isaiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 15, 16, 17, and 18.

In chapters 15 and 16 Moab is judged. They are warned that the throne of
David shall be established, and the oppressor consumed out of the land.
In chapter 17 we have the invasion of armies from the north, the
assembled nations. Damascus is overthrown. Israel shall be but as a few
berries on the outmost branches. Nevertheless they shall look to their
Maker, and the gathered nations shall perish before the manifested power
of God. The outline of this last invasion of Israel gives rise to a
brief but very clear prophecy of their condition in the last days, and
which is contained in chapter 18. They shall be restored by means of
some powerful nation, outside the limits \[See Note \#1\] of their then
national relationships; but Jehovah stands apart from His own
relationship with them, though ordering all things. Then, when Israel
shall begin to bud as a vine in the land, they shall be given up as a
prey to the nations. Nevertheless in that time they shall be brought as
an offering to Jehovah, and shall themselves bring an offering too.

Note \#1

The rivers of Cush, Nile and Euphrates.
