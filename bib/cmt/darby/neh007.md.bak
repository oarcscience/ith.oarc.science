### [Nehemiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md)

God blesses the labours of the faithful Nehemiah, and Jerusalem is once
more encompassed by walls; a less touching condition than when the city
of God was defended by the altar of God, which was a testimony to His
presence and to the faith of those who erected it; but a condition that
proved the faithfulness and loving-kindness of God, who, nevertheless,
while outwardly re-establishing them, revoked no part of the judgment
pronounced on His people and His city. He who rebuilt the walls was but
the vicegerent of a foreign king; and it was the security of the people,
and that which uprightness of heart required of them to acknowledge
this; and it was done ([Neh 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#037).md).
Still, God blesses them. Nehemiah recurs to the numbering of the people,
according to the register of their genealogies that was drawn up at
their first return from captivity, an already distant period. Thus the
people are again placed in their cities.
