### [Psalms Chapter 93](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001.md)

Psalm 93 states the grand and blessed results. Jehovah reigns. Ever
indeed was His throne established, but the floods had lifted up their
voice. The waves of ungodly men had risen up high. Jehovah on high was
mightier. Two other great principles complete this short but remarkable
summary of the whole history of God and man in government. Jehovah's
testimonies are very sure. Faith could count upon them, come what would;
but, further, another great truth came out as to the character of God.
There could be no peace to the wicked. Holiness became His house. But I
apprehend this last phrase describes the comely holiness of God's house
for the now lasting period for which the earth was established.

We have now the details of the coming in of the Only begotten into the
world to establish the glory and divine order in the world, introduced
by the cry of the remnant in Israel.
