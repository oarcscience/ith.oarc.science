### [Leviticus Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#001.md)

Other cases connected with the weakness of nature are mentioned, but
which point out that, sin having come in, all that is of nature, of the
flesh, defiles (whatever may be the excuse as to the weakness and the
unavoidable character of the thing). If it cannot be avoided, it is the
manifestation, or at least the inevitable existence, of that which is
shameful, because it is a nature fallen and sinful. We shall find,
however, that, though being shameful, the case is supposed less morally
serious than leprosy. In leprosy there was the manifestation of positive
corruption, existing beforehand in the nature, which was admitted in the
heart, so that a long process was necessary to purify the conscience.
Here they only washed once, and they offered merely a sin-offering, and
they were thereby able, in offering their burnt-offering, to enter into
communion through the sweet savour of Christ.
