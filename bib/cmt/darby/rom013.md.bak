### [Romans Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)

Among themselves Christians are exhorted not to seek the high things of
this world, but to walk as brethren with those of low degree: a precept
too much forgotten in the assembly of God to her loss. If the Christian
of high degree requires that honour according to the flesh should be
paid him, let it be done with good will. Happy he who, according to the
example of the King of kings and to the precept of our apostle, knows
how to walk in company with those of low degree in their journey through
the wilderness. Now love is the fulfilling of the law; for love works no
ill to his neighbour, and so fulfils the law.

Another principle acts also on the spirit of the Christian. It is time
to awake. The deliverance from this present evil age, which the Lord
will accomplish for us, draws nigh. The night is far spent, the day is
at hand God knows the moment. The characteristics which marked its
approach in the days of the apostle have ripened in a very different way
since then, although God, with a view to those whom He is gathering in,
is still even now restraining them. Let us then walk as children of the
day, casting off the works of darkness. We belong to the day, of which
Christ Himself will be the light. Let our walk be in accordance with
that day, putting on Christ Himself, and not being studious of that
which is in accordance with the will and the lusts of the flesh.
