### [Ezekiel Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001.md)

Chapter 8 begins a new prophecy, which comprises several distinct
revelations, and extends to the close of chapter 19 (from the eighth to
the end of the eleventh being connected). Judah still existed at
Jerusalem, although many of them had already been carried into captivity
with Jehoiakim. It was not till five years later that the temple was
destroyed. It is the state of things at Jerusalem which is judged in
these chapters. The elders of Judah presented themselves before the
prophet, and Jehovah took this opportunity to shew him all the
enormities that would bring down judgment on the people. In the prophecy
of the preceding year God, by the mouth of the prophet, had threatened
Israel with the giving up of His sanctuary to the profane ([Eze
7:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#020).md). Here Jehovah exhibits in
detail the cause of this judgment. The glory of Jehovah appeared to the
prophet, and he was taken in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and there
in the courts and the chambers, and in the gates, he was shewn every
form of hateful and defiling idolatry practised in Jehovah's own house
by the elders and others of Israel. If we compare the history of
Jeremiah, and the outward profession that was made-the pretension that
the law should not perish from the priest, we shall understand the
excessive iniquity of the Jews and their hypocrisy.
