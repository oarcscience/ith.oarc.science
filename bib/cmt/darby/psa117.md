### [Psalms Chapter 117](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md)

Psalm 117 is the calling the other nations and peoples to come and
praise Jehovah, who will be now King over all the earth. They join and
are brought happily into this relationship, Jehovah being made known to
them by His ways with Israel. Merciful kindness is here, as ever, first;
and truth enduring for ever, which no failure has made to fail. This, as
the last, is a hallelujah.
