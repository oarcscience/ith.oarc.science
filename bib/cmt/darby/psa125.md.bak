### [Psalms Chapter 125](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

Psalm 125. The position of those who trust in Jehovah is celebrated, in
virtue of this intervention of Jehovah, who would now protect them for
ever, and they abide for ever. Peace would be on Israel. Those that
turned to their crooked ways Jehovah would lead them forth with the open
evildoers in judgment. The rod of wickedness would not rest upon the lot
of the righteous. There would be an exclusion of the rod of wickedness
(what represented the wicked as a tribe), separation from its mischief,
that the righteous might not go astray. All this, I apprehend, refers to
the last inroad of the final power of Gog, or the last condition of the
Assyrian, perhaps to Daniel 8 (only that that gives its whole character,
not merely its final one); also to the final king of the north, who
comes in after the wilful king in Daniel 11.
