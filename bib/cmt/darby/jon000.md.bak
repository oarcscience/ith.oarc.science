Introduction to Jonah

The prophet Jonah gives us the opportunity of applying his history to
many sentiments that arise in the human heart in all ages. His personal
history-the history of a man who was upright in the main, but who had
not courage to follow out the will of God boldly-is so intermingled with
his prophecy, as to make this individual application easy and natural.
Nevertheless the history of Jonah is that of one who bears testimony on
the part of God, rather than that of a believer in his ordinary life. It
is the history of the human heart, when the testimony of God towards the
world has been committed to it, and that of the sovereign and
governmental dealings of God in connection with the workings of that
heart. It is on this account that we find in the history of Jonah a
picture of the history of the Jews in this respect, and even in some
respects of that of the Messiah; only that the latter entered into it in
grace, and was always perfect in it. I shall point out the leading
features which the Spirit of God has been pleased to develop in this
narrative, deeply interesting as it is in this aspect.

It is evident that in this prophecy the prophetic events are but the
occasion, and, as it were, the frame of the great principles that flow
from them; or rather the prophetic event. For the prophecy is confined
to the threat of the destruction of Nineveh in forty days: a threat
whose accomplishment was averted by the repentance of that city. Jonah's
history forms the chief portion of the book.
