### [Revelation Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md)

This at once distinguishes them from the heavenly worshipers; there is
no temple there; the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. He
that sits on the throne tabernacles over these, as once over the
tabernacle They are not only as Israel in the courts or the nations in
the world: they have a priest's place in the world's temple. The
millennial multitudes are worshipers; these priests. As Anna, the
daughter of Phanuel, ever in the temple itself, they have always access
to the throne. But they had blessings under the Lamb also, to whom they
alike ascribe their salvation the good Shepherd cast out, and who had
passed through tribulation Himself, also so great, would feed them; they
would not hunger any more or thirst any more, as they had often done;
nor should persecution or tribulation reach them. The Lamb, as known in
this transitional time, but exalted in the throne, would feed them and
lead them to living fountains of water. It is not, as to us, the promise
of a well of water, springing up into everlasting life, and flowing out
as a river; but they would be fed, refreshed, and perfectly cared for by
the Lamb's grace whom they had followed; and God Himself would wipe all
tears from their eyes. They would have the consolations of God, worth
all the sorrows they had passed through. But their blessings are
consolations, not proper heavenly joy. They are thus a class apart,
distinct from the elders or heavenly saints, and distinct from
millennial saints who will never see tribulation, having a known
position fixed in grace before God. It is a new revelation as to those
passing through the great tribulation. The 144,000 of Chapter 14 are a
similar class from among the Jews, coming out of their special
tribulation.

Again, divine interest in the saints, brought out into action by the
effectual intercession of the great High Priest, brings down judgments
on the world. For those under the altar there was no intercession; they
were perfected, having been rejected and slain like Christ. There are
saints upon the earth who yet need this intercession, so that their cry
in their infirmity should be heard and answered. The smoke of the
incense came up with the prayers of the saints. The great mediator took
of the fire off the altar, put it into the censer, and cast it on the
earth. The intercession turned into judgments in the answer, and the
signs of God's power were manifested, and subversion of order on earth
followed voices, thunderings, lightnings (as when the throne was set),
and an earthquake.

Then follow specific judgments, on the signal being given from above.
They fell on the Roman earth, the third part of the earth. (See [Rev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004)..md) First, judgment from heaven,
hail and fire; and violence or destruction of men; on earth blood: the
effect was the destruction of the great ones in the Roman earth, and of
all general prosperity. Next, a great power, as the judgment of God, was
cast into the mass of peoples still, I apprehend, in the Roman earth;
for destruction of men, and all that belonged to their subsistence and
commerce followed in those limits. Next, one that should have been a
special source of light and order in government fell from his place, and
corrupted the moral sources of popular motives and feelings what governs
and sways the people so as to characterise them. They became bitter, and
men died of it. The last of these four plagues falls on the governing
powers, and puts them out in their order, as from God: all in the limits
of the Roman earth. This closed the general judgments, subverting and
producing disaster and confusion in the Roman earth, where the power of
evil, as against the saints, was.

Woe (specially on those who had their settled place on earth, in
contrast with the heavenly calling, and who were unawakened and unmoved
by the judgments on the earth, but clung to it in spite of all as their
home,) is then announced. Threefold woe! The term "dwellers on," or
"inhabiters of," the earth, has not yet been used, save in the promise
to Philadelphia and the claims of the souls under the altar: for both of
these were in contrast with such. After all these dealings of God, they
are a distinct and manifested class, and spoken of, in what passes on
the earth, as such. Against this perVersely unbelieving class the
earthly judgments of God are now directed: the first, against the Jews;
the second, against the inhabitants of the Roman earth; the last,
universal.
