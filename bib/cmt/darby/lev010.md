### [Leviticus Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#001.md)

Lastly, we have what, alas! is always the case with man. The first day
the priesthood is established, it comes short of the glory of God. Nadab
and Abihu offer strange fire, acting as men in nature in their
relationship with God, not founding their service on the altar of
sacrifice, and they die.

The priests must on no account whatever depart from their consecration
([Lev 10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#006).md); therefore they must be
Nazarites ([Lev 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009).md), apart from that
which is only the excitement of the flesh, separated unto God from all
that which would let nature loose in His presence; from that which would
prevent them from feeling its power-a state of abstraction in which the
flesh has no place. The presence of God must have its full power, and
the flesh must be silent before Him. It is only thus that they would be
able to discern between that which is unclean and that which is
pure-that which is profane and that which is holy. There are lawful
things, real joys, which, however, do not belong to priesthood-joys
which flow from God's blessings, and which do not keep the flesh in
check as does His presence; for there is always a certain restraint on
the heart, on nature and its activity, produced by the presence of God.
But priesthood is exercised before Him.
