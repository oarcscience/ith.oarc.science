### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#001)

"And David went up and dwelt in the strongholds of Engedi." Saul pursues
him thither, after following the Philistines, more occupied with his
jealousy of the king whom God had chosen than with the enemies of his
people. But this expedition is not to his honour. An opportunity to kill
his persecutor presents itself to David; but the fear of God rules him,
and even Saul's heart is touched for the moment by a preservation which
proved that David respected him in a way he had not imagined. He sees
clearly what the result will be, and engages David to protect his
posterity; but David does not return to Saul. The relationship was
broken.
