### [Psalms Chapter 149](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001)

Psalm 149 calls upon Israel to praise. The creation and Israel we have
seen all through to be co-ordinate (the new creation and the assembly),
and to form the sphere of the Psalms. Still it is now in the
congregation of the saints. Israel's relationship is double: Jehovah has
formed him for His praise; He is King in Zion. The reasons of praise are
then given. Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; but we learn who have
this place. He beautifies the meek with salvation. Then he can say, Let
the saints be joyful in glory; but if the high praises of God are in
their mouths, the sword of earthly judgment and vengeance is in their
hands to execute it on the nations and peoples, to bind the mighty ones
who had once oppressed them. It was the judgment written. Such honor
have all His saints. The persons here in view are thus evident, as is
their position: the meek in Israel now delivered, and the Lord Jesus,
King in Zion, execute judgment on those who had oppressed them. Such is
indeed, as said, the judgment written, and confirms the view I have
taken of the last two books: only now it is complete in its statements.
The millennium itself is not described. The Psalms are the introduction
to it, and by their connection of Christ, as seen in the Gospels, and
the remnant of Israel, with the last days, throw the greatest light on
the Gospels themselves.
