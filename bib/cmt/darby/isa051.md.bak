### [Isaiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 51 and 52.

The application is found in chapters 51 and 52 to the end of Verse 12
([Isa 52:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md), and that to the
remnant of Israel. In [Isa 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#013.md) a
fresh division of the prophecy begins. The remnant in the last days are
exhorted to have confidence. Those who follow after righteousness are a
little flock; but God had called Abraham alone, and had blessed and
increased him; He can do the same for the remnant. Compare [Eze
33:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#024.md), where we see in what manner
carnal confidence, walking in unrighteousness, can imitate, to its own
ruin, divine faith. Jehovah will comfort Zion. [Isa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md) is the second exhortation. The
remnant are acknowledged as Jehovah's nation. His righteousness was
near; salvation and deliverance were already gone forth from Him, and
should be for ever. In [Isa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007.md) there
is a further step. They are a people who know righteousness, who have
the law in their heart; they are not to fear men who should be devoured
by the judgments of God. But His righteousness and His salvation should
be everlasting. The remnant, thus set in their place, are revealed by
the Spirit of prophecy as owned of Jehovah. The same Spirit speaks by
the mouth of the remnant ([Isa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009).md),
to implore His intervention in power, and to claim the perfect
lovingkindness of Jehovah, and the assured salvation of His redeemed
ones, as well as the re-establishment of Zion in everlasting joy. The
remnant thus encouraged, the Spirit turns to Zion, and even as "Awake!
awake!" had been addressed to the arm of Jehovah, so is it now to Zion
herself, oppressed and trodden under foot of strangers. As if to say it
was Zion that had need to awake, not the Lord, for the salvation was
there. The cup shall now be given to those that afflicted her again.
"Awake! awake!" is once more addressed to her, that she may stand up and
clothe herself in strength and glory. For Jehovah has made bare His holy
arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall
see the salvation of Israel's God. This threefold repetition of
"hearken" ([Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md); [Isa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md) and [Isa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#007).md), followed by the threefold
repetition, "Awake! awake!" is extremely beautiful. The Verses 11, 12 of
chapter 52 ([Isa 52:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011).md) shew that
in those days Israel will be captive among apostate Gentiles, as in the
days of Babylon. [Isa 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md) is closely
connected with that which precedes. It is Christ's position in those
times of glory and of deliverance wrought by Jehovah. Nevertheless it
may be considered separately, and as beginning a new subject, because it
forms a whole with respect to the Lord Jesus Himself. Christ shall be
very highly exalted in those days. But what had His position been? On
this subject the Spirit of prophecy enlarges. The kings shall be
astonished at His glory-His whose visage had been so marred, more than
any man.
