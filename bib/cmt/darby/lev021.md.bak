### [Leviticus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 21 and 22.

Chapter 21 specially presents what becomes the priests as set apart for
Jehovah: this more intimate nearness supposed a conduct corresponding
with it. All in their state must be fit for God's presence. So it is
with us. Chapter 22. If there was, through weakness or neglect, anything
unbecoming this nearness, they were to keep at a distance. Consequently
there were things of which the priests, and those of their families in
priestly separation, alone could eat. It is the same with us: there are
things of the spiritual food of Christ, offered to God, upon which we
can only feed, inasmuch as the heart is really separated unto Him, by
the power of the Spirit. The offerings themselves must be pure, and such
as become the eyes of God to whom they are presented, and a right
appreciation of His majesty, and of our relationship with Him. All this
indeed is found in Christ. No hardness of nature is allowed, but
holiness. In what is connected with our own joy before God, holiness
must be maintained in what is offered.

In chapter 20, where they are forbidden to follow the brutal and
superstitious customs of idolatry (to which Satan had degraded man) and
are warned against all impurity, which indeed was always inseparable
from it, and for which the influence of the devil gave license, we have
this simple and beautiful exposition of the principle which was to
govern them: "Sanctify yourselves, therefore, and be ye holy: for I am
Jehovah your God. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am
Jehovah which sanctify you." They are bound to holiness and to sanctify
themselves practically, because they are in the house, and the Master of
it is holy. Sanctification supposed that they were in an acknowledged
relationship with God, who will have the inmates of His house clean
according to His own cleanness. But then His word was to be the rule.
They were to obey Him in His directions, for it was He who was
separating them to Himself. This is a very instructive word as to the
standard of all our thoughts with regard to that. If any are in my
house, I will have them clean, because they are there; those outside are
no concern of mine \[See Note \#1\]. Then it was Jehovah who was
separating them for that. There are interesting instructions with regard
to what the priests ate, which we shall find again in the following
book, and consider when we come to it.

Note \#1

I do not speak of responsibility or mercy here.
