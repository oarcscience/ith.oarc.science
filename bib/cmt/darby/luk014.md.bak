### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md)

Some moral details are unfolded in the next chapter (14). \[See Note
\#37\] The Lord, being invited to eat with a Pharisee, vindicates the
rights of grace over that which was the seal of the old covenant,
judging the hypocrisy which at any rate broke the sabbath when their own
interest was in question. He then shews the spirit of humility and
lowliness that became man in the presence of God, and the union of this
spirit with love when there was the possession of worldly advantages. By
such a walk, which was indeed His own, in opposition to the spirit of
the world, one's place there would be lost; the reciprocations of
society would not exist: but another hour was beginning to dawn through
His rejection, and which in fact was its necessary consequence the
resurrection of the just. Cast out by the world from its bosom, they
should have their place apart in that which the power of God should
effect. There would be a resurrection of the just. Then should they have
the reward of all that they had done through love to the Lord and for
His name's sake. We see the force with which this allusion applies to
the Lord's position at that moment, ready to be put to death in this
world.

And the kingdom, what would then become of it? With reference to it at
that moment, the Lord gives its picture in the parable of the great
supper of grace ([Luk 14:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016).md).
Despised by the chief part of the Jews, when God invited them to come
in, He then sought out the poor of the flock. But there was room in His
house, and He sends out to seek the Gentiles, and bring them in by His
call that went forth in efficacious power when they sought Him not. It
was the activity of His grace. The Jews, as such, should have no part in
it. But those who entered in must count the cost ([Luk
14:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025).md). All must be forsaken in
this world; every link with this world must be broken. The nearer
anything was to the heart, the more dangerous, the more it must be
abhorred. Not that the affections are evil things; but, Christ being
rejected by this world, everything that binds us to earth must be
sacrificed for Him. Cost what it may, He must be followed; and one must
know how to hate one's own life, and even to lose it, rather than grow
lax in following the Lord. All was lost here in this life of nature.
Salvation, the Saviour, eternal life, were in question. To take up one's
cross, therefore, and follow Him, was the only way to be His disciples.
Without this faith, it were better not to begin building; and, being
conscious that the enemy is outwardly much stronger than we are, it must
be ascertained whether, come what may, we dare, with settled purpose, go
out to meet him by faith in Christ. Everything connected with the flesh
as such must be broken with.

Moreover ([Luk 14:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034).md), they were
called to bear a peculiar testimony, to witness to the character of God
Himself, as He was rejected in Christ, of which the cross was the true
measure. If the disciples were not this, they were nothing worth. They
were disciples in this world for no other purpose. Has the church
maintained this character? A solemn question for us all!

Note \#37

chapters 15 and 16 present the sovereign energy of grace, its fruits,
and its consequences, in contrast with all apparent earthly blessing,
and God's government on earth in Israel, and the old covenant. The
fourteenth, before entering on that full revelation, shews us the place
to be taken in such a world as this, in view of the distributive justice
of God, of the judgment He will execute when He comes. Self-exaltation
in this world leads to humiliation. Self-humiliation taking the lowest
place according to what we are, on the one side, and, on the other, to
act in love leads to exaltation on the part of Him who judges morally.
After this we have set before us, the responsibility that flows from the
presentation of grace; and that which it costs in a world like this. In
a word, sin existing there, to exalt oneself is ministering to it; it is
selfishness, and the love of the world in which it unfolds itself. One
sinks morally. It is being far from God morally. When love acts, It is
representing God to the men of this world. Nevertheless it is at the
cost of all things that we become His disciples.
