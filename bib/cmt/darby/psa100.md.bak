### [Psalms Chapter 100](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#001.md)

Psalm 100 is the summons to universal worship of Jehovah with gladness
and praise. Jehovah is good. Verse 5 ([Psa
100:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#005).md) gives in principle the great
truth so often laid down as Israel's hope His mercy endureth for ever
which gave them too to say, How long? "All ye lands" is free as a
translation; it is rather "all the land" (of Israel) or "all the earth."
The claim of Israel to be His people and the sheep of His pasture seems
to extend it to the earth. It is, however, to me very doubtful if it is
not simply "all the land of Israel." This closes the remarkable series
picturing the coming of Jehovah (Christ) to establish righteousness and
judgment in the earth and His throne in Israel.
