<p>Psalm 130 takes up another subject, of the place of which we have found clear traces before  the sins of Israel as between the people and God. It is not, however, now merely legal distress. Confidence in Jehovah characterizes it, though accompanied by depth of distress and humiliation. This is the effect of the connection of the sense of sin and of mercy in the soul. Mere legal distress is more selfish in its terror, though admirable for destroying confidence in self and throwing on mercy; conviction with the sense of mercy is more the sense of wronging the God of goodness. It is a deeper work after all. Here there is forgiveness with Jehovah that He might be feared, and the soul waits on Jehovah, though it has cried out of the depths. There is desire, grace being looked to, as well as waiting for Jehovah, Verse 6, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#006">Psa 130:6</A>). The groundwork is stated in Verse 7, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007">Psa 130:7</A>), while Verse 8 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008">Psa 130:8</A>) shows confidence in the full results. Verse 4 (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004">Psa 130:4</A>) is the upright acknowledgment of where the need came from, grace meeting that need; Verse 7, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#007">Psa 130:7</A>), that which can be reckoned on in Jehovah; Verse 8, (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#008">Psa 130:8</A>), the full counting on it for Israel, that is, redemption, not from troubles, but from iniquities.
