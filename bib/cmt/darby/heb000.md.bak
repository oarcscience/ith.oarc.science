Introduction to Hebrews

The important nature of the Epistle to the Hebrews demands that we
should examine it with peculiar care. It is not the presentation of
Christian position in itself, viewed as the fruit of sovereign grace,
and of the work and the resurrection of Christ, or as the result of the
union of Christians with Christ, the members of the body with the Head a
union which gives them the enjoyment of every privilege in Him. It is an
epistle in which one who has apprehended indeed the whole scope of
Christianity, considered as placing the Christian in Christ before God,
whether individually or as a member of the body, looks nevertheless at
the Lord from here below; and presents His Person and His offices as
between us and God in heaven, while we are in feebleness on earth, for
the purpose of detaching us (as walking on earth from all that would
attach us in a religious way to the earth; even when as was the case
among the Jews the bond had been ordained by God Himself.

The epistle shews us Christ in heaven, and consequently that our
religious bonds with God are heavenly, although we are not yet
personally in heaven ourselves nor viewed as united to Christ there.
Every bond with the earth is broken, even while we are walking on the
earth.

These instructions naturally are given in an epistle addressed to the
Jews, because their religious relationships had been earthly, and at the
same time solemnly appointed by God Himself. The heathen, as to their
religions, had no formal relationships except with demons.

In the case of the Jews this rupture with the earth was in its nature so
much the more solemn, the more absolute and conclusive, from the
relationship having been divine. This relationship was to be fully
acknowledged and entirely abandoned, not here because the believer is
dead and risen again in Christ, but because Christ in heaven takes the
place of all earthly figures and ordinances. God Himself, who had
instituted the ordinances of the law, now established other bonds,
different indeed in character; but it was still the same God.

This fact gives occasion for His relationships with Israel being resumed
by Him hereafter, when the nation shall be re-established and in the
enjoyment of the promises. Not that this epistle views them as actually
on that ground; on the contrary it insists on what is heavenly, and
walking by faith as Abraham and others who had not the promises, but it
lays down principles which can apply to that position, and in one or two
passages it leaves (and ought to leave) a place for this ultimate
blessing of the nation. The Epistle to the Romans, in the direct
instruction which it furnishes, cannot leave this place for the
blessings proper to the Jewish people. In its point of view all are
alike sinners, and all in Christ are justified together before God in
heaven. Still less in the Epistle to the Ephesians, with the object
which it has in view, could there be room for speaking of the future
blessing of God's people on the earth. It only contemplates Christians
as united to their heavenly Head, as His body; or as the habitation of
God on earth by the Holy Ghost. The Epistle to the Romans, in the
passage that shews the compatibility of this salvation (which, because
it was of God, was for all without distinction) with the faithfulness of
God to His promises made to the nation, touches the chord of which we
speak even more distinctly that the Epistle to the Hebrews; and shews us
that Israel will although in a different way from before resume their
place in the line peculiar to the heirs of promise; a place which
through their sin, was partially left vacant for a time to allow the
bringing in of the Gentiles on the principle of faith into this blessed
succession. We find this in Romans 11. But the object in both epistles
is to separate the faithful entirely from earth, and to bring them into
relationship religiously with heaven; the one (that to the Romans) as
regards their personal presentation to God by means of forgiveness and
divine righteousness, the other with respect to the means that God has
established, in order that the believer, in his walk here below, may
find his present relationships with heaven maintained and his daily
connection with God preserved in its integrity.

I have said preserved, because this is the subject of the epistle; \[See
Note \#1\] but it must be added, that these relationships are
established on this ground by divine revelations, which communicate the
will of God and the conditions under which He is pleased to connect
Himself with His people.

We should also remark, that in the Epistle to the Hebrews, although the
relationship of the people with God is established on a new ground,
being founded on the heavenly position of the Mediator, they are
considered as already existing. God treats with a people already known
to Him. He addresses persons in relationship with Himself, and who for a
long period have held the position of a people whom God had taken out
from the world unto Himself. It is not, as in Romans, sinners without
law or transgressors of the law, between whom there is no difference,
because all have alike come entirely short of the glory of God, all
alike are the children of wrath, or, as in Ephesians, an entirely new
creation unknown before. They were in need of some better thing; but
those here addressed were in that need because they were in relationship
with God, and the condition of their relationship with Him brought
nothing to perfection. That which they possessed was in fact nothing but
signs and figures; still, the people were, I again say, a people in
relationship with God. Many of them might refuse the new method of
blessing and grace, and consequently would be lost: but the link between
the people and God is accounted to subsist: only that, Messiah having
been revealed, a place among that people could not be had but in the
recognition of Messiah.

It is very important for the understanding of this Epistle to apprehend
this point, namely, that it is addressed to Hebrews on the ground of a
relationship which still existed \[See Note \#2\] , although in only
retained its force in so far as they acknowledged the Messiah, who was
its corner-stone. hence the first words connect their present state with
previous revelations, instead of breaking off all connection and
introducing a new thing as yet unrevealed.

Some remarks on the form of the epistle will help us to understand it
better.

It does not contain the name of its author. The reason of this is
touching and remarkable. It is that the Lord Himself, according to this
epistle, was the Apostle of Israel. The apostles whom He sent were only
employed to confirm His words by transmitting them to others, God
Himself confirming their testimonies by miraculous gifts. This also
makes us understand that, although as Priest the Lord is in heaven for
the exercise of His priesthood there, and in order to establish on new
ground the relationship of the people with God, yet the communications
of God with His people by means of the Messiah had begun when Jesus was
on earth living in their midst. Consequently the character of their
relationship was not union with Him in heaven; it was relationship with
God on the ground of divine communications and of the service of a
Mediator with God.

Moreover this epistle is a discourse, a treatise, rather than a letter
addressed in the exercise of apostolic functions to saints with whom the
writer was personally in connection. The author takes the place of a
teacher rather than of an apostle. He speaks doubtless from the height
of the heavenly calling, but in connection with the actual position of
the Jewish people; nevertheless it was for the purpose of making
believers at length understand that they must abandon that position.

The time for judgment on the nation was drawing near; and with regard to
this the destruction of Jerusalem had great significance, because it
definitely broke off all outward relationship between God and the Jewish
people. There was no longer an altar or sacrifice, priest or sanctuary.
Every link was then broken by judgment, and remains broken until it
shall be formed again under the new covenant according to grace.

Further, it will be found that there is more contrast than comparison.
The veil is compared, but then, closing the entrance to the sanctuary,
now, a new and living way into it; a sacrifice, but the repeated, so as
to say sins were still there, now once for all so that there is no
remembrance of sins; and so of every important particular.

The author of this epistle (Paul, I doubt not, but this is of little
importance) employed other motives than that of the approaching judgment
to induce the believing Jews to abandon their Judaic relationships. It
is this last step however which he engages them to take; and the
judgment was at hand. Until now they had linked Christianity with
Judaism.; there had been thousands of Christians who were very zealous
for the law. But God was about to destroy that system altogether already
in fact judged by the Jews' rejection of Christ, and by their resistance
to the testimony of the Holy Ghost. Our Epistle engages believers to
come forth entirely from that system and to bear the Lord's reproach,
setting before them a new foundation for their relationship with God in
a High Priest who is in the heavens. At the same time it links all that
it says with the testimony of God by the prophets through the
intermedium of Christ, the Son of God, speaking during His life on
earth, though now speaking from heaven.

Thus the new position is plainly set forth, but continuity with the
former is also established; and we have a glimpse, by means of the new
covenant, of continuity also with that which is to come a thread by
which another state of things, the millennial state, is connected with
the whole of God's dealings with the nation, although that which is
taught and developed in the Epistle is the position of believers (of the
people), formed by the revelation of a heavenly Christ on whom depended
all their connection with God. They were to come forth from the camp;
but it was because Jesus, in order to sanctify the people with His own
blood, suffered without the gate. For here there is no continuing city:
we seek one that is to come. The writer places himself among the remnant
of the people as one of them. He teaches with the full light of the Holy
Ghost, but not those to whom he had been sent as an apostle, with the
apostolic authority which such a mission would have given him over them.
It will be understood that in saying this we speak of the relationship
of the writer, not of the inspiration of the writing.

While developing the sympathies of Christ and His sufferings, in order
to shew that He is able to compassionate the suffering and the tried,
the Epistle does not bring forward His humiliation nor the reproach of
the cross, till quite at the end when His glory having been set forth
the author engages the Jew to follow Him and to share His reproach.

The glory of the Messiah's Person, His sympathies, His heavenly glory,
are made prominent in order to strengthen the faltering faith of the
Jewish Christians, and to fortify them in their Christian position, that
they might view the latter in its true character; and that they
themselves, being connected with heaven and established in their
heavenly calling, might learn to bear the cross and to separate
themselves from the religion of the flesh, and not draw back to a
Judaism just ready to pass away.

We must look then in this Epistle for the character of relationships
with God, formed upon the revelation of the Messiah in the position
which He had taken on high, and not for the doctrine of a new nature
approach to God in the holiest, impossible in Judaism, but no revelation
of the Father, nor union with Christ on high.

He is speaking to persons who were familiar with the privileges of the
fathers.

God had spoken to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in
different ways; and now, at the end of those days, that is to say, at
the end of the days of the Israelite dispensation, in which the law
ought to have been in vigour, at the end of the times during which God
maintained relationship with Israel (sustaining them with a disobedient
people by means of the prophets) at the end then of those days God had
spoken in the Person of the Son. There is no breach to begin a wholly
new system. The God who had spoken before by the prophets now went on to
speak in Christ.

It was not only by inspiring holy men (as He had done before), that they
might recall Israel to the law and announce the coming of the Messiah.
Himself had spoken as the Son in \[His\] Son. We see at once that the
writer connects the revelation made by Jesus \[See Note \#3\] of the
thoughts of God, with the former words addressed to Israel by the
prophets. God has spoken, he says, identifying himself with His people,
to us, as He spake to our fathers by the prophets.

The Messiah had spoken, the Son of whom the scriptures had already
testified. This gives occasion to lay open, according to the scriptures,
the glory of this Messiah, of Jesus, with regard to His Person, and to
the position He has taken.

And here we must always remember, that it is the Messiah of whom he is
speaking He who once spoke on the earth. He declares indeed His divine
glory; but it is the glory of Him who has spoken which he declares, the
glory of that Son who had appeared according to the promises made to
Israel.

This glory is twofold, and in connection with the twofold office of
Christ. It is the divine glory of the Person of the Messiah, the Son of
God. The solemn authority of His word is connected with this glory. And
then there is the glory with which His humanity is invested according to
the counsels of God the glory of the Son of man; a glory connected with
His sufferings during His sojourn here below, which fitted Him for the
exercise of a priesthood both merciful and intelligent with regard to
the necessities and the trials of His people.

These two chapters are the foundation of all the doctrine of the
epistle. In chapter 1 we find the divine glory of the Messiah's Person;
in [Heb 2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001.md) (which continues the
subject), the authority of His word; and from [Heb
2:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md), His glorious humanity. As man,
all things are put in subjection under Him; nevertheless, before being
glorified, He took part in all the sufferings and in all the temptations
to which the saints, whose nature He had assumed, are subjected. With
this glory His priesthood is connected: He is able to succour them that
are tempted, in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted. Thus He is
the Apostle and the High Priest of the "called" people.

To this twofold glory is joined an accessory glory: He is Head, as Son ,
over God's house, possessing this authority as the One who created all
things, even as Moses had authorityas a servant in the house of God on
earth. Now the believers, whom the inspired writer was addressing, were
this house, if at least they held fast their confession of His name unto
the end. For the danger of the Hebrew converts was that of losing their
confidence, because there was nothing before their eyes as the
fulfillment of the promises. Consequently exhortations follow (chapter
3:7-4:13) which refer to the voice of the Lord, as carrying the word of
God into the midst of the people, in order that they might not harden
their hearts.

From [Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md), the subject of the
priesthood is treated, leading to the value of the sacrifice of Christ,
but introducing also the two covenants in passing, and insisting on the
change of the law necessarily consequent upon the change of priesthood.
Then comes the value of the sacrifice very fully in contrast with the
figures that accompanied the old; and on which, and on the blood which
was shed in them, the covenant itself was founded. This instruction on
the priesthood continues to the end of verse 18 in chapter 10 ([Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md). The exhortations founded
thereon introduce the principle of the endurance of faith, which leads
to chapter 11, in which the cloud of witnesses is reviewed, crowning
them with the example of Christ Himself, who completed the whole career
of faith in spite of every obstacle, and who shews us where this painful
but glorious path terminates. ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002).md)

From [Heb 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003.md), he enters more closely
into the trials found in the path of faith, and gives the most solemn
warning with regard to the danger of those who draw back, and the most
precious encouragements to those who persevere in it, setting forth the
relationship into which we are brought by grace: and finally in chapter
13 he exhorts the faithful Hebrews on several points of detail, and in
particular on that of unreservedly taking the Christian position under
the cross, laying stress on the fact that Christians alone had the true
worship of God, and that they who chose to persevere in Judaism had no
right to take part in it. In a word, he world have them to separate
themselves definitely from a Judaism which was already judged, and to
lay hod of the heavenly calling, bearing the cross here below. It was
now a heavenly calling, and the path a path of faith.

Such is the summary of our Epistle. We return now to the study of its
chapters in detail.

Note \#1:

It will be found, I think, that in Hebrews the exercise of the heavenly
priesthood is not applied to the case of a fall into sin. It is for
mercy and grace to help in time of need. Its subject is access to God,
having the High Priest on high; and this we always have. The conscience
is always perfect (chaps. 9-10) as to imputation and thus going to God.
In 1 John, where communion is spoken of, which is interrupted by sin, we
have an advocate with the Father if any man sin this also founded on
perfect righteousness and propitiation in Him. The priesthood of Christ
reconciles a perfect heavenly standing with God, with a weak condition
on earth ever liable to failure gives comfort and dependence in the path
through the desert.

Note \#2:

He sanctifies the people with His own blood. They count the blood of the
covenant wherewith they were sanctified an unholy thing. There is no
inward sanctifying operation of the Spirit spoken of in Hebrews, though
there are exhortations to the pursuit of holiness.

Note \#3:

We shall see that, while shewing at the outset that the subject of his
discourse had seated Himself at the right hand of God, he speaks also of
the communications of the Lord when on earth. But even here it is in
contrast with Moses and the angels as far more excellent. All has in
view the deliverance of the believing Jews from Judaism.
