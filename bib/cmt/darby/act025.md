### [Acts Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#001.md)

The dignity of Paul's manner before all these governors is perfect. He
addresses himself to the conscience with a forgetfulness of self that
shewed a man in whom communion with God, and the sense of his
relationship with God, carried the mind above all effect of
circumstances. He was acting for God; and, with a perfect deference for
the position of those he addressed, we see that which was morally
altogether superior to them. The more humiliating his circumstances, the
more beauty there is in this superiority. Before the Gentiles he is a
missionary from God. He is again (blessed be God!) in his right place.
All that he said to the Jews was right and deserved; but why was he, who
had been delivered from the people, subjected to their total want of
conscience, and their blind passions which gave no place for testimony?
Nevertheless, as we have seen, it was to be so in order that the Jews
might in every way fill up the measure of their iniquity, and indeed
that the blessed apostle might follow the steps of his Master.
