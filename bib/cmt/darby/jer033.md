### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001)

Chapter 33 repeats with ample and rich abundance the testimony to these
blessings, and dwells particularly on the presence of the Messiah; it
announces that the branch of righteousness shall grow up unto David,
executing judgment and righteousness in the land. Judah shall be saved
and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. Her name shall be "Jehovah our
Righteousness." David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of
the house of Israel (not merely Judah), nor the tribe of Levi a priest.
The Lord's covenant with the heavens and the earth shall fail, before
this covenant with David shall be broken. However deeply sunk in despair
the people might be, the Lord would never cast off Jacob, or His servant
David, but would cause their captivity to return and would have mercy on
them. The reader will remark how complete this revelation of deliverance
is in its objects: first Judah, who was then particularly in question,
then all Israel, then the land, then Messiah and the priesthood.
Although, as a comfort to those in Babylon, the captive Jews are
encouraged with a sure hope on their repentance (chap. 29); yet in
general Judah is joined with Israel in the same deliverance. It is
looked at as a whole. Indeed, after chapter 29, save [Jer
31:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023), where Ephraim had been
already distinguished, and [Jer 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007);
[Jer 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010); [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016), in present grace because of the
siege, Israel is always put before Judah when both are named, and God
glories in the name of the God of Israel. We do not get in Jeremiah the
rejection of Messiah. His subject is present sins, and future purposes
in which Messiah comes in. With this chapter the second part of the book
closes, that is, the revelation of the full effect of God's grace
towards ruined Israel, a result which should be according to His
purposes of love, and perfect according to His counsels.
