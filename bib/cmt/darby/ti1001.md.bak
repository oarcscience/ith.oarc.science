[1 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 1:1</span></span>

The Epistles to Timothy and Titus have naturally a peculiar bearing and
character, being addressed to persons deputed by the apostle to act in
his name, or to care for the churches during his absence. Their
application to us is none the less direct on this account, because they
not only instruct us with regard to the state of the church, and the
pastoral care which the apostle bestowed on it, but the line of conduct
in which Timothy is charged to lead the faithful is that which the
faithful ought always themselves to follow. Nevertheless to confound the
directions given to Timothy and Titus with the words addressed
immediately to the faithful, would be to cast confusion upon ministry in
its best sense.

A great part of this First Epistle to Timothy requires but little
development; not because it is without importance but because it
contains directions so plain and simple that explanation would be
superfluous and practical exhortations which would only be obscured and
their force and point taken away by attempting to enlarge upon them.

On the other hand, some general principles of great importance for the
position of the assembly in general are contained in this epistle.

God assumes here, in a peculiar way, the character of a Saviour-God with
regard to the world: a principle of great importance in all that
concerns our conversation in the world and our intercourse with men. We
represent in our religious character a God of love. This was not the
case in Judaism. He was indeed the same God; but there He took the
character of a Lawgiver. All were indeed to come to His temple according
to the declaration of the prophets, and His temple was open to them; but
He did not characterise Himself as a Saviour-God for all. In Titus we
find the same expression.

In these confidential communications to his dear children in the faith
and companions in the work, we can understand that the apostle would
clearly establish the great principles on which the administration
committed to him rested. That all men were the objects of God's dealings
in grace was the general basis on which this administration was founded
that the character of God towards the world was that of a Saviour.
(Compare 2 Cor. 5) The law has its place and it still has it, as the
apostle shews the conviction of unrighteous men. \[See Note \#1\] But
the sovereign mercy of God was the starting-point of all that the
apostle had to declare. This thought, this spirit, was to govern the
worship even of believers. Details follow. Not withstanding this love to
the world, there was upon the earth an assembly of the living God, the
pillar and support of the truth, and the witness to it on earth.The
Person of Christ, and all that concerns Him, is the subject of its
confession, the foundation of its existence, and the object of its
faith. This faith would be assailed in the last days by the enemy, who,
under the pretense of sanctity, would set himself up against God the
Creator and Preserver of all men and of believers in particular.
Directions for the walk of the assembly compose the remainder of the
epistle. Conduct suitable to all is set before Timothy to make him, as
well as ourselves, understand that which befits the assembly of God. We
will now look more closely into the contents of this epistle.

From its commencement the apostle designates God as the Saviour-God.
Paul is the apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Saviour. The Lord Jesus Christ is the confidence and the hope of the
soul.

We observe also that the apostle's wish differs from that which he
expresses when addressing an assembly; "Grace, mercy," he says, " and
peace." He does not say "mercy" to the assemblies, which stand before
God as such, in consequence of the mercy shewn them, and which (however
low their condition might be) are viewed as assemblies according to the
nature in which they live by the Spirit, in which there is no question
Of mercy, because that nature is itself of God. Grace and peace are that
which they are to enjoy on the part of God. But when an individual is in
question, whatever his piety or faithfulness may be, he is both flesh
and spirit, his career has yet in part at least to be provided for,
having always need of mercy. Therefore the apostle wishes it to Timothy
as well as to Titus. \[See Note \#2\] In the case of Philemon he adds "
the church in thy house," and his wish has therefore no longer the
personal form. But with Timothy and Titus it is the apostle's intimacy
with his beloved fellow-labourers He knew how much they needed mercy. It
was his own resource, that which he had experienced for the comfort of
his own soul.

The special object for which Paul had left Timothy at Ephesus, when he
went into Macedonia, was that he might watch over the doctrine which was
taught; but being there, he gives him directions for the interior order
of the assembly. The evil which the enemy sought to introduce, with
regard to doctrine, had a twofold character; fables of human
imagination, and the introduction of the law into Christianity. As to
the former, it was pure evil and edified no on.e. The apostle does not
here say much about it; he fore warned them of the evil; and the faith
of the assembly at Ephesus was solid enough to allow him to treat the
whole system as mere fables and genealogies. The Spirit gave warning,
that in later times it would have more disastrous consequences; but at
present there was only need to guard the faithful from it as that which
was worthless. Timothy was charged by the apostle to attend to this.

But that which is committed to us in Christianity as service, is always,
both in its object and its character, at the height of the eternal
principles of God, and belongs to the foundation of our moral relations
with Him.

The object of Paul's mandate is the love of a pure heart, a good
conscience, and faith unfeigned, and never the subtleties of argument or
of human imagination. This is a sure token for souls that are sound in
the faith and guided by the Spirit of God. Speculative questions do not
act on the conscience, nor bring into the presence of God. Some had
forsaken these great landmarks of Christianity, turning aside to vain
discussions. And here we again find those same corrupters of
Christianity, who, after having rejected the Saviour, sowed the
apostle's path with thorns Judaising teachers. They desired to inculcate
the law. The human mind is adequate to this.

Now we see here the way in which one who is at the height of the truth
of God can put everything in its true place. Paul treats the produce of
human imagination as mere fables; but the law was of God and could be
made useful if rightly employed. It was of great service to condemn, to
judge evil, to slay to shew the judgment of God against every wrong
thing forbidden by the gospel which revealed the glory of the blessed
God a glory which tolerated no evil and which had been committed to the
apostle. It could be used to act upon the conscience in this way, but it
did not build up the righteous; and, if any were under the law, they
were under the curse. As a sword for the conscience, it may be used. But
grace alone is the source of our preaching and the stay of our souls.

These two systems and their respective places are presented in Verses
6-17 ([Ti1 1:6-17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).md), which form a kind
of parenthesis, the apostle resuming his address to Timothy in Verse 18
([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018).md). The use of the law is
explained in Verses 8-13 ([Ti1
1:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008).md). The apostle in a certain
sense lowers it here, while acknowledging its utility in its place, as
the weapon of righteousness for condemnation, and contrasts it with
thegospel which is connected with the glory of God Himself which this
gospel proclaims, as the law is connected with the wickedness which it
condemns.

Having spoken of the gospel of the glory which had been committed to
him, the apostle turns to the sovereign grace that brought him into the
knowledge of this glory which is the testimony to the accomplishment of
the work of grace.

"I give thanks," he says, " to Jesus Christ our Lord, who hath counted
me faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a blasphemer
and persecutor and injurious". This indeed was grace.

The apostle speaks of two things in his conversion: the one, how God
could have compassion on him in such a state he was in ignorance; the
other, the purpose of God that the apostle should be a pattern of grace
to all. That he was in ignorance and unbelief although a condition which
made mercy possible (for had he been an enemy, knowing and willing it,
while acquainted with the grace of the gospel, it would have been
impossible), yet that condition was no excuse for his sin; he puts pure
and perfect grace forward, as having abounded in his case he was the
chief of sinners. This indeed was true. The high priests had resisted
the Holy Ghost to the uttermost. Paul had joined them in it: but he was
not satisfied with that. He desired to be the active enemy of the faith
wherever it existed, and to destroy the name of Jesus. He had done much
at Jerusalem, but he wished to satiate his hatred even in foreign
cities. We know his history in the Acts. The living expression of Jewish
resistance to grace, he was also among men the expression of the most
active human enmity to Him whom God would glorify. Grace was greater
than the sin, the patience of God more perfect than the perseverance of
man's hostility. The latter was limited by man's importance, the former
has no limit in the nature of God but that of His own sovereign will.
Guilty as man may be, his sin cannot so reach God as to disturb the
independent action of His nature or change His purposes. He was pleased
to shew forth in Paul a pattern of the sovereignty of that grace and
perfect goodness to the Jews hereafter, who as a nation will be in
Saul's condition to all men as the enemies of God and by nature children
of wrath. The chief, the most active, the most inveterate of enemies was
the best and most powerful of witnesses that the grace of God abounded
over sin, and that the work of Christ was perfect to put it away. " Unto
God " being such in His nature, and having the development of all the
ages in His counsels "unto the only God, invisible, incorruptible," he
ascribes all praise and all glory. Such was the foundation of Paul's
ministry in contrast with the law. It was founded on the revelation of
grace; but it was a revelation connected with the experience of its
application to his own case. Peter, guilty of denying a living Saviour,
could speak to the Jews of grace that met their case, which was his own;
Paul, formerly the enemy of a glorified Saviour and the resister of the
Holy Ghost, could proclaim grace that rose above even that state of
sinfulness, above all that could flow from human nature grace that
opened the door to the Gentiles according to God's own counsels, when
the Jews had rejected everything, substituting the heavenly assembly for
them grace that sufficed for the future admission of that guilty nation
to better privileges than those which they had forfeited.

Such was the call of this apostle, such his ministry. Having shewn the
opposition between that which was committed to him and the law (while
affirming the usefulness of the latter, not as a rule to the righteous
or a guide to God's people, but as judging wrong), he resumes his
address to Timothy in that which refers to the details of his mission
among the Ephesians.

At the end of Chapter 1 he commits the charge to him sends him his
mandate. The term he employs relates to Verses 3 and 5 ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md); [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005).md). He had left Timothy at Ephesus
in order to command some persons there not to teach other doctrines than
the truths of the gospel. Now the end of the command, of this
evangelical commission, was love flowing from a pure heart and a good
conscience and faith unfeigned. For the gospel, while revealing the
marvelous counsels of God, maintains the great eternal principles of His
nature. It is this which distinguishes truth from the lofty pretensions
of heretical imaginations; it requires that man should be in
relationship with God really in heart and in truth according to those
principles. And this commission the apostle now entrusted to Timothy,
his own son in the faith. He was to maintain it with an authority that
had its basis in divine testimony but which he held formally from the
apostle who appointed him to it; not merely of his own accord, but
according to prophecies which had pointed him out for this purpose, and
which were a means of strength to him in the conflict he was thus
brought into. The conditions of victory were in accordance with the
nature of the commission. He was to keep the faith and a good
conscience. Now faith here is the doctrine of Christianity; yet not
merely as doctrine, but as that which the soul held between itself and
God as coming from Him. He had to maintain the truth, the christian
doctrine, but to hold it as so revealed by God Himself to the soul that
it should be the truth. The light should possess, with well-defined
outlines, the authority of God.

It was the faith, that which God had revealed, received with certainty
as such as the truth.

But, to be in communion with God, the conscience must be good, must be
pure; and if we are not in communion with God, we cannot have the
strength that would maintain us in the faith, that would enable us to
persevere in the profession of the truth, as God gives it to us. Satan
has then a hold upon us, and if the intellect of one in this state is
active, he falls into heresy. The loss of a good conscience opens the
door to Satan, because it deprives us of communion with God; and the
active mind, under Satan's influence, invents ideas instead of
confessing the truth of God. The apostle treats the fruit of this state
as "blasphemies;" the will of man is at work, and the higher the
subject, the more an unbridled will, possessed by the enemy, goes
astray, and exalts itself against God, and against the subjection of the
whole mind to the obedience of Christ, to the authority of the
revelation of God.

The apostle had delivered up two persons of this character to Satan that
is to say, outwardly. Though already deceived by him, they were not
under his dominion as having power to torment and make them suffer. For
in the assembly (when in its normal state) Satan has no power of that
kind. It is guarded from it, being the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost
and protected by God and by the power of Christ. Satan can tempt us
individually; but he has no right over the members of the assembly as
such. They are within, and, weak as they may be, Satan cannot enter
there. They may be delivered to him for their good. This may take place
at all times witness the history of Job. But the assembly ought to have
the knowledge, and be the guardian and instrument, of the accomplishment
of the dealings of God with His own. Within the assembly is the Holy
Ghost; God dwells in it as His house by the Spirit. Without is the world
of which Satan is the prince. The apostle (by the power bestowed on him,
\[See Note \#3\] for it Is an act of positive power) delivered these two
men into the power of the enemy deprived them of the shelter they had
enjoyed. They had listened to the enemy had been his instruments. It was
not in the assembly, with members of Christ, that this should have taken
place. They must be made to feel what he was to whom they had given ear.
God thus made use of Satan himself as a rod for the good of His
rebellious children. Satan should instruct them, through the pains he
would make them suffer, of whatever kind it might be, whether anguish of
soul or of body, and the latter is the immediate effect, in order that
their will might be broken and brought into subjection to God. Solemn
discipline! Marvelous power in the hands of man! but a proof that the
love of God can order all things for the purpose of delivering a soul
and bringing it to Himself.

Note \#1

Not here, specially, that any one is under it, or that it is a rule of
life for a people of God, but a rule of right and wrong to demonstrate
evil to any conscience. In Verse 5 ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005).md) we have the end of the commission
of the gospel on the other hand, partaking of the divine nature love and
holiness, acting up to responsibility, a good conscience and the heart
fully devoted to God, receiving His word and trusting Him.

Note \#2

There is, however, some question as to the reading in Titus.

Note \#3

We must not confound this act of power with discipline which is the act
of the assembly and its formal duty. In 1 Corinthians 5 the apostle
joins the assembly to himself in this act of power, but he delivered
with the power of Christ. The duty of the assembly is stated there in
Verse 13 ([Ti1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md). As to the
saints' or assembly's part, when God has exercised discipline see [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md); [Jam
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md).
