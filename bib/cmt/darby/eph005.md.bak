### [Ephesians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001.md)

Moreover, let us remark here, and it is an important feature in this
picture of the fruits of grace and of the new man, that when the grace
and love, which come down from God, act in man, they always go up again
to God in devotedness. Walk, he says, in love, even as Christ loved us
and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling savour. We see it in Christ. He is this love which comes
down in grace, but this grace, acting in man, makes Him devote Himself
to God, although it is on behalf of others. So it is in us; it is the
touchstone of the christian heart's activity.

The apostle then speaks plainly as to sin, in order that no one may
deceive himself; nor be occupied with deep truths, using them
intellectually, to the neglect of ordinary morality one of the signs of
heresy, properly so called. He has connected the profoundest doctrines
in his teaching with daily practice. If Christ be glorified, the Head of
the assembly, He is the model of the new man, the last Adam; the
assembly being one with Him on high, and the habitation of God on earth
by the Spirit, with whom every Christian is sealed. Every Christian, if
indeed he has learned the truth as it is in Jesus, has learned that it
consists in having put off the old man, and having put on the new man,
created after God in righteousness and holiness (of which Christ is the
model, according to the counsels of God in glory); and he is to grow up
unto the measure of the stature of Christ, who is the Head, and not
grieve the Holy Spirit wherewith he is sealed. The fullest revelation of
grace does not weaken the immutable truth that God had a character
proper to Himself; it unfolds that character to us by means of the most
precious revelations of the gospel, and of the closest relationships
with God, which were formed by these revelations: but this character
could not alter, nor could the kingdom of God allow of, any characters
contrary to it. The wrath of God therefore against evil, and against
those who commit it, is plainly set forth.

Now we were that which is contrary to His character, we were darkness;
not only in the dark, but darkness in our nature, the opposite of God
who is light. Not one ray of that which He is was found in our will, our
desires, our understanding. We were morally destitute of it. There was
the corruptness of the first Adam, but no share in any feature of the
divine character. We are now partakers of the divine nature, we have the
same desires, we know what it is that He loves, and we love what He
loves, we enjoy that which He enjoys, we are light (poor and weak
indeed, yet such by nature) in the Lord looked at as in Christ. They are
the fruits of light \[See Note \#24\] that are developed in the
Christian; he is to avoid all association with the unfruitful works of
darkness.

But, in speaking of motives, the apostle returns to the great subjects
that pre-occupied him, and he returns to them, not only that we should
put on the character set forth by that of which he speaks, but that we
should realise all its extent, that we should experience all its force.
He had told us that the truth in Christ was the having put on the new
man, in contrast with the old man, and that we are not to grieve the
Holy Spirit. Now he exhorts those that sleep to awake, and Christ should
be their light. Light makes all things manifest; but he who sleeps,
although not dead, does not profit by it. For hearing, seeing, and all
mental reception and communication, he is in the state of a dead man.
Alas, how apt this sleep is to overtake us! But in awaking, it was not
that they should see the light dimly, but Christ Himself should be the
light of the soul; they should have all the full revelation of that
which is well-pleasing to God, that which He loves; they should have
divine wisdom in Christ; they should be able to profit by opportunities,
should find them, being thus enlightened, in the difficulties of a world
governed by the enemy, and should act according to spiritual
understanding in every case that presented itself. Further, if they were
not to lose their senses through means of excitement used in the world,
they were to be filled with the Spirit, that is, that He should take
such possession of our affections, our thoughts, our understanding, that
He should be their only source according to His proper and mighty energy
to the exclusion of all else. Thus, full of joy, we should praise, we
should sing for joy; and we should give thanks for all that might
happen, because a God of love is the true source of all. We should be
full of joy in the spiritual realisation of the objects of faith, and
the heart continuing to be filled with the Spirit and sustained by this
grace, the experience of the hand of God in everything here below will
give rise only to thanksgiving. It comes from His hand whom we trust and
whose love we know. But giving thanks in all things is a test of the
state of the soul; because the consciousness that all things are from
God's hand, full trust in His love, and deadness as to any will of our
own, must exist in order to give thanks in everything a single eye which
delights in His will.

In entering into the details of relationships and particular duties, the
apostle cannot give up the subject that is so dear to him. The command
which he addresses to wives, that they are to submit themselves to their
husbands, immediately suggests the relationship between Christ and the
assembly, not now as a subject for knowledge, but to unfold His
affection and tender care. We have seen that the apostle, having
established the great principles displayed in the revelation of our
relationship with God our vocation then deduces their practical
consequences with regard to the life and conduct of Christians: they
were to walk as having put on the new man, to have Christ for their
light, not to grieve the Spirit, to be filled with the Spirit. Now all
this, while the fruit of grace, was either knowledge or practical
responsibility.

But here the subject is viewed in another aspect. It is the grace that
acts in Christ Himself, His affections, His guardian care, His
devotedness to the assembly. Nothing can be more precious, more tender,
more intimate. He loved the assembly that is the source of all. And
there are three steps in the work of this love. He gave Himself for it,
He washes it, He presents it all glorious to Himself. This is not
precisely the sovereign election of the individual by God; but the
affection that displays itself in the relationship which Christ
maintains with the assembly. \[See Note \#25\] See also the extent of
the gift, and how marvellous the ground of confidence that it contains.
He gives Himself; it is not only His life, true as that is, but Himself.
\[See Note \#26\]
