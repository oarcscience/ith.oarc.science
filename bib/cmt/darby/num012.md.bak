### [Numbers Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#001.md)

After that (for what form will not rebellion assume?) Miriam and Aaron
speak against Moses. It is the prophetess and the priest (one who has
the word from God and access to God, the twofold character of the people
of God), who rise up against him who is king in Jeshurun, with whom God
speaks as unto His friend. In this Moses is in all respects a type of
Christ, who stands personally outside the rights which grace has
conferred upon the people. Faithful in all the house of God, he enjoys
close intercourse with Him. Miriam and Aaron ought to have been afraid.
The excuse of the two rebels was, that Moses had taken an Ethiopian
woman-a blessed sign for us of the sovereignty of grace which has
introduced into the blessing of Christ those who had no right or title
to it. The people of God, whatever their privileges, ought to have
recognised this sovereignty. Israel would not, and was smitten with
leprosy. It is, however, in their character of witness or prophet that
they suffer this chastening.

Aaron resumes his place of intercessor, and speaks humbly to Moses (a
figure, I think, of the humiliation of Israel, grounded on the value of
the intercession of Christ, identifying Himself with the position of the
people). God's answer is, that Miriam should be humbled and chastened,
shut out, for a time, from intercourse with Him, then restored to favour
again. The people wait for her restoration. Let us remember that the
Lord here recalls this fact, that the most glorious position for Moses
was that when he was separated from the people-when he pitched his tent
without the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the congregation or
meeting. The people had but too much forgotten this. When the members of
the church also, in the thought of making themselves spiritual, take
advantage of their glory and position as prophets and priests
(characters which do indeed belong to them), to disown the rights of
Christ, as king in Jeshurun, having authority over the house of God,
there is room for considering whether they are not guilty of the
rebellion here spoken of. For my part, I believe they are.
