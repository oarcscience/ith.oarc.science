### [Psalms Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

Psalm 58. All righteousness was silent in Israel. The wicked were such
and nought else. The godly man looks for judgment on them, for, let
favor be shown to them, they will not learn uprightness. In the land of
uprightness will they deal unjustly ([Isa
26:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md). They cannot, says David of
the same, be taken with hand; one must be fenced with iron to touch them
(2 Samuel 23). Hence the godly looked for judgment the only possible
means, by God's own testimony, of removing the evil; for patience had
been fully exercised towards them, but when even God's hand was lifted
up they would not see. And the vengeance of deliverance would come, and
men would say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous; doubtless
there is a God that judgeth in the earth (see [Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009).md). This is the meaning of these
terrible judgments: they establish the government and righteous judgment
of God in the earth. Grace has taken us out of the world; we are not of
it, as Christ was not of it. Christ will, as to our deliverance, even
from suffering, come and take us out of the evil, so that we have in no
way need to seek the destruction of our enemies. But for the persecuted
remnant, it is the only and promised deliverance; and not only that it
establishes God's government of the earth.
