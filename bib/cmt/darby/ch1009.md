### [1 Chronicles Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9.

In the genealogies of Levi (chap. 6) we see, first of all, the line of
high priests until the captivity; and then the Levites, their services
and their cities. After Levi come Issachar ([Ch1
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001).md), Benjamin ([Ch1
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006).md), Naphtali ([Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013).md), few in number; the other half
tribe of Manasseh ([Ch1 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014).md), Ephraim
([Ch1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#020).md), and Asher ([Ch1
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#030).md). Then we find Benjamin again
(chap. 8), first of all with reference to Jerusalem, and afterwards in
connection with the family of Saul.

But that which has been preserved here of the genealogies of the
people-an affecting remnant (through grace) of those who had fallen
under the sorrowful condemnation of "Lo-ruhamah" and "Lo-ammi"-reveals
to us another circumstance, namely, that, wherever there has been faith,
God has blessed His people individually. Jabez ([Ch1
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#009).md), the son of affliction,
seeking blessing in the presence of the God of Israel, failed not to
find it. Jehovah enlarged his borders, and so kept him from evil that it
grieved him not. Simeon, although dispersed in Israel, was able to drive
out the enemy and possess their land, even unto mount Seir. The two
tribes and a half beyond Jordan enlarged their territories also, and
possessed the gates of their enemies, "because they cried unto God."
Afterwards they were carried away captives, because they forsook God.
Thus, although there was neither the power of the king nor the order of
the kingdom, yet, wherever there was faith, God blessed those of His
people who trusted in Him.

These genealogies were imperfect. The condition of Israel bore the
impress of the ruin which had befallen them; but also that of the
goodness of God who had brought back a remnant, and who had preserved
all that was needful to place those who formed it in the record of His
people. If the needful proof to give them a title to this were wanting,
such as were of the people ceased to enjoy their proper privileges, and
the priests their sacerdotal position, until a priest stood up with Urim
and with Thummim. For these genealogies served as a means to recognise
the people. Happy he who had preserved his own, and who had so
appreciated the heritage of Jehovah as to attach value to it! It was a
proof of faith; for, it might have been said, Of what use are these
genealogies in Babylon?

As to the Levites-for it is good to serve the Lord-their genealogies,
their cities, and their services were known with sufficient certainty,
even with respect to those that dwelt at Jerusalem. The mercy of God has
not forgotten either to preserve a lamp in the house of Saul; for in
judgment God remembers mercy. Chapter 9 teaches us the use which they
made of their genealogies; for those mentioned in it are persons who had
returned from the captivity, as may be seen in Nehemiah 11. This portion
of the book closes at [Ch1 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#034.md). Verse
35 ([Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035).md) begins the narrative.
