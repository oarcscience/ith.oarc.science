### [Acts Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)

Alas! evil shews itself there also (Chapter 5). If the mighty Spirit of
God is there, the flesh also is there. There are some who wished to have
the credit of devotedness which the Holy Ghost produces, although devoid
of that faith in God, and that self-renunciation, which, shewing itself
in the path of love, constitutes all the value and all the truth of this
devotedness. But it only gives fresh occasion to manifest the power of
the Spirit of God, the presence of God within, against evil; as the
preceding Chapter shewed His energy outside, and the precious fruits of
His grace. If there be not the simple fruit and of good already
described, there is the power of good against evil. The present state of
the assembly, as a whole, is the power of evil over good. God cannot
endure evil where He dwells; still less than where He does not dwell.
However great the energy of the testimony which He sends to those who
are outside, He exercises all patience until there is no remedy within.
The more His presence is realised and manifested (and even in proportion
as that is done), the more He shews Himself intolerant of evil. It
cannot be otherwise. He judges in the midst of His saints, where He will
have holiness; and that according to the measure of the manifestation of
Himself. Ananias and Sapphira disregarding the presence of the Holy
Ghost, whose impulse they pretended to follow, fall down dead before the
God whom, in their blindness, they sought to deceive in forgetting Him.
God was in the assembly.

Mighty, though painful, testimony to His presence! Fear pervades every
heart, both within and outside. In fact, the presence of God is a
serious thing, however great its blessing. The effect of this
manifestation of the power of a God present with those whom He
acknowledged as His own was very great. Multitudes joined themselves by
faith to the confession of the name of the Lord at least from among the
people, for the rest dared not. The more position we have in the world,
the more we fear the world which gave it us. This miraculous testimony
to the power of God was also displayed in a still more remarkable way,
so that people came from far to profit by it. The apostles were
constantly together in Solomon's porch.

But alas! the manifestation of the power of God, in connection with the
despised disciples of Jesus, and working outside the beaten track in
which the self-importance of the high priest and those that were with
him found its path, together with the progress made by that which they
rejected, and the attention drawn to the apostles by the miracles that
were wrought, excite the opposition and jealousy of the rulers; and they
put the apostles in prison. In this world good ever works in the
presence of the power of evil.

A power different from that of the Holy Ghost in the assembly now
displays itself. The providence of God, watching over His work, and
acting through the ministry of angels, frustrates all the plans of the
unbelieving heads of Israel. The priests shut up the apostles in prison.
An angel of the Lord opens the prison doors, and sends the apostles to
pursue their accustomed work in the temple. The officers whom the
council send to the prison find it shut, and everything in order; but no
apostles.

Meanwhile the council are informed that they are in the temple, teaching
the people. Confounded and alarmed, the council send to fetch them; but
the officers bring them without violence, fearing the people. For God
holds everything in check, until His testimony be rendered, when He will
have it rendered. The high priest remonstrates with them on the ground
of his former prohibition. Peter's reply is more concise than on the
former occasion, and is rather the announcement of a settled purpose,
than the rendering a testimony by reasoning with those who will not
hearken, and who shewed themselves to be adversaries. It is the same in
substance as what he had said when previously brought before the rulers:
God is to be obeyed rather than men. Opposed to God, the heads of Israel
were merely men. In saying this, all was decided: the opposition between
them and God was evident. The God of their fathers had raised up Jesus,
whom the rulers of Israel had crucified. The apostles were His
witnesses, and so was the Holy Ghost, whom God had given to those who
obeyed Him. All was said; the position clearly announced. Peter, in the
name of the apostles, formally takes it on the part of God and of
Christ, and in agreement with the seal of the Holy Ghost, who, given to
believers, bore witness in the Saviour's name. Nevertheless there is no
pride, no self-will. He must obey God. He still takes his place in
Israel ("the God," he says, "of our fathers"); but the place of
testimony for God in Israel. The advice of Gamaliel prevails to turn
aside the purposes of the council, for God has always His instruments
ready, unknown perhaps to us, where we are doing His will; nevertheless
they cause the apostles to be beaten, and command them not to preach,
and send them away. They were at a loss what to do only made the
opposition of their will the more evident, while how simple the path
when sent of God, and consciously doing His will! We must obey God.

The object of this latter part of the Chapter is to shew that the
providential care of God, whether miraculously by means of angels, or by
disposing the hearts of men to accomplish His purposes, was exercised on
behalf of the assembly, even as the Spirit of God bore testimony in it
and manifested in it His power. The apostles, in no wise terrified,
return, full of joy at being counted worthy to suffer for the name of
Jesus; and every day, in the temple, or from house to house, they cease
not to teach and to preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. However
weak they might be, God Himself maintains His testimony.
