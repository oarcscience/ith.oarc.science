### [Jonah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

The God of grace has compassion on the works of His hands, when they
humble themselves before Him and tremble at the hearing of His righteous
judgments. But Jonah, instead of caring for them, thinks only of his own
reputation as a prophet. Wretched heart of man, so unable to rise up to
the goodness of God! If Jonah had been nearer to God, he would have
known that this was truly the God whom he proclaimed, whom he had learnt
to love by knowing Him. He would have been able to say, Now, indeed, the
Ninevites know the God whose testimony I gloried in bearing, and they
will be happy. But Jonah thought only of himself; and the horrid
selfishness of his heart hides from him the God of grace, faithful to
His love for His helpless creatures. [Jon
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#002.md) exhibits the spirit of Jonah in
all its deformity. The grace of God is insupportable to the pride of
man. His justice is all very well: man can invest himself with it for
his own glory; for man loves vengeance which is allied with the power
that executes it. God must proclaim His justice. He does not save in
sin. He makes man know his sin, in order to reconcile him to Himself, in
order that his restoration may be real-may be that of his heart and of
his conscience with God. But it is to make Himself known in pardoning
him.

But God is above all the wretched evil of man, and He treats even Jonah
with kindness, yet making him feel, at the same time, that He will not
renounce His grace, His nature, to satisfy the frowardness of man's
heart. He relieves the suffering of Jonah, disappointed at the
non-fulfilment of his words; and the selfishness of Jonah's heart
delights in this relief. He almost forgets the vengeance he had desired,
in his satisfaction at being sheltered from the burning heat of the sun.
Having gone out of Nineveh, and seated himself apart that he might see
what would become of this city whose repentance vexed his evil heart, he
rejoiced, in the midst of his anger, at the gourd which God prepared for
him. But what a testimony to the utter iniquity of the flesh! The
repentance of the sinner, his return to God, irritates the heart. It is
really this; for the city is spared on account of its repentance. Will
God smite one who returns to Him in humiliation for his sins? He who
does not know the heart of man could not understand the application of
such a word as "Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity." We see it here in
the case of a prophet. There is the same thing-having also the same
application, and the same patient grace on God's part-in the case of the
elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son. But if man is content
with that which relieves his own distress, and is even angry in his
selfishness when that which relieved him is destroyed, shall not God
spare the works of His hand and have compassion on that which, in His
goodness, He has created? Assuredly He will not listen to the man who
would silence His kindness towards those who need it. Most touching and
beautiful is the last Verse of this book ([Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md), in which God displays this
force, this supreme necessity, of His love; which (although the
threatenings of His justice are heard, and must needs be heard and even
executed if man continues in rebellion) abides in the repose of that
perfect goodness which nothing can alter, and which seizes the
opportunity of displaying itself, whenever man allows Him, so to speak,
to bless him-the repose of a perfection that nothing can escape, that
observes everything, in order to act according to its own undisturbed
nature-the repose of God Himself, essential to His perfection, on which
depends all our blessing and all our peace.

It is well to remark here, that the subject of this book is not the
judgment of the secrets of all hearts in the great day, but the
government of God with respect to men on the earth. This is the case,
moreover, with all the prophets. We may observe, also, that God reveals
Himself in this book as God the Creator-Elohim. We know that even the
creatures still groan under the effects of our sin; and they share also
the kindness and the compassions of God. His tender mercies are over
them. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without Him. The day will come
when the curse shall be removed, and they shall enjoy the liberty of the
glory of the children of God, set free from bondage and corruption. If
God becomes our Father, He takes also the character of Jehovah, who will
judge Israel, and who will accomplish His promises and His purposes with
respect to them in spite of the whole world. He never ceases to be the
Creator God. He does not lay aside one of His characters in order to
assume another, any more than He confounds them together; for they
reveal His nature, and what He is.

It is sweet, after all, to see Jonah's docility in the end to the voice
of God, manifested by the existence of this book, in which the Spirit
uses him to exhibit what is in the heart of man, as the vessel of God's
testimony, and (in contrast with the prophet, who honestly confesses all
his faults) the kindness of God, to which Jonah could not elevate
himself, and to which he could not submit.

We may remark, that the case of Jonah is used in the New Testament in
two ways, which must not be confounded together: as a testimony in the
world, by the word of God-a service with which the Lord compares His
own: and afterwards as in the belly of the fish-a circumstance used by
the Lord as a figure of the time during which He lay in the grave.
Jonah, by his preaching, was a sign to the Ninevites, even as the Lord
was to the Jews, harder of hearing and of heart than those pagans who
were afar from God. Jonah was also (in that which happened to him in
consequence of his refusal to bear testimony) a type of that which
befell Jesus when He bore the penalty of the people's sin, and when,
being raised from the dead, He became the testimony of grace, and at the
same time the occasion of judgment to those who had rejected Him. We
have seen in his history that Jonah is a remarkable moral figure of
Israel-at least of Israel's conduct.
