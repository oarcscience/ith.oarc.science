### [Isaiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)

Finally, Jehovah invites His people to hide themselves a little moment,
while He comes out of His place to execute vengeance (chap. 27). The
power of Satan in this world and among men shall be destroyed, Israel
preserved and watered as the vine of Jehovah. He had smitten Israel, but
only in measure. Nevertheless the people shall be fully judged, and then
Jehovah will gather His dispersed, one by one. In the succeeding
chapters we have the details of that which will happen to Israel in
their own land, when invaded by the Gentiles in the last days, of which
we have had but the general picture and results. We shall find a
complete and glorious deliverance of the remnant amidst the most
terrible judgments.
