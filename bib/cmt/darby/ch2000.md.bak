Introduction to 2 Chronicles

This Second Book of Chronicles unfolds the reign of the son of David and
of the family of David. It does not commence with the faith of David at
the ark, but with the tabernacle that Moses, the servant of Jehovah had
set up, and the brazen altar, at which the king and the congregation
worshipped. The kingly power is realised in connection with Israel, the
people of God whom Moses brought out of Egypt. \[See Note \#1\] It is
the means by which the purposes of God with respect to them are
accomplished; it is not yet assuredly a new covenant by a new power, but
the object of blessing is Israel. If it is Boaz and Ruth who raise up
the family, it is to Naomi that a son is born, that is, through
sovereign grace, by a redeemer "in whom is strength": \[See Note \#2\]
one who had no title (and Israel had no more any) is introduced into the
enjoyment of the promises. Israel, long known as the "pleasant one"
\[See Note \#3\] of God, is the people which receives into its bosom the
son that is born. To us, they say, a son is born ([Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007).md). At the altar which was before
Jehovah in the tabernacle of the congregation Solomon recognises his
position. He is to judge the people of God. Hereafter all this shall
take place in power.

This book presents us also with kingly power in connection with the
earth and the government of the people on the earth. Glory and riches
are added to that which Solomon requests. Neither enemies nor the energy
of faith is in question. The king's position is the result of the
victory which that faith had obtained. He reigns, and is established in
glory and in riches. He begins to build the house. Hiram acknowledges
Jehovah as the Creator of heaven and earth, and the strangers who dwell
in Israel are the king's servants to do his work. In the temple the
cherubim have their faces towards the house, that is, outwards. \[See
Note \#4\] The attributes of God do not now look only at the covenant to
maintain it in spite of everything, but they also look outwards in order
to bless. It is the time of the millennium; but the veil is here found
again in the temple. Whatever may be the blessing of the true Solomon's
reign, Israel and the earth have not immediate and direct access to Him
who is hidden in the heavens. That is our portion, even to enter boldly
now through the veil, and to find no veil in heaven: blessed be God!
There is no temple there. Jehovah God Almighty and the Lamb are the
temple of it. The stability of a divine government is granted to the
earth, \[See Note \#5\] and the blessing of a God whose face is turned
towards it; but those who are blessed do not behold that face, do not
draw nigh unto it. There is also an altar adapted for worship in a time
of such blessing. The altar and the veil are not mentioned in the Book
of Kings, where the structure of the temple is the figure of things not
seen, and where, as a whole, it is presented to us as the dwelling-place
and manifestation of God. We are told of a golden door, opening with two
leaves, before the oracle, and nothing is said about the altar.

In Chronicles the order is arranged also according to the state of
things which this book sets before us, that is to say, according to the
state of Christ's glorious kingdom. There is a court for the priests,
and the large outer court with doors. All was arranged ([Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md) for the relationship of which we
speak.

So also, as to the manifestation of the glory, nothing is said in the
Book of Kings of the public acceptance of the sacrifice; but it is
simply stated that when the ark had been carried into the holy place,
and the priests were gone out, and the staves of the ark had been drawn
out, so that the dwelling of Jehovah was definitively established there,
the glory of Jehovah filled the house. It is God's habitation, a figure
of the heavenly dwelling-place which awaits us, our Father's house. On
the other hand, that which is set before us in the Book of Chronicles is
God's connection with His people Israel in the last days, prefigured by
that which happened to Solomon. It was when the trumpeters and singers
lifted up their voices with one accord to praise Jehovah, saying "His
mercy endureth for ever," that the house was filled with a cloud. As we
have seen, when all shall be accomplished for Israel, these words will
celebrate the untiring mercy of which Israel's blessing will be the
proof in that day. It is the deliverance and blessing of that people
which demonstrate the truth of those words.

Note \#1:

But the connection is not with the ark in Zion He goes, historically,
where the people are.

Note \#2:

Such is the meaning of the name of Boaz.

Note \#3:

Naomi means "my pleasant one."

Note \#4:

the Authorised Version it is inwards. It is literally towards the house,
which, generally, would mean inwards; but, as the cherubim were at the
very bottom of the house, looking towards the house was really outwards.

Note \#5:

This stability consists, apparently, in two things God shall establish
it, and then in Him is strength. These are the two sources of the
stability of Christ's kingdom. This is the meaning of the words Jachin
and Boaz, the names of the pillars before the temple.

We have seen that there was a second part of grace, the acceptance of
Israel as worshippers after their sinnot only the ark on Mount Zion, but
the sacrifice and pardon and consequent worship of Mount Moriah, the
threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
