### [Jeremiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)

Chapter 25 closes, so to say, this part of the prophecy with a general
summary of God's judgments on the earth, giving it into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar. The immediate application to events already accomplished
does not offer much difficulty, but we shall find a good deal, if we
would bring in also an allusion to the last days. Israel, to whom the
door had always been held open, is first judged. The chapter begins by
announcing the judgment of God upon Jerusalem, because she had refused
to hear the call to repentance which had been addressed to her during
twenty-three years. And here let us notice the hardness of the people's
heart, stubborn in evil, and refusing to bow the neck to God's
testimony, in spite of all the pains God took, if we may so speak, to
warn them. And indeed it is His own language: "Jehovah hath sent unto
you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, but ye
have not hearkened" ([Ch2 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md).
Jehovah had always set before the people a full and abiding blessing, if
they repented; but they would not. The prophet announces that Jehovah
will bring all the families of the north under Nebuchadnezzar, against
Jerusalem, and against the adjoining nations, all of whom should
assuredly drink the cup of judgment that the Lord had mingled for them.
Jerusalem shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years; and after that
the king of Babylon himself should be judged and punished, according to
the prophecy of Jeremiah against all the nations. For, having begun with
Jerusalem, it should be a universal judgment. That which should
immediately happen was the judgment of the nations around Palestine, and
afterwards that of Babylon, which was the instrument of their judgment.
But the fact that the city called by the name of Jehovah was to be laid
waste implied the judgment of all the nations. Consequently, in the
symbolical action of the prophecy, all the nations connected with
Israel, all those of the world as then known, are forced to drink the
cup. But this is expressed in terms that include the nations of the
whole earth. The historical application of Verse 26 ([Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md) does not go farther than that
which happened by means of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Sheshach, who
should drink subsequently to the others. But a principle of universal
judgment is comprised in this. The universal evil is developed ([Jer
25:29-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029).md). The only question that can
be raised is whether, in this ulterior destruction of all the kingdoms
of the earth, the expression "King of Sheshach" has any application to
one who shall possess the same territory, or if it is merely
Nebuchadnezzar. I doubt its going farther. \[See Note \#1\] The picture
of universal judgment ends the first division of the prophecy. That
which follows gives details and particular cases. \[See Note \#2\]

Note \#1

In either case the judgment does not appear to me to go farther than the
oppression of the nations by the king of the Gentiles, who is raised up
in place of the throne of God in Jerusalem, and his own destruction at
the end of his wicked career.

Note \#2

The destruction of Babylon had a peculiar importance; first, because it
was substituted by God Himself in place of His throne at Jerusalem;
secondly, because it was the only Gentile power directly set up by Him,
though all power be from Him. The others replaced Babylon
providentially. Hence, at the destruction of Babylon, Jerusalem is
restored (however partially it shews the principle), and the power which
judges Babylon is the setter up of God's people again in the holy city.
Babylon-its setting up, its rule, and its destruction-involved the whole
of the direct dealings of God with the Gentiles, and with His people in
power. All the rest came in merely as a prolonging by the bye.
