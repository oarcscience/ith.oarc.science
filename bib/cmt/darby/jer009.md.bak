### [Jeremiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 7, 8, and 9.

Chapter 7 begins a new prophecy, contemplating especially the temple,
which, instead of being a protection (as the people, without conscience,
would have it), was become a further demonstration of their iniquity.
They were to remember Shiloh; for the house of God should likewise be
overthrown. Judah should be cast off, as Ephraim had been, and God would
hear no intercession for His people. He required obedience and not
sacrifice, and if the people came into His house while they were
practising idolatry, they did but defile it. But Israel had less
understanding than the birds of the heaven, which at least knew their
appointed times, while Israel knew not the judgment of Jehovah (chap.
8). From Verse 18 to Verse 2 of chapter 9 the prophet lays open the
depth of his grief. From Verse 3 of chapter 9 ([Jer
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md) he proclaims judgment-a judgment
which shall also visit the nations around. And in view of these
judgments he exhorts every man not to glory in man, but in the knowledge
of Jehovah ([Jer 9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#023).md).
