### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 22, 23, 24, and 25.

Moab also opposes in vain. Now they are in the plains of Moab, having
only Jordan between them and the land of their rest. But had they a
right to enter there? If the enemy cannot oppose by force, he will try
another way, by putting under the curse the people who well deserved it.
Balak sends for Balaam. The grand question in this touching scene is
this, "Can Satan succeed in cursing the people of God, so as to prevent
their entrance into the land of promise?" \[See Note \#1\] It is not
merely a question of redemption and of the joy of redemption at the
beginning of their course, but in the end, when all their unfaithfulness
has been manifested-their unfaithfulness even after the Lord has brought
them to Himself. Can Satan succeed then? No.

When Moses, in those same plains, has to say, with regard to their
conduct towards God, "Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the
day that I knew you," (and indeed, they had been excessively froward, a
most stiff-necked people; do we not know this well?), God says by the
mouth of Balaam, the involuntary witness of the truth, "He hath not
beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel."
What a testimony! What wonderful grace! What perfection in the ways of
God! God sees aright; He makes no mistakes. He speaks the truth
according to the perfectness of His infinite intelligence; and it is
because it is infinite, that He can see no iniquity in the redeemed
people. How could He see any in those who are washed in the blood of the
Lamb? Nor is it His mind to see it.

In His own dealings with the people He will see everything, take
knowledge of everything; but with the accuser it is a question of
righteousness. God only sees this, that, according to the counsels of
His grace, He has given a ransom; the sins of His people have been
atoned for. He could not in justice see those sins. The mouth of the
accuser is therefore obliged to confess that there are none, and that
there is no power of the enemy against Jacob. And the ground is clearly
taught: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and Israel,
what hath God wrought? Not said of God, but of Israel; and not what hath
Israel wrought, but what hath God wrought? Israel had the place, but the
work was God's work. This is very perfect. What is peculiarly blessed
and comforting in this is, that God acts and judges from His own
thoughts. From beginning to end He has had thoughts about us; He has
done what was needed to reconcile all His ways, in the accomplishment of
them, with eternal righteousness; but He has these thoughts, and acts
towards us according to them. It is these faith apprehends, accepts, and
builds on. Hence joy and peace; while the presence of God in the midst
of an accepted people to whom a new nature has been given, and His
judging all there secures practically the holiness which He cannot
dispense with, or judges departure from it, so as to vindicate His name.
But here it is God acting, judging, in spite of all, according to His
own thoughts.

Balaam was a sad character. Forced to see from afar off the blessing of
God upon His people, when he is near, and actuated by his own heart and
will, he sees nothing but the way of error, into which he wishes to drag
them that they might forfeit that blessing (if this were possible),
reasoning upon this ground, that the righteous God could not bless a
sinful people. One cannot think of any iniquity worse than that.

We shall say a few words as to his typical character. Let us pursue the
history. Balak seeks him. Balaam wishes to inquire of Jehovah either
from instinctive fear, or to attach, in the sight of others, the
importance of the name of Jehovah to what he does. Effectively God does
interfere, and even goes first to Balaam. He takes the matter in hand,
and has power over the unjust mind of Balaam against his will; for
Balaam has no understanding of the mind of God. God said, "Thou shalt
not go: they are blessed." What is his answer? "Jehovah refuseth to give
me leave to go." He would gladly have gone; his heart was set upon the
reward of Balak; but he fears before God. The blessing of the people
does not come into his mind; he is a complete stranger to the generosity
of grace-insensible to the thought of their being blessed of God, of
delight in His blessing on His people. Consequently, when there is a
renewal of the temptation, he says that he cannot transgress the
commandment of Jehovah his God: he puts on piety, and, in reality, he
was not entirely without sincerity, for God held him close, and, indeed,
allowed all this. But, at the same time, Balaam induces the messengers
of Balak to tarry and see what God would say further. What did he want
to know more about an invitation to curse that people, who, God had told
him, were blessed? He had no sympathy whatever with the thoughts of the
heart of God, none with Himself; he was governed by the fear of
consequences. Otherwise, he would have been so happy in the blessing of
the people, that he would have shuddered at the idea of cursing what God
had blessed. God, however, will use him, to give a glorious testimony on
behalf of His people, whilst, at the same time, condemning the crooked
ways of the prophet, for they were indeed crooked. He shews him his
perverseness, his folly, to be more stupid than the ass he was riding;
but, at the same time, He makes him go on his way. This meeting in the
way does serve to force him, through fear, to utter faithfully what God
should put into his mouth. Balaam goes to meet-he does not say what. It
is plain ([Num 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#001).md) that he had mixed
enchantments with the profession of the name of Jehovah, and that he had
thus been the enemy's instrument, with the credit of Jehovah's name-a
deeply solemn case. He was thus going to meet the mysterious power which
came there, and Elohim came to meet him. God restrains and hinders on
the behalf of His people all power of the enemy, and causes Balaam to
say what He wishes to be said. Balaam looks upon Israel from above, and
utters his prophecy.

This prophecy is divided into four parts. It has Israel for its object;
but, as to the principle of it, it applies also to the assembly. The
first prophecy announces the separation of the people from the world.
"The people shall dwell alone," separated unto God, a people not
reckoned among the nations.

The second prophecy declares that God does not repent. God has blessed
them; shall He not confirm what He has just said? The people are
justified, and without sin in the eyes of God. God it was who had
brought them out of Egypt. This people had "the strength of the
unicorn," and the enemy, whom he had sought (in his enchantments), had
no power against them.

Balaam, seeing at last that God was bent upon blessing, yields to the
power of God, goes no longer to the meeting of enchantments, and the
Spirit of God comes upon him. The justification of the people being now
declared, the Spirit of God can bear testimony to them, instead of
confining His testimony to the thoughts and intentions of God. Balaam
sees them from above; seeing the vision of the Almighty, he sees the
people according to the thoughts of the Spirit of God, as seen in the
mind of God from above. The eyes of the prophet are open. And remark,
here, that it is neither the anticipation of Canaan, nor Israel in their
permanent habitations: Balaam turns his face towards the wilderness and
sees Israel abiding in their tents. There the Spirit sees them, and
declares the beauty and the order of the people in the eyes of God. The
water of the refreshing of God was also always with them there; they
were as trees that Jehovah had planted, therefore will they be great
amongst the nations, a source of power and joy. They drink from the
sources of God, and pour out from them abundantly for others. God had
brought them out of Egypt, they were the work of God? and the power of
God was to go with them against their enemies. We get here, thirdly,
then, beauty, a freshness the sources of which do not dry up, and power
(what the Spirit does for the assembly).

Then, in the fourth place is the coming of Christ, the Star of Jacob,
who crowns the glory of the people. Only, as it comes in the midst of
Israel, it is in judgment. With regard to us, it will be to take us
hence, in order to make us participate in the joy of His presence, to
the marriage of the Lamb. In a word, we see the separation of the people
from the world; their justification; their order, their beauty, as
planted by God near the everlasting sources of the river of God; and
then the coming of Christ. The prophecy is perfectly beautiful. Remark,
too, the prophecies, in the renewed effort to bring a curse on them, are
not repetitions. Each such effort brings out something more of what God
had in His mind for His people! for blessing. It is not without interest
to see how Balak uses all human and superstitious means to bring the
curse on them. He had no idea of God, and it was with God he had to do.

It is very important for us to see sometimes the church from above, in
the wilderness, but in the beauty of the thoughts of God, a pearl
without price. In the midst of the camp below, in the desert, what
murmurings, complainings; how much indifference, what carnal motives,
would have been witnessed and heard! From above, for him who has the
vision of God, who has his eyes open, everything is beautiful. "I stand
in doubt of you," says the apostle; and immediately after, "I have
confidence in you, through the Lord." We must get up to Him, and we
shall have His thoughts of grace, who sees the beauty of His people, of
His assembly, through everything else, for it is beautiful. But for
this, one would be either entirely discouraged or satisfied with evil.
This vision of God removes these two thoughts at once.

We see the final judgment of the ships of Chittim (that is, of the west,
north of the Mediterranean), and that of their chief, after he has
afflicted Asshur and Eber also. It will be the terrible judgment of God
at the end of this age.

A few words more on the position of Balaam. At the end of a dispensation
based on any knowledge whatever of God, when faith is lost and
profession retained, this last obtains a renown of which men glory (as
now, of the name of Christianity). Satan uses it: power is sought from
him. They go to meet enchantments; because, whilst glorying in the
revealed name of God, they seek to satisfy their own lusts; and the
importance of the name of God is tacked on to the work of the devil.
However, God is acknowledged up to a certain point. They fear Him, and
He may interfere; but the system is diabolical, under the name of the
Lord, with a partial fear of the Lord, and a dread which recognises Him
as an object of fear. The people of God are preserved; but it is a very
solemn thought, and it is truly the history of the christian system. At
last, the unhappy Balaam, whose heart was in the bond of iniquity,
seeing that he cannot curse by the power of Satan, seeks to frustrate
the blessing of God by leading the people into sin and idolatry. As
regards the people, he is but too successful. God sends chastisement;
and, while the people are humbling themselves, the enormity of the evil
excites the indignation of Phinehas, who, acting with an energy suitable
to the circumstances, stops the plague and acquires a perpetual
priesthood in his family.

Note \#1

It is of the highest interest to see the special character of this
prophecy. It is God who, of His own will, interferes to take the part of
His people against the enemy, and that even without their knowing it, or
asking for it. It is not, as almost all prophecies are, an appeal to the
conscience of the people, accompanied by promises calculated to sustain
the faith of the remnant in the midst of the gainsayers. The people know
nothing about it; they are perhaps still murmuring in their tents (so
beautiful in the eyes of him who had the vision of the Almighty) against
the ways of God with them. It is God declaring His own thoughts and
confounding the malice of Satan, the enemy He has to do with. That is
the reason why this prophecy is so complete; presenting to us, in
spirit, our whole portion (literally it is that of Israel, as in the
fourth prophecy is evident), separation, justification, beauty in the
eyes of God (all that corresponds with the presence of the Spirit of
God), and the crown of glory in the coming of the Star of Jacob, of
Christ Himself, in glory.
