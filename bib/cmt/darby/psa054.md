### [Psalms Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#001.md)

Psalm 54 is the cry to God to deliver according to the value of His
name, the subject of trust. The double character of the enemies is
spoken ofstrangers, enemies from without; and oppressors, the proud
within, who hunt for the life of the poor. When deliverance comes, then
the name of Jehovah is introduced ([Psa
54:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006).md). The name of God is the
revelation of what He is. This is what is trusted. Jehovah's name, that
of their covenant God, will be praised when they get back into the place
of association with Him.
