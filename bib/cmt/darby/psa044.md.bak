### [Psalms Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md)

Psalm 44 gives a full and vivid picture of the state of the nation, as
in the conscience of the remnant. They had heard with their ears. Faith
rested in the memorial of all the old mighty deliverances wrought by
God, and how He had put them in possession of the land by His power, not
theirs ([Psa 44:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001).md). In Verses 9-16
([Psa 44:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009).md) their present state is
recounted. They are cast off and scattered. The enemy and avenger is
among them; they scattered among the heathens old of God for no price
([Psa 44:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017).md). Yet they have, in no
wise, swerved from their integrity. On the contrary, it is for His sake
they are killed all the day long, and counted as sheep for the
slaughter. (Note, the moment Messiah was rejected, this began in
principle: compare [Rom 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036).md). Verses
23-26 ([Psa 44:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023).md) contain the
appeal to God to wake up to redeem them for His mercies' sake. Why
should He forget them for ever? We have still God, not Jehovah, in this
psalm; for they are outside.
