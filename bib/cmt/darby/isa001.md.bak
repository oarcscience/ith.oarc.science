[Isaiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 1:1</span></span>

Isaiah 1 begins with a testimony to the sad condition of the people.
They were all wounds and corruption. It was useless to chastise them any
more. Their ceremonies were an abomination to Jehovah. He desired
righteousness. Nevertheless the people are called to repentance, and are
assured that blessing should follow repentance. Such is the position
which prophecy gives them. But God knew the people who, with their
princes, were wicked and corrupt; and God declares what will take place.
He will execute judgment and thus cleanse the people and re-establish
blessing. The two great principles are thus laid down: blessing proposed
consequent upon repentance; but in fact it will be blessing brought in
by judgment.
