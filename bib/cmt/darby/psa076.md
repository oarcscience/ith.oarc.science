### [Psalms Chapter 76](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001)

Psalm 76 is extremely simple in its application to the judgment of the
kings, who come up against Jerusalem in their pride, and find, unlooked
for, the Lord Himself there (compare [Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011) and [Zac
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002); [Zac
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003)). The judgment of God is
rehearsed, and God is now celebrated as having His dwelling-place in
Zion. He is the God of Jacob and known in Judah: His judgment was heard
from heaven. The long-despised Zion is more glorious than the mountains
of prey, the high places of human violence. The earth feared, and was
still, when God arose to judgment, and to help all the meek upon the
earth.
