### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

To close this succession of ordinances, we have (chap. 26) a most
beautiful picture of the worship consequent on the enjoyment of the land
according to the promises of God, a picture full of instruction for us
too. First, we find the main subject of this book appears as everywhere
else: Israel is in the land which God had given him for an inheritance.
But, as to worship, it is not looked at here in the light of drawing
near to God in the holy place, by means of sacrifices which, supposing
sin, opened the way for the people into the presence of Jehovah. This
characterises the whole book. Then the question was, could they, or how
far could they, or how near could they or the priests-draw near to
Jehovah in the sanctuary of His holiness. What Deuteronomy presents is,
while acknowledging their previous state, the festal enjoyment of the
effect of all the promises, only as coming from, and they themselves
identified with Jehovah. (So in chaps. 12 and 14). \[See Note \#1\] They
enjoy the promise, and present themselves as worshippers, giving thanks
as enjoying it. In presenting the firstfruits of the land of promise,
they were to go up to the place where the Lord had placed His name. What
then was the spirit of that worship?

First, it was based on the open confession that they were in the full
enjoyment of the effect of the promise of God. "I profess this day unto
Jehovah that I am come unto the country which Jehovah sware unto our
fathers to give us." That is the first feature of that worship-the full
profession of being in the enjoyment of the effect of the promise. It
was the acknowledgment of the faithfulness of God in the present
communion of His goodness. Thereupon the offering was presented.

Then, in the presence of Jehovah, the worshipper made confession of the
redemption and deliverance of the people. A Syrian, ready to perish, was
his father; and afterwards, when his children, oppressed by the
Egyptians, cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah had heard and delivered them with
an outstretched arm, and had, by a display of His power, brought them up
into the land they were enjoying.

The second feature, then, is the confession of what their misery had
been, of their impotency in time past, and that their redemption has
been accomplished by Jehovah alone, to whom they were indebted for all
these blessings. Thereupon the worshipper directly addresses Jehovah,
presenting Him with the firstfruits of those blessings. It was the
recognition of God in the blessings (the infallible effect of a work of
God in the heart), and the only means of truly enjoying them; for God's
blessings turn the heart away from Him, if their first effect is not to
turn it to Him. That is the history of Israel, and a thousand times
alas! in the details of life, that of our own hearts. A pious heart
acknowledges God Himself in the blessing, before enjoying it. See a
beautiful example in the conduct of Eliezer, the servant of Abraham,
sent to fetch a wife for Isaac.

Then it is added, "And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which
Jehovah thy God hath given unto thee." They were to enjoy them with God;
and, consequently, observe here, that in this the spirit of grace
manifests itself at once: "Thou, the Levite, and the stranger that is
within thy gate." It is impossible truly to rejoice in the blessing of
God before Him, without the spirit of grace being present-without
returning blessing for cursing, knowing that we are called to inherit
His blessing. The same truth is found again in the tithes of the third
year, given to the poor, the Levite, &c., according to the spirit which
we have just spoken of. Another feature of the state of heart of the
true worshipper was holiness in consecrating to Jehovah, with
uprightness of heart, that which was due to Him according to grace. He
was not to be robbed in anything for appropriation to oneself: nothing
was to be profaned by applying it to self-to defiled or interested uses.
In a word, the conscience was good as regarded consecration to Jehovah,
in the things by which the worshipper acknowledged Him as the true and
sole Author of all the blessings. And if Jehovah was the Author of them,
communion with Him, in acknowledging Him, was enjoyed in the spirit of
holiness, of consecration to Him, and in the spirit of goodness and
grace that was in Him towards His poor and forsaken ones. The character
of God is introduced again and again, and His name brought in, in that
which is recognised in the communion of His people; if overlooked, the
people were guilty and defiled, in that they had profaned the name of
the Lord. This consecration in purity to God, and this expression of His
goodness, are singularly beautiful. Then the blessing of God was
implored not only upon oneself, from God who cared for all His people,
but upon all Israel, upon the land which was the proof of the
faithfulness of God and of the riches of His goodness.

This chapter is of great importance, and a kind of summing up of the
spirit proposed of God in the whole book: it is the last chapter of the
body of its contents. It refers to no promises to Abraham, Isaac, etc.,
but takes the history of Israel from Jacob's going down into Egypt, a
Syrian ready to perish; oppressed in Egypt they cried to the God of
their fathers, historically so known (not the promises), and they were
delivered with great signs, and Jehovah had brought them into that good
land where they were, and they brought the firstfruits of the land
Jehovah had given them. It was the acknowledgment of the possession of
blessing in the land given by Jehovah through grace. This was their
worship; and they, and Levites, and strangers rejoiced together there in
all the good Jehovah had given. They did so also, when they had given to
fatherless, widows, Levites, strangers, the tithes of the third year,
which were eaten within their gates, they declare their cleanness and
uprightness; there had been no profanation, but obedience in all things
as to their ordinances; and thereupon an appeal to God for blessing on
the people and the land. The land possessed, its firstfruits offered to
Jehovah; then comes rejoicing in all the good Jehovah gave; then
fellowship in grace with all in need every third year, and with this,
avowal of purity of ways, thoroughness in doing it, and obedience, and
so a blessing looked for. It is a picture of the true state of the
people with Jehovah, and in the land, and walking uprightly, considering
the needy, that the blessing might rest upon them; and on this ground
they now entered into covenant with Jehovah to possess and enjoy the
land in obedience, and be fully blessed and exalted. This worship was,
then, a bond between the people and God, in the communion of what He
was; that is, a bond in worship by acknowledging what He was; and by
bearing witness to it. Thus, according to the commandments of Jehovah,
looked at as the conditions of this bond, God had that day acknowledged
the people, and the people had acknowledged Jehovah for their God. This
closes the teaching of the book.

Note \#1

These two characters of worship, the wilderness worshipper's approach to
Jehovah, and the enjoyment of promises in the land, are not separated
for Christians as they are in these books, because we have entered into,
and are in, the holiest, in heavenly places, and the things we enjoy are
the things that are there. It is all one, though we shall reign over a
subject inheritance, but our undefiled inheritance is there where we are
entered. This is a blessed truth. It is with, not from. We have from;
but we joy in God.
