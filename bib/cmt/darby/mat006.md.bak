### [Matthew Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md)

This discourse gives the principles of the kingdom, but supposes the
rejection of the King, and the position into which this would bring
those that were His; who consequently must look for a heavenly reward.
They were to be a divine savour where God was known and was dealing, and
would be a spectacle to the whole world. Moreover, this was God's
object. Their confession was to be so open that the world should refer
their works to the Father. They were to act, on the one hand, according
to a judgment of evil which reached the heart and motives, but also, on
the other, according to the Father's character in grace to approve
themselves to the Father who saw in secret, where the eye of man could
not penetrate. They were to have full confidence in Him for all their
need. His will was the rule according to which there was entrance into
the kingdom.

We may observe that this discourse is connected with the proclamation of
the kingdom as being near at hand, and that all these principles of
conduct are given as characterising the kingdom, and as the conditions
of entrance into it. No doubt it follows that they are suitable to those
who have entered in. But the discourse is pronounced in the midst of
Israel, \[See Note \#19\] before the kingdom is set up, and as the
previous state called for in order to enter, and to set forth the
fundamental principles of the kingdom in connection with that people,
and in moral contrast with the ideas they had formed respecting it.

In examining the beatitudes, we shall find that this portion in general
gives the character of Christ Himself. They suppose two things; the
coming possession of the land of Israel by the meek; and the persecution
of the faithful remnant, really righteous in their ways, and who
asserted the rights of the true King (heaven being set before them as
their hope to sustain their hearts). \[See Note \#20\]

This will be the position of the remnant in the last days before the
introduction of the kingdom, the last being exceptional. It was so,
morally, in the days of the Lord's disciples, in reference to Israel,
the earthly part being delayed. In reference to heaven, the disciples
are looked at as witnesses in Israel; but while the only preservative of
the earth they were a testimony to the world. So that the disciples are
seen as in connection with Israel, but, at the same time, as witnesses
on God's part to the world (the kingdom being in view, but not yet
established). The connection with the last days is evident; nevertheless
their testimony then had, morally, this character. Only the
establishment of the earthly kingdom has been delayed, and the church,
which is heavenly, brought in. [Mat
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md) evidently alludes to the position
of Israel in the days of Christ. And in fact they remain captive, in
prison, until they have received their full chastisement, and then they
shall come forth.

The Lord ever speaks and acts as the obedient man, moved and guided by
the Holy Ghost; but we see in the most striking manner, in this Gospel,
who it is that acts thus. And it is this which gives its true moral
character to the kingdom of heaven. John the Baptist might announce it
as a change of dispensation, but his ministry was earthly. Christ might
equally announce this same change (and the change was all-important);
but in Him there was more than this. He was from heaven, the Lord who
came from heaven. In speaking of the kingdom of heaven, He spoke out of
the deep and divine abundance of His heart. No man had been in heaven,
excepting Him who had come down from thence, the Son of man who was in
heaven. Therefore, when speaking of heaven, He spoke of that which He
knew, and testified of that which He had seen This was the case in two
ways, as shewn forth in Matthew's Gospel. It was no longer an earthly
government according to the law; Jehovah, the Saviour, Emmanuel, was
present Could He be otherwise than heavenly in His character, in the
tone, in the essence, of His whole life?

Moreover, when He began His public ministry and was sealed by the Holy
Ghost, heaven was opened to Him. He was identified with heaven as a man
sealed with the Holy Ghost on earth. He was thus the continual
expression of the spirit, of the reality, of heaven. There was not yet
the exercise of the judicial power which would uphold this character in
the face of all that opposed it. It was its manifestation in patience,
notwithstanding the opposition of all around Him and the inability of
His disciples to understand Him. Thus in the sermon on the Mount we find
the description of that which was suitable to the kingdom of heaven, and
even the assurance of reward in heaven for those who should suffer on
earth for His sake. This description, as we have seen, is essentially
the character of Christ Himself. It is thus that a heavenly spirit
expresses itself on earth. If the Lord taught these things, it is
because He loved them, because He was them and delighted in them. Being
the God of heaven, filled as man with the Spirit without measure, His
heart was perfectly in unison with a heaven that He perfectly knew.
Consequently therefore He concludes the character which His disciples
were to assume by these words: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father in heaven is perfect." All their conduct was to be in reference
to their Father in heaven. The more we understand the divine glory of
Jesus, the more we understand the way in which He was as man in
connection with heaven, the better shall we apprehend what the kingdom
of heaven was to Him with regard to that which was suitable to it. When
it shall be established hereafter in power, the world will be governed
according to these principles, although they are not, properly speaking,
its own.

The remnant in the last days, I doubt not, finding all around them
contrary to faithfulness, and seeing all Jewish hope fail before their
eyes, will be forced to look upward, and will more and more acquire this
character, which, if not heavenly, is at least very much conformed to
Christ. \[See Note \#21\]

Note \#19

We must always remember that, while dispensationally Israel has great
importance, as the centre of God's government of this world, morally
Israel was just man where all the ways and dealings of God had been
carried out so as to bring to light what he was. The Gentile was man
left to himself as regards. God's special ways, and so unrevealed.
Christ was a light, to reveal the Gentiles, [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032.md).

Note \#20

The characters pronounced blessed may be briefly noted. They suppose
evil in the world, and amongst God's people. The first is not seeking
great things for self, but accepting a despised place in a scene
contrary to God. Hence mourning characterises them there, and meekness,
a will not lifting up itself against God, or to maintain its position or
right. Then positive good in desire, for it is not yet found; hungering
hence and thirsting after it, such is the inward state and activity of
the mind. Then grace towards others. Then purity of heart, the absence
of what would shut out God; and, what is always connected with it,
peacefulness and peace-making. I think there is moral progress in the
verses, one leading to the next as an effect of it. The two last are the
consequences of maintaining a good conscience and connection with Christ
in a world of evil. There are two principles of suffering, as in 1
Peter, for righteousness' and Christ's sake.

Note \#21

Those who are put to death will go up to heaven, as [Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md) testifies, and the Apocalypse
also. The others, who are thus conformed to Christ, as a suffering Jew,
will be with Him on Mount Sion; they will learn the song which is sung
in heaven, and will follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth (on earth).
We may also remark here, that in the beatitudes there is the promise of
the earth to the meek, which will be literally fulfilled in the last
days. In [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md), a reward in heaven
is promised to those who suffer for Christ, true for us now, and in some
sort for those who shall be slain for His sake in the last days, who
will have their place in heaven, although they were a part of the Jewish
remnant and not the assembly. The same are found in
