### [Daniel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 1:1</span></span>

Chapter 1 sets before us the royalty of Judah, formerly established by
God over His people in the person of David, falling under the power of
Nebuchadnezzar; and the king, Jehovah's anointed, given up by Jehovah
into the hands of the head of the Gentiles, on whom God now bestowed
dominion. That which was announced by Isaiah ([Dan
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan039.htm#007).md) falls upon the children of the
royal seed; but God watches over them and brings them into favour with
those that kept them. This was especially the case with respect to
Daniel; The two characteristics of the faithful remnant in captivity are
prominently marked in this chapter:-firstly, faithful to the will of
God, although at a distance from His temple, they do not defile
themselves among the Gentiles; secondly, their prayer being granted,
understanding is given them, as we see in chapter 2 in Daniel's case,
even the knowledge of that which God alone can reveal, as well as His
purpose in that revelation. They alone possess this understanding, a
token of divine favour and the fruit of their faithfulness through
grace. This is the case with Daniel in particular, whose faith and
earnest fidelity marks out the path of faith for his companions. This
did not interfere with their subjection to the Gentiles, whose power was
the ordinance of God for the time being. But this is a most important
element: the place of true knowledge, of intelligence of the divine
mind, what is called the secret of the Lord, in the days of Babylonish
corruption and power, is the thorough keeping oneself undefiled by the
smallest contact with what it gives, with the meat with which it would
feed us.
