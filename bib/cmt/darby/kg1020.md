### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#001.md)

According to the outward history of Israel, that which follows the
revelations made to Elijah in Horeb looks like a time of restoration and
blessing; and outwardly it was so. Benhadad is overcome and Israel
delivered from his power; but Ahab has no knowledge at all of the mind
of God, and he lets the man whom God had condemned escape. There are
cases in which levity only proves that the honour of God and His
thoughts have no influence over the heart. It was not for Ahab to be on
brotherly terms with a king whose constant aim was the oppression of
God's people. It was putting himself on a level with a Gentile king,
forgetting the position both of Israel and of Israel's king, with
respect to God. In such a case as this, severity of conduct is the
suitable accompaniment of the sense of God's perfect grace towards His
people. He who, from love to God's people, desired in Mount Horeb to be
blotted out of the book of Jehovah, is also he who said, in the presence
of evil, "Consecrate yourselves to-day unto Jehovah, every man upon his
brother, his companion, and his neighbour"; but the weakness, which
despisal of God produces in one who holds the place of God's servant,
assumes the character of kindness towards men.
