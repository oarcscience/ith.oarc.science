### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

Moreover, this peace with the Gibeonites only brought fresh attacks upon
Israel. But now all is plain. Jehovah says to Joshua, "Fear them not,
for I have delivered them into thy hand." This is all that conflict
means for one who walks in the Spirit before God. There must be
conflict, but conflict is only victory. It is the Lord who has delivered
the enemy into our hands; none can stand before us.

All things are ours. The sun stands still, and the moon stays its
course, witnessing to the power of God and to the interest He takes in
blessing His people. We may be sure that, whithersoever the Spirit will
go, there the wheels will go ([Eze
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020).md). Joshua defeated all his
enemies, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. This
time they were faithful, they made no peace. What had Canaanites to do
in Jehovah's land? Has Satan any right to the land of promise? This is
the light in which Joshua always beholds the land of Canaan ([Jos
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#027).md). But, after the victory, Israel
returned to the camp of Gilgal. We have already explained what Gilgal
means. But the return thither of the conquerors of the Canaanitish kings
contains the instructive lesson that, whatever our victories and our
conquests may be, we must always return to the place that becomes us
before God in the annihilation of self; to the application of the
knowledge we have of God (the resurrection of Christ having set us in
the heavenly places), to the judging and the mortifying of the flesh-to
spiritual circumcision, which is the death of the flesh by the power of
resurrection. There is a time to act and a time to be still, waiting
upon God that we may be fit for action. Activity, the power that attends
us, success, everything, tends to draw us away from God, or at least to
divide the attention of our fickle hearts. But the camp is the
starting-point for victory, and the return from triumph for true
strength is always to Gilgal. It is not there that the enemy attacks us
if we are faithful. The attack will be on our side, whatever the
manoeuvres of our adversaries may be.

Let us observe also that, in spite of the people's and Joshua's
failures, everything turned out well in the end. There were faults, and
these faults received their chastisement, as in the case of Gibeon and
of Ai. But, the walk of the people being faithful in the main, God made
everything work together for good. Thus the peace with Gibeon led to
victory over the kings who attacked that people. There was cause for
humiliation and for chastisement in the details of their history; but,
as a whole, the hand of God appears in it most manifestly. It is seldom
that every step of our way is taken in faith and dependence upon God. We
do well to humble ourselves on account of this. But when the object is
the Lord's object, He goes before us, and orders all things for the
triumph of His people in this holy war, which is His own war. Only
failures may bring their fruits for a long while.
