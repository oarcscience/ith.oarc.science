### [Jeremiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md)

Chapter 3 has the same character; indeed it is the continuation of the
same address; but it contains details of Israel's and Judah's behaviour,
and proclaims the restoration of Israel by sovereign goodness, and the
blessing of the last days on their return to God. Remark only that,
before the pleading with Israel for their folly, what the Lord first
notices is that there was no seeking Himself, no longing after Him: no
people nor priests said, "Where is Jehovah?" For judgment being executed
on Israel, God can allow His heart to flow out in the testimony of
grace. This necessarily gives a place also to Judah, as the two are to
be united. The end of the chapter enlarges, in a very affecting manner,
on the spirit that grace will produce in Israel when they are brought
back, and on the manner in which the Lord will receive them. In Verses
23-25 ([Jer 3:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023).md) the prophet
confesses the people's condition at the time in which he spoke. It is in
this chapter that we have the solemn revelation, that as far as the
people were concerned, the reformation under Josiah was but hypocrisy.
These two chapters form a kind of general introduction, shewing the ways
and judgment of Israel and Judah, and their restoration by grace. The
first chapter had been the appointment of Jeremiah to the prophet's
office.
