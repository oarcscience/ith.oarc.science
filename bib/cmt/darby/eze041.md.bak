### [Ezekiel Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 40, 41, 42, and 43.

The remaining part of the prophecy is the establishment of His sanctuary
in the midst of His people. The reader will perceive that we find in
these last chapters a revelation of the same kind as that given to Moses
for the tabernacle, and to David for the temple-only that in this case
the details are preserved in the writings given to the people by
inspiration, as a testimony for the time to come, and to conscience in
all times. God takes an interest in His people. He will reestablish His
sanctuary among men. Meantime the testimony of this has been given to
the people to bring them under the responsibility which this good-will
of God towards them involved. For the prophet was commanded to tell the
house of Israel all that he had seen; and he did so. When the dimensions
of the different parts of the house have been given, the glory of
Jehovah fills the house, in the vision, as happened historically at the
dedication of the tabernacle and of the temple. [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md) proclaims that the house, which
is the throne and the footstool of Jehovah, should no more be defiled by
profane things. The prophet was then to declare that, if Israel
renounced their unfaithfulness, Jehovah would return to dwell there.
Thus the people are placed at all times under this responsibility. The
prophet was to shew the house to Israel that they might repent; and, if
they repented, he was to explain it to them in detail. And it is this
which takes place at the end. The ordinances of the house were to be
shewn them, if they humbled themselves; and in view of this the prophet
announces all that was to be done for the cleansing and the consecration
of the altar, in order that the regular service might be performed.
