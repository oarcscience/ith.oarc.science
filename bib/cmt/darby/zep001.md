[Zephaniah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 1:1</span></span>

The prophet begins by declaring that the land should be reduced to
complete desolation; afterwards, that Judah, Jerusalem, their false
gods, and their priests, should be smitten by the hand of Jehovah. The
idolaters, those who mingled the name of Jehovah with that of other
gods, those who had turned back from Jehovah, those who had not sought
Him, each one is called to hold his peace at the presence of the Lord
Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah was at hand. He had prepared His
sacrifice, He had invited His guests; and in the day of His sacrifice,
the king, the prince, and the king's children should be visited by His
hand. Violence and deceit should receive their just reward. The day of
Jehovah should cause a cry to be heard from the gates of Jerusalem. He
would search Jerusalem as with candles, and make manifest the folly of
those who denied His intervention either for good or for evil. The
prophet then declares, in general but most forcible terms, the terrors
of the day of Jehovah. The whole land should be devoured by the fire of
His jealousy. We have here the whole land-Jerusalem and Judah-judged in
the great day of God. This division of the prophecy ends here.
