### [Jeremiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

On the other hand the prophet comforts those who, by the judgment of
God, were subjected to the yoke which He had imposed upon them. The Jews
in Babylon should dwell in peace, quietly seeking the welfare of the
city in which they were captives. The time of deliverance should come.
The spirit of rebellion should be punished. Finally, having insisted on
the people's submission to the judgment, God reveals His own thoughts of
grace. This submission was necessary, because of Israel's sin; for God
must maintain His own character, and not identify Himself with the ways
of a rebellious people. But He must needs manifest Himself as He is in
His grace. The execution of the judgment, and Israel's ruined condition,
brought the truth and beauty of the grace of God into yet greater
prominence.
