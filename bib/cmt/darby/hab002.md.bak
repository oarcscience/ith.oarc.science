### [Habakkuk Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001.md)

There the prophet stops, that God in His time may explain this; watches,
like a sentinel, to receive the answer of God to the anxiety of his
soul. God, in order to comfort His prophet and all His faithful people,
commands him to write the answer so plainly, that he who runs may read
it. He bears in mind the affections of His people; He appreciates them,
for in truth they are given, according to His own heart, by the Holy
Ghost.

He will, even before the deliverance, comfort the heart that is
oppressed by the feelings to which faith itself gives birth. If faith
produces them, the answer to that faith will not be wanting. Deliverance
would not yet come. The vision was yet for an appointed time, but
deliverance on God's part would assuredly come. God, who sets value on
faith, would Himself intervene. If deliverance tarried, the faithful
should wait for it. It would surely come and would not tarry. To the
heart of man it tarried. Patience was to have its perfect work. The
patience of God had been long and perfect. The time of deliverance
should not tarry one moment after the hour appointed by God in His
wisdom.

God had judged the spirit of pride, whose effects had overwhelmed the
heart of the prophet. The oppressor was not upright, but the portion of
the just was to live by faith, and by faith he should live. A
deliverance for the people, which did not, so to say, require this
faith, might have been preferred. But God would have the heart thus
exercised. The righteous must pass through it and learn to trust in
Jehovah, to count on Him in all circumstances, to learn what He is in
Himself (come what may).

Nevertheless, although God allowed His people, on account of their sins,
to be crushed by injustice and oppression, the conduct of the oppressor
cried unto heaven, and brought judgment on his own head. Woe unto him!
for, even apart from God's relations with His people, it is He who
judges the earth and delivers it from the oppressor and the wicked. His
graven image shall not profit him: what can the dumb stone do for the
man that set it up? But Jehovah was in His holy place, in His temple.
All the earth should keep silence before Him. It should be filled with
the knowledge of His glory, as the bed of the sea with the waters that
cover it. The people of the world should labour as in the fire for very
vanity, and this from Jehovah; for He will fill the world with the
knowledge of Himself.
