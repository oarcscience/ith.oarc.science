[1 Chronicles 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 1:1</span></span>

Thus, beginning with Adam, we have the family of Seth down to Noah. Then
comes the family of Japheth and of Ham, one of whose descendants began
to be mighty on the earth; and finally that of Shem, whose God was
Jehovah, and whose line is followed down to Abraham. Abraham, called out
from among men, becomes, as it were, a fresh stock. His posterity after
the flesh is first given us; then Isaac, the child of promise, a fresh
stock, whose children after the flesh are exhibited, with their kings
and their chiefs, before the child of election.
