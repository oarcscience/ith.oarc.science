### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 4 and 5.

In chapter 4 we see that the prophet addresses the whole people
together. In Verse 15 ([Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015)) he
distinguishes Judah from Israel, warning the former not to follow the
apostasy of the latter. He dwells upon the sins ([Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002)) of which the people were guilty.
Israel is rejected from being a nation of priests unto Jehovah-a glory
which had been promised them (Exodus 19). This introduces the judgments
of the priests, properly so called, who took pleasure in the sins of the
people, that they might enrich themselves with their sacrifices. The
proverb, "Like people, like priest," was exemplified in them. Whoredom
and wine took all sound judgment from the heart; and the people of God
asked counsel of their stocks and of their staff, sacrificed in the high
places, and committed whoredom there. God would give them up to the
fruits of their iniquity. It is then that God exhorts Judah not to
follow this course. Nevertheless, the Spirit of the Lord, in unfolding
all the iniquity of Ephraim committed in His sight, shews that Judah
also was guilty before Him ([Hos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010);
[Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013)). Priests, people, king, all
are addressed as objects of the judgment; all had given themselves up to
violence. Although God had rebuked them, they would not return to Him.
Afterwards they should seek Him and not find Him. He would have
withdrawn Himself from them. Another sin is imputed to them both.
Ephraim had perceived his weakness, the consequence of his sin, and
Judah his wound; but they had gone too far from Jehovah to have recourse
unto Him; they had sought help from the Assyrian. Could he deliver the
sinful people from the judgment of Jehovah? Surely not. God would be to
them as a lion that rends its prey; and then He would go and return to
His place, until they should acknowledge their offence. In their
affliction they would diligently seek Him.
