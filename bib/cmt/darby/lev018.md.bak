### [Leviticus Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md)

Chapter 18 keeps them from dishonouring themselves in the things which
belong to nature itself-to what man ought to be in his natural
relations, that he might not dishonour himself. Man ought not to do it;
but, not having honoured God, he has been left to dishonour himself
(compare Rom. 1). The people of God, being brought into nearness to Him,
are taught on this subject. They were separated from the evil of the
world they were called out of, and the reckless profligacy into which
Satan had driven degraded man as his sport. Verse 6 ([Lev
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#006).md) is the great principle which is
insisted on in the chapter-not to confound the intimacies of marriage
with the confidence of natural relationship. Those things are forbidden
into which, in the satanic and unnatural indulgence of flesh, Satan
plunged man, and to which God had given them up to work all uncleanness
with greediness. The comeliness of nature is maintained; what is
defiling forbidden. Jehovah's statutes and judgments were to guide them:
man in probation walking in them would live.
