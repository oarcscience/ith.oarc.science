### [Psalms Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001)

Psalm 48 completes this series. Jehovah is fully established as Israel's
God in Zion, now the praise of the whole earth, the city of the great
King, and in whose palaces God is well known as a refuge. The kings were
assembled; they found another sort of power there than they thought of,
marvelled, were troubled, and hasted away. The power of the sea was
broken by the east wind, and Jehovah's hand manifested there too. The
psalm beautifully refers to the beginning of Psalm 44, where they had
said in their distress, We have heard with our ears.... the mighty works
of the fathers' days. Now they say, As we have heard, so have we seen in
the city of Jehovah Sabaoth, the city of our God. They do not now say,
as in Psalm 42, "I had gone with the multitude," but now cry to thee
from Jordan; but in sweet and unendangered peace, "we have thought of
thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple." God's name they
had trusted, but now His praise was according to it. He had come in in
power. It was so to the ends of the earth. He calls on Mount Zion to
rejoice because of these judgments, with the joyful assurance that this
God is their God for ever and ever; their life long will He guide and
bless them. It is an earthly blessing, and death, the last enemy, is not
destroyed ([Psa 48:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011)).
