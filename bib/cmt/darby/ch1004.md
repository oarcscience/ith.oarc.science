### [1 Chronicles Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001)

The following commentary covers Chapters 3, 4, and 5.

The genealogy of David's family is next given us, as far as several
generations after the return from the captivity; and then that of the
tribes in succession; but in relationship with their position in Israel,
and with the addition of certain notices of possessions acquired either
by families or by an entire tribe. Dan and Zebulun are wanting; Judah is
found ([Ch1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#001)). Simeon ([Ch1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#024)) had had his lot within the
territory of Judah, but he had enlarged his domain; and some of this
tribe, having gone beyond the borders of the land, had escaped the
captivity. Reuben ([Ch1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001)), Gad
([Ch1 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#011)), and the half tribe of
Manasseh ([Ch1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#023)), had remained
eastward of Jordan. These tribes together had also much extended their
territory, and had enriched themselves at the expense of their enemies.
These tribes come together, Judah as the royal tribe; Simeon is brought
in with him, because his territory was within Judah's; then Reuben, the
firstborn, and with him the tribes beyond Jordan as connected with him.
Also they were carried away captive before the rest. The God of Israel
brought judgment upon them. Levi came genealogically next; but I
apprehend there was a stronger reason; that it was the priestly tribe,
as Judah the royal.
