Introduction to Mark

The Gospel according to Mark has a character that differs in certain
respects from all the others. Each Gospel, as we have seen, has its own
character; each is occupied with the Person of the Lord in a different
point of view: as a divine Person, the Son of God; as the Son of man; as
the Son of David, the Messiah presented to the Jews, Emmanuel. But Mark
is occupied with none of these titles. It is the Servant we find here
and, in particular, His service as bearing the word the active service
of Christ in the gospel. The glory of His divine Person shews itself, it
is true, in a remarkable manner through His service, and, as it were, in
spite of Himself, so that He avoids its consequences. But still service
is the subject of the book. Doubtless, we shall find the character of
His teaching developing itself (and truth consequently shaking off the
Jewish forms under which it had been held), as well as the account of
His death, on which all depended for the establishment of faith. But
that which distinguishes this Gospel is the character of service and of
Servant that is attached to the life of Jesus the work that He came to
accomplish personally as living on the earth. On this account, the
history of His birth is not found in Mark. It opens with the
announcement of the beginning of the gospel. John the Baptist is the
herald, the forerunner, of Him who brought this good news to man.
