### [Ezekiel Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#001)

Chapter 25 has an especial character. The nations that surrounded and
that were within the territory of Israel rejoiced at the destruction of
Jerusalem, and of the sanctuary. Therefore God would execute judgment
upon them. Ammon, Moab, Edom, and the Philistines are the objects of
this prophecy. The testimony of God against Edom is yet more developed
in Obadiah. Thus, by the judgment that should fall upon them, should
these nations know that, although Jerusalem had not been a faithful
witness, Jehovah alone is God. Chapters 24 and 25 go together. Chapter
25 anticipates (although the date is similar) the events which gave rise
to the manifestations of hatred that are the occasion of the judgments
pronounced. But the spirit had shewn itself in these tribes or nations
from the commencement of the desolations of Judah and Jerusalem. Their
introduction here is easily to be understood, for these nations were to
share the same fate, and are included in this judgment, because they are
all upon Israel's territory. Another remarkable element (found also in
other prophecies on Edom, and giving a wider meaning to the one we are
considering), is, that it declares that the judgment which shall fall on
Edom in the end shall be executed by the hand of Israel. Compare [Oba
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#017) with Verse 14 of this chapter
[Eze 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#014).
