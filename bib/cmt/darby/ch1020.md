### [1 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 18, 19, and 20.

In chapters 18, 19 and 20 David, already delivered from all internal
conflict in Israel, triumphs over the heathen, and spreads the glory of
Israel and of his reign on every side. These are the events which
occasioned Psalm 18, although it has a more extended meaning (compare
[Ch1 18:36-45](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#036).md). It will also be
remarked that all David's faults are passed over in silence. Faithfully
recounted elsewhere, they have no place here, because it is the
fulfilment of the ways and thoughts of God in the house of the elect
king that is here depicted. The children of the giant fall with the
Philistines before the children of Israel.
