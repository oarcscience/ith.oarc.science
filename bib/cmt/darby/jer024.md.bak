### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)

Two things attract our attention in chapter 24. First, submission to the
judgment of God when He executes it is the proof of intelligence in His
word-of real spirituality. Want of faith leans, not on the stability of
the promises, but, under pretext of the promises, on that of the
ordinances and of the men who enjoy them. Those who submit to this
judgment of God upon the unfaithfulness of man (a judgment which leads
to the enjoyment of these promises, and operates to the setting aside of
ordinances, the stability of which God had not guaranteed; but in
connection with which man would, if faithful, have enjoyed the
promises)-those, I repeat, who submit to this judgment, shall enjoy the
full and entire effect of these promises, to which it is impossible that
God should be unfaithful. The second thing to be remarked is that, when
God would encourage the faith of those who submit to His judgment (being
led by this submission to a holy conviction that man has deserved it),
God stops at nothing short of the full and entire accomplishment of the
promises, which depend on His faithfulness, whatever may have been the
unfaithfulness of man-an accomplishment which can and shall be enjoyed
solely by means of a work of God in man, that will bring him into a
condition suitable to this accomplishment (see [Jer
24:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006).md). The position of the people at
the time of Jeremiah's prophecies furnished an evident opportunity for
the development of these two principles; for the people and the house of
David had entirely failed in their faithfulness to God. It is very
afflicting, and very humbling, when we are obliged to confess that God's
enemies are in the right. The only comfort is that God is in the right
([Eze 14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022).md), and that in the end
He cannot fail to accomplish His gracious promises.
