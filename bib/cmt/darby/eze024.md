### [Ezekiel Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#001.md)

In chapter 24 definitive judgment is pronounced against Jerusalem, who
was not even ashamed of her sins. The day that Nebuchadnezzar lays siege
to Jerusalem, the wife of the prophet dies; and, although she was the
dearest object of his affections, Ezekiel was not to mourn. Under the
figure of his wife's death he is instructed to refrain his heart before
the judgment of Jehovah. The judgment once executed, the mouth of the
prophet would be opened, and the word of Jehovah openly addressed to the
remnant, so that Jehovah should be known to them. Jerusalem should be
set as a caldron on the fire to melt and consume the whole. God had
purged her, but she was not purged; and now He causes His fury to rest
upon her.
