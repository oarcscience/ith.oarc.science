### [Deuteronomy Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001.md)

In chapter 31 he introduces Joshua, as the leader under whom the people
were to take possession of the promised land. He orders that the law
should be read before all every seventh year, in order that every one
might take notice of it, in that solemn moment when, enjoying afresh, as
it were, the blessing which it secured to them, they submitted to it as
a testimony that the land, as well as everything, belonged to Jehovah.
Afterwards, when Joshua is established in his charge, Moses is ordered
to communicate to the people a song inspired of God, which, based upon
the certainty of the iniquity of the people, announces the ways of the
Lord towards them; commanding the Levites, at the same time, to put the
written law by the side of the ark, as a witness against the people.
