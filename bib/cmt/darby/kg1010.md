### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001)

The king of Tyre also was dependent on the king of Israel; and the queen
of Sheba comes from the far south to delight herself in the wisdom of
the head of God's people, and to be filled with wonder at the sight of
his glory, and to praise Jehovah who had raised him so high, and who had
blessed the people in giving him to be their king. She also came with
gifts; for the king's renown had spread into distant lands.
Nevertheless, although it was a true report that she had heard, the
sight of his glory went far beyond all that had been said of it.
