### [Luke Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001.md)

It will be remarked here that, as He draws nigh to Jerusalem, the Lord
weeps over the city. It is not now as in Matthew, where, while
discoursing with the Jews, He points it out to them as that which having
rejected and slain the prophets Emmanuel also, the Lord, who would so
often have gathered her children under His wings, having been
ignominiously rejected was now given up to desolation until His return.
It is the hour of her visitation, and she has not known it. If only she
had, even now, hearkened to the call of the testimony of her God! She is
given up into the hands of the Gentiles, her enemies, who will not leave
her one stone upon another. That is to say, not having known this
visitation of God in grace in the Person of Jesus, she is set aside the
testimony goes no farther she gives place to a new order of things. Thus
the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus is here prominent. It is the moral
character of the temple also of which the Lord here speaks. The Spirit
does not notice here that it is to be the temple of God for all nations.
It is simply ([Luk 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016).md) the vineyard
is given to others. They fell upon the stone of stumbling then: when it
falls on them when Jesus comes in judgment it will grind them to powder.

In His reply to the Sadducees, three important things are added to that
which is said in Matthew. 1st, It is not only the condition of those who
are raised, and the certainty of the resurrection; it is an age, which a
certain class only, who are accounted worthy of it, shall obtain, a
separate resurrection of the just ([Luk
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035).md). 2nd, This class is composed of
the children of God, as being the children of the resurrection ([Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036).md). 3rd While waiting for this
resurrection, their souls survive death, all live unto God, although
they may be hidden from the eyes of men ([Luk
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038).md).

The parable of the wedding feast is omitted here. In chapter 14 of this
Gospel we find it with characteristic elements, a mission to the lanes
of the city, to the despised of the nations, which is not in Matthew,
who gives us the judgment of Jerusalem instead, before announcing the
evangelisation of the Gentiles. All this is characteristic. In Luke it
is grace, a moral condition of man before God, and the new order of
things founded on the rejection of Christ. I will not dwell upon those
points which Luke relates in common with Matthew. They naturally meet in
the great facts that relate to the Lord's rejection by the Jews, and its
consequences.

If we compare Matthew 23 and [Luk
20:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045.md), we shall see at once the
difference. In Luke the Spirit gives us in three Verses that which
morally puts the scribes aside. In Matthew their whole position with
respect to the dispensation is developed; whether as having a place, so
long as Moses continued, or with reference to their guiltiness before
God in that place.
