### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001)

Psalm 47 only pursues this deliverance to its bright results for Israel
according to God's glory in the earth. Jehovah is now a great King over
all the earth (compare Zechariah 14). He subdues the nations under
Israel and Himself chooses their inheritance. This is triumphantly
celebrated from Verses 5-9 ([Psa
47:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005)), and the association of the
princes of the peoples now owning God, with the people of the God of
Abraham. He is specially Israel's (the remnant's) King, but if He is, He
is King of all the earth. In these Verses God Himself is celebrated, but
He is the God of Israel. It is the celebration of the earthly part of
the millennial glory of God: Israel owned in the delivered remnant being
the center. I apprehend Verse 9 ([Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009)) should be "have joined
themselves to the people."
