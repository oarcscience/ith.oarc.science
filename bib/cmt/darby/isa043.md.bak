### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md)

The following commentary covers Chapters 41, 42, and 43.

Chapter 41 begins the historical details which prove this. Who raised up
Cyrus to overthrow idolatry? But in the midst of the havoc he made of
it, Israel is the elect servant of God, the seed of Abraham \[See Note
\#1\] (this title of "servant" is a key to the rest of the book). He is
not to fear: God will uphold him; and they that strive with him shall
perish. God will hearken to His poor, and minister to their need. The
besotted idolaters of the nations know nothing of what God is about to
do in judgment and for the deliverance of His people. But although Cyrus
is Jehovah's instrument for inflicting judgment and for delivering His
people, this is but a passing and partial thing. Above all this there is
a servant of God, His elect, who will appear in humility and without
pretension, but who shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set
judgment in the earth; and the isles of the Gentiles shall receive His
law (chap. 42). This testimony was needful, and secures the blessing of
Israel by the unfailing purpose and grace of God; but nothing more is
said of the Messiah in this part of the prophecy. The result of bringing
in the work of the Messiah is the glory of Jehovah, who alone in fact
shall be glorified, and that unto the ends of the earth. In the
manifestation of this glory He who had for a long time held His peace,
will deliver His blind and deaf people Israel, who had not understood
His ways. He will magnify His law. But why then are the people robbed
and spoiled? Jehovah had given them up because of their disobedience.
But now He delivers and saves them (chap. 43). He created them for His
glory. The blind have eyes; the deaf, ears; they are witnesses that
Jehovah alone is God. The judgments on Babylon-the commencement and the
figure of the final judgments \[See Note \#2\] -prove this. Jehovah had
formed this people for Himself, and the people had grown weary of their
God; and, as it were, had made Him to serve with their sins. But now He
pardons it all for His own glory. Glorious and striking testimony of Him
who, in grace to the sinner when the sin becomes unbearable, puts away
the sin instead of the sinner! This is what God has done through Christ.

Note \#1

It will be remarked that, though there is the fullest discovery of
Israel's sin, yet these chapters are the expression of grace and
sovereign goodness, and a remnant preserved; not the responsibility of
the nation and judgment.

Note \#2

That is, earthly judgments.
