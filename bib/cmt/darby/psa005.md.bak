### [Psalms Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#001.md)

In Psalm 5 the cry of the godly is presented, and the character of God,
as necessarily responding to that of the godly, is appealed to as
necessitating His hearing him and judging the wicked. If the godly love
godliness, surely Jehovah does; if the godly abhor wickedness, surely He
does. It answers to the "righteous Father" of the Lord in John 17: only
there the answer was heaven; here, earth the necessary consequence of
the difference of Christ's position on earth and that of the remnant.
