### [Deuteronomy Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 26:2</span></span>

THE CONFESSION OF HIM THAT OFFERS THE BASKET OF FIRST FRUITS. ([Deu
26:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#001).md)

Thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth--The
Israelites in Canaan, being God's tenants-at-will, were required to give
Him tribute in the form of first-fruits and tithes. No Israelite was at
liberty to use any productions of his field until he had presented the
required offerings. The tribute began to be exigible after the
settlement in the promised land, and it was yearly repeated at one of
the great feasts ([Lev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014.md); [Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md); [Lev
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md); [Num
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026.md); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md). Every master of a family
carried it on his shoulders in a little basket of osier, peeled willow,
or palm leaves, and brought it to the sanctuary.

[Deuteronomy 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 26:5</span></span>

thou shalt say . . . A Syrian ready to perish was my father--rather, "a
wandering Syrian." The ancestors of the Hebrews were nomad shepherds,
either Syrians by birth as Abraham, or by long residence as Jacob. When
they were established as a nation in the possession of the promised
land, they were indebted to God's unmerited goodness for their
distinguished privileges, and in token of gratitude they brought this
basket of first-fruits.

[Deuteronomy 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 26:11</span></span>

thou shalt rejoice--feasting with friends and the Levites, who were
invited on such occasions to share in the cheerful festivities that
followed oblations ([Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md); [Deu
16:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#010).md).

[Deuteronomy 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 26:12</span></span>

When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase
the third year--Among the Hebrews there were two tithings. The first was
appropriated to the Levites ([Num
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#021).md). The second, being the tenth of
what remained, was brought to Jerusalem in kind; or it was converted
into money, and the owner, on arriving in the capital, purchased sheep,
bread, and oil ([Deu 14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#022).md). This
was done for two consecutive years. But this second tithing was eaten at
home, and the third year distributed among the poor of the place ([Deu
14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028).md).

[Deuteronomy 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 26:13</span></span>

thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have brought away the hallowed
things out of mine house--This was a solemn declaration that nothing
which should be devoted to the divine service had been secretly reserved
for personal use.

[Deuteronomy 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 26:14</span></span>

I have not eaten thereof in my mourning--in a season of sorrow, which
brought defilement on sacred things; under a pretense of poverty, and
grudging to give any away to the poor.

neither . . . for any unclean use--that is, any common purpose,
different from what God had appointed and which would have been a
desecration of it.

nor given ought thereof for the dead--on any funeral service, or, to an
idol, which is a dead thing.
