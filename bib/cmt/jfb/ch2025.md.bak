### [2 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 25:1</span></span>

AMAZIAH BEGINS TO REIGN WELL. ([Ch2
25:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#001).md)

Amaziah was twenty and five years old, &c.--(See [Kg2
14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001).md).

[2 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 25:5</span></span>

HAVING HIRED AN ARMY OF ISRAELITES AGAINST THE EDOMITES, AT THE WORD OF
A PROPHET HE LOSES A HUNDRED TALENTS AND DISMISSES THEM. ([Ch2
25:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#005).md)

Amaziah . . . made captains, &c.--As all who were capable of bearing
arms were liable to serve, it was quite natural in making up the
muster-roll to class them according to their respective families and to
appoint the officers of each corps from the same quarter; so that all
the soldiers who formed a regiment were brothers, relatives, friends.
Thus the Hebrew troops were closely linked together, and had strong
inducements to keep steady in their ranks.

found them three hundred thousand choice men--This was only a fourth
part of Jehoshaphat's army ([Ch2
17:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014).md), showing how sadly the
kingdom of Judah had, in the space of eighty-two years, been reduced in
population by foreign wars, no less than by internal corruptions. But
the full amount of Amaziah's troops may not be here stated.

[2 Chronicles 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 25:6</span></span>

He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour . . . for an
hundred talents of silver--This sum was paid into the treasury of
Jehoahaz--not given as bounty to the mercenaries who were obliged to
serve at the sovereign's call; their remuneration consisting only in the
booty they might obtain. It was about Â£50,000 sterling, being 10s. per
man, including officers--a very paltry pay, compared with the bounty
given for a soldier in this country. But it must be remembered that in
ancient times campaigns were short and the hazards of the service
comparatively small.

[2 Chronicles 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 25:7</span></span>

there came a man of God--sent to dissuade Amaziah from the course he was
following, on the ground that "the Lord is not with Israel." This
statement was perfectly intelligible to the king. But the historian,
writing long after, thought it might require explanation, and therefore
added the comment, "with all the children of Ephraim." Idolatry had long
been the prevailing religion in that kingdom, and Ephraim its
headquarters. As to the other part of the prophet's advice ([Ch2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#008).md), considerable obscurity hangs
over it, as the text stands; and hence some able critics have suggested
the insertion of "not" in the middle clause, so that the verse will be
thus: "But if thou wilt go \[alone\], do, be strong for the battle; God
shall not make thee fall before the enemy."

[2 Chronicles 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 25:10</span></span>

separated them . . . the army . . . out of Ephraim . . . their anger was
greatly kindled against Judah--Amaziah, who knew his position as the
Lord's viceroy, complied with the prophet's counsel, and, consenting to
forfeit the purchase money of the Israelitish soldiers, discharged them.
Exasperated at this treatment, they resolved to indemnify themselves for
the loss of their expected booty, and so on their return home they
plundered all the towns in their way, committing great havoc both of
life and property without any stoppage, as the king of Judah and his
army had set out on their expedition ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md).

[2 Chronicles 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 25:11</span></span>

valley of salt--This ravine lies to the south of the Dead Sea. The arms
of Amaziah, in reward for his obedience to the divine will, were crowned
with victory--ten thousand of the Edomites were slain on the field, and
as many taken prisoners, who were put to death by precipitation "from
the top of the rock" \[[Ch2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#012.md)\].
This rock might be situated in the neighborhood of the battlefield, but
more probably it formed one of the high craggy cliffs of Selah (Petra),
the capital of the Edomites, whither Amaziah marched directly from the
Valley of Salt, and which he captured ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md). The savage cruelty dealt out to
them was either in retaliation for similar barbarities inflicted on the
Hebrews, or to strike terror into so rebellious a people for the future.
The mode of execution, by dashing against stones ([Psa
137:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#009).md), was common among many ancient
nations.

[2 Chronicles 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 25:14</span></span>

Amaziah . . . brought the gods of the children of Seir--The Edomites
worshipped the sun under different forms and with various rites. But
burning incense upon altars was a principal act of worship, and this was
the very thing Amaziah is described as having with strange infatuation
performed. Whether he had been captivated with the beauty of the images,
or hoped by honoring the gods to disarm their spite at him for his
conquest and harsh treatment of their votaries, his conduct in
establishing these objects of religious homage in Jerusalem was foolish,
ignorant, and highly offensive to God, who commissioned a prophet to
rebuke him for his apostasy, and threaten him with the calamity that
soon after befell him.

[2 Chronicles 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 25:16</span></span>

as he talked with him, &c.--Those who were invested with the prophetic
character were entitled to counsel kings. Amaziah, had he not been
offended by unwelcome truths, would have admitted the claim of this
prophet, who was probably the same that had given him counsel previous
to the war with Edom. But victory had elated and blinded him.

[2 Chronicles 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 25:17</span></span>

HE PROVOKES JOASH TO HIS OVERTHROW. ([Ch2
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#017).md)

Then Amaziah . . . sent to Joash . . . Come, let us see one another in
the face--(See on [Kg2 14:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008).md).
