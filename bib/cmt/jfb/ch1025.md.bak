### [1 Chronicles Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 25:1</span></span>

NUMBER AND OFFICE OF THE SINGERS. ([Ch1
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#001).md)

David and the captains of the host--that is, the princes ([Ch1
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002.md); [Ch1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#006).md). It is probable that the king
was attended on the occasion of arranging the singers by the same
parties that are mentioned as having assisted him in regulating the
order of the priests and Levites.

[1 Chronicles 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 25:2</span></span>

according to the order of the king--Hebrew, "by the hands of the king,"
that is, "according to the king's order," under the personal
superintendence of Asaph and his colleagues.

which prophesied--that is, in this connection, played with instruments.
This metaphorical application of the term "prophecy" most probably
originated in the practice of the prophets, who endeavored to rouse
their prophetic spirit by the animating influence of music (see on [Kg2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#015).md). It is said that Asaph did this
"according to David's order," because by royal appointment he officiated
in the tabernacle on Zion ([Ch1
16:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037).md), while other leaders of the
sacred music were stationed at Gibeon.

[1 Chronicles 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 25:5</span></span>

Heman the king's seer--The title of "seer" or "prophet of David" is also
given to Gad ([Ch1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#009).md), and to
Jeduthun ([Ch2 29:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#014).md), in the words
(Margin, "matters") of God.

to lift up the horn--that is, to blow loudly in the worship of God; or
perhaps it means nothing more than that he presided over the wind
instruments, as Jeduthun over the harp. Heman had been appointed at
first to serve at Gibeon ([Ch1 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#041).md).
But his destination seems to have been changed at a subsequent period.

God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters--The daughters are
mentioned, solely because from their musical taste and talents they
formed part of the choir ([Psa 68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025).md).

[1 Chronicles 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 25:6</span></span>

All these were under the hands of their father--Asaph had four sons,
Jeduthun six, and Heman fourteen, equal to twenty-four; making the
musicians with their brethren the singers, an amount of two hundred
eighty-eight. For, like the priests and Levites, they were divided into
twenty-four courses of twelve men each, equal to two hundred
eighty-eight, who served a week in rotation; and these, half of whom
officiated every week with a proportionate number of assistants, were
skilful and experienced musicians, capable of leading and instructing
the general musical corps, which comprised no less than four thousand
([Ch1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005).md).

[1 Chronicles 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 25:8</span></span>

THEIR DIVISION BY LOT INTO FOUR AND TWENTY ORDERS. (1Ch. 25:8-31)

they cast lots, ward against ward--"Ward" is an old English word for
"division" or "company." The lot was cast to determine the precedence of
the classes or divisions over which the musical leaders presided; and,
in order to secure an impartial arrangement of their order, the master
and his assistants, the teacher and his scholars, in each class or
company took part in this solemn casting of lots. In the first catalogue
given in this chapter the courses are classed according to their
employment as musicians. In the second, they are arranged in the order
of their service.
