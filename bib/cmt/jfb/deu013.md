### [Deuteronomy Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 13:1</span></span>

ENTICERS TO IDOLATRY TO BE PUT TO DEATH. ([Deu
13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001))

If there arise among you a prophet--The special counsels which follow
arose out of the general precept contained in [Deu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032); and the purport of them is,
that every attempt to seduce others from the course of duty which that
divine standard of faith and worship prescribes must not only be
strenuously resisted, but the seducer punished by the law of the land.
This is exemplified in three cases of enticement to idolatry.

a prophet--that is, some notable person laying claim to the character
and authority of the prophetic office ([Num
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006); [Sa1
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006)), performing feats of dexterity
or power in support of his pretensions, or even predicting events which
occurred as he foretold; as, for instance, an eclipse which a knowledge
of natural science might enable him to anticipate (or, as Caiaphas, [Joh
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#014)). Should the aim of such a one
be to seduce the people from the worship of the true God, he is an
impostor and must be put to death. No prodigy, however wonderful, no
human authority, however great, should be allowed to shake their belief
in the divine character and truth of a religion so solemnly taught and
so awfully attested (compare [Gal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008)). The modern Jews appeal to this
passage as justifying their rejection of Jesus Christ. But He possessed
all the characteristics of a true prophet, and He was so far from
alienating the people from God and His worship that the grand object of
His ministry was to lead to a purer, more spiritual and perfect
observance of the law.

[Deuteronomy 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 13:6</span></span>

WITHOUT REGARD TO NEARNESS OF RELATION. ([Deu
13:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006))

If thy brother . . . entice thee secretly--This term being applied very
loosely in all Eastern countries ([Gen
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#013)), other expressions are added to
intimate that no degree of kindred, however intimate, should be allowed
to screen an enticer to idolatry, to conceal his crime, or protect his
person. Piety and duty must overcome affection or compassion, and an
accusation must be lodged before a magistrate.

[Deuteronomy 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 13:9</span></span>

thou shalt surely kill him--not hastily, or in a private manner, but
after trial and conviction; and his relative, as informer, was to cast
the first stone (see on [Deu 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002);
[Act 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058)). It is manifest that what
was done in secret could not be legally proved by a single informer; and
hence Jewish writers say that spies were set in some private part of the
house, to hear the conversation and watch the conduct of a person
suspected of idolatrous tendencies.

[Deuteronomy 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 13:12</span></span>

Certain men, the children of Belial--lawless, designing demagogues ([Jdg
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#022); [Sa1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016); [Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025)), who abused their influence to
withdraw the inhabitants of the city to idol-worship.

[Deuteronomy 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 13:14</span></span>

Then shalt thou inquire--that is, the magistrate, to whom it officially
belonged to make the necessary investigation. In the event of the report
proving true, the most summary proceedings were to be commenced against
the apostate inhabitants. The law in this chapter has been represented
as stern and sanguinary, but it was in accordance with the national
constitution of Israel. God being their King, idolatry was treason, and
a city turned to idols put itself into a state, and incurred the
punishment, of rebellion.

[Deuteronomy 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 13:16</span></span>

it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again--Its ruins
shall be a permanent monument of the divine justice, and a beacon for
the warning and terror of posterity.

[Deuteronomy 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 13:17</span></span>

there shall cleave naught of the cursed thing to thine hand--No spoil
shall be taken from a city thus solemnly devoted to destruction. Every
living creature must be put to the sword--everything belonging to it
reduced to ashes--that nothing but its infamy may remain.
