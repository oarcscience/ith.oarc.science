<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 23:3</A></FONT></span></p>Restoration of Judah from Babylon foretold in language which in its fulness can only apply to the final restoration of both "Judah" and "Israel" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006">Jer 23:6</A>); also "out of all countries," in this verse and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008">Jer 23:8</A>; also, "neither shall they be lacking," that is, none shall be missing or detached from the rest: a prophecy never yet fully accomplished. It holds good also of the spiritual Israel, the elect of both Jews and Gentiles (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016">Mal 3:16-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028">Joh 10:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012">Joh 17:12</A>). As to the literal Israel also, see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037">Jer 32:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013">Isa 54:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021">Isa 60:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011">Eze 34:11-16</A>. 
<p>
<p>shepherds . . . shall feed them-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015">Jer 3:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023">Eze 34:23-31</A>). Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the Maccabees were but typical of the consummating fulfilment of these prophecies under Messiah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005">Jeremiah 23:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 23:5</A></FONT></span></p>As Messianic prophecy extended over many years in which many political changes took place in harmony with these, it displayed its riches by a variety more effective than if it had been manifested all at once. As the moral condition of the Jews required in each instance, so Messiah was exhibited in a corresponding phase, thus becoming more and more the soul of the nation's life: so that He is represented as the antitypical Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>unto David--HENGSTENBERG observes that Isaiah dwells more on His prophetical and priestly office, which had already been partly set forth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018">Deu 18:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004">Psa 110:4</A>). Other prophets dwell more on His kingly office. Therefore here He is associated with "David" the king: but in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A> with the then poor and unknown "Jesse." 
<p>
<p>righteous Branch--"the Branch of righteousness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015">Jer 33:15</A>); "The Branch" simply (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008">Zac 3:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012">Zac 6:12</A>); "The Branch of the Lord" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002">Isa 4:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>prosper--the very term applied to Messiah's undertaking (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013">Isa 52:13</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010">Isa 53:10</A>). Righteousness or justice is the characteristic of Messiah elsewhere, too, in connection with our salvation or justification (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009">Zac 9:9</A>). So in the New Testament He is not merely "righteous" Himself, but "righteousness to us" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030">Co1 1:30</A>), so that we become "the righteousness of God in Him" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003">Rom 10:3-4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">Co2 5:19-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009">Phi 3:9</A>). 
<p>
<p>execute judgment and justice in the earth-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002">Psa 72:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isa 32:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018">Isa 32:18</A>). Not merely a spiritual reign in the sense in which He is "our righteousness," but a righteous reign "in the earth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017">Jer 3:17-18</A>). In some passages He is said to come to judge, in others to reign. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034">Mat 25:34</A>, He is called "the King." <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007">Psa 9:7</A> unites them. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022">Dan 7:22</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026">Dan 7:26-27</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006">Jeremiah 23:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 23:6</A></FONT></span></p>Judah . . . Israel . . . dwell safely--Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016">Jer 33:16</A>, where "Jerusalem" is substituted for "Israel" here. Only Judah, and that only in part, has as yet returned. So far are the Jews from having enjoyed, as yet, the temporal blessings here foretold as the result of Messiah's reign, that their lot has been, for eighteen centuries, worse than ever before. The accomplishment must, therefore, be still future, when both Judah and Israel in their own land shall dwell safely under a Christocracy, far more privileged than even the old theocracy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037">Jer 32:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028">Deu 33:28</A>; Isa. 54:1-17; 60:1-22; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017">Isa 65:17-25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011">Zac 14:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>shall be called, the Lord--that is, shall be (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</A>) "Jehovah," God's incommunicable name. Though when applied to created things, it expresses only some peculiar connection they have with Jehovah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014">Gen 22:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015">Exo 17:15</A>), yet when applied to Messiah it must express His Godhead manifested in justifying power towards us (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">Ti1 3:16</A>). 
<p>
<p>our--marks His manhood, which is also implied in His being a Branch raised unto David, whence His human title, "Son of David" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042">Mat 22:42-45</A>). 
<p>
<p>Righteousness--marks His Godhead, for God alone can justify the ungodly (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005">Rom 4:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017">Isa 45:17</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024">Isa 45:24-25</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007">Jeremiah 23:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 23:7</A></FONT></span></p>Repeated from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014">Jer 16:14-15</A>. The prophet said the same things often, in order that his sayings might make the more impression. The same promise as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#003">Jer 23:3-4</A>. The wide dispersion of the Jews at the Babylonish captivity prefigures their present wider dispersion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006">Joe 3:6</A>). Their second deliverance is to exceed far the former one from Egypt. But the deliverance from Babylon was inferior to that from Egypt in respect to the miracles performed and the numbers delivered. The final deliverance under Messiah must, therefore, be meant, of which that from Babylon was the earnest.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009">Jeremiah 23:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 23:9</A></FONT></span></p>because of the prophets--so the Masorites and Targum. But Vulgate, Septuagint, &amp;c., make this the inscription of the prophecy, CONCERNING THE PROPHETS: as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001">Jer 48:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001">Jer 49:1</A>. Jeremiah expresses his horror at the so-called "prophets" not warning the people, though iniquity so fearfully abounded, soon to be followed by awful judgments. 
<p>
<p>bones shake-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#016">Hab 3:16</A>). 
<p>
<p>drunken--God's judgments are represented as stupefying like wine. The effects of the Holy Spirit also are compared to those of wine (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017">Act 2:17</A>). In both cases ecstasy was produced. This accounts for the denial of wine to those likely to be inspired, Nazarites, &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015">Luk 1:15</A>). It was necessary to put it out of men's power to ascribe inspired ecstasy to the effects of wine. 
<p>
<p>because of . . . words of . . . holiness--because of Jehovah's holy words, wherewith He threatened severe penalties, soon to be inflicted, against the breakers of His law.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010">Jeremiah 23:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 23:10</A></FONT></span></p>adulterers--spiritual, that is, forsakers of God, Israel's true Husband (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005">Isa 54:5</A>) for idols, at the instigation of the false "prophets" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009">Jer 23:9</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015">Jer 23:15</A>). Literal adultery and fornication, the usual concomitants of idolatry, are also meant. 
<p>
<p>swearing--MAURER, &amp;c., translate, "Because of the curse (of God on it), the land mourneth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015">Deu 27:15-26</A>; Deu. 28:15-68; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#006">Isa 24:6</A>). More than usual notoriety had been given to the curses of the law, by the finding and reading of it in Josiah's time (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011">Kg2 22:11</A>, &amp;c.). But <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002">Hos 4:2-3</A>, favors English Version (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004">Jer 12:4</A>). A drought was sent by God on the pastures ("pleasant places," oases) in the desert, on account of the "profaneness" of the priests, prophets, and people (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011">Jer 23:11</A>). 
<p>
<p>course . . . evil--They (both prophets and people) rush into wickedness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021">Jer 23:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007">Isa 59:7</A>).

Their not teaching the law in which God's counsel is set forth proves they are not His prophets, though they boast of being so (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015">Mat 7:15-20</A>).

Do the same as when wheat is mixed with chaff: do not reject the wheat because of the chaff mixed with it, but discriminate between the false and the true revelations. The test is adherence to, or forgetfulness of, Me and My law (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#027">Jer 23:27</A>).

The result will be the former (both the prophets and their fictions) will soon be seen to be chaff; the latter (the true prophets and the word of God in their mouth) wheat (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004">Psa 1:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003">Hos 13:3</A>).

"My word" which is "wheat" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028">Jer 23:28</A>), that is, food to the true prophet and his hearers, is a consuming "fire," and a crushing "hammer" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044">Mat 21:44</A>) to false prophets and their followers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016">Co2 2:16</A>). The Word of the false prophets may be known by its promising men peace in sin. "My word," on the contrary, burns and breaks the hard-hearted (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009">Jer 20:9</A>). The "hammer" symbolizes destructive power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023">Jer 50:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001">Nah 2:1</A>, Margin).

They scoffingly ask, Has he got any new burden (burdensome oracle: for all his prophecies are disasters) to announce (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001">Mal 1:1</A>)? Jeremiah indignantly repeats their own question, Do you ask, What burden? This, then, it is, "I will forsake you." My word is burdensome in your eyes, and you long to be rid if it. You shall get your wish. There will be no more prophecy: I will forsake you, and that will be a far worse "burden" to you.

Rather for "forget" translate, "I will altogether lift you up (like a 'burden,' alluding to their mocking term for God's messages) and cast you off."
