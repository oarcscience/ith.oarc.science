### [Deuteronomy Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 31:1</span></span>

MOSES ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE AND JOSHUA. ([Deu
31:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#001).md)

Moses went and spake--It is probable that this rehearsal of the law
extended over several successive days; and it might be the last and most
important day on which the return of Moses to the place of assembly is
specially noticed. In drawing his discourse towards a conclusion, he
adverted to his advanced age; and although neither his physical nor
intellectual powers had suffered any decay ([Deu
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007).md), yet he knew, by a special
revelation, that the time had arrived when he was about to be withdrawn
from the superintendence and government of Israel.

[Deuteronomy 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 31:2</span></span>

also the Lord hath said--should be "for the Lord hath said" thou shalt
not go over this Jordan. While taking a solemn leave of the people,
Moses exhorted them not to be intimidated by the menacing opposition of
enemies; to take encouragement from the continued presence of their
covenanted God; and to rest assured that the same divine power, which
had enabled them to discomfit their first assailants on the east of
Jordan, would aid them not less effectually in the adventurous
enterprise which they were about to undertake, and by which they would
obtain possession of "the land which He had sworn unto their fathers to
give them."

[Deuteronomy 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 31:9</span></span>

HE DELIVERS THE LAW TO THE PRIESTS, TO READ IT EVERY SEVENTH YEAR TO THE
PEOPLE. ([Deu 31:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009).md)

And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests--The law
thus committed to writing was either the whole book of Deuteronomy, or
the important part of it contained between the twenty-seventh and
thirtieth chapters. It was usual in cases of public or private contract
for two copies of the engagement to be made--one to be deposited in the
national archives or some secure place for reference, should occasion
require. The other was to remain in the hands of the contracting parties
([Jer 32:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012).md). The same course was
followed on this renewal of the covenant between God and Israel. Two
written copies of the law were prepared, the one of which was delivered
to the public representatives of Israel; namely, the priests and the
elders.

the priests, . . . who bare the ark of the covenant--In all ordinary
journeys, it was the common duty of the Levites to carry the ark and its
furniture ([Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015).md); but, on solemn
or extraordinary occasions, that office was discharged by the priests
([Jos 3:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003.md); [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md); [Ch1
15:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011).md).

all the elders of Israel--They were assistants to the priests and
overseers to take care of the preservation, rehearsal, and observance of
the law.

[Deuteronomy 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 31:10</span></span>

At the end of every seven years, . . . thou shalt read this law--At the
return of the sabbatic year and during the feast of tabernacles, the law
was to be publicly read. This order of Moses was a future and
prospective arrangement; for the observance of the sabbatic year did not
commence till the conquest and peaceful occupation of Canaan. The
ordinance served several important purposes. For, while the people had
opportunities of being instructed in the law every Sabbath and daily in
their own homes, this public periodical rehearsal at meetings in the
courts of the sanctuary, where women and children of twelve years were
present (as they usually were at the great festivals), was calculated to
produce good and pious impressions of divine truth amid the sacred
associations of the time and place. Besides, it formed a public
guarantee for the preservation, integrity, and faithful transmission of
the Sacred Book to successive ages.

[Deuteronomy 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 31:14</span></span>

the Lord said unto Moses, . . .call Joshua, and present yourselves in
the tabernacle of the congregation--Joshua had been publicly designated
to the office of commander by Moses \[[Num
27:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#022.md)\]; and God was pleased to
confirm his appointment by the visible symbols of His presence and
approval. As none but the priests were privileged to enter the
sanctuary, it is probable that this significant manifestation of the
cloudy pillar was made while the leaders stood at the door of the
tabernacle.

[Deuteronomy 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 31:16</span></span>

the Lord said unto Moses, . . . this people will rise up--In this
remarkable interview, Moses was distinctly apprised of the infidelity of
Israel, their corruptions of the true religion through intercourse with
the idolatrous inhabitants of Canaan ([Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026).md), and their chastisements in
consequence of those national defections.

[Deuteronomy 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">deu 31:17</span></span>

Then my anger shall be kindled, . . . and I will hide my face from
them--an announcement of the withdrawal of the divine favor and
protection of which the Shekinah was the symbol and pledge. It never
appeared in the second temple; and its non-appearance was a prelude of
"all the evils that came upon them, because their God was not among
them."

[Deuteronomy 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 31:19</span></span>

Now therefore write ye this song--National songs take deep hold of the
memories and have a powerful influence in stirring the deepest feelings
of a people. In accordance with this principle in human nature, a song
was ordered to be composed by Moses, doubtless under divine inspiration,
which was to be learnt by the Israelites themselves and to be taught to
their children in every age, embodying the substance of the preceding
addresses, and of a strain well suited to inspire the popular mind with
a strong sense of God's favor to their nation.

[Deuteronomy 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">deu 31:26</span></span>

Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark--The second
copy of the law (see on [Deu 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#009).md) was
deposited for greater security and reverence in a little chest beside
the ark of the covenant, for there was nothing contained within it but
the tables of stone ([Kg1 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009).md). Others
think it was put within the ark, it being certain, from the testimony of
Paul ([Heb 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md), that there were once
other things inside the ark, and that this was the copy found in the
time of Josiah ([Kg2 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008).md).
