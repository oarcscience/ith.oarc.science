### [Zechariah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 3:1</span></span>

FOURTH VISION. Joshua the high priest before the angel of Jehovah;
accused by Satan, but justified by Jehovah through Messiah the coming
Branch. ([Zac 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001).md)

Joshua as high priest ([Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001).md)
represents "Jerusalem" ([Zac 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002).md), or
the elect people, put on its trial, and "plucked" narrowly "out of the
fire." His attitude, "standing before the Lord," is that of a high
priest ministering before the altar erected previously to the building
of the temple ([Ezr 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#002.md), [Ezr
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#006.md); [Psa
135:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#002).md). Yet, in this position, by
reason of his own and his people's sins, he is represented as on his and
their trial ([Num 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#012).md).

he showed me--"He" is the interpreting angel. Jerusalem's (Joshua's)
"filthy garments" ([Zac 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003).md) are its
sins which had hitherto brought down God's judgments. The "change of
raiment" implies its restoration to God's favor. Satan suggested to the
Jews that so consciously polluted a priesthood and people could offer no
acceptable sacrifice to God, and therefore they might as well desist
from the building of the temple. Zechariah encourages them by showing
that their demerit does not disqualify them for the work, as they are
accepted in the righteousness of another, their great High Priest, the
Branch ([Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008).md), a scion of their
own royal line of David ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md).
The full accomplishment of Israel's justification and of Satan the
accuser's being "rebuked" finally, is yet future ([Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010).md). Compare [Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008.md), wherein "Jerusalem," as here, is
shown to be meant primarily, though including the whole Church in
general (compare [Job 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009).md).

Satan--the Hebrew term meaning "adversary" in a law court: as devil is
the Greek term, meaning accuser. Messiah, on the other hand, is
"advocate" for His people in the court of heaven's justice ([Jo1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).md).

standing at his right hand--the usual position of a prosecutor or
accuser in court, as the left hand was the position of the defendant
([Psa 109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006).md). The "angel of the Lord"
took the same position just before another high priest was about to
beget the forerunner of Messiah ([Luk
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011).md), who supplants Satan from his
place as accuser. Some hence explain [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md) as referring to this passage: "the
body of Moses" being thus the Jewish Church, for which Satan contended
as his by reason of its sins; just as the "body of Christ" is the
Christian Church. However, [Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md)
plainly speaks of the literal body of Moses, the resurrection of which
at the transfiguration Satan seems to have opposed on the ground of
Moses' error at Meribah; the same divine rebuke, "the Lord rebuke thee,"
checked Satan in contending for judgment against Moses' body, as checked
him when demanding judgment against the Jewish Church, to which Moses'
body corresponds.

[Zechariah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 3:2</span></span>

the Lord--JEHOVAH, hereby identified with the "angel of the Lord
(Jehovah)" ([Zac 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001).md).

rebuke thee--twice repeated to express the certainty of Satan's
accusations and machinations against Jerusalem being frustrated. Instead
of lengthened argument, Jehovah silences Satan by the one plea, namely,
God's choice.

chosen Jerusalem-- ([Rom 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md); [Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005).md). The conclusive answer. If the
issue rested on Jerusalem's merit or demerit, condemnation must be the
award; but Jehovah's "choice" ([Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016).md) rebuts Satan's charge against
Jerusalem ([Zac 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017.md); [Zac
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md); [Rom
8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md), [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037).md), represented by Joshua (compare
in the great atonement, [Lev 16:6-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#006.md),
&c.), not that she may continue in sin, but be freed from it ([Zac
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007).md).

brand plucked out of . . . fire-- ([Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011.md); [Pe1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md); [Jde
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#023).md). Herein God implies that His
acquittal of Jerusalem is not that He does not recognize her sin ([Zac
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003.md), [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009).md), but that having punished her
people for it with a seventy years' captivity, He on the ground of His
electing love has delivered her from the fiery ordeal; and when once He
has begun a deliverance, as in this case, He will perfect it ([Psa
89:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#030.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

[Zechariah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 3:3</span></span>

filthy garments--symbol of sin ([Pro
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#012.md); [Isa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004.md); [Isa
64:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#006).md); proving that it is not on the
ground of His people's righteousness that He accepts them. Here
primarily the "filthy garments" represent the abject state temporally of
the priesthood and people at the return from Babylon. Yet he "stood
before the angel." Abject as he was, he was before Jehovah's eye, who
graciously accepts His people's services, though mixed with sin and
infirmity.

[Zechariah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 3:4</span></span>

those that stood before him--the ministering angels (compare the phrase
in [Kg1 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#008.md); [Dan
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005).md).

Take away the filthy garments--In [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md) it is "remove the iniquity of that
land"; therefore Joshua represents the land.

from him--literally, "from upon him"; pressing upon him as an
overwhelming burden.

change of raiment--festal robes of the high priest, most costly and
gorgeous; symbol of Messiah's imputed righteousness ([Mat
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011).md). The restoration of the glory
of the priesthood is implied: first, partially, at the completion of the
second temple; fully realized in the great High Priest Jesus, whose name
is identical with Joshua ([Heb 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008).md),
the Representative of Israel, the "kingdom of priests" ([Exo
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006).md); once clad in the filthy
garments of our vileness, but being the chosen of the Father ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001).md), He hath by death ceased from
sin, and in garments of glory entered the heavenly holy place as our
High Priest ([Heb 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md). Then, as the consequence ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md), realized in the Church generally
([Luk 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022.md); [Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008).md), and in Israel in particular
([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); compare [Isa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md); [Isa
66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021).md).

[Zechariah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 3:5</span></span>

And I said--Here the prophet, rejoicing at the change of raiment so far
made, interposes to ask for the crowning assurance that the priesthood
would be fully restored, namely, the putting the miter or priestly
turban on Joshua: its fair color symbolizing the official purity of the
order restored. He does not command, but prays; not "Set," but "Let them
set." Vulgate and Syriac version read it, "He then said," which is the
easier reading; but the very difficulty of the present Hebrew reading
makes it less likely to come from a modern corrector of the text.

angel of . . . Lord stood by--the Divine Angel had been sitting (the
posture of a judge, [Dan 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009).md); now He
"stands" to see that Zechariah's prayer be executed, and then to give
the charge ([Zac 3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#006).md).

[Zechariah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 3:6</span></span>

protested--proceeded solemnly to declare. A forensic term for an
affirmation on oath ([Heb 6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017).md).
God thus solemnly states the end for which the priesthood is restored to
the people, His own glory in their obedience and pure worship, and their
consequent promotion to heavenly honor.

[Zechariah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 3:7</span></span>

God's choice of Jerusalem ([Zac 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002).md)
was unto its sanctification ([Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md); hence the charge here which
connects the promised blessing with obedience.

my charge--the ordinances, ritual and moral ([Num
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#028.md), [Num
3:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md), [Num
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#038.md); [Jos
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#007.md); [Kg1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003.md); [Eze
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#016).md).

judge my house--Thou shalt long preside over the temple ceremonial as
high priest ([Lev 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010.md); [Eze
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#023.md); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md) \[GROTIUS\]. Or, rule over My
house, that is, My people \[MAURER\] ([Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md); [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md). We know from [Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md) that the priest judged cases. He
was not only to obey the Mosaic institute himself, but to see that it
was obeyed by others. God's people are similarly to exercise judgment
hereafter, as the reward of their present faithfulness ([Dan
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md), [Dan
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#022.md); [Luk
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017.md); [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002).md); by virtue of their royal
priesthood ([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md).

keep my courts--guard My house from profanation.

places to walk--free ingress and egress ([Sa1
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#016.md); [Kg1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007.md); [Kg1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#017).md), so that thou mayest go through
these ministering angels who stand by Jehovah ([Zac
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#014.md); [Zac
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#005.md); [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019).md) into His presence, discharging
thy priestly function. In [Eze 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md)
the same Hebrew word is used of a walk before the priests' chambers in
the future temple. Zechariah probably refers here to such a walk or way;
Thou shalt not merely walk among priests like thyself, as in the old
temple walks, but among the very angels as thine associates.
HENGSTENBERG translates, "I will give thee guides (from) among these,"
&c. But there is no "from" in the Hebrew; English Version is therefore
better. Priests are called angels or "messengers" ([Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md); they are therefore thought
worthy to be associated with heavenly angels. So these latter are
present at the assemblies of true Christian worshippers ([Co1
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md); compare [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009).md).

[Zechariah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 3:8</span></span>

Hear--On account of the magnitude of what He is about to say, He at once
demands solemn attention.

thy fellows that sit before thee--thy subordinate colleagues in the
priesthood; not that they were actually then sitting before him; but
their usual posture in consultations was on chairs or benches before
him, while he sat on an elevated seat as their president.

they are--From speaking to Joshua He passes to speaking of him and them,
in the third person, to the attendant angels (compare [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009).md).

men wondered at--Hebrew, "men of wonder," that is, having a typical
character ([Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Isa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md); [Eze
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#011.md); [Eze
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#024).md). Joshua the high priest
typifies Messiah, as Joshua's "fellows" typify believers whom Messiah
admits to share His Priesthood ([Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010).md). This, its typical character,
then, is a pledge to assure the desponding Jews that the priesthood
shall be preserved till the great Antitype comes. There may be also an
indirect reproof of the unbelief of the multitude who "wonder" at God's
servants and even at God's Son incredulously ([Psa
71:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#007.md); [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001), &c..md).

behold--marking the greatness of what follows.

my servant--the characteristic title of Messiah ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md); [Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md); [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md).

the Branch--Messiah, a tender branch from the almost extinct royal line
of David ([Zac 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md); [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015).md). [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md), where for "day spring," "branch"
may be substituted ([Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md), however,
favors English Version). The reference cannot be to Zerubbabel (as
GROTIUS thinks), for he was then in the full discharge of his office,
whereas "the Branch" here is regarded as future.

[Zechariah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 3:9</span></span>

For--expressing the ground for encouragement to the Jews in building the
temple: I (Jehovah) have laid the (foundation) stone as the chief
architect, before (in the presence of) Joshua, by "the hand of
Zerubbabel" ([Zac 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md); [Ezr
3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#008).md), so that your labor in
building shall not be vain. Antitypically, the (foundation) stone
alluded to is Christ, before called "the Branch." Lest any should think
from that term that His kingdom is weak, He now calls it "the stone,"
because of its solidity and strength whereby it is to be the foundation
of the Church, and shall crush all the world kingdoms ([Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md); compare [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045.md); [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md); [Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md); [Pe1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md). The angel pointing to the
chief stone lying before Him, intimates that a deeper mystery than the
material temple is symbolized. MOORE thinks the "stone" is the Jewish
Church, which Jehovah engages watchfully to guard. The temple, rather,
is that symbolically. But the antitype of the foundation-stone is
Messiah.

upon one stone shall be seven eyes--namely, the watchful "eyes" of
Jehovah's care ever fixed "upon" it ([Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md) \[MAURER\]. The eye is the
symbol of Providence: "seven," of perfection ([Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md); compare [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009.md); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008).md). Antitypically, "the seven eyes
upon the stone" are the eyes of all angels ([Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md), and of all saints ([Joh
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#014.md); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032).md), and of the patriarchs and
prophets ([Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md); [Pe1
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010).md), fixed on Christ; above all,
the eyes of the Father ever rest with delight on Him. CALVIN (perhaps
better) considers the seven eyes to be carved on the stone, that is, not
the eyes of the Father and of angels and saints ever fixed on Him, but
His own sevenfold (perfect) fullness of grace, and of gifts of the
Spirit ([Isa 11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md); [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034.md); [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md), and His watchful providence now
for the Jews m building the temple, and always for His Church, His
spiritual temple. Thus the "stone" is not as other stones senseless, but
living and full of eyes of perfect intelligence ([Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004), "a living stone".md), who not only
attracts the eyes ([Joh 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032).md) of His
people, but emits illumination so as to direct them to Him.

engrave . . . graying--implying Messiah's exceeding beauty and
preciousness; alluding to the polished stones of the temple: Christ
excelled them, as much as God who "prepared His body" ([Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md); compare [Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021).md) is superior to all human
builders.

remove . . . iniquity of that land in one day--that is, the iniquity and
its consequences, namely the punishment to which the Jews heretofore had
been subjected ([Hag 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006.md), [Hag
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009).md). The remission of sin is the
fountain of every other blessing. The "one day" of its removal is
primarily the day of national atonement celebrated after the completion
of the temple ([Lev 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027).md) on the
tenth day of the seventh month. Antitypically, the atonement by Messiah
for all men, once for all ("one day") offered, needing no repetition
like the Mosaic sacrifices ([Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md), [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).md).

[Zechariah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 3:10</span></span>

under . . . vine . . . fig tree--emblem of tranquil prosperity ([Kg1
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025).md). Type of spiritual peace with
God through Christ ([Rom 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001).md); and of
millennial blessedness ([Mic 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004).md).
