### [Zechariah Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 14:1</span></span>

LAST STRUGGLE WITH THE HOSTILE WORLD POWERS: MESSIAH-JEHOVAH SAVES
JERUSALEM AND DESTROYS THE FOE, OF WHOM THE REMNANT TURNS TO THE LORD
REIGNING AT JERUSALEM. (Zec. 14:1-21)

day of the Lord--in which He shall vindicate His justice by punishing
the wicked and then saving His elect people ([Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md); [Joe
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), [Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005).md).

thy spoil . . . divided in the midst of thee--by the foe; secure of
victory, they shall not divide the spoil taken from thee in their camp
outside, but "in the midst" of the city itself.

[Zechariah 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 14:2</span></span>

gather all nations, &c.--The prophecy seems literal (compare [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002).md). If Antichrist be the leader of
the nations, it seems inconsistent with the statement that he will at
this time be sitting in the temple as God at Jerusalem ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md); thus Antichrist outside would be
made to besiege Antichrist within the city. But difficulties do not set
aside revelations: the event will clear up seeming difficulties. Compare
the complicated movements, Dan. 11:1-45.

half . . . the residue--In [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md), it is "two-thirds" that
perish, and "the third" escapes. There, however, it is "in all the
land"; here it is "half of the city." Two-thirds of the "whole people"
perish, one-third survives. One-half of the citizens are led captive,
the residue are not cut off. Perhaps, too, we ought to translate, "a
(not 'the') residue."

[Zechariah 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 14:3</span></span>

Then--In Jerusalem's extremity.

as . . . in . . . day of battle--as when Jehovah fought for Israel
against the Egyptians at the Red Sea ([Exo
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#014.md); [Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003).md). As He then made a way through
the divided sea, so will He now divide in two "the Mount of Olives"
([Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md).

[Zechariah 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 14:4</span></span>

The object of the cleaving of the mount in two by a fissure or valley (a
prolongation of the valley of Jehoshaphat, and extending from Jerusalem
on the west towards Jordan, eastward) is to open a way of escape to the
besieged (compare [Joe 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012.md), [Joe
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014).md). Half the divided mount is
thereby forced northward, half southward; the valley running between.
The place of His departure at His ascension shall be the place of His
return: and the "manner" of His return also shall be similar ([Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011).md). He shall probably "come from
the east" ([Mat 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027).md). He so made His
triumphal entry into the city from the Mount of Olives from the east
([Mat 21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001).md). This was the scene of
His agony: so it shall be the scene of His glory. Compare [Eze
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023.md), with [Eze
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md), "from the way of the east.

[Zechariah 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 14:5</span></span>

ye shall flee to the valley--rather "through the valley," as in [Sa2
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029.md). The valley made by the cleaving
asunder of the Mount of Olives ([Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md) is designed to be their way of
escape, not their place of refuge \[MAURER\]. JEROME is on the side of
English Version. If it be translated so, it will mean, Ye shall flee
"to" the valley, not to hide there, but as the passage through which an
escape may be effected. The same divinely sent earthquake which swallows
up the foe, opens out a way of escape to God's people. The earthquake in
Uzziah's days is mentioned ([Amo 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001).md)
as a recognized epoch in Jewish history. Compare also [Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md) : perhaps the same year that
Jehovah held His heavenly court and gave commission to Isaiah for the
Jews, an earthquake in the physical world, as often happens ([Mat
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007).md), marked momentous movements in
the unseen spiritual world.

of the mountains--rather, "of My mountains," namely, Zion and Moriah,
peculiarly sacred to Jehovah \[MOORE\]. Or, the mountains formed by My
cleaving Olivet into two \[MAURER\].

Azal--the name of a place near a gate east of the city. The Hebrew means
"adjoining" \[HENDERSON\]. Others give the meaning, "departed,"
"ceased." The valley reaches up to the city gates, so as to enable the
fleeing citizens to betake themselves immediately to it on leaving the
city.

Lord my God . . . with thee--The mention of the "Lord my God" leads the
prophet to pass suddenly to a direct address to Jehovah. It is as if
"lifting up his head" ([Luk 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md), he
suddenly sees in vision the Lord coming, and joyfully exclaims, "All the
saints with Thee!" So [Isa 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md).

saints--holy angels escorting the returning King ([Mat
24:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md); [Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md); and redeemed men ([Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md); [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md); [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md). Compare the similar mention of
the "saints" and "angels" at His coming on Sinai ([Deu
32:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002.md); [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md); [Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002).md). PHILLIPS thinks Azal is Ascalon
on the Mediterranean. An earthquake beneath Messiah's tread will divide
Syria, making from Jerusalem to Azal a valley which will admit the ocean
waters from the west to the Dead Sea. The waters will rush down the
valley of Arabah, the old bed of the Jordan, clear away the sand-drift
of four thousand years, and cause the commerce of Petra and Tyre to
center in the holy city. The Dead Sea rising above its shores will
overflow by the valley of Edom, completing the straits of Azal into the
Red Sea. Thus will be formed the great pool of Jerusalem (compare [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md); [Eze
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md), &c.; [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018).md). Euphrates will be the north
boundary, and the Red Sea the south. Twenty-five miles north and
twenty-five miles south of Jerusalem will form one side of the fifty
miles square of the Lord's Holy Oblation (Eze. 48:1-35). There are seven
spaces of fifty miles each from Jerusalem northward to the Euphrates,
and five spaces of fifty miles each southward to the Red Sea. Thus there
are thirteen equal distances on the breadth of the future promised land,
one for the oblation and twelve for the tribes, according to Eze.
48:1-35. That the Euphrates north, Mediterranean west, the Nile and Red
Sea south, are to be the future boundaries of the holy land, which will
include Syria and Arabia, is favored by [Gen
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#008.md); [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031.md); [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024.md); [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004.md); [Kg1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md); [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026.md); [Isa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012.md); all which was partially
realized in Solomon's reign, shall be antitypically so hereafter. The
theory, if true, will clear away many difficulties in the way of the
literal interpretation of this chapter and Eze. 48:1-35.

[Zechariah 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 14:6</span></span>

light . . . not . . . clear . . . dark--JEROME, Chaldee, Syriac, and
Septuagint translate, "There shall not be light, but cold and ice"; that
is, a day full of horror ([Amo 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018).md).
But the Hebrew for "clear" does not mean "cold," but "precious,"
"splendid" (compare [Job 31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md).
CALVIN translates, "The light shall not be clear, but dark" (literally,
"condensation," that is, thick mist); like a dark day in which you can
hardly distinguish between day and night. English Version accords with
[Zac 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md) : "There shall not be
altogether light nor altogether darkness," but an intermediate condition
in which sorrows shall be mingled with joys.

[Zechariah 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 14:7</span></span>

one day--a day altogether unique, different from all others \[MAURER\].
Compare "one," that is, unique ([Sol
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009.md); [Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007).md). Not as HENDERSON explains, "One
continuous day, without night" ([Rev
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005.md); [Rev
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025).md); the millennial period ([Rev
20:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003).md).

known to . . . Lord--This truth restrains man's curiosity and teaches us
to wait the Lord's own time ([Mat
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036).md).

not day, nor night--answering to "not . . . clear nor . . . dark" ([Zac
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006).md); not altogether daylight, yet
not the darkness of night.

at evening . . . shall be light--Towards the close of this twilight-like
time of calamity, "light" shall spring up ([Psa
97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011.md); [Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004.md); [Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026.md); [Isa
60:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019).md).

[Zechariah 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 14:8</span></span>

living waters-- ([Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md); [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018).md).

former sea--that is, the front, or east, which Orientalists face in
taking the points of the compass; the Dead Sea.

hinder sea--the west or Mediterranean.

summer . . . winter--neither dried up by heat, nor frozen by cold; ever
flowing.

[Zechariah 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 14:9</span></span>

king over all . . . earth-- [Isa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md)
implies that this is to be the consequence of Israel being again
recognized by God as His own people ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md).

one Lord . . . name one--Not that He is not so already, but He shall
then be recognized by all unanimously as "One." Now there are "gods many
and lords many." Then Jehovah alone shall be worshipped. The
manifestation of the unity of the Godhead shall be simultaneous with
that of the unity of the Church. Believers are one in spirit already,
even as God is one ([Eph 4:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003).md). But
externally there are sad divisions. Not until these disappear, shall God
reveal fully His unity to the world ([Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md), [Joh
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023).md). Then shall there be "a pure
language, that all may call upon the name of the Lord with one consent"
([Zep 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009).md). The Son too shall at last
give up His mediatorial kingdom to the Father, when the purposes for
which it was established shall have been accomplished, "that God may be
all in all" ([Co1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md).

[Zechariah 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 14:10</span></span>

turned--or, "changed round about": literally, "to make a circuit." The
whole hilly land round Jerusalem, which would prevent the free passage
of the living waters, shall be changed so as to be "as a (or the) plain"
([Isa 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004).md).

from Geba to Rimmon--Geba ([Kg2 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#008).md)
in Benjamin, the north border of Judah. Rimmon, in Simeon ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md), the south border of Judah; not
the Rimmon northeast of Michmash. "The plain from Geba to Rimmon" (that
is, from one boundary to the other) is the Arabah or plain of the
Jordan, extending from the Sea of Tiberias to the Elanitic Gulf of the
Red Sea.

it shall be lifted up--namely, Jerusalem shall be exalted, the hills all
round being lowered ([Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md).

inhabited in her place-- ([Zac 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006).md).

from Benjamin's gate--leading to the territory of Benjamin. The same as
Ephraim's gate, the north boundary of the city ([Kg2
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013).md).

the first gate--west of the city \[GROTIUS\]. "The place of," &c.
implies that the gate itself was then not in existence. "The old gate"
([Neh 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#006).md).

the corner gate--east of the city \[GROTIUS\]. Or the "corner" joining
the north and west parts of the wall \[VILLALPANDUS\]. GROTIUS thinks
"corners" refers to the towers there built (compare [Zep
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006), Margin.md).

tower of Hananeel--south of the city, near the sheep gate ([Neh
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md); [Neh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039.md); [Jer
31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038).md) \[GROTIUS\].

king's wine-presses-- ([Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011).md). In
the interior of the city, at Zion \[GROTIUS\].

[Zechariah 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 14:11</span></span>

no more utter destruction-- ([Jer
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#040).md). Literally, "no more curse"
([Rev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md); compare [Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006).md), for there will be no more sin.
Temporal blessings and spiritual prosperity shall go together in the
millennium: long life ([Isa 65:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020).md),
peace ([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004).md), honor ([Isa
60:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#014).md), righteous government ([Isa
54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014.md); [Isa
60:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#018).md). Judgment, as usual, begins at
the house of God, but then falls fatally on Antichrist, whereon the
Church obtains perfect liberty. The last day will end everything evil
([Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021).md) \[AUBERLEN\].

[Zechariah 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 14:12</span></span>

Punishment on the foe, the last Antichristian confederacy ([Isa
59:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#018.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md); Eze. 38:1-39:29; [Rev
19:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017).md). A living death: the
corruption ([Gal 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008).md) of death
combined in ghastly union with the conscious sensibility of life. Sin
will be felt by the sinner in all its loathsomeness, inseparably
clinging to him as a festering, putrid body.

[Zechariah 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 14:13</span></span>

tumult--consternation ([Zac 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004.md); [Sa1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#015.md), [Sa1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020).md).

lay hold . . . on . . . hand of . . . neighbour--instinctively grasping
it, as if thereby to be safer, but in vain \[MENOCHIUS\]. Rather, in
order to assail "his neighbor" \[CALVIN\], ([Eze
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#021).md). Sin is the cause of all
quarrels on earth. It will cause endless quarrels in hell ([Jam
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).md).

[Zechariah 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 14:14</span></span>

Judah . . . fight at Jerusalem--namely, against the foe: not against
Jerusalem, as MAURER translates in variance with the context. As to the
spoil gained from the foe, compare [Eze
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#010.md), [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md).

[Zechariah 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 14:15</span></span>

The plague shall affect the very beasts belonging to the foe. A typical
foretaste of all this befell Antiochus Epiphanes and his host at
Jerusalem (I Maccabees 13:49; II Maccabees 9:5).

[Zechariah 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 14:16</span></span>

every one . . . left-- ([Isa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md),
[Isa 66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023).md). God will conquer all the
foes of the Church, Some He will destroy; others He will bring into
willing subjection.

from year to year--literally, "from the sufficiency of a year in a
year."

feast of tabernacles--The other two great yearly feasts, passover and
pentecost, are not specified, because, their antitypes having come, the
types are done away with. But the feast of tabernacles will be
commemorative of the Jews' sojourn, not merely forty years in the
wilderness, but for almost two thousand years of their dispersion. So it
was kept on their return from the Babylonian dispersion ([Neh
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014).md). It was the feast on which
Jesus made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem ([Mat
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#008).md); a pledge of His return to His
capital to reign (compare [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md),
[Lev 23:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039.md), [Lev
23:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042.md); [Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md). A feast of peculiar joy ([Psa
118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md); [Hos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009).md). The feast on which Jesus gave
the invitation to the living waters of salvation ("Hosanna," save us
now, was the cry, [Mat 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); compare
[Psa 118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025).md) ([Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md), [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). To the Gentiles, too, it will
be significant of perfected salvation after past wanderings in a moral
wilderness, as it originally commemorated the ingathering of the
harvest. The seedtime of tears shall then have issued in the harvest of
joy \[MOORE\]. "All the nations" could not possibly in person go up to
the feast, but they may do so by representatives.

[Zechariah 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 14:17</span></span>

no rain--including every calamity which usually follows in the East from
want of rain, namely, scarcity of provisions, famine, pestilence, &c.
Rain is the symbol also of God's favor ([Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003).md). That there shall be unconverted
men under the millennium appears from the outbreak of God and Magog at
the end of it ([Rev 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007).md); but they,
like Satan their master, shall be restrained during the thousand years.
Note, too, from this verse that the Gentiles shall come up to Jerusalem,
rather than the Jews go as missionaries to the Gentiles ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md). However, [Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md) may imply the converse.

[Zechariah 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 14:18</span></span>

if . . . Egypt go not up--specified as Israel's ancient foe. If Egypt go
not up, and so there be no rain on them (a judgment which Egypt would
condemn, as depending on the Nile's overflow, not on rain), there shall
be the plague . . . . Because the guilty are not affected by one
judgment, let them not think to escape, for God has other judgments
which shall plague them. MAURER translates, "If Egypt go not up, upon
them also there shall be none" (no rain). [Psa
105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032.md) mentions "rain" in Egypt. But
it is not their main source of fertility.

punishment--literally, "sin"; that is, "punishment for sin."

[Zechariah 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md)

shall there be upon the bells--namely, this inscription, "Holiness to
the Lord," the same as was on the miter of the high priest ([Exo
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#036).md). This implies that all things,
even the most common, shall be sacred to Jehovah, and not merely the
things which under the law had peculiar sanctity attached to them. The
"bells" were metal plates hanging from the necks of horses and camels as
ornaments, which tinkled (as the Hebrew root means) by striking against
each other. Bells attached to horses are found represented on the walls
of Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik.

pots . . . like . . . bowls--the vessels used for boiling, for receiving
ashes, &c., shall be as holy as the bowls used for catching the blood of
the sacrificial victims (see on [Zac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md); [Sa1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md). The priesthood of Christ will
be explained more fully both by the Mosaic types and by the New
Testament in that temple of which Ezekiel speaks. Then the Song of
Solomon, now obscure, will be understood, for the marriage feast of the
Lamb will be celebrated in heaven (Rev. 19:1-21), and on earth it will
be a Solomonic period, peaceful, glorious, and nuptial. There will be no
king but a prince; the sabbatic period of the judges will return, but
not with the Old Testament, but New Testament glory ([Isa
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026); Eze. 45:1-25.md) \[ROOS\].

[Zechariah 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 14:21</span></span>

every pot--even in private houses, as in the temple, shall be deemed
holy, so universal shall be the consecration of all things and persons
to Jehovah.

take of them--as readily as they would take of the pots of the temple
itself, whatever number they wanted for sacrifice.

no . . . Canaanite--no unclean or ungodly person ([Isa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md); [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017).md). Compare as to the final state
subsequent to the millennium, [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md). MAURER not so well translates
"merchant" here, as in [Pro 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#024.md). If
a man would have the beginnings of heaven, it must be by absolute
consecration of everything to God on earth. Let his life be a liturgy, a
holy service of acted worship \[MOORE\].
