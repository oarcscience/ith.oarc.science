### [Psalms Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 65:1</span></span>

This is a song of praise for God's spiritual blessings to His people and
His kind providence over all the earth. ([Psa
65:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001).md)

Praise waiteth for thee--literally, "To Thee silence praise," or
(compare [Psa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001).md), To Thee silence
is praise--that is, Praise is waiting as a servant; it is due to Thee.
So the last clause expresses the duty of paying vows. These two parts of
acceptable worship, mentioned in [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md), are rendered in Zion, where God
chiefly displays His mercy and receives homage.

[Psalms 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 65:2</span></span>

All are encouraged to pray by God's readiness to hear.

[Psalms 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 65:3</span></span>

God's mercy alone delivers us from the burden of iniquities, by purging
or expiating by an atonement the transgressions with which we are
charged, and which are denoted by--

Iniquities--or, literally, "Words of iniquities."

[Psalms 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 65:4</span></span>

dwell in thy courts; . . . \[and\] satisfied with the goodness . . .
temple--denote communion with God ([Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md); [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md); compare [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md). This is a blessing for all God's
people, as denoted by the change of number.

[Psalms 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 65:5</span></span>

terrible things--that is, by the manifestation of justice and wrath to
enemies, accompanying that of mercy to His people ([Psa
63:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009.md); [Psa
64:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007).md).

the confidence--object of it.

of all . . . earth--the whole world; that is, deservedly such, whether
men think so or not.

[Psalms 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 65:6</span></span>

God's great power and goodness are the grounds of this confidence. These
are illustrated in His control of the mightiest agencies of nature and
nations affecting men with awe and dread ([Psa
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#007.md); [Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001), &c..md), and in His fertilizing
showers, causing the earth to produce abundantly for man and beast.

[Psalms 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 65:8</span></span>

outgoings of . . . rejoice--all people from east to west.

[Psalms 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 65:9</span></span>

visitest--in mercy (compare [Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004).md).

river of God--His exhaustless resources.

[Psalms 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 65:11</span></span>

thy paths--ways of providence ([Psa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md), [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 65:12</span></span>

wilderness--places, though not inhabited by men, fit for pasture ([Lev
16:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md); [Job
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#005).md).

pastures--is literally, "folds," or "enclosures for flocks"; and in [Psa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#013.md) it may be "lambs," the same word
used and so translated in [Psa 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md);
so that "the flocks are clothed with lambs" (a figure for abundant
increase) would be the form of expression.
