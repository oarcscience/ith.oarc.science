Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [2 Timothy Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

[2 Timothy 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 3:1</span></span>

COMING EVIL DAYS: SIGNS OF EVIL ALREADY: CONTRAST IN THE DOCTRINE AND
LIFE OF PAUL, WHICH TIMOTHY SHOULD FOLLOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS EARLY
TRAINING IN SCRIPTURE. (2Ti. 3:1-17)

also--Greek, "but."

last days--preceding Christ's second coming ([Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018)). "The latter times," [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001), refer to a period not so remote
as "the last days," namely, the long days of papal and Greek
anti-Christianity.

perilous--literally, "difficult times," in which it is difficult to know
what is to be done: "grievous times."

shall come--Greek, "shall be imminent"; "shall come unexpectedly"
\[BENGEL\].

[2 Timothy 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 3:2</span></span>

men--in the professing Church. Compare the catalogue, [Rom
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029), &c., where much the same sins
are attributed to heathen men; it shall be a relapse into virtual
heathendom, with all its beast-like propensities, whence the symbol of
it is "a beast" ([Rev 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001), [Rev
13:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011), &c.; [Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003), [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008), [Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)).

covetous--Translate, "money-loving," a distinct Greek word from that for
"covetous" (see on [Col 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)). The
cognate Greek substantive ([Ti1 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010))
is so translated, "the love of money is a (Greek, not 'the') root of all
evil."

boasters--empty boasters \[ALFORD\]; boasting of having what they have
not.

proud--overweening: literally, showing themselves above their fellows.

blasphemous--rather, "evil-speakers," revilers.

disobedient to parents--The character of the times is even to be
gathered especially from the manners of the young \[BENGEL\].

unthankful--The obligation to gratitude is next to that of obedience to
parents.

unholy--irreligious \[ALFORD\]; inobservant of the offices of piety.

[2 Timothy 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 3:3</span></span>

truce-breakers--rather as the Greek is translated in [Rom
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031), "implacable."

false accusers--slanderers ([Ti1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011);
[Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003)).

incontinent, fierce--at once both soft and hard: incontinently indulging
themselves, and inhuman to others.

despisers, &c.--"no lovers of good" \[ALFORD\]; the opposite of "a lover
of good" ([Tit 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008)).

[2 Timothy 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 3:4</span></span>

heady--precipitate in action and in passion.

high-minded--literally, "puffed up" with pride, as with smoke blinding
them.

lovers of pleasure . . . God--Love of pleasure destroys the love and
sense of God.

[2 Timothy 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 3:5</span></span>

form--outward semblance.

godliness--piety.

denying--rather as Greek, "having denied," that is, renounced.

the power--the living, regenerating, sanctifying influence of it.

turn away--implying that some of such characters, forerunners of the
last days, were already in the Church.

[2 Timothy 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 3:6</span></span>

of this sort--Greek, "of these," such as were described ([Ti2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005)).

creep into--stealthily.

laden with sins-- ([Isa 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#004)); applying
to the "silly women" whose consciences are burdened with sins, and so
are a ready prey to the false teachers who promise ease of conscience if
they will follow them. A bad conscience leads easily to shipwreck of
faith ([Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019)).

divers lusts--not only animal lusts, but passion for change in doctrine
and manner of teaching; the running after fashionable men and
fashionable tenets, drawing them in the most opposite directions
\[ALFORD\].

[2 Timothy 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 3:7</span></span>

Ever learning--some new point, for mere curiosity, to the disparagement
of what they seemed to know before.

the knowledge--Greek, "the perfect knowledge"; the only safeguard
against further novelties. Gnosticism laid hold especially of the female
sex \[ESTIUS, 1.13.3\]: so Roman Jesuitism.

[2 Timothy 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 3:8</span></span>

Now--Greek, "But"; it is no wonder there should be now such opponents to
the truth, for their prototypes existed in ancient times \[ALFORD\].

Jannes . . . Jambres--traditional names of the Egyptian magicians who
resisted Moses ([Exo 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011), [Exo
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#022)), derived from "the unwritten
teaching of the Jews" \[THEODORET\]. In a point so immaterial as the
names, where Scripture had not recorded them, Paul takes the names which
general opinion had assigned the magicians. EUSEBIUS \[Preparation of
the Gospel\], quotes from NUMENIUS, "Jannes and Jambres were sacred
scribes (a lower order of priests in Egypt) skilled in magic." HILLER
interprets "Jannes" from the Abyssinian language a trickster, and
"Jambres" a juggler" ([Act 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#008)).

resist--"withstand," as before. They did so by trying to rival Moses'
miracles. So the false teachers shall exhibit lying wonders in the last
days ([Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024); [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009); [Rev
13:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014)).

reprobate--incapable of testing the truth ([Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)) \[BENGEL\]. ALFORD takes
passively, "not abiding the test"; rejected on being tested ([Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030)).

[2 Timothy 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 3:9</span></span>

they shall proceed no further--Though for a time ([Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016)) "they shall advance or proceed
(English Version, 'increase') unto more ungodliness," yet there is a
final limit beyond which they shall not be able to "proceed further"
([Job 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#011); [Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007), [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011)). They themselves shall "wax
worse and worse" ([Ti2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013)), but they
shall at last be for ever prevented from seducing others. "Often malice
proceeds deeper down, when it cannot extend itself" \[BENGEL\].

their folly--literally, "dementation": wise though they think
themselves.

shall be manifest--Greek, "shall be brought forth from concealment into
open day" \[BENGEL\], ([Co1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)).

as theirs . . . was--as that of those magicians was, when not only could
they no longer try to rival Moses in sending boils, but the boils fell
upon themselves: so as to the lice ([Exo
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#018); [Exo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#011)).

[2 Timothy 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 3:10</span></span>

fully known--literally, "fully followed up" and traced; namely, with a
view to following me as thy pattern, so far as I follow Christ; the same
Greek as in [Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003), "having had
perfect understanding of all things." His pious mother Eunice and
grandmother Lois would recommend him to study fully Paul's Christian
course as a pattern. He had not been yet the companion of Paul at the
time of the apostle's persecutions in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra ([Act
13:50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050); [Act
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)), but is first mentioned as such
[Act 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001). However, he was "a
disciple" already, when introduced to us in [Act
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001); and as Paul calls him "my own
son in the faith," he must have been converted by the apostle
previously; perhaps in the visit to those parts three years before.
Hence arose Timothy's knowledge of Paul's persecutions, which were the
common talk of the churches in those regions about the time of his
conversion. The incidental allusion to them here forms an undesigned
coincidence between the history and the Epistle, indicating genuineness
\[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. A forger of Epistles from the
Acts would never allude to Timothy's knowledge of persecutions, when
that knowledge is not expressly mentioned in the history, but is only
arrived at by indirect inference; also the omission of Derbe here, in
the Epistle, is in minute accordance with the fact that in Derbe no
persecution is mentioned in the history, though Derbe and Lystra are
commonly mentioned together. The reason why he mentions his persecutions
before Timothy became his companion, and not those subsequent, was
because Timothy was familiar with the latter as an eye-witness and Paul
needed not to remind him of them, but the former Timothy had traced up
by seeking the information from others, especially as the date and scene
of them was the date and scene of his own conversion.

doctrine--"teaching."

manner of life--"conduct," "behavior."

purpose--The Greek is elsewhere usually used of God's "purpose." But
here, as in [Act 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023), of Paul's
determined "purpose of heart in cleaving unto the Lord." My set aim, or
resolution, in my apostolic function, and in every action is, not my
selfish gain, but the glory of God in Christ.

long-suffering--towards my adversaries, and the false teachers; towards
brethren in bearing their infirmities; towards the unconverted, and the
lapsed when penitent ([Ti2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002); [Co2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006); [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022); [Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)).

charity--love to all men.

patience--"endurance"; patient continuance in well-doing amidst
adversities ([Ti2 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011); [Rom
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007)).

[2 Timothy 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 3:11</span></span>

afflictions--"sufferings."

which--Greek, "such as."

in Antioch--of Pisidia ([Act 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014),
[Act 13:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050)).

Iconium-- ([Act 14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001)).

Lystra-- ([Act 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)).

what--How grievous.

out of . . . all . . . Lord delivered me-- ([Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017); [Psa
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017); [Co2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010)). An encouragement to Timothy not
to fear persecutions.

[2 Timothy 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 3:12</span></span>

Yea, and--an additional consideration for Timothy: if he wishes to live
godly in Christ, he must make up his mind to encounter persecution.

that will, &c.--Greek, "all whose will is to live," &c. So far should
persecution be from being a stumbling-block to Timothy, he should
consider it a mark of the pious. So the same Greek is used of the same
thing, [Luk 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028), [Luk
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033), "intending (Greek, 'wishing')
to build a tower . . . counteth the cost."

live godly in Christ-- ([Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020);
[Phi 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021)). There is no godliness
(Greek, "piously") or piety out of Christ. The world easily puts up with
the mask of a religion which depends on itself, but the piety which
derives its vigor directly from Christ is as odious to modern Christians
as it was to the ancient Jews \[BENGEL\].

shall suffer persecution--and will not decline it ([Gal
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011)). BISHOP PEARSON proves the
divine origination of Christianity from its success being inexplicable
on the supposition of its being of human origin. The nature of its
doctrine was no way likely to command success: (1) it condemns all other
religions, some established for ages; (2) it enjoins precepts ungrateful
to flesh and blood, the mortifying of the flesh, the love of enemies,
and the bearing of the cross; (3) it enforces these seemingly
unreasonable precepts by promises seemingly incredible; not good things
such as afford complacency to our senses, but such as cannot be obtained
till after this life, and presuppose what then seemed impossible, the
resurrection; (4) it predicts to its followers what would seem sure to
keep most of the world from embracing it, persecutions.

[2 Timothy 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 3:13</span></span>

Reason why persecutions must be expected, and these becoming worse and
worse as the end approaches. The breach between light and darkness, so
far from being healed, shall be widened \[ALFORD\].

evil men--in contrast to the "godly" ([Ti2
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012)).

seducers--literally, "conjurers." Magical arts prevailed at Ephesus
([Act 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019)), and had been renounced
by many Ephesians on embracing Christianity: but now when Paul was
writing to Ephesus, symptoms of a return to conjuring tricks appeared:
an undesigned coincidence \[BURTON\]. Probably sorcery will characterize
the final apostasy ([Rev 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015); [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015)).

wax worse--literally, "advance in the direction of worse" (see on [Ti2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009)). Not contradictory to that verse:
there the diffusion of the evil was spoken of; here its intensity
\[ALFORD\].

deceiving, and being deceived--He who has once begun to deceive others,
is the less easily able to recover himself from error, and the more
easily embraces in turn the errors of others \[BENGEL\].

[2 Timothy 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 3:14</span></span>

But . . . thou--Whatever they may do. Resuming the thread begun at [Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010).

learned--from me and thy mother and grandmother ([Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)).

assured of--from Scripture ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)).

of whom--plural, not singular, in the oldest manuscripts, "from what
teachers." Not only from me, but from Lois and Eunice.

[2 Timothy 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 3:15</span></span>

from a child--literally, "from an infant." The tender age of the first
dawn of reason is that wherein the most lasting impressions of faith may
be made.

holy scriptures--The Old Testament taught by his Jewish mother. An
undesigned coincidence with [Ti2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005);
[Act 16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001).

able--in themselves: though through men's own fault they often do not in
fact make men savingly alive.

wise unto salvation--that is, wise unto the attainment of salvation.
Contrast "folly" ([Ti2 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#009)). Wise also
in extending it to others.

through faith--as the instrument of this wisdom. Each knows divine
things only as far as his own experience in himself extends. He who has
not faith, has not wisdom or salvation.

which is in--that is, rests on Christ Jesus.

[2 Timothy 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 3:16</span></span>

All scripture--Greek, "Every Scripture," that is, Scripture in its every
part. However, English Version is sustained, though the Greek article be
wanting, by the technical use of the term "Scripture" being so well
known as not to need the article (compare Greek, [Eph
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015); [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021)). The Greek is never used of
writings in general, but only of the sacred Scriptures. The position of
the two Greek adjectives closely united by "and," forbids our taking the
one as an epithet, the other as predicated and translated as ALFORD and
ELLICOTT. "Every Scripture given by inspiration of God is also
profitable." Vulgate and the best manuscripts, favor English Version.
Clearly the adjectives are so closely connected that as surely as one is
a predicate, the other must be so too. ALFORD admits his translation to
be harsh, though legitimate. It is better with English Version to take
it in a construction legitimate, and at the same time not harsh. The
Greek, "God-inspired," is found nowhere else. Most of the New Testament
books were written when Paul wrote this his latest Epistle: so he
includes in the clause "All Scripture is God-inspired," not only the Old
Testament, in which alone Timothy was taught when a child ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)), but the New Testament books
according as they were recognized in the churches which had men gifted
with "discerning of spirits," and so able to distinguish really inspired
utterances, persons, and so their writings from spurious. Paul means,
"All Scripture is God-inspired and therefore useful"; because we see no
utility in any words or portion of it, it does not follow it is not
God-inspired. It is useful, because God-inspired; not God-inspired,
because useful. One reason for the article not being before the Greek,
"Scripture," may be that, if it had, it might be supposed that it
limited the sense to the hiera grammata, "Holy Scriptures" ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)) of the Old Testament, whereas
here the assertion is more general: "all Scripture" (compare Greek, [Pe2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020)). The translation, "all Scripture
that is God-inspired is also useful," would imply that there is some
Scripture which is not God-inspired. But this would exclude the
appropriated sense of the word "Scripture"; and who would need to be
told that "all divine Scripture is useful ('profitable')?" [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013) would, in ALFORD'S view, have to
be rendered, "All naked things are also open to the eyes of Him," &c.:
so also [Ti1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004), which would be
absurd \[TREGELLES, Remarks on the Prophetic Visions of the Book of
Daniel\]. Knapp well defines inspiration, "An extraordinary divine
agency upon teachers while giving instruction, whether oral or written,
by which they were taught how and what they should speak or write"
(compare [Sa2 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001); [Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025); [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)). The inspiration gives the
divine sanction to all the words of Scripture, though those words be the
utterances of the individual writer, and only in special cases revealed
directly by God ([Co1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013)).
Inspiration is here predicated of the writings, "all Scripture," not of
the persons. The question is not how God has done it; it is as to the
word, not the men who wrote it. What we must believe is that He has done
it, and that all the sacred writings are every where inspired, though
not all alike matter of special revelation: and that even the very words
are stamped with divine sanction, as Jesus used them (for example in the
temptation and [Joh 10:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034)), for
deciding all questions of doctrine and practice. There are degrees of
revelation in Scripture, but not of inspiration. The sacred writers did
not even always know the full significancy of their own God-inspired
words ([Pe1 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010)). Verbal
inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but all "Scripture is
(so) inspired by God," that everything in it, its narratives,
prophecies, citations, the whole--ideas, phrases, and words--are such as
He saw fit to be there. The present condition of the text is no ground
for concluding against the original text being inspired, but is a reason
why we should use all critical diligence to restore the original
inspired text. Again, inspiration may be accompanied by revelation or
not, but it is as much needed for writing known doctrines or facts
authoritatively, as for communicating new truths \[TREGELLES\]. The
omission here of the substantive verb is,' I think, designed to mark
that, not only the Scripture then existing, but what was still to be
written till the canon should be completed, is included as God-inspired.
The Old Testament law was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; so it
is appropriately said to be "able to make wise unto salvation through
faith in Jesus Christ": the term wisdom being appropriated to a
knowledge of the relations between the Old and New Testaments, and
opposed to the pretended wisdom of the false teachers ([Ti1
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007)).

doctrine--Greek, "teaching," that is, teaching the ignorant dogmatic
truths which they cannot otherwise know. He so uses the Old Testament,
[Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).

reproof--"refutation," convicting the erring of their error. Including
polemical divinity. As an example of this use of the Old Testament,
compare [Gal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006), [Gal
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013), [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016). "Doctrine and reproof"
comprehend the speculative parts of divinity. Next follow the practical:
Scripture is profitable for: (1) correction (Greek, "setting one right";
compare an example, [Co1 10:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)) and
instruction (Greek, "disciplining," as a father does his child, see on
[Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025); [Eph
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004); [Heb
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#005), [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011), or "training" by instruction,
warning, example, kindnesses, promises, and chastisements; compare an
example, [Co1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013)). Thus the whole
science of theology is complete in Scripture. Since Paul is speaking of
Scripture in general and in the notion of it, the only general reason
why, in order to perfecting the godly ([Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017)), it should extend to every
department of revealed truth, must be that it was intended to be the
complete and sufficient rule in all things touching perfection. See
Article VI, Common Prayer Book.

in--Greek, "instruction which is in righteousness," as contrasted with
the "instruction" in worldly rudiments ([Col
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020), [Col
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022)).
