Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Lamentations Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

[Lamentations 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 3:1</span></span>

(Lam. 3:1-66)

seen affliction--his own in the dungeon of Malchiah ([Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006)); that of his countrymen also in
the siege. Both were types of that of Christ.

[Lamentations 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 3:2</span></span>

darkness--calamity.

light--prosperity.

[Lamentations 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 3:3</span></span>

turneth . . . hand--to inflict again and again new strokes. "His hand,"
which once used to protect me. "Turned . . . turneth" implies repeated
inflictions.

[Lamentations 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 3:4</span></span>

([Job 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008)).

[Lamentations 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 3:5</span></span>

builded--mounds, as against a besieged city, so as to allow none to
escape (so [Lam 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007), [Lam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009)).

[Lamentations 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 3:6</span></span>

set me--HENDERSON refers this to the custom of placing the dead in a
sitting posture.

dark places--sepulchers. As those "dead long since"; so Jeremiah and his
people are consigned to oblivion ([Psa
88:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#005); [Psa
143:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#003); [Eze
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#013)).

[Lamentations 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 3:7</span></span>

hedged-- ([Job 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023); [Hos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006)).

chain--literally, "chain of brass."

[Lamentations 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 3:8</span></span>

shutteth out--image from a door shutting out any entrance ([Job
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020)). So the antitype. Christ ([Psa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)).

[Lamentations 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 3:9</span></span>

hewn stone--which coheres so closely as not to admit of being broken
through.

paths crooked--thwarted our plans and efforts so that none went right.

[Lamentations 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 3:10</span></span>

([Job 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016); [Hos
13:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007)).

[Lamentations 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 3:11</span></span>

turned aside--made me wander out of the right way, so as to become a
prey to wild beasts.

pulled in pieces-- ([Hos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001)), as a
"bear" or a "lion" ([Lam 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010)).

[Lamentations 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 3:12</span></span>

([Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020)).

[Lamentations 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 3:13</span></span>

arrows--literally, "sons" of His quiver (compare [Job
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004)).

[Lamentations 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 3:14</span></span>

([Jer 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)).

their song-- ([Psa 69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)). Jeremiah
herein was a type of Messiah. "All my people" ([Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011)).

[Lamentations 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 3:15</span></span>

wormwood-- ([Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015)). There it is
regarded as food, namely, the leaves: here as drink, namely, the juice.

[Lamentations 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 3:16</span></span>

gravel--referring to the grit that often mixes with bread baked in
ashes, as is the custom of baking in the East ([Pro
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017)). We fare as hardly as those who
eat such bread. The same allusion is in "Covered me with ashes," namely,
as bread.

[Lamentations 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 3:17</span></span>

Not only present, but all hope of future prosperity is removed; so much
so, that I am as one who never was prosperous ("I forgat prosperity").

[Lamentations 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 3:18</span></span>

from the Lord--that is, my hope derived from Him ([Psa
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022)).

[Lamentations 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 3:19</span></span>

This gives the reason why he gave way to the temptation to despair. The
Margin, "Remember" does not suit the sense so well.

wormwood . . . gall-- ([Jer 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#015)).

[Lamentations 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 3:20</span></span>

As often as my soul calls them to remembrance, it is humbled or bowed
down in me.

[Lamentations 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 3:21</span></span>

This--namely, what follows; the view of the divine character ([Lam
3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022)). CALVIN makes "this" refer to
Jeremiah's infirmity. His very weakness ([Lam
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019)) gives him hope of God
interposing His strength for him (compare [Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011), [Psa
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#017); [Psa
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005), [Psa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008); [Co2
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)).

[Lamentations 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 3:22</span></span>

([Mal 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006)).

[Lamentations 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lam 3:23</span></span>

([Isa 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#002)).

[Lamentations 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lam 3:24</span></span>

([Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020); [Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005); [Psa
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026); [Psa
119:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#057); [Jer
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016)). To have God for our portion is
the one only foundation of hope.

[Lamentations 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">lam 3:25</span></span>

The repetition of "good" at the beginning of each of the three verses
heightens the effect.

wait-- ([Isa 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018)).

[Lamentations 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lam 3:26</span></span>

quietly wait--literally, "be in silence." Compare [Lam
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028) and [Psa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#002), [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009), that is, to be patiently quiet
under afflictions, resting in the will of God ([Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007)). So Aaron ([Lev
10:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002)); and Job ([Job
40:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004)).

[Lamentations 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lam 3:27</span></span>

yoke--of the Lord's disciplinary teaching ([Psa
90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012); [Psa
119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071)). CALVIN interprets it, The
Lord's doctrine ([Mat 11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)), which
is to be received in a docile spirit. The earlier the better; for the
old are full of prejudices ([Pro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017);
[Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001)). Jeremiah himself received
the yoke, both of doctrine and chastisement in his youth ([Jer
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006)).

[Lamentations 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lam 3:28</span></span>

The fruit of true docility and patience. He does not fight against the
yoke ([Jer 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018); [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005)), but accommodates himself to it.

alone--The heathen applauded magnanimity, but they looked to display and
the praise of men. The child of God, in the absence of any witness,
"alone," silently submits to the will of God.

borne it upon him--that is, because he is used to bearing it on him.
Rather, "because He (the Lord, [Lam
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026)) hath laid it on him"
\[VATABLUS\].

[Lamentations 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lam 3:29</span></span>

([Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006)). The mouth in the dust is
the attitude of suppliant and humble submission to God's dealings as
righteous and loving in design (compare [Ezr
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006); [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025)).

if so be there may be hope--This does not express doubt as to whether
GOD be willing to receive the penitent, but the penitent's doubt as to
himself; he whispers to himself this consolation, "Perhaps there may be
hope for me."

[Lamentations 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lam 3:30</span></span>

Messiah, the Antitype, fulfilled this; His practice agreeing with His
precept ([Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006); [Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039)). Many take patiently afflictions
from God, but when man wrongs them, they take it impatiently. The godly
bear resignedly the latter, like the former, as sent by God ([Psa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013)).

[Lamentations 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lam 3:31</span></span>

True repentance is never without hope ([Psa
94:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#014)).

[Lamentations 3:32](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">lam 3:32</span></span>

The punishments of the godly are but for a time.

[Lamentations 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lam 3:33</span></span>

He does not afflict any willingly (literally, "from His heart," that is,
as if He had any pleasure in it, [Eze
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011)), much less the godly ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010)).

[Lamentations 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lam 3:34</span></span>

This triplet has an infinitive in the beginning of each verse, the
governing finite verb being in the end of [Lam
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#036), "the Lord approveth not," which
is to be repeated in each verse. Jeremiah here anticipates and answers
the objections which the Jews might start, that it was by His connivance
they were "crushed under the feet" of those who "turned aside the right
of a man." God approves (literally, "seeth," [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013); so "behold," "look on," that is,
look on with approval) not of such unrighteous acts; and so the Jews may
look for deliverance and the punishment of their foes.

[Lamentations 3:35](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">lam 3:35</span></span>

before . . . face of . . . most High--Any "turning aside" of justice in
court is done before the face of God, who Is present, and "regardeth,"
though unseen ([Ecc 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#008)).

[Lamentations 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">lam 3:36</span></span>

subvert--to wrong.

[Lamentations 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lam 3:37</span></span>

Who is it that can (as God, [Psa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009))
effect by a word anything, without the will of God?

[Lamentations 3:38](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lam 3:38</span></span>

evil . . . good--Calamity and prosperity alike proceed from God ([Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010); [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007); [Amo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006)).

[Lamentations 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">lam 3:39</span></span>

living--and so having a time yet given him by God for repentance. If sin
were punished as it deserves, life itself would be forfeited by the
sinner. "Complaining" (murmuring) ill becomes him who enjoys such a
favor as life ([Pro 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#003)).

for the punishment of his sins--Instead of blaming God for his
sufferings, he ought to recognize in them God's righteousness and the
just rewards of his own sin.

[Lamentations 3:40](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lam 3:40</span></span>

us--Jeremiah and his fellow countrymen in their calamity.

search--as opposed to the torpor wherewith men rest only on their
outward sufferings, without attending to the cause of them ([Psa
139:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023)).

[Lamentations 3:41](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">lam 3:41</span></span>

heart with . . . hands--the antidote to hypocrisy ([Psa
86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004); [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008)).

[Lamentations 3:42](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">lam 3:42</span></span>

not pardoned--The Babylonian captivity had not yet ended.

[Lamentations 3:43](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">lam 3:43</span></span>

covered--namely, thyself (so [Lam
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)), so as not to see and pity our
calamities, for even the most cruel in seeing a sad spectacle are moved
to pity. Compare as to God "hiding His face," [Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011); [Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025).

[Lamentations 3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">lam 3:44</span></span>

([Lam 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#008)). The "cloud" is our sins,
and God's wrath because of them ([Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002)).

[Lamentations 3:45](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">lam 3:45</span></span>

So the apostles were treated; but, instead of murmuring, they rejoiced
at it ([Co1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#013)).

[Lamentations 3:46](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">lam 3:46</span></span>

Pe is put before Ain ([Lam 3:43](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#043), [Lam
3:46](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#046)), as in [Lam
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016); [Lam
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016). ([Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016).)

[Lamentations 3:47](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">lam 3:47</span></span>

Like animals fleeing in fear, we fall into the snare laid for us.

[Lamentations 3:48](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">lam 3:48</span></span>

([Jer 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019)).

[Lamentations 3:49](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">lam 3:49</span></span>

without . . . intermission--or else, "because there is no intermission"
\[PISCATOR\], namely, Of my miseries.

[Lamentations 3:50](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">lam 3:50</span></span>

Till--His prayer is not without hope, wherein it differs from the blind
grief of unbelievers.

look down, &c.-- ([Isa 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015)).

[Lamentations 3:51](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">lam 3:51</span></span>

eye affecteth mine heart--that is, causeth me grief with continual
tears; or, "affecteth my life" (literally, "soul," Margin), that is, my
health \[GROTIUS\].

daughters of . . . city--the towns around, dependencies of Jerusalem,
taken by the foe.

[Lamentations 3:52](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">lam 3:52</span></span>

a bird--which is destitute of counsel and strength. The allusion seems
to be to [Pro 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017) \[CALVIN\].

without cause-- ([Psa 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004); [Psa
109:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#003)). Type of Messiah ([Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025)).

[Lamentations 3:53](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">lam 3:53</span></span>

in . . . dungeon-- ([Jer 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016)).

stone--usually put at the mouth of a dungeon to secure the prisoners
([Jos 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#018); [Dan
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017); [Mat
27:60](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#060)).

[Lamentations 3:54](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">lam 3:54</span></span>

Waters--not literally, for there was "no water" ([Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006)) in the place of Jeremiah's
confinement, but emblematical of overwhelming calamities ([Psa
69:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#002); [Psa
124:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004)).

cut off-- ([Isa 38:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010)). I am
abandoned by God. He speaks according to carnal sense.

[Lamentations 3:55](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">lam 3:55</span></span>

I called out of dungeon--Thus the spirit resists the flesh, and faith
spurns the temptation \[CALVIN\], ([Psa
130:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#001); [Jon
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#002)).

[Lamentations 3:56](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">lam 3:56</span></span>
