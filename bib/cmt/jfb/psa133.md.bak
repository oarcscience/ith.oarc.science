### [Psalms Chapter 133](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 133:1</span></span>

The blessings of fraternal unity. ([Psa
133:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001).md)

As the fragrant oil is refreshing, so this affords delight. The holy
anointing oil for the high priest was olive oil mixed with four of the
best spices ([Exo 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#022.md), [Exo
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#025.md), [Exo
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030).md). Its rich profusion typified
the abundance of the Spirit's graces. As the copious dew, such as fell

[Psalms 133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003.md)

commanded the blessing--(Compare [Psa
68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028).md).

stand in the house of the Lord--at the time of the evening sacrifice, to
unite in praising God in their name and that of the people, using
appropriate gestures, to which the priests reply, pronouncing the Mosaic
blessing which they alone could pronounce. A fit epilogue to the whole
pilgrim-book, Psalms 120-134.

by night--the evening service ([Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002).md), as opposed to morning ([Psa
92:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#002).md).
