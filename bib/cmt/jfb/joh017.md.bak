### [John Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

[John 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 17:1</span></span>

THE INTERCESSORY PRAYER. (John 17:1-26)

These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes--"John very seldom
depicts the gestures or looks of our Lord, as here. But this was an
occasion of which the impression was indelible, and the upward look
could not be passed over" \[ALFORD\].

Father, the hour is come--(See on [Joh
13:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031).md).

glorify thy Son--Put honor upon Thy Son, by countenancing, sustaining,
and carrying Him through that "hour."

[John 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 17:2</span></span>

given--gavest

him power over all flesh--(See on [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md); [Mat
28:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md).

give eternal life to as many as, &c.--literally, "to all that which thou
hast given him." (See on [Joh
6:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037).md).

[John 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 17:3</span></span>

this is--that.

life eternal, that they might--may.

know, &c.--This life eternal, then, is not mere conscious and unending
existence, but a life of acquaintance with God in Christ ([Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021).md).

thee, the only true God--the sole personal living God; in glorious
contrast equally with heathen polytheism, philosophic naturalism, and
mystic pantheism.

and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent--This is the only place where our
Lord gives Himself this compound name, afterwards so current in
apostolic preaching and writing. Here the terms are used in their strict
signification--"JESUS," because He "saves His people from their sins";
"CHRIST," as anointed with the measureless fulness of the Holy Ghost for
the exercise of His saving offices (see on [Mat
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#016).md); "WHOM THOU HAST SENT," in the
plenitude of Divine Authority and Power, to save. "The very
juxtaposition here of Jesus Christ with the Father is a proof, by
implication, of our Lord's Godhead. The knowledge of God and a creature
could not be eternal life, and such an association of the one with the
other would be inconceivable" \[ALFORD\].

[John 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 17:4</span></span>

I have glorified thee on the earth--rather, "I glorified" (for the thing
is conceived as now past).

I have finished--I finished.

the work which thou gavest me to do--It is very important to preserve in
the translation the past tense, used in the original, otherwise it might
be thought that the work already "finished" was only what He had done
before uttering that prayer; whereas it will be observed that our Lord
speaks throughout as already beyond this present scene ([Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012), &c..md), and so must be supposed
to include in His "finished work" the "decease which He was to
accomplish at Jerusalem."

[John 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 17:5</span></span>

And now--in return.

glorify thou me--The "I Thee" and "Thou Me" are so placed in the
original, each beside its fellow, as to show that A PERFECT RECIPROCITY
OF SERVICES of the Son to the Father first, and then of the Father to
the Son in return, is what our Lord means here to express.

with the glory which I had with thee before the world was--when "in the
beginning the Word was with God" ([Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md), "the only-begotten Son in the
bosom of the Father" ([Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md). With
this pre-existent glory, which He veiled on earth, He asks to be
reinvested, the design of the veiling being accomplished--not, however,
simply as before, but now in our nature.

[John 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 17:6</span></span>

From praying for Himself He now comes to pray for His disciples.

I have manifested--I manifested.

thy name--His whole character towards mankind.

to the men thou gavest me out of the world--(See on [Joh
6:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037).md).

[John 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 17:8</span></span>

they . . . have known surely that I came out from thee--(See on [Joh
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029.md); [Joh
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#031).md).

[John 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 17:9</span></span>

I pray for them--not as individuals merely, but as representatives of
all such in every succeeding age (see on [Joh
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020).md).

not for the world--for they had been given Him "out of the world" ([Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006).md), and had been already
transformed into the very opposite of it. The things sought for them,
indeed, are applicable only to such.

[John 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 17:10</span></span>

all mine are thine, and thine are mine--literally, "All My things are
Thine and Thy things are Mine." (On this use of the neuter gender, see
on [Joh 6:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037).md). Absolute COMMUNITY
OF PROPERTY between the Father and the Son is here expressed as nakedly
as words can do it. (See on [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md).

[John 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 17:11</span></span>

I am no more in the world--(See on [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004).md).

but these are in the world--that is, Though My struggles are at an end,
theirs are not; though I have gotten beyond the scene of strife, I
cannot sever Myself in spirit from them, left behind and only just
entering on their great conflict.

Holy Father--an expression He nowhere else uses. "Father" is His wonted
appellation, but "Holy" is here prefixed, because His appeal was to that
perfection of the Father's nature, to "keep" or preserve them from being
tainted by the unholy atmosphere of "the world" they were still in.

keep through thine own name--rather, "in thy name"; in the exercise of
that gracious and holy character for which He was known.

that they may be one--(See on [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021).md).

[John 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 17:12</span></span>

I kept--guarded.

them in thy name--acting as Thy Representative on earth.

none of them is lost, but the son of perdition--It is not implied here
that the son of perdition was one of those whom the Father had given to
the Son, but rather the contrary ([Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018).md) \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. It
is just as in [Luk 4:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#026.md), where we
are not to suppose that the woman of Sarepta (in Sidon) was one of the
widows of Israel, nor Naaman the Syrian one of the lepers in Israel,
though the language--the same as here--might seem to express it.

son of perdition--doomed to it ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md); [Mar
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021).md).

[John 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 17:13</span></span>

I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves--that is, Such a strain befits rather the upper sanctuary
than the scene of conflict; but I speak so "in the world," that My joy,
the joy I experience in knowing that such intercessions are to be made
for them by their absent Lord, may be tasted by those who now hear them,
and by all who shall hereafter read the record of them,

[John 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 17:15</span></span>

I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world--for that,
though it would secure their own safety, would leave the world unblessed
by their testimony.

but . . . keep them from the evil--all evil in and of the world.

[John 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 17:16</span></span>

They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world--(See [Joh
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018).md). This is reiterated here, to
pave the way for the prayer which follows.

[John 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 17:17</span></span>

Sanctify them--As the former prayer, "Keep them," was "negative," asking
protection for them from the poisonous element which surrounded and
pressed upon their renewed nature, so this prayer, "Sanctify them," is
positive, asking the advancement and completion of their begun
sanctification.

through--in.

thy truth--God's revealed truth, as the medium or element of
sanctification; a statement this of immense importance.

thy word is truth--(Compare [Joh 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md);
[Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md); [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md).

[John 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 17:18</span></span>

As thou hast sent--sentest.

me into the world, even so have I also sent them--sent I also them.

into the world--As their mission was to carry into effect the purposes
of their Master's mission, so our Lord speaks of the authority in both
cases as co-ordinate.

[John 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 17:19</span></span>

And for their sakes I sanctify--consecrate.

myself that they also might--may.

be sanctified--consecrated. The only difference between the application
of the same term to Christ and the disciples is, as applied to Christ,
that it means only to "consecrate"; whereas, in application to the
disciples, it means to consecrate with the additional idea of previous
sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented as an
offering. The whole self-sacrificing work of the disciples appears here
as a mere result of the offering of Christ \[OLSHAUSEN\].

through--in.

the truth--Though the article is wanting in the original here, we are
not to translate, as in the Margin, "truly sanctified"; for the
reference seems plainly to be "the truth" mentioned in [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md). (See on [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017).md).

[John 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 17:20</span></span>

Neither pray I for these alone--This very important explanation, uttered
in condescension to the hearers and readers of this prayer in all time,
is meant not merely of what follows, but of the whole prayer.

them also which shall believe--The majority of the best manuscripts read
"which believe," all future time being viewed as present, while the
present is viewed as past and gone.

[John 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 17:21</span></span>

that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
that they may be one in us--The indwelling Spirit of the Father and the
Son is the one perfect bond of union, knitting up into a living unity,
first all believers amongst themselves; next, this unity into one still
higher, with the Father and the Son. (Observe, that Christ never mixes
Himself up with His disciples as He associates Himself with the Father,
but says I in THEM and THEY in US).

that the world may believe that thou hast sent me--sentest me. So the
grand impression upon the world at large, that the mission of Christ is
divine, is to be made by the unity of His disciples. Of course, then, it
must be something that shall be visible or perceptible to the world.
What is it, then? Not certainly a merely formal, mechanical unity of
ecclesiastical machinery. For as that may, and to a large extent does,
exist in both the Western and Eastern churches, with little of the
Spirit of Christ, yea much, much with which the Spirit of Christ cannot
dwell so instead of convincing the world beyond its own pale of the
divinity of the Gospel, it generates infidelity to a large extent within
its own bosom. But the Spirit of Christ, illuminating, transforming, and
reigning in the hearts of the genuine disciples of Christ, drawing them
to each other as members of one family, and prompting them to loving
co-operation for the good of the world--this is what, when sufficiently
glowing and extended, shall force conviction upon the world that
Christianity is divine. Doubtless, the more that differences among
Christians disappear--the more they can agree even in minor matters--the
impression upon the world may be expected to be greater. But it is not
dependent upon this; for living and loving oneness in Christ is
sometimes more touchingly seen even amidst and in spite of minor
differences, than where no such differences exist to try the strength of
their deeper unity. Yet till this living brotherhood in Christ shall
show itself strong enough to destroy the sectarianism, selfishness,
carnality, and apathy that eat out the heart of Christianity in all the
visible sections of it, in vain shall we expect the world to be overawed
by it. It is when "the Spirit shall be poured upon us from on high," as
a Spirit of truth and love, and upon all parts of the Christian
territory alike, melting down differences and heart burnings, kindling
astonishment and shame at past unfruitfulness, drawing forth longings of
catholic affection, and yearnings over a world lying in wickedness,
embodying themselves in palpable forms and active measures--it is then
that we may expect the effect here announced to be produced, and then it
will be irresistible. Should not Christians ponder these things? Should
not the same mind be in them which was also in Christ Jesus about this
matter? Should not His prayer be theirs?

[John 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 17:22</span></span>

And the glory which thou gavest--hast given.

me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one--The last
clause shows the meaning of the first. It is not the future glory of the
heavenly state, but the secret of that present unity just before spoken
of; the glory, therefore, of the indwelling Spirit of Christ; the glory
of an accepted state, of a holy character, of every grace.

[John 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 17:23</span></span>

I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one--(See on
[Joh 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021).md).

[John 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 17:24</span></span>

Father, I will--The majesty of this style of speaking is quite
transparent. No petty criticism will be allowed to fritter it away in
any but superficial or perverted readers.

be with me where I am--(See on [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).md).

that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me--(See on [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005).md). Christ regards it as glory
enough for us to be admitted to see and gaze for ever upon His glory!
This is "the beatific vision"; but it shall be no mere vision, for "we
shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is" ([Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md).

[John 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 17:25</span></span>

O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee--knew thee not.

but I have known thee--knew thee.

and these have known--knew.

that thou hast sent--sentest

me--As before He said "Holy Father," when desiring the display of that
perfection on His disciples ([Joh
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011).md), so here He styles Him
"Righteous Father," because He is appealing to His righteousness or
justice, to make a distinction between those two diametrically opposite
classes--"the world," on the one hand, which would not "know the Father,
though brought so nigh to it in the Son of His love, and, on the other,
Himself, who recognized and owned Him, and even His disciples, who owned
His mission from the Father.

[John 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 17:26</span></span>

And I have declared--I made known or communicated.

thy name--in His past ministry.

and will declare it--in yet larger measure, by the gift of the Holy
Ghost at Pentecost and through all succeeding ages.

that the love wherewith thou hast loved--lovedst.

me may be in them, and I in them--This eternal love of the Father,
resting first on Christ, is by His Spirit imparted to and takes up its
permanent abode in all that believe in Him; and "He abiding in them and
they in Him" ([Joh 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005).md), they are
"one Spirit." "With this lofty thought the Redeemer closes His prayer
for His disciples, and in them for His Church through all ages. He has
compressed into the last moments given Him for conversation with His own
the most sublime and glorious sentiments ever uttered by mortal lips.
But hardly has the sound of the last word died away, when He passes with
the disciples over the brook Kedron to Gethsemane--and the bitter
conflict draws on. The seed of the new world must be sown in Death, that
thence Life may spring up" \[OLSHAUSEN\].
