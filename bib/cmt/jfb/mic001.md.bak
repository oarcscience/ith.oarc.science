### [Micah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)

[Micah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 1:2</span></span>

GOD'S WRATH AGAINST SAMARIA AND JUDAH; THE FORMER IS TO BE OVERTHROWN;
SUCH JUDGMENTS IN PROSPECT CALL FOR MOURNING. (Mic. 1:1-16)

all that therein is--Hebrew, "whatever fills it." Micaiah, son of Imlah,
begins his prophecy similarly, "Hearken, O people, every one of you."
Micah designedly uses the same preface, implying that his ministrations
are a continuation of his predecessor's of the same name. Both probably
had before their mind Moses' similar attestation of heaven and earth in
a like case ([Deu 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#028.md); [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md); compare [Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002).md).

God be witness against you--namely, that none of you can say, when the
time of your punishment shall come, that you were not forewarned. The
punishment denounced is stated in [Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md), &c.

from his holy temple--that is, heaven ([Kg1
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#030.md); [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md); [Jon
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#007.md); compare [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018).md).

[Micah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 1:3</span></span>

tread upon the high places of the earth--He shall destroy the fortified
heights (compare [Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013.md); [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md) \[GROTIUS\].

[Micah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 1:4</span></span>

Imagery from earthquakes and volcanic agency, to describe the terrors
which attend Jehovah's coming in judgment (compare [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005).md). Neither men of high degree, as
the mountains, nor men of low degree, as the valleys, can secure
themselves or their land from the judgments of God.

as wax-- ([Psa 97:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#005.md); compare [Isa
64:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#001).md). The third clause, "as wax,"
&c.; answers to the first in the parallelism, "the mountains shall be
molten"; the fourth, "as the waters," &c.; to the second, "the valleys
shall be cleft." As wax melts by fire, so the mountains before God, at
His approach; and as waters poured down a steep cannot stand but are
diffused abroad, so the valleys shall be cleft before Jehovah.

[Micah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 1:5</span></span>

For the transgression of Jacob is all this--All these terrors attending
Jehovah's coming are caused by the sins of Jacob or Israel, that is, the
whole people.

What is the transgression of Jacob?--Taking up the question often in the
mouths of the people when reproved, "What is our transgression?"
(compare [Mal 1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006).md), He answers, Is
it not Samaria? Is not that city (the seat of the calf-worship) the
cause of Jacob's apostasy ([Kg1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#016.md);
[Kg1 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#026.md), [Kg1
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#034.md); [Kg1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#013.md), [Kg1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md), [Kg1
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md), [Kg1
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#030).md)?

and what are the high places of Judah?--What city is the cause of the
idolatries on the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem (compare
[Kg2 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md)?

[Micah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 1:6</span></span>

Samaria's punishment is mentioned first, as it was to fall before
Jerusalem.

as an heap of the field-- ([Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md).
Such a heap of stones and rubbish as is gathered out of fields, to clear
them ([Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011).md). Palestine is of a
soil abounding in stones, which are gathered out before the vines are
planted ([Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002).md).

as plantings of a vineyard--as a place where vines are planted.
Vineyards were cultivated on the sides of hills exposed to the sun. The
hill on which Samaria was built by Omri, had been, doubtless, planted
with vines originally; now it is to be reduced again to its original
state ([Kg1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024).md).

pour down--dash down the stones of the city into the valley beneath. A
graphic picture of the present appearance of the ruins, which is as
though "the buildings of the ancient city had been thrown down from the
brow of the hill" \[Scottish Mission of Inquiry, pp. 293,294\].

discover the foundations--destroy it so utterly as to lay bare its
foundations ([Eze 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#014).md). Samaria was
destroyed by Shalmaneser.

[Micah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 1:7</span></span>

all the hires--the wealth which Israel boasted of receiving from her
idols as the "rewards" or "hire" for worshipping them ([Hos
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md), [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md).

idols . . . will I . . . desolate--that is, give them up to the foe to
strip off the silver and gold with which they are overlaid.

she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the
hire of an harlot--Israel gathered (made for herself) her idols from the
gold and silver received from false gods, as she thought, the "hire" of
her worshipping them; and they shall again become what they had been
before, the hire of spiritual harlotry, that is, the prosperity of the
foe, who also being worshippers of idols will ascribe the acquisition to
their idols \[MAURER\]. GROTIUS explains it, The offerings sent to
Israel's temple by the Assyrians, whose idolatry Israel adopted, shall
go back to the Assyrians, her teachers in idolatry, as the hire or fee
for having taught it. The image of a harlot's hire for the supposed
temporal reward of spiritual fornication, is more common in Scripture
([Hos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001).md).

[Micah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 1:8</span></span>

Therefore I will wail--The prophet first shows how the coming judgment
affects himself, in order that he might affect the minds of his
countrymen similarly.

stripped--that is, of shoes, or sandals, as the Septuagint translates.
Otherwise "naked" would be a tautology.

naked--"Naked" means divested of the upper garment ([Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002).md). "Naked and barefoot," the sign
of mourning ([Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md). The
prophet's upper garment was usually rough and coarse-haired ([Kg2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md); [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004).md).

like the dragons--so JEROME. Rather, "the wild dogs," jackals or wolves,
which wail like an infant when in distress or alone \[MAURER\]. (See on
[Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029).md).

owls--rather, "ostriches," which give a shrill and long-drawn, sigh-like
cry, especially at night.

[Micah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 1:9</span></span>

wound . . . incurable--Her case, politically and morally, is desperate
([Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022).md).

it is come--the wound, or impending calamity (compare [Isa
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028).md).

he is come . . . even to Jerusalem--The evil is no longer limited to
Israel. The prophet foresees Sennacherib coming even "to the gate" of
the principal city. The use of "it" and "he" is appropriately distinct.
"It," the calamity, "came unto" Judah, many of the inhabitants of which
suffered, but did not reach the citizens of Jerusalem, "the gate" of
which the foe ("he") "came unto," but did not enter ([Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md); [Isa
37:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033).md).

[Micah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 1:10</span></span>

Declare ye it not at Gath--on the borders of Judea, one of the five
cities of the Philistines, who would exult at the calamity of the
Hebrews ([Sa2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020).md). Gratify not those
who exult over the falls of the Israel of God.

weep ye not at all--Do not betray your inward sorrow by outward weeping,
within the cognizance of the enemy, lest they should exult at it. RELAND
translates, "Weep not in Acco," that is, Ptolemais, now St. Jean d'Acre,
near the foot of Mount Carmel; allotted to Asher, but never occupied by
that tribe ([Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md); Acco's
inhabitants would, therefore, like Gath's, rejoice at Israel's disaster.
Thus the parallelism is best carried out in all the three clauses of the
verse, and there is a similar play on sounds in each, in the Hebrew
Gath, resembling in sound the Hebrew for "declare"; Acco, resembling the
Hebrew for "weep"; and Aphrah, meaning "dust." While the Hebrews were
not to expose their misery to foreigners, they ought to bewail it in
their own cities, for example, Aphrah or Ophrah ([Jos
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#023.md); [Sa1
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017).md), in the tribe of Benjamin. To
"roll in the dust" marked deep sorrow ([Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md); [Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030).md).

[Micah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 1:11</span></span>

Pass ye away--that is, Thou shall go into captivity.

inhabitant of Saphir--a village amidst the hills of Judah, between
Eleutheropolis and Ascalon, called so, from the Hebrew word for
"beauty." Though thy name be "beauty," which heretofore was thy
characteristic, thou shalt have thy "shame" made "naked." This city
shall be dismantled of its walls, which are the garments, as it were, of
cities; its citizens also shall be hurried into captivity, with persons
exposed ([Isa 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003.md); [Eze
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037.md); [Hos
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010).md).

the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth--Its inhabitants did not come
forth to console the people of Beth-ezel in their mourning, because the
calamity was universal; none was exempt from it (compare [Jer
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025).md). "Zaanan" is the same as Zenan,
in Judah ([Jos 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#037).md), meaning the
"place of flocks." The form of the name used is made like the Hebrew for
"came forth." Though in name seeming to imply that thou dost come forth,
thou "camest not forth."

Beth-ezel--perhaps Azal ([Zac 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md),
near Jerusalem. It means a "house on the side," or "near." Though so
near, as its name implies, to Zaanan, Beth-ezel received no succor or
sympathy from Zaanan.

he shall receive of you his standing--"he," that is, the foe; "his
standing," that is, his sustenance \[PISCATOR\]. Or, "he shall be caused
a delay by you, Zaanan." He shall be brought to a stand for a time in
besieging you; hence it is said just before, "Zaanan came not forth,"
that is, shut herself up within her walls to withstand a siege. But it
was only for a time. She, too, fell like Beth-ezel before her
\[VATABLUS\]. MAURER construes thus: "The inhabitant of Zaanan came not
forth; the mourning of Beth-ezel takes away from you her shelter."
Though Beth-ezel be at your side (that is, near), according to her name,
yet as she also mourns under the oppression of the foe, she cannot give
you shelter, or be at your side as a helper (as her name might lead you
to expect), if you come forth and be intercepted by him from returning
to Zaanan.

[Micah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 1:12</span></span>

Maroth--possibly the same as Maarath ([Jos
15:59](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#059).md). Perhaps a different town,
lying between the previously mentioned towns and the capital, and one of
those plundered by Rab-shakeh on his way to it.

waited carefully for good--that is, for better fortune, but in vain
\[CALVIN\]. GESENIUS translates, "is grieved for her goods," "taken
away" from her. This accords with the meaning of Maroth, "bitterness,"
to which allusion is made in "is grieved." But the antithesis favors
English Version, "waited carefully (that is, anxiously) for good, but
evil came down."

from the Lord--not from chance.

unto the gate of Jerusalem--after the other cities of Judah have been
taken.

[Micah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 1:13</span></span>

"Bind the chariot to the swift steed," in order by a hasty flight to
escape the invading foe. Compare Note, see on [Isa
36:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#002.md), on "Lachish," at which
Sennacherib fixed his headquarters ([Kg2
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), [Kg2
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md); [Jer
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#007).md).

she is the beginning of the sin to . . . Zion--Lachish was the first of
the cities of Judah, according to this passage, to introduce the worship
of false gods, imitating what Jeroboam had introduced in Israel. As
lying near the border of the north kingdom, Lachish was first to be
infected by its idolatry, which thence spread to Jerusalem.

[Micah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 1:14</span></span>

shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath--that its inhabitants may
send thee help. MAURER explains it, "thou shalt give a writing of
renunciation to Moresheth-gath," that is, thou shalt renounce all claim
to it, being compelled to yield it up to the foe. "Thou," that is,
Judah. "Israel" in this verse is used for the kingdom of Judah, which
was the chief representative of the whole nation of Israel.
Moresheth-gath is so called because it had fallen for a time under the
power of the neighboring Philistines of Gath. It was the native town of
Micah ([Mic 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001).md).

Achzib--meaning "lying." Achzib, as its name implies, shall prove a "lie
to . . . Israel," that is, shall disappoint Israel's hopes of succor
from her (compare [Job 6:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015.md); [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018).md). Achzib was in Judah between
Keilah and Mareshah ([Jos 15:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#044).md).
Perhaps the same as Chezib ([Gen
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#005).md).

[Micah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 1:15</span></span>

Yet will I bring an heir unto thee--rather, "the heir." As thou art now
occupied by possessors who expelled the former inhabitants, so will I
bring "yet" again the new possessor, namely, the Assyrian foe. Other
heirs will supplant us in every inheritance but that of heaven. There is
a play upon the meaning of Mareshah, "an inheritance": there shall come
the new heir of the inheritance.

Adullam the glory of Israel--so called as being superior in situation;
when it and the neighboring cities fell, Israel's glory was gone.
MAURER, as the Margin, translates, "the glory of Israel" (her chief
citizens: answering to "thy delicate children," [Mic
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016).md) "shall come in flight to
Adullam." English Version better preserves the parallelism, "the heir"
in the first clause answering to "he" in the second.

[Micah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 1:16</span></span>

Make thee bald, &c.--a token of deep mourning ([Ezr
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003.md); [Job
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020).md). Mourn, O land, for thy darling
children.

poll--shave off thy hair.

enlarge thy baldness--Mourn grievously. The land is compared to a mother
weeping for her children.

as the eagle--the bald eagle, or the dark-winged vulture. In the
moulting season all eagles are comparatively bald (compare [Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005).md).
