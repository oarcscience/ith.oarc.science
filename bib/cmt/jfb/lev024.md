### [Leviticus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 24:2</span></span>

OIL FOR THE LAMPS. (Lev. 24:1-23)

Command the children of Israel--This is the repetition of a law
previously given ([Exo 27:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020).md).

pure oil olive beaten--or cold-drawn, which is always of great purity.

[Leviticus 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 24:3</span></span>

Aaron shall order it from the evening unto the morning--The daily
presence of the priests was necessary to superintend the cleaning and
trimming.

[Leviticus 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 24:4</span></span>

upon the pure candlestick--so called because of pure gold. This was
symbolical of the light which ministers are to diffuse through the
Church.

[Leviticus 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 24:5</span></span>

take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes--for the showbread, as previously
appointed ([Exo 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030).md). Those cakes
were baked by the Levites, the flour being furnished by the people ([Ch1
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#032.md); [Ch1
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#029).md), oil, wine, and salt being the
other ingredients ([Lev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#013).md).

two tenth deals--that is, of an ephah--thirteen and a half pounds weight
each; and on each row or pile of cakes some frankincense was strewed,
which, being burnt, led to the showbread being called "an offering made
by fire." Every Sabbath a fresh supply was furnished; hot loaves were
placed on the altar instead of the stale ones, which, having lain a
week, were removed, and eaten only by the priests, except in cases of
necessity ([Sa1 21:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#003.md); also [Luk
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#003).md).

[Leviticus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 24:10</span></span>

the son of an Israelitish woman, &c.--This passage narrates the
enactment of a new law, with a detail of the circumstances which gave
rise to it. The "mixed multitude" \[[Exo
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md)\] that accompanied the
Israelites in their exodus from Egypt creates a presumption that
marriage connections of the kind described were not infrequent. And it
was most natural, in the relative circumstances of the two people, that
the father should be an Egyptian and the mother an Israelite.

[Leviticus 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 24:11</span></span>

And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord--A youth
of this half-blood, having quarrelled with an Israelite \[[Lev
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#010.md)\], vented his rage in some
horrid form of impiety. It was a common practice among the Egyptians to
curse their idols when disappointed in obtaining the object of their
petitions. The Egyptian mind of this youth thought the greatest insult
to his opponent was to blaspheme the object of his religious reverence.
He spoke disrespectfully of One who sustained the double character of
the King as well as the God of the Hebrew people; as the offense was a
new one, he was put in ward till the mind of the Lord was ascertained as
to his disposal.

[Leviticus 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 24:14</span></span>

Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp--All executions took
place without the camp; and this arrangement probably originated in the
idea that, as the Israelites were to be "a holy people" \[[Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md), [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md); [Deu
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019.md); [Deu
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009.md)\], all flagrant offenders should
be thrust out of their society.

let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, &c.--The
imposition of hands formed a public and solemn testimony against the
crime, and at the same time made the punishment legal.

[Leviticus 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 24:16</span></span>

as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he
blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death--Although
strangers were not obliged to be circumcised, yet by joining the
Israelitish camp, they became amenable to the law, especially that which
related to blasphemy.

[Leviticus 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 24:17</span></span>

he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death--These verses
contain a repetition of some other laws, relating to offenses of a
social nature, the penalties for which were to be inflicted, not by the
hand of private parties, but through the medium of the judges before
whom the cause was brought.

[Leviticus 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 24:23</span></span>

the children of Israel did as the Lord's commanded--The chapter closes
with the execution of Shelomith's son \[[Lev
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md)\] --and stoning having
afterwards become the established punishment in all cases of blasphemy,
it illustrates the fate of Stephen, who suffered under a false
imputation of that crime \[[Act
7:58-59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md)\].
