### [Psalms Chapter 106](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001)

[Psalms 106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 106:1</span></span>

This Psalm gives a detailed confession of the sins of Israel in all
periods of their history, with special reference to the terms of the
covenant as intimated ([Psa 105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045)).
It is introduced by praise to God for the wonders of His mercy, and
concluded by a supplication for His favor to His afflicted people, and a
doxology. (Psa. 106:1-48)

Praise, &c.--(See on [Psa 104:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#035)),
begins and ends the Psalm, intimating the obligations of praise, however
we sin and suffer [Ch1 16:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034) is the
source from which the beginning and end of this Psalm are derived.

[Psalms 106:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 106:2</span></span>

His acts exceed our comprehension, as His praise our powers of
expression ([Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)). Their
unutterable greatness is not to keep us back, but to urge us the more to
try to praise Him as best we can ([Psa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005); [Psa
71:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#015)).

[Psalms 106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 106:3</span></span>

The blessing is limited to those whose principles and acts are right.
How "blessed" Israel would be now, if he had "observed God's statutes"
([Psa 105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045)).

[Psalms 106:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 106:4</span></span>

In view of the desert of sins to be confessed, the writer invokes God's
covenant mercy to himself and the Church, in whose welfare he rejoices.
The speaker, me, I, is not the Psalmist himself, but the people, the
present generation (compare [Psa
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006)).

visit--(Compare [Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)).

[Psalms 106:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 106:5</span></span>

see the good--participate in it ([Psa
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013)).

thy chosen--namely, Israel, God's elect ([Isa
43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020); [Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004)). As God seems to have forgotten
them, they pray that He would "remember" them with the favor which
belongs to His own people, and which once they had enjoyed.

thine inheritance-- ([Deu 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009)).

[Psalms 106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 106:6</span></span>

Compare [Kg1 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#047); [Dan
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005), where the same three verbs occur
in the same order and connection, the original of the two later passages
being the first one, the prayer of Solomon in dedicating the temple.

sinned . . . fathers--like them, and so partaking of their guilt. The
terms denote a rising gradation of sinning (compare [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)).

with our fathers--we and they together forming one mass of corruption.

[Psalms 106:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 106:7</span></span>

Special confession. Their rebellion at the sea ([Exo
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011)) was because they had not
remembered nor understood God's miracles on their behalf. That God saved
them in their unbelief was of His mere mercy, and for His own glory.

the sea . . . the Red Sea--the very words in which Moses' song
celebrated the scene of Israel's deliverance ([Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004)). Israel began to rebel against
God at the very moment and scene of its deliverance by God!

[Psalms 106:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 106:8</span></span>

for his name's sake-- ([Eze 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014)).

[Psalms 106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 106:9</span></span>

rebuked-- ([Psa 104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007)).

as through the wilderness-- ([Isa
63:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011)).

[Psalms 106:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 106:12</span></span>

believed . . . his words--This is said not to praise the Israelites, but
God, who constrained even so unbelieving a people momentarily to
"believe" while in immediate view of His wonders, a faith which they
immediately afterwards lost ([Psa
106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013); [Exo
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031); [Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001)).

[Psalms 106:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 106:13</span></span>

The faith induced by God's display of power in their behalf was short
lived, and their new rebellion and temptation was visited by God with
fresh punishment, inflicted by leaving them to the result of their own
gratified appetites, and sending on them spiritual poverty ([Num
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#018)).

They soon forgat--literally, "They hasted, they forgat" (compare [Exo
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#008)). "They have turned aside quickly
(or, hastily) out of the way." The haste of our desires is such that we
can scarcely allow God one day. Unless He immediately answers our call,
instantly then arise impatience, and at length despair.

his works-- ([Deu 11:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#003); [Dan
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014)).

his counsel--They waited not for the development of God's counsel, or
plan for their deliverance, at His own time, and in His own way.

[Psalms 106:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 106:14</span></span>

Literally, "lusted a lust" (quoted from [Num
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004), Margin). Previously, there had
been impatience as to necessaries of life; here it is lusting ([Psa
78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018)).

[Psalms 106:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 106:15</span></span>

but sent leanness--rather, "and sent," that is, and thus, even in doing
so, the punishment was inflicted at the very time their request was
granted. So [Psa 78:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#030), "While their
meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them."

soul--the animal soul, which craves for food ([Num
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#006); [Psa
107:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#018)). This soul got its wish, and
with it and in it its own punishment. The place was therefore called
Kibroth-hattaavah, "the graves of lust" \[[Num
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034)\], because there they buried the
people who had lusted. Animal desires when gratified mostly give only a
hungry craving for more ([Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)).

[Psalms 106:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 106:16</span></span>

All the congregation took part with Dathan, Korah, &c., and their
accomplices ([Num 16:41](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#041)).

Aaron the saint--literally, "the holy one," as consecrated priest; not a
moral attribute, but one designating his office as holy to the Lord. The
rebellion was followed by a double punishment: (1) of the non-Levitical
rebels, the Reubenites, Dathan and Abiram, &c. ([Deu
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#006); [Num
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010)); these were swallowed up by the
earth.

[Psalms 106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 106:17</span></span>

covered--"closed upon them" ([Num
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#033)). (2) Of the Levitical rebels,
with Korah at their head ([Num 16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035);
[Num 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010)); these had sinned by fire,
and were punished by fire, as Aaron's (being high priest) sons had been
([Lev 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002); Num. 16:1-35).

[Psalms 106:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 106:19</span></span>

From indirect setting God at naught, they pass to direct.

made--though prohibited in [Exo 20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004)
to make a likeness, even of the true God.

calf--called so in contempt. They would have made an ox or bull, but
their idol turned out but a calf; an imitation of the divine symbols,
the cherubim; or of the sacred bull of Egyptian idolatry. The idolatry
was more sinful in view of their recent experience of God's power in
Egypt and His wonders at Sinai ([Exo
32:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001)). Though intending to worship
Jehovah under the symbol of the calf, yet as this was incompatible with
His nature ([Deu 4:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)), they in
reality gave up Him, and so were given up by Him. Instead of the Lord of
heaven, they had as their glory the image of an ox that does nothing but
eat grass.

[Psalms 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 106:23</span></span>

he said--namely, to Moses ([Deu 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#013)).
With God, saying is as certain as doing; but His purpose, while full of
wrath against sin, takes into account the mediation of Him of whom Moses
was the type ([Exo 32:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011); [Deu
9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#018)).

Moses his chosen--that is, to be His servant (compare [Psa
105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026)).

in the breach--as a warrior covers with his body the broken part of a
wall or fortress besieged, a perilous place ([Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005); [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030)).

to turn away--or, "prevent"

his wrath-- ([Num 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038)).

[Psalms 106:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 106:24</span></span>

The sin of refusing to invade Canaan, "the pleasant land" ([Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019); [Eze
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006); [Dan
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009)), "the land of beauty," was
punished by the destruction of that generation ([Num
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#028)), and the threat of dispersion
([Deu 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#025); [Deu
28:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#032)) afterwards made to their
posterity, and fulfilled in the great calamities now bewailed, may have
also been then added.

despised-- ([Num 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#031)).

believed not his word--by which He promised He would give them the land;
but rather the word of the faithless spies (compare [Psa
78:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#022)).

[Psalms 106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 106:26</span></span>

lifted up his hand--or, "swore," the usual form of swearing (compare
[Num 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030), Margin).

[Psalms 106:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 106:27</span></span>

To overthrow--literally, "To make them fall"; alluding to the words
([Num 14:39](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#039)).

among . . . nations . . . lands--The "wilderness" was not more
destructive to the fathers ([Psa
106:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#026)) than residence among the
heathen ("nations") shall be to the children. [Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033), [Lev
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038) is here, before the Psalmist's
mind, the determination against the "seed" when rebellious, being not
expressed in [Num 14:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#031), but
implied in the determination against the fathers.

[Psalms 106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 106:28</span></span>

sacrifices of the dead--that is, of lifeless idols, contrasted with "the
living God" ([Jer 10:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#003); compare
[Psa 115:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#004); [Co1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002)). On the words,

joined themselves to Baal-peor--see [Num
25:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002), [Num
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005).

Baal-peor--that is, the possessor of Peor, the mountain on which
Chemosh, the idol of Moab, was worshipped, and at the foot of which
Israel at the time lay encamped ([Num
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028)). The name never occurs except
in connection with that locality and that circumstance.

[Psalms 106:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 106:29</span></span>

provoked--excited grief and indignation ([Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007); [Psa
78:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058)).

[Psalms 106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 106:30</span></span>

stood--as Aaron "stood between the living and the dead, and the plague
was stayed" ([Num 16:48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048)).

executed judgment--literally, "judged," including sentence and act.

[Psalms 106:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 106:31</span></span>

counted . . . righteousness--"a just and rewardable action."

for--or, "unto," to the procuring of righteousness, as in [Rom
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002); [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004). Here it was a particular act,
not faith, nor its object Christ; and what was procured was not
justifying righteousness, or what was to be rewarded with eternal life;
for no one act of man's can be taken for complete obedience. But it was
that which God approved and rewarded with a perpetual priesthood to him
and his descendants ([Num 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013); [Ch1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004), &c.).

[Psalms 106:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 106:32</span></span>

(Compare [Num 20:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#003); [Deu
1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037); [Deu
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026)).

went ill with--literally, "was bad for"

Moses--His conduct, though under great provocation, was punished by
exclusion from Canaan.

[Psalms 106:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 106:34</span></span>

They not only failed to expel the heathen, as God

commanded-- ([Exo 23:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032)),
literally, "said (they should)," but conformed to their idolatries
\[[Psa 106:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#036)\], and thus became
spiritual adulterers ([Psa 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027)).

[Psalms 106:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 106:37</span></span>

unto devils--Septuagint, "demons" (compare [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020)), or "evil spirits."

[Psalms 106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 106:38</span></span>

polluted with blood--literally, "blood," or "murder" ([Psa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006); [Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009)).

[Psalms 106:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 106:40</span></span>

Those nations first seduced and then oppressed them (compare [Jdg
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#034); [Jdg
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014); [Jdg
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#030)). Their apostasies ungratefully
repaid God's many mercies till He finally abandoned them to punishment
([Lev 26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039)).

[Psalms 106:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 106:44</span></span>

If, as is probable, this Psalm was written at the time of the captivity,
the writer now intimates the tokens of God's returning favor.

[Psalms 106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 106:45</span></span>

repented--(compare [Psa 90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013)).

[Psalms 106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 106:46</span></span>

made . . . pitied-- ([Kg1 8:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#050); [Dan
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#009)). These tokens encourage the
prayer and the promise of praise ([Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004)), which is well closed by a
doxology.
