### [Matthew Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 23:1</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES--LAMENTATION OVER JERUSALEM,
AND FAREWELL TO THE TEMPLE. ( = [Mar
12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md); [Luk
20:45-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045)). (Mat. 23:1-39.md)

Then spake Jesus to the multitude--to the multitudes, "and to his
disciples."

[Matthew 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 23:2</span></span>

Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit--The Jewish teachers stood to
read, but sat to expound the Scriptures, as will be seen by comparing
[Luk 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016.md) with [Mat
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#020.md).

in Moses' seat--that is, as interpreters of the law given by Moses.

[Matthew 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 23:3</span></span>

All therefore--that is, all which, as sitting in that seat and teaching
out of that law.

they bid you observe, that observe and do--The word "therefore" is thus,
it will be seen, of great importance, as limiting those injunctions
which He would have them obey to what they fetched from the law itself.
In requiring implicit obedience to such injunctions, He would have them
to recognize the authority with which they taught over and above the
obligations of the law itself--an important principle truly; but He who
denounced the traditions of such teachers ([Mat
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003).md) cannot have meant here to throw
His shield over these. It is remarked by WEBSTER and WILKINSON that the
warning to beware of the scribes is given by Mark and Luke ([Mar
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md); [Luk
20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046).md) without any qualification: the
charge to respect and obey them being reported by Matthew alone,
indicating for whom this Gospel was especially written, and the writer's
desire to conciliate the Jews.

[Matthew 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 23:4</span></span>

For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on
men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them--"touch them
not" ([Luk 11:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#046).md).

with one of their fingers--referring not so much to the irksomeness of
the legal rites, though they were irksome enough ([Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md), as to the heartless rigor with
which they were enforced, and by men of shameless inconsistency.

[Matthew 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 23:5</span></span>

But all their works they do for to be seen of men--Whatever good they
do, or zeal they show, has but one motive--human applause.

they make broad their phylacteries--strips of parchment with
Scripture--texts on them, worn on the forehead, arm, and side, in time
of prayer.

and enlarge the borders of their garments--fringes of their upper
garments ([Num 15:37-40](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#037).md).

[Matthew 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 23:6</span></span>

And love the uppermost rooms at feasts--The word "room" is now obsolete
in the sense here intended. It should be "the uppermost place," that is,
the place of highest honor.

and the chief seats in the synagogues. See on [Luk
14:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md).

[Matthew 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 23:7</span></span>

And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi--It
is the spirit rather than the letter of this that must be pressed;
though the violation of the letter, springing from spiritual pride, has
done incalculable evil in the Church of Christ. The reiteration of the
word "Rabbi" shows how it tickled the ear and fed the spiritual pride of
those ecclesiastics.

[Matthew 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 23:8</span></span>

But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Master--your Guide, your
Teacher.

[Matthew 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 23:9</span></span>

And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
which is in heaven, &c.--To construe these injunctions into a
condemnation of every title by which Church rulers may be distinguished
from the flock which they rule, is virtually to condemn that rule
itself; and accordingly the same persons do both--but against the whole
strain of the New Testament and sound Christian judgment. But when we
have guarded ourselves against these extremes, let us see to it that we
retain the full spirit of this warning against that itch for
ecclesiastical superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of
Christ's ministers in every age. (On the use of the word "Christ" here,
see on [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001).md).

[Matthew 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 23:11</span></span>

But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant--This plainly
means, "shall show that he is so by becoming your servant"; as in [Mat
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#027.md), compared with [Mar
10:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#044.md).

[Matthew 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 23:12</span></span>

And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased--See on [Luk
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014.md). What follows was addressed more
immediately to the scribes and Pharisees.

[Matthew 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 23:13</span></span>

But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the
kingdom of heaven against men--Here they are charged with shutting
heaven against men: in [Luk 11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052.md) they
are charged with what was worse, taking away the key--"the key of
knowledge"--which means, not the key to open knowledge, but knowledge as
the only key to open heaven. A right knowledge of God's revealed word is
eternal life, as our Lord says ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md); [Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039).md); but this they took away from
the people, substituting for it their wretched traditions.

[Matthew 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 23:14</span></span>

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows'
houses, &c.--Taking advantage of the helpless condition and confiding
character of "widows," they contrived to obtain possession of their
property, while by their "long prayers" they made them believe they were
raised far above "filthy lucre." So much "the greater damnation" awaits
them. What a lifelike description of the Romish clergy, the true
successors of those scribes!

[Matthew 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 23:15</span></span>

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and
land to make one proselyte--from heathenism. We have evidence of this in
JOSEPHUS.

and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
yourselves--condemned, for the hypocrisy he would learn to practice,
both by the religion he left and that he embraced.

[Matthew 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 23:16</span></span>

Woe unto you, ye blind guides--Striking expression this of the ruinous
effects of erroneous teaching. Our Lord, here and in some following
verses, condemns the subtle distinctions they made as to the sanctity of
oaths--distinctions invented only to promote their own avaricious
purposes.

which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing--He has
incurred no debt.

but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple--meaning not the
gold that adorned the temple itself, but the Corban, set apart for
sacred uses (see on [Mat 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005).md).

he is a debtor!--that is, it is no longer his own, even though the
necessities of the parent might require it. We know who the successors
of these men are.

but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty--It
should have been rendered, "he is a debtor," as in [Mat
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#016.md).

[Matthew 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 23:19</span></span>

Ye fools, and blind! for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that
sanctifieth the gift?--(See [Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037).md).

[Matthew 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 23:20</span></span>

Whose therefore shall swear by the altar, &c.--See on [Mat
5:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md).

[Matthew 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 23:23</span></span>

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of
mint and anise--rather, "dill," as in Margin.

and cummin--In Luke ([Luk 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042).md) it is
"and rue, and all manner of herbs." They grounded this practice on [Lev
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030.md), which they interpreted rigidly.
Our Lord purposely names the most trifling products of the earth as
examples of what they punctiliously exacted the tenth of.

and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and
faith--In Luke ([Luk 11:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#042).md) it is
"judgment, mercy, and the love of God"--the expression being probably
varied by our Lord Himself on the two different occasions. In both His
reference is to [Mic 6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md), where the
prophet makes all acceptable religion to consist of three
elements--"doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with our God";
which third element presupposes and comprehends both the "faith" of
Matthew and the "love" of Luke. See on [Mar
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029.md); [Mar
12:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md). The same tendency to merge
greater duties in less besets even the children of God; but it is the
characteristic of hypocrites.

these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone--There is
no need for one set of duties to jostle out another; but it is to be
carefully noted that of the greater duties our Lord says, "Ye ought to
have done" them, while of the lesser He merely says, "Ye ought not to
leave them undone."

[Matthew 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 23:24</span></span>

Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat--The proper rendering--as in the
older English translations, and perhaps our own as it came from the
translators' hands--evidently is, "strain out." It was the custom, says
TRENCH, of the stricter Jews to strain their wine, vinegar, and other
potables through linen or gauze, lest unawares they should drink down
some little unclean insect therein and thus transgress ([Lev
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#020.md), [Lev
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#023.md), [Lev
11:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#041).md) --just as the Buddhists do
now in Ceylon and Hindustan--and to this custom of theirs our Lord here
refers.

and swallow a camel--the largest animal the Jews knew, as the "gnat" was
the smallest; both were by the law unclean.

[Matthew 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 23:25</span></span>

within they are full of extortion--In Luke ([Luk
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#039).md) the same word is rendered
"ravening," that is, "rapacity."

[Matthew 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 23:26</span></span>

Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and
platter, that the outside of them may be clean also--In Luke ([Luk
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#040).md) it is, "Ye fools, did not He
that made that which is without make that which is within also?"--"He to
whom belongs the outer life, and of right demands its subjection to
Himself, is the inner man less His?" A remarkable example this of our
Lord's power of drawing the most striking illustrations of great truths
from the most familiar objects and incidents in life. To these words,
recorded by Luke, He adds the following, involving a principle of
immense value: "But rather give alms of such things as ye have, and
behold, all things are clean unto you" ([Luk
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041).md). As the greed of these
hypocrites was one of the most prominent features of their character
([Luk 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#014).md), our Lord bids them
exemplify the opposite character, and then their outside, ruled by this,
would be beautiful in the eye of God, and their meals would be eaten
with clean hands, though much fouled with the business of this everyday
world. (See [Ecc 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007).md).

[Matthew 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 23:27</span></span>

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited
sepulchres--or, whitewashed sepulchres. (Compare [Act
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003).md). The process of whitewashing the
sepulchres, as LIGHTFOOT says, was performed on a certain day every
year, not for ceremonial cleansing, but., as the following words seem
rather to imply, to beautify them.

which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's
bones, and of all uncleanness--What a powerful way of conveying the
charge, that with all their fair show their hearts were full of
corruption! (Compare [Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009.md); [Rom
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013).md). But our Lord, stripping off the
figure, next holds up their iniquity in naked colors.

Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of
them which killed the prophets--that is "ye be witnesses that ye have
inherited, and voluntarily served yourselves heirs to, the truth-hating,
prophet-killing, spirit of your fathers." Out of pretended respect and
honor, they repaired and beautified the sepulchres of the prophets, and
with whining hypocrisy said, "If we had been in their days, how
differently should we have treated these prophets?" While all the time
they were witnesses to themselves that they were the children of them
that killed the prophets, convicting themselves daily of as exact a
resemblance in spirit and character to the very classes over whose deeds
they pretended to mourn, as child to parent. In [Luk
11:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#044.md) our Lord gives another turn to
this figure of a grave: "Ye are as graves which appear not, and the men
that walk over them are not aware of them." As one might unconsciously
walk over a grave concealed from view, and thus contract ceremonial
defilement, so the plausible exterior of the Pharisees kept people from
perceiving the pollution they contracted frown coming in contact with
such corrupt characters.

[Matthew 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 23:33</span></span>

Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of
hell?--In thus, at the end of His ministry, recalling the words of the
Baptist at the outset of his, our Lord would seem to intimate that the
only difference between their condemnation now and then was, that now
they were ripe for their doom, which they were not then.

[Matthew 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 23:34</span></span>

Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
scribes--The I here is emphatic: "I am sending," that is, "am about to
send." In [Luk 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049.md) the variation is
remarkable: "Therefore also, said the wisdom of God, I will send them,"
&c. What precisely is meant by "the wisdom of God" here, is somewhat
difficult to determine. To us it appears to be simply an announcement of
a purpose of the Divine Wisdom, in the high style of ancient prophecy,
to send a last set of messengers whom the people would reject, and
rejecting, would fill up the cup of their iniquity. But, whereas in Luke
it is "I, the Wisdom of God, will send them," in Matthew it is "I,
Jesus, am sending them"; language only befitting the one sender of all
the prophets, the Lord God of Israel now in the flesh. They are
evidently evangelical messengers, but called by the familiar Jewish
names of "prophets, wise men, and scribes," whose counterparts were the
inspired and gifted servants of the Lord Jesus; for in Luke ([Luk
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049).md) it is "prophets and apostles."

unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the
temple and the altar--As there is no record of any fresh murder
answering to this description, probably the allusion is not to any
recent murder, but to [Ch2 24:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md),
as the last recorded and most suitable case for illustration. And as
Zacharias' last words were, "The Lord require it," so they are here
warned that of that generation it should be required.

[Matthew 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 23:36</span></span>

Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
generation--As it was only in the last generation of them that "the
iniquity of the Amorites was full" ([Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md), and then the abominations of
ages were at once completely and awfully avenged, so the iniquity of
Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age till in that generation
it came to the full, and the whole collected vengeance of heaven broke
at once over its devoted head. In the first French Revolution the same
awful principle was exemplified, and Christendom has not done with it
yet.

Lamentation over Jerusalem and Farewell to the Temple ([Mat
23:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md).

[Matthew 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 23:37</span></span>

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
which are sent unto thee, &c.--How ineffably grand and melting is this
apostrophe! It is the very heart of God pouring itself forth through
human flesh and speech. It is this incarnation of the innermost life and
love of Deity, pleading with men, bleeding for them, and ascending only
to open His arms to them and win them back by the power of this story of
matchless love, that has conquered the world, that will yet "draw all
men unto Him," and beautify and ennoble Humanity itself! "Jerusalem"
here does not mean the mere city or its inhabitants; nor is it to be
viewed merely as the metropolis of the nation, but as the center of
their religious life--"the city of their solemnities, whither the tribes
went up, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord"; and at this moment
it was full of them. It is the whole family of God, then, which is here
apostrophized by a name dear to every Jew, recalling to him all that was
distinctive and precious in his religion. The intense feeling that
sought vent in this utterance comes out first in the redoubling of the
opening word--"Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" but, next, in the picture of it
which He draws--"that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are
sent unto thee!"--not content with spurning God's messages of mercy,
that canst not suffer even the messengers to live! When He adds, "How
often would I have gathered thee!" He refers surely to something beyond
the six or seven times that He visited and taught in Jerusalem while on
earth. No doubt it points to "the prophets," whom they "killed," to
"them that were sent unto her," whom they "stoned." But whom would He
have gathered so often? "Thee," truth-hating, mercy-spurning,
prophet-killing Jerusalem--how often would I have gathered thee! Compare
with this that affecting clause in the great ministerial commission,
"that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name
among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem!" ([Luk
24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047).md). What encouragement to the
heartbroken at their own long-continued and obstinate rebellion! But we
have not yet got at the whole heart of this outburst. I would have
gathered thee, He says, "even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings." Was ever imagery so homely invested with such grace and such
sublimity as this, at our Lord's touch? And yet how exquisite the figure
itself--of protection, rest, warmth, and all manner of conscious
well-being in those poor, defenseless, dependent little creatures, as
they creep under and feel themselves overshadowed by the capacious and
kindly wing of the mother bird! If, wandering beyond hearing of her
peculiar call, they are overtaken by a storm or attacked by an enemy,
what can they do but in the one case droop and die, and in the other
submit to be torn in pieces? But if they can reach in time their place
of safety, under the mother's wing, in vain will any enemy try to drag
them thence. For rising into strength, kindling into fury, and
forgetting herself entirely in her young, she will let the last drop of
her blood be shed out and perish in defense of her precious charge,
rather than yield them to an enemy's talons. How significant all this of
what Jesus is and does for men! Under His great Mediatorial wing would
He have "gathered" Israel. For the figure, see [Deu
32:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md); [Rut
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#012.md); [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Psa
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#007.md); [Psa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#004.md); [Psa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#007.md); [Psa
91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004.md); [Isa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#005.md); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md). The ancient rabbins had a
beautiful expression for proselytes from the heathen--that they had
"come under the wings of the Shekinah." For this last word, see on [Mat
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038.md). But what was the result of all
this tender and mighty love? The answer is, "And ye would not." O
mysterious word! mysterious the resistance of such patient
Love-mysterious the liberty of self-undoing! The awful dignity of the
will, as here expressed, might make the ears to tingle.

[Matthew 23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 23:38</span></span>

Behold, your house--the temple, beyond all doubt; but their house now,
not the Lord's. See on [Mat 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007.md).

is left unto you desolate--deserted, that is, of its Divine Inhabitant.
But who is that? Hear the next words:

[Matthew 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 23:39</span></span>

For I say unto you--and these were His last words to the impenitent
nation, see on [Mar 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md), opening
remarks.

Ye shall not see me henceforth--What? Does Jesus mean that He was
Himself the Lord of the temple, and that it became "deserted" when HE
finally left it? It is even so. Now is thy fate sealed, O Jerusalem, for
the glory is departed from thee! That glory, once visible in the holy of
holies, over the mercy seat, when on the day of atonement the blood of
typical expiation was sprinkled on it and in front of it--called by the
Jews the Shekinah, or the Dwelling, as being the visible pavilion of
Jehovah--that glory, which Isaiah ([Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md) saw in vision, the beloved
disciple says was the glory of Christ ([Joh
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#041).md). Though it was never visible in
the second temple, Haggai foretold that "the glory of that latter house
should be greater than of the former" ([Hag
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#009).md) because "the Lord whom they
sought was suddenly to come to His temple" ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md), not in a mere bright cloud, but
enshrined in living humanity! Yet brief as well as "sudden" was the
manifestation to be: for the words He was now uttering were to be HIS
VERY LAST within its precincts.

till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord--that is, till those "Hosannas to the Son of David" with which the
multitude had welcomed Him into the city--instead of "sore displeasing
the chief priests and scribes" ([Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015).md) --should break forth from the
whole nation, as their glad acclaim to their once pierced, but now
acknowledged, Messiah. That such a time will come is clear from [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md); [Co2
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md), &c. In what sense they shall
then "see Him" may be gathered from [Zac
2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md); [Eze
37:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023.md); [Eze
39:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#028.md), &c.
