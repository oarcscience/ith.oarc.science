### [Psalms Chapter 96](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001)

[Psalms 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 96:1</span></span>

The substance of this Psalm, and portions of the ninety-seventh,
ninety-eighth, and hundredth, are found in 1Ch. 16:7-36, which was used
by David's directions in the dedication of the tabernacle on Mount Zion.
The dispensation of the Messiah was typified by that event, involving,
as it did, a more permanent seat of worship, and the introduction of
additional and more spiritual services. Hence the language of these
Psalms may be regarded as having a higher import than that pertinent to
the occasion on which it was thus publicly used. ([Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001))

All nations are invited to unite in this most joyful praise.

new song--literally, "fresh," or new mercies ([Psa
33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003); [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 96:4</span></span>

For He is not a local God, but of universal agency, while idols are
nothing.

[Psalms 96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 96:6</span></span>

Honour and majesty--are His attendants, declared in His mighty works,
while power and grace are specially seen in His spiritual relations to
His people.

[Psalms 96:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 96:7</span></span>

Give--or, "ascribe" ([Psa 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)) due

[Psalms 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 96:10</span></span>

Let all know that the government of the world is ordered in justice, and
they shall enjoy firm and lasting peace (compare [Psa
72:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#003), [Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007); [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)).

[Psalms 96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 96:11</span></span>

For which reason the universe is invoked to unite in joy, and even
inanimate nature ([Rom 8:14-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014)) is
poetically represented as capable of joining in the anthem of praise.
