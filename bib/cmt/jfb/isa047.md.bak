### [Isaiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 47:1</span></span>

THE DESTRUCTION OF BABYLON IS REPRESENTED UNDER THE IMAGE OF A ROYAL
VIRGIN BROUGHT DOWN IN A MOMENT FROM HER MAGNIFICENT THRONE TO THE
EXTREME OF DEGRADATION. (Isa. 47:1-15)

in the dust--(See on [Isa 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md); [Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md).

virgin--that is, heretofore uncaptured \[HERODOTUS, 1.191\].

daughter of Babylon--Babylon and its inhabitants (see on [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008.md); [Isa
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022).md).

no throne--The seat of empire was transferred to Shushan. Alexander
intended to have made Babylon his seat of empire, but Providence
defeated his design. He soon died; and Seleucia, being built near,
robbed it of its inhabitants, and even of its name, which was applied to
Seleucia.

delicate--alluding to the effeminate debauchery and prostitution of all
classes at banquets and religious rites \[CURTIUS, 5.1; HERODOTUS,
1.199; BARUCH, 6.43\].

[Isaiah 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 47:2</span></span>

millstones--like the querns or hand-mills, found in this country, before
the invention of water mills and windmills: a convex stone, made by the
hand to turn in a concave stone, fitted to receive it, the corn being
ground between them: the office of a female slave in the East; most
degrading ([Job 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010.md); [Mat
24:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#041).md).

uncover thy locks--rather, "take off thy veil" \[HORSLEY\]: perhaps the
removal of the plaited hair worn round the women's temples is included;
it, too, is a covering ([Co1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#015).md);
to remove it and the veil is the badge of the lowest female degradation;
in the East the head is the seat of female modesty; the face of a woman
is seldom, the whole head almost never, seen bare (see on [Isa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008).md).

make bare the leg--rather "lift up (literally, 'uncover'; as in lifting
up the train the leg is uncovered) thy flowing train." In Mesopotamia,
women of low rank, as occasion requires, wade across the rivers with
stript legs, or else entirely put off their garments and swim across.
"Exchange thy rich, loose, queenly robe, for the most abject condition,
that of one going to and fro through rivers as a slave, to draw water,"
&c.

uncover . . . thigh--gather up the robe, so as to wade across.

[Isaiah 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 47:3</span></span>

not meet . . . as a man--rather, "I will not meet a man," that is,
suffer man to intercede with me--give man an audience \[HORSLEY\]. Or,
"I will not make peace with any man," before all are destroyed.
Literally, "strike a league with"; a phrase arising from the custom of
striking hands together in making a compact \[MAURER\], (see on [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md); [Pro
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md); [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015), Margin.md). Or else from striking
the victims sacrificed in making treaties.

[Isaiah 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 47:4</span></span>

As for--rather supply, "Thus saith our Redeemer" \[MAURER\]. LOWTH
supposes this verse to be the exclamation of a chorus breaking in with
praises, "Our Redeemer! Jehovah of hosts," &c. ([Jer
50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034).md).

[Isaiah 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 47:5</span></span>

Sit--the posture of mourning ([Ezr
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004.md); [Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010).md).

darkness--mourning and misery ([Lam
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#002.md); [Mic
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008).md).

lady of kingdoms--mistress of the world ([Isa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 47:6</span></span>

reason for God's vengeance on Babylon: in executing God's will against
His people, she had done so with wanton cruelty ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), &c.; [Jer
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md); [Zac
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015).md).

polluted my inheritance-- ([Isa
43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028).md).

the ancient--Even old age was disregarded by the Chaldeans, who treated
all alike with cruelty ([Lam 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md);
[Lam 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012).md) \[ROSENMULLER\]. Or, "the
ancient" means Israel, worn out with calamities in the latter period of
its history ([Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004).md), as its
earlier stage of history is called its "youth" ([Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md); [Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060).md).

[Isaiah 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 47:7</span></span>

so that--Through thy vain expectation of being a queen for ever, thou
didst advance to such a pitch of insolence as not to believe "these
things" (namely, as to thy overthrow, [Isa
47:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001).md) possible.

end of it--namely, of thy insolence, implied in her words, "I shall be a
lady for ever."

[Isaiah 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 47:8</span></span>

given to pleasures--(See on [Isa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#001).md). In no city were there so many
incentives to licentiousness.

I am . . . none . . . beside me-- ([Isa
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010).md). Language of arrogance in man's
mouth; fitting for God alone ([Isa
45:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#006).md). See [Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md), latter part.

widow . . . loss of children--A state, represented as a female, when it
has fallen is called a widow, because its king is no more; and
childless, because it has no inhabitants; they having been carried off
as captives ([Isa 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md); [Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md), [Isa
54:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md); [Rev
18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 47:9</span></span>

in a moment--It should not decay slowly, but be suddenly and
unexpectedly destroyed; in a single night it was taken by Cyrus. The
prophecy was again literally fulfilled when Babylon revolted against
Darius; and, in order to hold out to the last, each man chose one woman
of his family, and strangled the rest, to save provisions. Darius
impaled three thousand of the revolters.

in . . . perfection--that is, "in full measure."

for . . . for--rather, "notwithstanding the . . . notwithstanding"; "in
spite of" \[LOWTH\]. So "for" ([Num
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#011).md). Babylon was famous for
"expiations or sacrifices, and other incantations, whereby they tried to
avert evil and obtain good" \[DIODORUS SICULUS\].

[Isaiah 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 47:10</span></span>

wickedness--as in [Isa 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#011.md), the
cruelty with which Babylon treated its subject states.

None seeth me-- ([Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md); [Psa
94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007).md). "There is none to exact
punishment from me." Sinners are not safe, though seeming secret.

Thy wisdom--astrological and political ([Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011), &c., as to Egypt.md).

perverted--turns thee aside from the right and safe path.

[Isaiah 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 47:11</span></span>

from whence it riseth--Hebrew, "the dawn thereof," that is, its first
rising. Evil shall come on thee without the least previous intimation
\[ROSENMULLER\]. But dawn is not applied to "evil," but to prosperity
shining out after misery ([Isa 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012).md).
Translate, "Thou shall not see any dawn" (of alleviation) \[MAURER\].

put . . . off--rather, as Margin, "remove by expiation"; it shall be
never ending.

not know--unawares: which thou dost not apprehend. Proving the fallacy
of thy divinations and astrology ([Job
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#005.md); [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 47:12</span></span>

Stand--forth: a scornful challenge to Babylon's magicians to show
whether they can defend their city.

laboured--The devil's service is a laborious yet fruitless one ([Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 47:13</span></span>

wearied--(compare [Isa 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md); [Eze
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#012).md).

astrologers--literally, those who form combinations of the heavens; who
watch conjunctions and oppositions of the stars. "Casters of the
configurations of the sky" \[HORSLEY\]. GESENIUS explains it: the
dividers of the heavens. In casting a nativity they observed four
signs:--the horoscope, or sign which arose at the time one was born; the
mid-heaven; the sign opposite the horoscope towards the west; and the
hypogee.

monthly prognosticators--those who at each new moon profess to tell
thereby what is about to happen. Join, not as English Version, "save . .
. from those things," &c.; but, "They that at new moons make known from
(by means of) them the things that shall come upon thee" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 47:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 47:14</span></span>

([Isa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030).md).

not . . . a coal--Like stubble, they shall burn to a dead ash, without
leaving a live coal or cinder (compare [Isa
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014).md), so utterly shall they be
destroyed.

[Isaiah 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 47:15</span></span>

Thus, &c.--Such shall be the fate of those astrologers who cost thee
such an amount of trouble and money.

thy merchants, from thy youth--that is, with whom thou hast trafficked
from thy earliest history, the foreigners sojourning in Babylon for the
sake of commerce ([Isa 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md); [Jer
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), [Jer
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md); [Nah
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016).md) \[BARNES\]. Rather, the
astrologers, with whom Babylon had so many dealings ([Isa
47:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012).md) \[HORSLEY\].

to his quarter--literally, "straight before him" ([Eze
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#009.md), [Jer
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016).md).
