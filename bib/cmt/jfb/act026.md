### [Acts Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

[Acts 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 26:1</span></span>

PAUL'S DEFENSE OF HIMSELF BEFORE KING AGRIPPA, WHO PRONOUNCES HIM
INNOCENT, BUT CONCLUDES THAT THE APPEAL TO CÃ†SAR MUST BE CARRIED OUT.
(Acts 26:1-32)

Agrippa said--Being a king he appears to have presided.

Paul stretched forth the hand--chained to a soldier ([Act
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md), and see on [Act
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006).md).

[Acts 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 26:3</span></span>

I know thee to be expert, &c.--His father was zealous for the law, and
he himself had the office of president of the temple and its treasures,
and the appointment of the high priest \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities,
20.1.3\].

hear me patiently--The idea of "indulgently" is also conveyed.

[Acts 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 26:4</span></span>

from my youth, which was at the first . . . at Jerusalem, know all the
Jews; which knew me from the beginning--plainly showing that he received
his education, even from early youth, at Jerusalem. See on [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md).

[Acts 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 26:5</span></span>

if they would--"were willing to"

testify--but this, of course, they were not, it being a strong point in
his favor.

after the most straitest--"the strictest."

sect--as the Pharisees confessedly were. This was said to meet the
charge, that as a Hellenistic Jew he had contracted among the heathen
lax ideas of Jewish peculiarities.

[Acts 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 26:6</span></span>

I . . . am judged for the hope of the promise made . . . to our
fathers--"for believing that the promise of Messiah, the Hope of the
Church ([Act 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032.md); [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020).md) has been fulfilled in Jesus of
Nazareth risen from the dead."

[Acts 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 26:7</span></span>

Unto which promise--the fulfilment of it.

our twelve tribes-- ([Jam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md); and see
on [Luk 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036).md).

instantly--"intently"; see on [Act
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md).

serving God--in the sense of religious worship; on "ministered," see on
[Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md).

day and night, hope to come--The apostle rises into language as catholic
as the thought--representing his despised nation, all scattered thought
it now was, as twelve great branches of one ancient stem, in all places
of their dispersion offering to the God of their fathers one unbroken
worship, reposing on one great "promise" made of old unto their fathers,
and sustained by one "hope" of "coming" to its fulfilment; the single
point of difference between him and his countrymen, and the one cause of
all their virulence against him, being, that his hope had found rest in
One already come, while theirs still pointed to the future.

For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews--"I am
accused of Jews, O king" (so the true reading appears to be); of all
quarters the most surprising for such a charge to come from. The charge
of sedition is not so much as alluded to throughout this speech. It was
indeed a mere pretext.

[Acts 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 26:8</span></span>

Why should it be thought a thing incredible . . . that God should raise
the dead?--rather, "Why is it judged a thing incredible if God raises
the dead?" the case being viewed as an accomplished fact. No one dared
to call in question the overwhelming evidence of the resurrection of
Jesus, which proclaimed Him to be the Christ, the Son of God; the only
way of getting rid of it, therefore, was to pronounce it incredible. But
why, asks the apostle, is it so judged? Leaving this pregnant question
to find its answer in the breasts of his audience, he now passes to his
personal history.

[Acts 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 26:9</span></span>

(See on [Act 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md), &c.; and compare
[Act 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004), &c..md)

[Acts 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 26:16</span></span>

But rise, &c.--Here the apostle appears to condense into one statement
various sayings of his Lord to him in visions at different times, in
order to present at one view the grandeur of the commission with which
his Master had clothed him \[ALFORD\].

a minister . . . both of these things which thou hast seen--putting him
on a footing with those "eye-witnesses and ministers of the word"
mentioned in [Luk 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md).

and of those in which I will appear to thee--referring to visions he was
thereafter to be favored with; such as [Act
18:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009.md); [Act
22:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011.md); [Co2
12:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001.md), &c. ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012).md).

[Acts 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 26:17</span></span>

Delivering thee from the people--the Jews.

and from the Gentiles--He was all along the object of Jewish malignity,
and was at that moment in the hands of the Gentiles; yet he calmly
reposes on his Master's assurances of deliverance from both, at the same
time taking all precautions for safety and vindicating all his legal
rights.

unto whom now I send thee--The emphatic "I" here denotes the authority
of the Sender \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 26:18</span></span>

To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light--rather,
"that they may turn" (as in [Act
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020).md), that is, as the effect of
their eyes being opened. The whole passage leans upon [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md) ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).md).

and from the power of Satan--Note the connection here between being
"turned from darkness" and "from the power of Satan," whose whole power
over men lies in keeping them in the dark: hence he is called "the ruler
of the darkness of this world." See on [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md).

that they may receive forgiveness . . . and inheritance among the
sanctified by faith that is in me--Note: Faith is here made the
instrument of salvation at once in its first stage, forgiveness, and its
last, admission to the home of the sanctified; and the faith which
introduces the soul to all this is emphatically declared by the
glorified Redeemer to rest upon Himself--"FAITH, even THAT WHICH IS IN
ME." And who that believes this can refrain from casting his crown
before Him or resist offering Him supreme worship?

[Acts 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 26:19</span></span>

Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision--This musical and elevated strain, which carries the reader along
with it, and doubtless did the hearers, bespeaks the lofty region of
thought and feeling to which the apostle had risen while rehearsing his
Master's communications to him from heaven.

[Acts 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 26:20</span></span>

showed . . . to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem--omitting Arabia;
because, beginning with the Jews, his object was to mention first the
places where his former hatred of the name of Christ was best known: the
mention of the Gentiles, so unpalatable to his audience, is reserved to
the last.

repent and return to God, and do works meet for repentance--a brief
description of conversion and its proper fruits, suggested, probably, by
the Baptist's teaching ([Luk 3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007).md).

[Acts 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 26:22</span></span>

having obtained help--"succor."

from God--"that \[which cometh\] from God."

I continue--"stand," "hold my ground."

unto this day, witnessing, &c.--that is, This life of mine, so
marvellously preserved, in spite of all the plots against it, is upheld
for the Gospel's sake; therefore I "witnessed," &c.

[Acts 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 26:23</span></span>

That Christ should suffer, &c.--The construction of this sentence
implies that in regard to the question "whether the Messiah is a
suffering one, and whether, rising first from the dead, he should show
light to the (Jewish) people and to the Gentiles," he had only said what
the prophets and Moses said should come.

[Acts 26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 26:24</span></span>

Festus said with a loud voice--surprised and bewildered.

Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad--"is
turning thy head." The union of flowing Greek, deep acquaintance with
the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and other
doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all, lofty
religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated, cold-hearted
skeptics of that day--may account for this sudden exclamation.

[Acts 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 26:25</span></span>

I am not mad, most noble Festus, but, &c.--Can anything surpass this
reply, for readiness, self-possession, calm dignity? Every word of it
refuted the rude charge, though Festus, probably, did not intend to hurt
the prisoner's feelings.

[Acts 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 26:26</span></span>

the king knoweth, &c.--(See on [Act
26:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001).md).

[Acts 26:27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 26:27</span></span>

believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest--The courage and
confidence here shown proceeded from a vivid persuasion of Agrippa's
knowledge of the facts and faith in the predictions which they verified;
and the king's reply is the highest testimony to the correctness of
these presumptions and the immense power of such bold yet courteous
appeals to conscience.

[Acts 26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 26:28</span></span>

Almost--or, "in a little time."

thou persuadest me to be a Christian--Most modern interpreters think the
ordinary translation inadmissible, and take the meaning to be, "Thou
thinkest to make me with little persuasion (or small trouble) a
Christian"--but I am not to be so easily turned. But the apostle's reply
can scarcely suit any but the sense given in our authorized version,
which is that adopted by CHRYSOSTOM and some of the best scholars since.
The objection on which so much stress is laid, that the word "Christian"
was at that time only a term of contempt, has no force except on the
other side; for taking it in that view, the sense is, "Thou wilt soon
have me one of that despised sect."

[Acts 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 26:29</span></span>

I would to God, &c.--What unequalled magnanimity does this speech
breathe! Only his Master ever towered above this.

not only . . . almost . . . but altogether--or, "whether soon or late,"
or "with little or much difficulty."

except these bonds--doubtless holding up his two chained hands (see on
[Act 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006).md): which in closing such a
noble utterance must have had an electrical effect.

[Acts 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 26:30</span></span>

when he had thus spoken, the king rose--not over-easy, we may be sure.

[Acts 26:32](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 26:32</span></span>

This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to
CÃ&brvbr;sar--It would seem from this that such appeals, once made,
behooved to be carried out.
