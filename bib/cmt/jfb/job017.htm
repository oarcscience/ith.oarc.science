<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001">Job 17:1</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">job 17:1</A></FONT></span></p>JOB'S ANSWER CONTINUED. (Job 17:1-16)
<p>
<p>breath . . . corrupt--result of elephantiasis. But UMBREIT, "my strength (spirit) is spent." 
<p>
<p>extinct--Life is compared to an expiring light. "The light of my day is extinguished." 
<p>
<p>graves--plural, to heighten the force.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002">Job 17:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 17:2</A></FONT></span></p>UMBREIT, more emphatically, "had I only not to endure mockery, in the midst of their contentions I (mine eye) would remain quiet." 
<p>
<p>eye continue--Hebrew, "tarry all night"; a figure taken from sleep at night, to express undisturbed rest; opposed to (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020">Job 16:20</A>), when the eye of Job is represented as pouring out tears to God without rest.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003">Job 17:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 17:3</A></FONT></span></p>Lay down now--namely, a pledge or security; that is, be my surety; do Thou attest my innocence, since my friends only mock me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002">Job 17:2</A>). Both litigating parties had to lay down a sum as security before the trial. 
<p>
<p>put me in a surety--Provide a surety for me (in the trial) with Thee. A presage of the "surety" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022">Heb 7:22</A>), or "one Mediator between God and man" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#021">Job 16:21</A>). 
<p>
<p>strike hands--"who else (save God Himself) could strike hands with me?" that is, be my security (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122">Psa 119:122</A>). The Hebrew strikes the hand of him for whom he goes security (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001">Pro 6:1</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#004">Job 17:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 17:4</A></FONT></span></p>their heart--The intellect of his friends. 
<p>
<p>shalt . . . exalt--Rather imperative, "exalt them not"; allow them not to conquer [UMBREIT], (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009">Isa 6:9-10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#005">Job 17:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 17:5</A></FONT></span></p>The Hebrew for "flattery" is "smoothness"; then it came to mean a prey divided by lot, because a smooth stone was used in casting the lots (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#008">Deu 18:8</A>), "a portion" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024">Gen 14:24</A>). Therefore translate, "He that delivers up his friend as a prey (which the conduct of my friends implies that they would do), even the eyes," &amp;c. [NOYES] (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#020">Job 11:20</A>). Job says this as to the sinner's children, retorting upon their reproach as to the cutting off of his (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004">Job 5:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030">Job 15:30</A>). This accords with the Old Testament dispensation of legal retribution (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Exo 20:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006">Job 17:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 17:6</A></FONT></span></p>He--God. The poet reverentially suppresses the name of God when speaking of calamities inflicted. 
<p>
<p>by-word-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037">Deu 28:37</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#011">Psa 69:11</A>). My awful punishment makes my name execrated everywhere, as if I must have been superlatively bad to have earned it. 
<p>
<p>aforetime . . . tabret--as David was honored (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006">Sa1 18:6</A>). Rather from a different Hebrew root, "I am treated to my face as an object of disgust," literally, "an object to be spit upon in the face" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#014">Num 12:14</A>). So Raca means (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022">Mat 5:22</A>) [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#007">Job 17:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 17:7</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007">Psa 6:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#009">Psa 31:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007">Deu 34:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>members--literally, "figures"; all the individual members being peculiar forms of the body; opposed to "shadow," which looks like a figure without solidity.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008">Job 17:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 17:8</A></FONT></span></p>astonied--at my unmerited sufferings. 
<p>
<p>against the hypocrite--The upright shall feel their sense of justice wounded ("will be indignant") because of the prosperity of the wicked. By "hypocrite" or "ungodly," he perhaps glances at his false friends.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#009">Job 17:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 17:9</A></FONT></span></p>The strength of religious principle is heightened by misfortune. The pious shall take fresh courage to persevere from the example of suffering Job. The image is from a warrior acquiring new courage in action (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030">Isa 40:30-31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014">Phi 1:14</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010">Job 17:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 17:10</A></FONT></span></p>return--If you have anything to advance really wise, though I doubt it, recommence your speech. For as yet I cannot find one wise man among you all.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011">Job 17:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 17:11</A></FONT></span></p>Only do not vainly speak of the restoration of health to me; for "my days are past." 
<p>
<p>broken off--as the threads of the web cut off from the loom (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012">Isa 38:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>thoughts--literally, "possessions," that is, all the feelings and fair hopes which my heart once nourished. These belong to the heart, as "purposes" to the understanding; the two together here describe the entire inner man.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#012">Job 17:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 17:12</A></FONT></span></p>They--namely, "my friends." 
<p>
<p>change the night into day--that is, would try to persuade me of the change of my misery into joy, which is impossible [UMBREIT] (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017">Job 11:17</A>); (but) the light of prosperity (could it be enjoyed) would be short because of the darkness of adversity. Or better for "short," the Hebrew "near"; "and the light of new prosperity should be near in the face of (before) the darkness of death"; that is, they would persuade me that light is near, even though darkness approaches.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#013">Job 17:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 17:13</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "if I wait for this grave (Sheol, or the unseen world) as my house, and make my bed in the darkness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014">Job 17:14</A>), and say to corruption," rather, "to the pit" or "grave," &amp;c. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015">Job 17:15</A>). Where then is my hope? [UMBREIT]. The apodosis is at <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015">Job 17:15</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#014">Job 17:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 17:14</A></FONT></span></p>Thou art my father, &amp;c.--expressing most intimate connection (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#004">Pro 7:4</A>). His diseased state made him closely akin to the grave and worm.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#015">Job 17:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 17:15</A></FONT></span></p>Who shall see it fulfilled? namely, the "hope" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#018">Job 11:18</A>) which they held out to him of restoration.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016">Job 17:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 17:16</A></FONT></span></p>They--namely, my hopes shall be buried with me. 
<p>
<p>bars-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010">Isa 38:10</A>). Rather, the wastes or solitudes of the pit (sheol, the unseen world). 
<p>
<p>rest together--the rest of me and my hope is in, &amp;c. Both expire together. The word "rest" implies that man's ceaseless hopes only rob him of rest.
