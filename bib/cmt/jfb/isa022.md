Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001)

[Isaiah 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 22:1</span></span>

PROPHECY AS TO AN ATTACK ON JERUSALEM. ([Isa
22:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001))

of . . . valley of vision--rather, "respecting the valley of visions";
namely, Jerusalem, the seat of divine revelations and visions, "the
nursery of prophets" \[JEROME\], ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003); [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001); [Eze
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#004), Margin; [Luk
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033)). It lay in a "valley"
surrounded by hills higher than Zion and Moriah ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002); [Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013)).

thee--the people of Jerusalem personified.

housetops--Panic-struck, they went up on the flat balustraded roofs to
look forth and see whether the enemy was near, and partly to defend
themselves from the roofs ([Jdg 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#051),
&c.).

[Isaiah 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 22:2</span></span>

art--rather, "wert"; for it could not now be said to be "a joyous city"
([Isa 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013)). The cause of their joy
([Isa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)) may have been because
Sennacherib had accepted Hezekiah's offer to renew the payment of
tribute, and they were glad to have peace on any terms, however
humiliating ([Kg2 18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014)), or on
account of the alliance with Egypt. If the reference be to Zedekiah's
time, the joy and feasting are not inapplicable, for this recklessness
was a general characteristic of the unbelieving Jews ([Isa
56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012)).

not slain with the sword--but with the famine and pestilence about to be
caused by the coming siege ([Lam 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009)).
MAURER refers this to the plague by which he thinks Sennacherib's army
was destroyed, and Hezekiah was made sick ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036); [Isa
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001)). But there is no authority for
supposing that the Jews in the city suffered such extremities of plague
at this time, when God destroyed their foes. BARNES refers it to those
slain in flight, not in open honorable "battle"; [Isa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#003) favors this.

[Isaiah 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 22:3</span></span>

rulers--rather, "generals" ([Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024); [Jdg
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#006), [Jdg
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#011)).

bound--rather, "are taken."

by the archers--literally, "by the bow"; so [Isa
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017). Bowmen were the light troops,
whose province it was to skirmish in front and ([Kg2
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#022)) pursue fugitives ([Kg2
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#005)); this verse applies better to
the attack of Nebuchadnezzar than that of Sennacherib.

all . . . in thee--all found in the city ([Isa
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#015)), not merely the "rulers" or
generals.

fled from far--those who had fled from distant parts to Jerusalem as a
place of safety; rather, fled afar.

[Isaiah 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 22:4</span></span>

Look . . . from me--Deep grief seeks to be alone; while others feast
joyously, Isaiah mourns in prospect of the disaster coming on Jerusalem
([Mic 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008)).

daughter, &c.--(see on [Isa 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008); [Lam
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 22:5</span></span>

trouble . . . by the Lord--that is, sent by or from the Lord (see on
[Isa 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015); [Luk
21:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#022)).

valley of vision--(See on [Isa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001)).
Some think a valley near Ophel is meant as about to be the scene of
devastation (compare see on [Isa
32:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#013)).

breaking . . . walls--that is, "a day of breaking the walls" of the
city.

crying to the mountains--the mournful cry of the townsmen "reaches" to
(MAURER translates, towards) the mountains, and is echoed back by them.
JOSEPHUS describes in the very same language the scene at the assault of
Jerusalem under Titus. To this the prophecy, probably, refers
ultimately. If, as some think, the "cry" is that of those escaping to
the mountains, compare [Mat 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014);
[Mat 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016), with this.

[Isaiah 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 22:6</span></span>

Elam--the country stretching east from the Lower Tigris, answering to
what was afterwards called Persia (see on [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002)). Later, Elam was a province of
Persia ([Ezr 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#009)). In Sennacherib's
time, Elam was subject to Assyria ([Kg2
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#011)), and so furnished a contingent
to its invading armies. Famed for the bow ([Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018); [Jer
49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035)), in which the Ethiopians alone
excelled them.

with chariots of men and horsemen--that is, they used the bow both in
chariots and on horseback. "Chariots of men," that is, chariots in which
men are borne, war chariots (compare see on [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007); [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009)).

Kir--another people subject to Assyria ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009)); the region about the river Kur,
between the Caspian and Black Seas.

uncovered--took off for the battle the leather covering of the shield,
intended to protect the embossed figures on it from dust or injury
during the march. "The quiver" and "the shield" express two
classes--light and heavy armed troops.

[Isaiah 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 22:7</span></span>

valleys--east, north, and south of Jerusalem: Hinnom on the south side
was the richest valley.

in array at the gate--Rab-shakeh stood at the upper pool close to the
city ([Isa 36:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 22:8</span></span>

he discovered the covering--rather, "the veil of Judah shall be taken
off" \[HORSLEY\]: figuratively for, exposing to shame as a captive ([Isa
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#003); [Nah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005)). Sennacherib dismantled all "the
defensed cities of Judah" ([Isa 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001)).

thou didst look--rather, "thou shalt look."

house of . . . forest--The house of armory built of cedar from the
forest of Lebanon by Solomon, on a slope of Zion called Ophel ([Kg1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002); [Kg1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#017); [Neh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019)). Isaiah says ([Isa
22:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008)) his countrymen will look to
their own strength to defend themselves, while others of them will drown
their sorrows as to their country in feasting, but none will look to
Jehovah.

[Isaiah 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 22:9</span></span>

Ye have seen--rather, "Ye shall see."

city of David--the upper city, on Zion, the south side of Jerusalem
([Sa2 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#007), [Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009); [Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001)); surrounded by a wall of its own;
but even in it there shall be "breaches." Hezekiah's preparations for
defense accord with this ([Ch2 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005)).

ye gathered--rather, "ye shall gather."

lower pool--(See on [Isa 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011)). Ye
shall bring together into the city by subterranean passages cut in the
rock of Zion, the fountain from which the lower pool (only mentioned
here) is supplied. See on [Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003);
[Kg2 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020); [Ch2
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003), represent Hezekiah as having
stopped the fountains to prevent the Assyrians getting water. But this
is consistent with the passage here. The superfluous waters of the lower
pool usually flowed into Hinnom valley, and so through that of
Jehoshaphat to the brook Kedron. Hezekiah built a wall round it, stopped
the outflowing of its waters to debar the foe from the use of them, and
turned them into the city.

[Isaiah 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 22:10</span></span>

numbered--rather, "ye shall number," namely, in order to see which of
them may be pulled down with the least loss to the city, and with most
advantage for the repair of the walls and rearing of towers ([Ch2
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005)).

have ye broken down--rather, "ye shall break down."

[Isaiah 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 22:11</span></span>

Ye made . . . a ditch--rather, "Ye shall make a reservoir" for receiving
the water. Hezekiah surrounded Siloah, from which the old (or king's, or
upper) pool took its rise, with a wall joined to the wall of Zion on
both sides; between these two walls he made a new pool, into which he
directed the waters of the former, thus cutting off the foe from his
supply of water also. The opening from which the upper pool received its
water was nearer Zion than the other from which the lower pool took its
rise, so that the water which flowed from the former could easily be
shut in by a wall, whereas that which flowed from the latter could only
be brought in by subterranean conduits (compare see on [Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009); [Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003); [Kg2
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#020); [Ch2
32:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#003), [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030); Ecclesiasticus 48:17). Both
were southwest of Jerusalem.

have not looked . . . neither had respect--answering by contrast to
"Thou didst look to the armor, ye have seen ('had respect', or 'regard
to') the breaches" ([Isa 22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008)).

maker thereof--God, by whose command and aid these defenses were made,
and who gave this fountain "long ago." G. V. SMITH translates, "Him who
doeth it," that is, has brought this danger on you--"Him who hath
prepared it from afar," that is, planned it even from a distant time.

[Isaiah 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 22:12</span></span>

did the Lord God call--Usually the priests gave the summons to national
mourning ([Joe 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014)); now JEHOVAH
Himself shall give it; the "call" shall consist in the presence of a
terrible foe. Translate, "shall call."

baldness--emblem of grief ([Job 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#020);
[Mic 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016)).

[Isaiah 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 22:13</span></span>

Notwithstanding Jehovah's "call to mourning" ([Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012)), many shall make the desperate
state of affairs a reason for reckless revelry ([Isa
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011), [Isa
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012); [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)).

In [Isa 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003), [Isa
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#022); [Isa
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#002), we find Shebna "a scribe," and
no longer prefect of the palace ("over the household"), and Eliakim in
that office, as is here foretold. Shebna is singled out as the subject
of prophecy (the only instance of an individual being so in Isaiah), as
being one of the irreligious faction that set at naught the prophet's
warnings (Isa. 28:1-33:24); perhaps it was he who advised the temporary
ignominious submission of Hezekiah to Sennacherib.

[Isaiah 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 22:15</span></span>

PROPHECY THAT SHEBNA SHOULD BE DEPOSED FROM BEING PREFECT OF THE PALACE,
AND ELIAKIM PROMOTED TO THE OFFICE. ([Isa
22:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015))

Go, get thee unto--rather, "Go in to" (that is, into the house to).

treasurer--"him who dwells in the tabernacle" \[JEROME\]; namely, in a
room of the temple set apart for the treasurer. Rather, "the king's
friend," or "principal officer of the court" ([Kg1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005); [Kg1
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#003); [Ch1
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#033), "the king's counsellor")
\[MAURER\]. "This" is prefixed contemptuously ([Exo
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001)).

unto Shebna--The Hebrew for "unto" indicates an accosting of Shebna with
an unwelcome message.

[Isaiah 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 22:16</span></span>

What . . . whom--The prophet accosts Shebna at the very place where he
was building a grand sepulcher for himself and his family (compare [Isa
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018); Gen. 23:1-20; [Gen
49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029); [Gen
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#013)). "What (business) hast thou
here, and whom hast thou (of thy family, who is likely to be buried)
here, that thou buildest," &c., seeing that thou art soon to be deposed
from office and carried into captivity? \[MAURER\].

on high--Sepulchres were made in the highest rocks ([Ch2
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#033), Margin).

habitation for himself--compare "his own house" ([Isa
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018)).

[Isaiah 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 22:17</span></span>

carry . . . away with . . . captivity--rather, "will cast thee away with
a mighty throw" \[MAURER\]. "Mighty," literally, "of a man" (so [Job
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003)).

surely cover--namely, with shame, where thou art rearing a monument to
perpetuate thy fame \[VITRINGA\]. "Rolling will roll thee," that is,
will continually roll thee on, as a ball to be tossed away \[MAURER\].
Compare [Isa 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018).

[Isaiah 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 22:18</span></span>

violently turn and toss--literally, "whirling He will whirl thee," that
is, He will, without intermission, whirl thee \[MAURER\]. "He will whirl
thee round and round, and (then) cast thee away," as a stone in a sling
is first whirled round repeatedly, before the string is let go
\[LOWTH\].

large country--perhaps Assyria.

chariots . . . shall be the shame of thy lord's house--rather, "thy
splendid chariots shall be there, O thou disgrace of thy lord's house"
\[NOYES\]; "chariots of thy glory" mean "thy magnificent chariots." It
is not meant that he would have these in a distant land, as he had in
Jerusalem, but that he would be borne thither in ignominy instead of in
his magnificent chariots. The Jews say that he was tied to the tails of
horses by the enemy, to whom he had designed to betray Jerusalem, as
they thought he was mocking them; and so he died.

[Isaiah 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 22:19</span></span>

state--office.

he--God. A similar change of persons occurs in [Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016).

[Isaiah 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 22:20</span></span>

son of Hilkiah--supposed by KIMCHI to be the same as Azariah, son of
Hilkiah, who perhaps had two names, and who was "over the household" in
Hezekiah's time ([Ch1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 22:21</span></span>

thy robe--of office.

girdle--in which the purse was carried, and to it was attached the
sword; often adorned with gold and jewels.

father--that is, a counsellor and friend.

[Isaiah 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 22:22</span></span>

key--emblem of his office over the house; to "open" or "shut"; access
rested with him.

upon . . . shoulder--So keys are carried sometimes in the East, hanging
from the kerchief on the shoulder. But the phrase is rather figurative
for sustaining the government on one's shoulders. Eliakim, as his name
implies, is here plainly a type of the God-man Christ, the son of
"David," of whom Isaiah ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006))
uses the same language as the former clause of this verse. In [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007), the same language as the latter
clause is found (compare [Job 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014)).

[Isaiah 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 22:23</span></span>

nail . . . sure place--Large nails or pegs stood in ancient houses on
which were suspended the ornaments of the family. The sense is: all that
is valuable to the nation shall rest securely on him. In [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008) "nail" is used of the large spike
driven into the ground to fasten the cords of the tent to.

throne--resting-place to his family, as applied to Eliakim; but
"throne," in the strict sense, as applied to Messiah, the antitype ([Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)).

[Isaiah 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 22:24</span></span>

Same image as in [Isa 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023). It was
customary to "hang" the valuables of a house on nails ([Kg1
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#016), [Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021); [Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004)).

offspring and the issue--rather, "the offshoots of the family, high and
low" \[VITRINGA\]. Eliakim would reflect honor even on the latter.

vessels of cups--of small capacity: answering to the low and humble
offshoots.

vessels of flagons--larger vessels: answering to the high offshoots.

[Isaiah 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 22:25</span></span>

nail . . . fastened--Shebna, who was supposed to be firmly fixed in his
post.

burden . . . upon it--All that were dependent on Shebna, all his
emoluments and rank will fail, as when a peg is suddenly "cut down," the
ornaments on it fall with it. Sin reaches in its effects even to the
family of the guilty ([Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)).

MENANDER, the historian, notices a siege of Tyre by Shalmaneser, about
the time of the siege of Samaria. Sidon, Acco, and Old Tyre, on the
mainland, were soon reduced; but New Tyre, on an island half a mile from
the shore, held out for five years. Sargon probably finished the siege.
Sennacherib does not, however, mention it among the cities which the
Assyrian kings conquered (thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh chapters). The
expression, "Chaldeans" ([Isa 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013)),
may imply reference to its siege under Nebuchadnezzar, which lasted
thirteen years. Alexander the Great destroyed New Tyre after a seven
months' siege.
