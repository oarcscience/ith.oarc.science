The AUTHENTICITY of this Epistle is attested by CLEMENT OF ROME \[First
Epistle to the Corinthians, 47\], POLYCARP \[Epistle to the Philippians,
11\], and IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 4.27.3\]. The city to which it
was sent was famed for its wealth and commerce, which were chiefly due
to its situation between the Ionian and Ã†gean Seas on the isthmus
connecting the Peloponese with Greece. In Paul's time it was the capital
of the province Achaia and the seat of the Roman proconsul ([Act
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012).md). The state of morals in it was
notorious for debauchery, even in the profligate heathen world; so much
so that "to Corinthianize" was a proverbial phrase for "to play the
wanton"; hence arose dangers to the purity of the Christian Church at
Corinth. That Church was founded by Paul on his first visit (Acts
18:1-17).

He had been the instrument of converting many Gentiles ([Co1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002).md), and some Jews ([Act
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008).md), notwithstanding the vehement
opposition of the countrymen of the latter ([Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005).md), during the year and a half in
which he sojourned there. The converts were chiefly of the humbler
classes ([Co1 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026), &c..md). Crispus
([Co1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md); [Act
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008)), Erastus, and Gaius (Caius.md)
were, however, men of rank ([Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023).md). A variety of classes is also
implied in [Co1 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022.md). The risk of
contamination by contact with the surrounding corruptions, and the
temptation to a craving for Greek philosophy and rhetoric (which
Apollos' eloquent style rather tended to foster, [Act
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024), &c..md) in contrast to Paul's
simple preaching of Christ crucified ([Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001), &c..md), as well as the opposition
of certain teachers to him, naturally caused him anxiety. Emissaries
from the Judaizers of Palestine boasted of "letters of commendation"
from Jerusalem, the metropolis of the faith. They did not, it is true,
insist on circumcision in refined Corinth, where the attempt would have
been hopeless, as they did among the simpler people of Galatia; but they
attacked the apostolic authority of Paul ([Co1
9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md); [Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md), [Co2
10:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007).md), some of them declaring
themselves followers of Cephas, the chief apostle, others boasting that
they belonged to Christ Himself ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md); [Co2
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007).md), while they haughtily repudiated
all subordinate teaching. Those persons gave out themselves for apostles
([Co2 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md), [Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013).md). The ground taken by them was
that Paul was not one of the Twelve, and not an eye-witness of the
Gospel facts, and durst not prove his apostleship by claiming sustenance
from the Christian Church. Another section avowed themselves followers
of Paul himself, but did so in a party spirit, exalting the minister
rather than Christ. The followers of Apollos, again, unduly prized his
Alexandrian learning and eloquence, to the disparagement of the apostle,
who studiously avoided any deviation from Christian simplicity ([Co1
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001).md). In some of this last
philosophizing party there may have arisen the Antinomian tendency which
tried to defend theoretically their own practical immorality: hence
their denial of the future resurrection, and their adoption of the
Epicurean motto, prevalent in heathen Corinth, "Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die" ([Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032).md).
Hence, perhaps, arose their connivance at the incestuous intercourse
kept up by one of the so-called Christian body with his stepmother
during his father's life. The household of Chloe informed Paul of many
other evils: such as contentions, divisions, and lawsuits brought
against brethren in heathen law courts by professing Christians; the
abuse of their spiritual gifts into occasions of display and fanaticism;
the interruption of public worship by simultaneous and disorderly
ministrations, and decorum violated by women speaking unveiled (contrary
to Oriental usage), and so usurping the office of men, and even the holy
communion desecrated by greediness and revelling on the part of the
communicants. Other messengers, also, came from Corinth, consulting him
on the subject of (1) the controversy about meats offered to idols; (2)
the disputes about celibacy and marriage; (3) the due exercise of
spiritual gifts in public worship; (4) the best mode of making the
collection which he had requested for the saints at Jerusalem ([Co1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001), &c..md). Such were the
circumstances which called forth the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
the most varied in its topics of all the Epistles.

In [Co1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md), "I wrote unto you in an
Epistle not to company with fornicators," it is implied that Paul had
written a previous letter to the Corinthians (now lost). Probably in it
he had also enjoined them to make a contribution for the poor saints at
Jerusalem, whereupon they seem to have asked directions as to the mode
of doing so, to which he now replies ([Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002).md). It also probably announced his
intention of visiting them on way to Macedonia, and again on his return
from Macedonia ([Co2 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md), which
purpose he changed hearing the unfavorable report from Chloe's household
([Co1 16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005).md), for which he was
charged with ([Co2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017).md). In the first
Epistle which we have, the subject of fornication is alluded to only in
a way, as if he were rather replying to an excuse set up after rebuke in
the matter, than introducing for the first time \[ALFORD\]. Preceding
this former letter, he seems to have paid a second visit to Corinth. For
in [Co2 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md), he speaks of his intention of
paying them a third visit, implying he had already twice visited them.
See on [Co2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md); [Co2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md); also see on [Co2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md); [Co2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#016.md). It is hardly likely that during
his three years' sojourn at Ephesus he would have failed to revisit his
Corinthian converts, which he could so readily do by sea, there being
constant maritime intercourse between the two cities. This second visit
was probably a short one (compare [Co1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007).md); and attended with pain and
humiliation ([Co2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md); [Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021).md), occasioned by the scandalous
conduct of so many of his own converts. His milder censures having then
failed to produce reformation, he wrote briefly directing them "not to
company with fornicators." On their misapprehending this injunction, he
explained it more fully in the Epistle, the first of the two extant
([Co1 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009.md), [Co1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012).md). That the second visit is not
mentioned in Acts is no objection to its having really taken place, as
that book is fragmentary and omits other leading incidents in Paul's
life; for example, his visit to Arabia, Syria, and Cilicia ([Gal
1:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017).md).

The PLACE OF WRITING is fixed to be Ephesus ([Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008).md). The subscription in English
Version, "From Philippi," has no authority whatever, and probably arose
from a mistaken translation of [Co1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md), "For I am passing through
Macedonia." At the time of writing Paul implies ([Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008).md) that he intended to leave
Ephesus after Pentecost of that year. He really did leave it about
Pentecost (A.D. 57). Compare [Act
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020.md). The allusion to Passover
imagery in connection with our Christian Passover, Easter ([Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007).md), makes it likely that the season
was about Easter. Thus the date of the Epistle is fixed with tolerable
accuracy, about Easter, certainly before Pentecost, in the third year of
his residence at Ephesus, A.D. 57. For other arguments, see CONYBEARE
and HOWSON'S Life and Epistles of St. Paul.

The Epistle is written in the name of Sosthenes "\[our\] brother." BIRKS
supposes he is the same as the Sosthenes, [Act
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md), who, he thinks, was converted
subsequently to that occurrence. He bears no part in the Epistle itself,
the apostle in the very next verses ([Co1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004), &c..md) using the first person: so
Timothy is introduced, [Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md). The
bearers of the Epistle were probably Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus
(see the subscription, [Co1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024).md),
whom he mentions ([Co1 16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017).md) as
with him then, but who he implies are about to return back to Corinth;
and therefore he commends them to the regard of the Corinthians.
