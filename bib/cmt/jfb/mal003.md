### [Malachi Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

[Malachi 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mal 3:1</span></span>

MESSIAH'S COMING, PRECEDED BY HIS FORERUNNER, TO PUNISH THE GUILTY FOR
VARIOUS SINS, AND TO REWARD THOSE WHO FEAR GOD. (Mal. 3:1-18)

Behold--Calling especial attention to the momentous truths which follow.
Ye unbelievingly ask, Where is the God of judgment ([Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md)? "Behold," therefore, "I send,"
&c. Your unbelief will not prevent My keeping My covenant, and bringing
to pass in due time that which ye say will never be fulfilled.

I will send . . . he shall come--The Father sends the Son: the Son
comes. Proving the distinctness of personality between the Father and
the Son.

my messenger--John the Baptist; as [Mat
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md); [Mat
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md); [Mar
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md); [Luk
1:76](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#076.md); [Luk
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004.md); [Luk
7:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026.md); [Joh
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#023.md), prove. This passage of Malachi
evidently rests on that of Isaiah his predecessor ([Isa
40:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md). Perhaps also, as HENGSTENBERG
thinks, "messenger" includes the long line of prophets headed by Elijah
(whence his name is put in [Mal 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005.md) as
a representative name), and terminating in John, the last and greatest
of the prophets ([Mat 11:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#009).md). John
as the representative prophet (the forerunner of Messiah the
representative God-man) gathered in himself all the scattered lineaments
of previous prophecy (hence Christ terms him "much more than a prophet,"
[Luk 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#026).md), reproducing all its awful
and yet inspiriting utterances: his coarse garb, like that of the old
prophets, being a visible exhortation to repentance; the wilderness in
which he preached symbolizing the lifeless, barren state of the Jews at
that time, politically and spiritually; his topics sin, repentance, and
salvation, presenting for the last time the condensed epitome of all
previous teachings of God by His prophets; so that he is called
pre-eminently God's "messenger." Hence the oldest and true reading of
[Mar 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md) is, "as it is written in
Isaiah the prophet"; the difficulty of which is, How can the prophecy of
Malachi be referred to Isaiah? The explanation is: the passage in
Malachi rests on that in [Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md),
and therefore the original source of the prophecy is referred to in
order to mark this dependency and connection.

the Lord--Ha-Adon in Hebrew. The article marks that it is JEHOVAH ([Exo
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017.md); [Exo
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#023.md); compare [Jos
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#011.md), [Jos
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#013).md). Compare [Dan
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017.md), where the Divine Son is meant by
"for THE Lord's sake." God the speaker makes "the Lord," the "messenger
of the covenant," one with Himself. "I will send . . . before Me,"
adding, "THE LORD . . . shall . . . come"; so that "the Lord" must be
one with the "Me," that is, He must be GOD, "before" whom John was sent.
As the divinity of the Son and His oneness with the Father are thus
proved, so the distinctness of personality is proved by "I send" and He
"shall come," as distinguished from one another. He also comes to the
temple as "His temple": marking His divine lordship over it, as
contrasted with all creatures, who are but "servants in" it ([Hag
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md); [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md), [Heb
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005).md).

whom ye seek . . . whom ye delight in--(see on [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md). At His first coming they
"sought" and "delighted in" the hope of a temporal Saviour: not in what
He then was. In the case of those whom Malachi in his time addresses,
"whom ye seek . . . delight in," is ironical. They unbelievingly asked,
When will He come at last? [Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md),
"Where is the God of judgment" ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md); [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003).md)? In the case of the godly the
desire for Messiah was sincere ([Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md), [Luk
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#028).md). He is called "Angel of God's
presence" ([Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009).md), also Angel of
Jehovah. Compare His appearances to Abraham ([Gen
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md), [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md), [Gen
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033).md), to Jacob ([Gen
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#011.md); [Gen
48:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015).md), to Moses in the bush ([Exo
3:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002).md); He went before Israel as the
Shekinah ([Exo 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md), and delivered
the law at Sinai ([Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md).

suddenly--This epithet marks the second coming, rather than the first;
the earnest of that unexpected coming ([Luk
12:38-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#038.md); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015).md) to judgment was given in the
judicial expulsion of the money-changing profaners from the temple by
Messiah ([Mat 21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012).md), where also as
here He calls the temple His temple. Also in the destruction of
Jerusalem, most unexpected by the Jews, who to the last deceived
themselves with the expectation that Messiah would suddenly appear as a
temporal Saviour. Compare the use of "suddenly" in [Num
12:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#004.md), where He appeared in wrath.

messenger of the covenant--namely, of the ancient covenant with Israel
([Isa 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009).md) and Abraham, in which the
promise to the Gentiles is ultimately included ([Gal
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#016).md). The gospel at the first
advent began with Israel, then embraced the Gentile world: so also it
shall be at the second advent. All the manifestations of God in the Old
Testament, the Shekinah and human appearances, were made in the person
of the Divine Son ([Exo 23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026.md); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).md). He was the messenger of the
old covenant, as well as of the new.

[Malachi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mal 3:2</span></span>

([Mal 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md); [Rev
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016).md). The Messiah would come, not,
as they expected, to flatter the theocratic nation's prejudices, but to
subject their principles to the fiery test of His heart-searching truth
([Mat 3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010).md), and to destroy
Jerusalem and the theocracy after they had rejected Him. His mission is
here regarded as a whole from the first to the second advent: the
process of refining and separating the godly from the ungodly beginning
during Christ's stay on earth, going on ever since, and about to
continue till the final separation (Mat. 25:31-46). The refining
process, whereby a third of the Jews is refined as silver of its dross,
while two-thirds perish, is described, [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md) (compare [Isa
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025).md).

[Malachi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mal 3:3</span></span>

sit--The purifier sits before the crucible, fixing his eye on the metal,
and taking care that the fire be not too hot, and keeping the metal in,
only until he knows the dross to be completely removed by his seeing his
own image reflected ([Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md) in the
glowing mass. So the Lord in the case of His elect ([Job
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010.md); [Psa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010.md); [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md); [Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md); [Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).md). He will sit down to the work,
not perfunctorily, but with patient love and unflinching justice. The
Angel of the Covenant, as in leading His people out of Egypt by the
pillar of cloud and fire, has an aspect of terror to His foes, of love
to His friends. The same separating process goes on in the world as in
each Christian. When the godly are completely separated from the
ungodly, the world will end. When the dross is taken from the gold of
the Christian, he will be for ever delivered from the furnace of trial.
The purer the gold, the hotter the fire now; the whiter the garment, the
harder the washing \[MOORE\].

purify . . . sons of Levi--of the sins specified above. The very
Levites, the ministers of God, then needed cleansing, so universal was
the depravity.

that they may offer . . . in righteousness--as originally ([Mal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006).md), not as latterly ([Mal
1:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007).md). So believers, the spiritual
priesthood ([Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md).

[Malachi 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mal 3:4</span></span>

as in the days of old-- ([Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md);
[Mal 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005).md). The "offering" (Mincha,
Hebrew) is not expiatory, but prayer, thanksgiving, and self-dedication
([Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md).

[Malachi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mal 3:5</span></span>

I . . . come near . . . to judgment--I whom ye challenged, saying,
"Where is the God of judgment?" ([Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md). I whom ye think far off, and to
be slow in judgment, am "near," and will come as a "swift witness"; not
only a judge, but also an eye-witness against sorcerers; for Mine eyes
see every sin, though ye think I take no heed. Earthly judges need
witnesses to enable them to decide aright: I alone need none ([Psa
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011.md); [Psa
73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011.md); [Psa
94:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#007), &c..md).

sorcerers--a sin into which the Jews were led in connection with their
foreign idolatrous wives. The Jews of Christ's time also practised
sorcery ([Act 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#009.md); [Act
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006.md); [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md); JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 20.6;
Wars of the Jews, 2.12.23\]). It shall be a characteristic of the last
Antichristian confederacy, about to be consumed by the brightness of
Christ's Coming ([Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md); [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009.md); [Rev
13:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#013.md); [Rev
16:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#013.md); also [Rev
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#021.md); [Rev
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#023.md); [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015).md). Romanism has practised it; an
order of exorcists exists in that Church.

adulterers-- ([Mal 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015).md).

fear not me--the source of all sins.

[Malachi 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mal 3:6</span></span>

the Lord--Jehovah: a name implying His immutable faithfulness in
fulfilling His promises: the covenant name of God to the Jews ([Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md), called here "the sons of Jacob,"
in reference to God's covenant with that patriarch.

I change not--Ye are mistaken in inferring that, because I have not yet
executed judgment on the wicked, I am changed from what I once was,
namely, a God of judgment.

therefore ye . . . are not consumed--Ye yourselves being "not consumed,"
as ye have long ago deserved, are a signal proof of My unchangeableness.
[Rom 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md) : compare the whole
chapter, in which God's mercy in store for Israel is made wholly to flow
from God's unchanging faithfulness to His own covenant of love. So here,
as is implied by the phrase "sons of Jacob" ([Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md); [Gen
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#012).md). They are spared because I am
JEHOVAH, and they sons of Jacob; while I spare them, I will also punish
them; and while I punish them, I will not wholly consume them. The
unchangeableness of God is the sheet-anchor of the Church. The
perseverance of the saints is guaranteed, not by their unchangeable love
to God, but by His unchangeable love to them, and His eternal purpose
and promise in Christ Jesus \[MOORE\]. He upbraids their ingratitude
that they turn His very long-suffering ([Lam
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#022).md) into a ground for skeptical
denial of His coming as a Judge at all ([Psa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001.md), [Psa
50:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md), [Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md); [Ecc
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md); [Isa
57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011.md); [Rom
2:4-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004).md).

[Malachi 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mal 3:7</span></span>

Reproof for the non-payment of tithes and offerings, which is the cause
of their national calamities, and promise of prosperity on their paying
them.

from . . . days of your fathers--Ye live as your fathers did when they
brought on themselves the Babylonian captivity, and ye wish to follow in
their steps. This shows that nothing but God's unchanging long-suffering
had prevented their being long ago "consumed" ([Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md).

Return unto me--in penitence.

I will return unto you--in blessings.

Wherein, &c.-- ([Mal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md). The same
insensibility to their guilt continues: they speak in the tone of
injured innocence, as if God calumniated them.

[Malachi 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mal 3:8</span></span>

rob--literally, "cover": hence, defraud. Do ye call defrauding God no
sin to be "returned" from ([Mal 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007).md)?
Yet ye have done so to Me in respect to the tithes due to Me, namely,
the tenth of all the remainder after the first-fruits were paid, which
tenth was paid to the Levites for their support ([Lev
27:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#030).md): a tenth paid by the Levites
to the priests ([Num 18:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#026).md): a
second tenth paid by the people for the entertainment of the Levites,
and their own families, at the tabernacle ([Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018).md): another tithe every third year
for the poor, &c. ([Deu 14:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#028).md).

offerings--the first-fruits, not less than one-sixtieth part of the
corn, wine, and oil ([Deu 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#004.md); [Neh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#010.md), [Neh
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#012).md). The priests had this
perquisite also, the tenth of the tithes which were the Levites
perquisite. But they appropriated all the tithes, robbing the Levites of
their due nine-tenths; as they did also, according to JOSEPHUS, before
the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. Thus doubly God was defrauded,
the priests not discharging aright their sacrificial duties, and robbing
God of the services of the Levites, who were driven away by destitution
\[GROTIUS\].

[Malachi 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mal 3:9</span></span>

cursed-- ([Mal 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002).md). As ye despoil Me,
so I despoil you, as I threatened I would, if ye continued to disregard
Me. In trying to defraud God we only defraud ourselves. The eagle who
robbed the altar set fire to her nest from the burning coal that adhered
to the stolen flesh. So men who retain God's money in their treasuries
will find it a losing possession. No man ever yet lost by serving God
with a whole heart, nor gained by serving Him with a half one. We may
compromise with conscience for half the price, but God will not endorse
the compromise; and, like Ananias and Sapphira, we shall lose not only
what we thought we had purchased so cheaply, but also the price we paid
for it. If we would have God "open" His treasury, we must open ours. One
cause of the barrenness of the Church is the parsimony of its members
\[MOORE\].

[Malachi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mal 3:10</span></span>

keep My promise of blessing you, on condition of your doing your part
([Ch2 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#010).md).

pour . . . out--literally, "empty out": image from a vessel completely
emptied of its contents: no blessing being kept back.

that . . . not . . . room enough, &c.--literally, "even to not . . .
sufficiency," that is, either, as English Version. Or, even so as that
there should be "not merely" "sufficiency" but superabundance \[JEROME,
MAURER\]. GESENIUS not so well translates, "Even to a failure of
sufficiency," which in the case of God could never arise, and therefore
means for ever, perpetually: so [Psa
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md), "as long as the sun and moon
endure"; literally, "until a failure of the sun and moon," which is
never to be; and therefore means, for ever.

[Malachi 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mal 3:11</span></span>

I will rebuke--(See on [Mal 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#003).md). I

rebuke every agency that could hurt it ([Amo
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009).md).

He notices the complaint of the Jews that it is of no profit to serve
Jehovah, for that the ungodly proud are happy; and declares He will soon
bring the day when it shall be known that He puts an everlasting
distinction between the godly and the ungodly.

words . . . stout--Hebrew, "hard"; so "the hard speeches which ungodly
sinners have spoken against Him" ([Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015).md) \[HENDERSON\].

have we spoken--The Hebrew expresses at once their assiduity and habit
of speaking against God \[VATABLUS\]. The niphal form of the verb
implies that these things were said, not directly to God, but of God, to
one another ([Eze 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#020).md) \[MOORE\].

[Malachi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mal 3:14</span></span>

what profit . . . that we . . . kept, &c.--(See on [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md). They here resume the same
murmur against God. [Job 21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md);
[Job 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017.md) describe a further stage of
the same skeptical spirit, when the skeptic has actually ceased to keep
God's service. [Psa 73:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md) describes
the temptation to a like feeling in the saint when seeing the really
godly suffer and the ungodly prosper in worldly goods now. The Jews here
mistake utterly the nature of God's service, converting it into a
mercenary bargain; they attended to outward observances, not from love
to God, but in the hope of being well paid for in outward prosperity;
when this was withheld, they charged God with being unjust, forgetting
alike that God requires very different motives from theirs to accompany
outward observances, and that God rewards even the true worshipper not
so much in this life, as in the life to come.

his ordinance--literally, what He requires to be kept, "His
observances."

walked mournfully--in mournful garb, sackcloth and ashes, the emblems of
penitence; they forget [Isa 58:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md),
where God, by showing what is true fasting, similarly rebukes those who
then also said, Wherefore have we fasted and Thou seest not? &c. They
mistook the outward show for real humiliation.

[Malachi 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015.md)

And now--Since we who serve Jehovah are not prosperous and "the proud"
heathen flourish in prosperity, we must pronounce them the favorites of
God ([Mal 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017.md); [Psa
73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012).md).

set up--literally, "built up": metaphor from architecture ([Pro
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#003.md); compare [Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002.md), Margin; [Gen
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#003), Margin..md)

tempt God--dare God to punish them, by breaking His laws ([Psa
95:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#009).md).

"Then," when the ungodly utter such blasphemies against God, the godly
hold mutual converse, defending God's righteous dealings against those
blasphemers ([Heb 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013).md). The "often"
of English Version is not in the Hebrew. There has been always in the
darkest times a remnant that feared God ([Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018.md); [Rom
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004).md).

feared the Lord--reverential and loving fear, not slavish terror. When
the fire of religion burns low, true believers should draw the nearer
together, to keep the holy flame alive. Coals separated soon go out.

book of remembrance . . . for them--for their advantage, against the day
when those found faithful among the faithless shall receive their final
reward. The kings of Persia kept a record of those who had rendered
services to the king, that they might be suitably rewarded ([Est
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#001.md); compare [Est
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#023.md); [Ezr
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#015.md); [Psa
56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008.md); [Isa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006.md); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012).md). CALVIN makes the fearers of
God to be those awakened from among the ungodly mass (before described)
to true repentance; the writing of the book thus will imply that some
were reclaimable among the blasphemers, and that the godly should be
assured that, though no hope appeared, there would be a door of
penitence opened for them before God. But there is nothing in the
context to support this view.

[Malachi 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017.md)

jewels-- ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md). Literally, "My
peculiar treasure" ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002.md); [Deu
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#018.md); [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); compare [Ecc
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008).md). CALVIN translates more in
accordance with Hebrew idiom, "They shall be My peculiar treasure in the
day in which I will do it" (that is, fulfil My promise of gathering My
completed Church; or, "make" those things come to pass foretold in [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005) above \[GROTIUS\].md); so in [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md) "do" is used absolutely, "in the
day that I shall do this." MAURER, not so well, translates, "in the day
which I shall make," that is, appoint as in [Psa
118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md).

as . . . man spareth . . . son-- ([Psa
103:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#018).md).

Then shall ye . . . discern--Then shall ye see the falseness of your
calumny against God's government ([Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015).md), that the "proud" and wicked
prosper. Do not judge before the time till My work is complete. It is in
part to test your disposition to trust in God in spite of perplexing
appearances, and in order to make your service less mercenary, that the
present blended state is allowed; but at last all ("ye," both godly and
ungodly) shall see the eternal difference there really is "between him
that serveth God and him that serveth Him not" ([Psa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#011).md).

return--Ye shall turn to a better state of mind on this point.
