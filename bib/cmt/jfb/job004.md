### [Job Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

[Job 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 4:1</span></span>

FIRST SPEECH OF ELIPHAZ. (Job 4:1-21)

Eliphaz--the mildest of Job's three accusers. The greatness of Job's
calamities, his complaints against God, and the opinion that calamities
are proofs of guilt, led the three to doubt Job's integrity.

[Job 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 4:2</span></span>

If we assay to commune--Rather, two questions, "May we attempt a word
with thee? Wilt thou be grieved at it?" Even pious friends often count
that only a touch which we feel as a wound.

[Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 4:3</span></span>

weak hands-- [Isa 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003); [Sa2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001).

[Job 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 4:5</span></span>

thou art troubled--rather, "unhinged," hast lost thy self-command ([Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003)).

[Job 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 4:6</span></span>

Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, &c.--Does thy fear, thy
confidence, come to nothing? Does it come only to this, that thou
faintest now? Rather, by transposition, "Is not thy fear (of God) thy
hope? and the uprightness of thy ways thy confidence? If so, bethink
thee, who ever perished being innocent?" \[UMBREIT\]. But [Luk
13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#002) shows that, though there is a
retributive divine government even in this life, yet we cannot judge by
the mere outward appearance. "One event is outwardly to the righteous
and to the wicked" ([Ecc 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)); but yet
we must take it on trust, that God deals righteously even now ([Psa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025); [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016)). Judge not by a part, but by
the whole of a godly man's life, and by his end, even here ([Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011)). The one and the same outward
event is altogether a different thing in its inward bearings on the
godly and on the ungodly even here. Even prosperity, much more calamity,
is a punishment to the wicked ([Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032)). Trials are chastisements for
their good (to the righteous) ([Psa
119:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#067), [Psa
119:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#071), [Psa
119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075)). See Preface on the DESIGN of
this book (see Introduction).

[Job 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 4:8</span></span>

they that plough iniquity . . . reap the same-- ([Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008); [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007); [Hos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

[Job 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 4:9</span></span>

breath of his nostrils--God's anger; a figure from the fiery winds of
the East ([Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016); [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025); [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008), [Psa
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015)).

[Job 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 4:10</span></span>

lion--that is, wicked men, upon whom Eliphaz wished to show that
calamities come in spite of their various resources, just as destruction
comes on the lion in spite of his strength ([Psa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006); [Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017)). Five different Hebrew terms
here occur for "lion." The raging of the lion (the tearer), and the
roaring of the bellowing lion and the teeth of the young lions, not
whelps, but grown up enough to hunt for prey. The strong lion, the
whelps of the lioness (not the stout lion, as in English Version)
\[BARNES and UMBREIT\]. The various phases of wickedness are expressed
by this variety of terms: obliquely, Job, his wife, and children, may be
hinted at by the lion, lioness, and whelps. The one verb, "are broken,"
does not suit both subjects; therefore, supply "the roaring of the
bellowing lion is silenced." The strong lion dies of want at last, and
the whelps, torn from the mother, are scattered, and the race becomes
extinct.

[Job 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 4:12</span></span>

a thing--Hebrew, a "word." Eliphaz confirms his view by a divine
declaration which was secretly and unexpectedly imparted to him.

a little--literally, "a whisper"; implying the still silence around, and
that more was conveyed than articulate words could utter ([Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014); [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004)).

[Job 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 4:13</span></span>

In thoughts from the visions of the night--\[So WINER\]. While revolving
night visions previously made to him ([Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029)). Rather, "In my manifold
(Hebrew, divided) thoughts, before the visions of the night commenced";
therefore not a delusive dream ([Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004)) \[UMBREIT\].

deep sleep-- ([Gen 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021); [Gen
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#012)).

[Job 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 4:16</span></span>

It stood still--At first the apparition glides before Eliphaz, then
stands still, but with that shadowy indistinctness of form which creates
such an impression of awe; a gentle murmur: not (English Version): there
was silence; for in [Kg1 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#012), the
voice, as opposed to the previous storm, denotes a gentle, still murmur.

[Job 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 4:17</span></span>

mortal man . . . a man--Two Hebrew words for "man" are used; the first
implying his feebleness; the second his strength. Whether feeble or
strong, man is not righteous before God.

more just than God . . . more pure than his maker--But this would be
self-evident without an oracle.

[Job 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 4:18</span></span>

folly--Imperfection is to be attributed to the angels, in comparison
with Him. The holiness of some of them had given way ([Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)), and at best is but the holiness
of a creature. Folly is the want of moral consideration \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 4:19</span></span>

houses of clay-- ([Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001)). Houses
made of sun-dried clay bricks are common in the East; they are easily
washed away ([Mat 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#027)). Man's
foundation is this dust ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019)).

before the moth--rather, "as before the moth," which devours a garment
([Job 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028); [Psa
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011); [Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009)). Man, who cannot, in a physical
point of view, stand before the very moth, surely cannot, in a moral,
stand before God.

[Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 4:20</span></span>

from morning to evening--unceasingly; or, better, between the morning
and evening of one short day (so [Exo
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#014); [Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012)).

They are destroyed--better, "they would be destroyed," if God withdrew
His loving protection. Therefore man must not think to be holy before
God, but to draw holiness and all things else from God ([Job
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017)).

[Job 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 4:21</span></span>

their excellency-- ([Psa 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011); [Psa
146:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#004); [Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)). But UMBREIT, by an Oriental
image from a bow, useless because unstrung: "Their nerve, or string
would be torn away." MICHAELIS, better in accordance with [Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019), makes the allusion be to the
cords of a tabernacle taken down ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020)).

they die, even without wisdom--rather, "They would perish, yet not
according to wisdom," but according to arbitrary choice, if God were not
infinitely wise and holy. The design of the spirit is to show that the
continued existence of weak man proves the inconceivable wisdom and
holiness of God, which alone save man from ruin \[UMBREIT\]. BENGEL
shows from Scripture that God's holiness (Hebrew, kadosh) comprehends
all His excellencies and attributes. DE WETTE loses the scope, in
explaining it, of the shortness of man's life, contrasted with the
angels "before they have attained to wisdom."
