### [Luke Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#001.md)

[Luke 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 23:7</span></span>

JESUS BEFORE HEROD. ([Luk 23:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006).md)

sent him to Herod--hoping thus to escape the dilemma of an unjust
condemnation or an unpopular release.

at Jerusalem . . . at that time--to keep the passover.

[Luke 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 23:8</span></span>

some miracle--Fine sport thou expectedst, as the Philistines with Samson
([Jdg 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#025).md), O coarse, crafty, cruel
tyrant! But thou hast been baulked before (see on [Luk
13:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031).md), and shalt be again.

[Luke 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 23:9</span></span>

answered . . . nothing--(See [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).md).

[Luke 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 23:10</span></span>

stood and vehemently accused him--no doubt both of treason before the
king, and of blasphemy, for the king was a Jew.

[Luke 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 23:11</span></span>

his men of war--his bodyguard.

set him at naught, &c.--stung with disappointment at His refusal to
amuse him with miracles or answer any of his questions.

gorgeous robe--bright robe. If this mean (as sometimes) of shining
white, this being the royal color among the Jews, it may have been in
derision of His claim to be "King of the Jews." But if so, "He in
reality honored Him, as did Pilate with His true title blazoned on the
cross" \[BENGEL\].

sent him again to Pilate--instead of releasing him as he ought, having
established nothing against Him ([Luk
23:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#014).md). "Thus he implicated himself
with Pilate in all the guilt of His condemnation, and with him
accordingly he is classed" ([Act 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027).md)
\[BENGEL\].

at enmity--perhaps about some point of disputed jurisdiction, which this
exchange of the Prisoner might tend to heal.

[Luke 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 23:26</span></span>

JESUS AGAIN BEFORE PILATE--DELIVERED UP--LED AWAY TO BE CRUCIFIED. (Luke
23:13-38)

Cyrenian--of Cyrene, in Libya, on the north coast of Africa, where were
many Jews who had a synagogue at Jerusalem ([Act
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009.md), and see [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010).md). He was "the father of Alexander
and Rufus" ([Mar 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021).md), probably
better known afterwards than himself, as disciples. (See [Rom
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013).md).

out of the country--and casually drawn into that part of the crowd.

laid the cross--"Him they compel to bear His cross," ([Mat
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#032).md) --sweet compulsion, if it
issued in him or his sons voluntarily "taking up their cross!" It would
appear that our Lord had first to bear His own cross ([Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017).md), but being from exhaustion
unable to proceed, it was laid on another to bear it "after Him."

[Luke 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 23:27</span></span>

women--not the precious Galilean women ([Luk
23:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#049).md), but part of the crowd.

[Luke 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 23:28</span></span>

not for me, &c.--noble spirit of compassion, rising above His own dread
endurances, in tender commiseration of sufferings yet in the distance
and far lighter, but without His supports and consolations!

[Luke 23:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 23:30</span></span>

mountains . . . hills, &c.-- ([Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008).md), flying hither and thither as
they did in despair for shelter, during the siege; a very slight
premonition of cries of another and more awful kind ([Isa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010.md), [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md), [Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021.md); [Rev
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016).md).

[Luke 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 23:31</span></span>

green tree--that naturally resists the fire.

the dry--that attracts the fire, being its proper fuel. The proverb here
plainly means: "If such sufferings alight upon the innocent One, the
very Lamb of God, what must be in store for those who are provoking the
flames?"

[Luke 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 23:39</span></span>

THE TWO THIEVES. ([Luk 23:39-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#039).md)

railed on him--catching up the universal derision, but with a turn of
his own. Jesus, "reviled, reviles not again"; but another voice from the
cross shall nobly wipe out this dishonor and turn it to the unspeakable
glory of the dying Redeemer.

[Luke 23:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 23:40</span></span>

Dost not thou--"thou" is emphatic: "Let others jeer, but dost thou?"

fear God--Hast thou no fear of meeting Him so soon as thy righteous
Judge? Thou art within an hour or two of eternity, and dost thou spend
it in reckless disregard of coming judgment?

in the same condemnation--He has been condemned to die, but is it better
with thee? Doth even a common lot kindle no sympathy in thy breast?

[Luke 23:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 23:41</span></span>

we . . . justly, &c.--He owns the worst of his crimes and deserts, and
would fain shame his fellow into the same.

nothing amiss--literally, "out of place"; hence "unnatural"; a striking
term here. Our Lord was not charged with ordinary crime, but only with
laying claim to office and honors which amounted to blasphemy. The
charge of treason had not even a show of truth, as Pilate told His
enemies. In this defense then there seems more than meets the eye. "He
made Himself the promised Messiah, the Son of God; but in this He 'did
nothing amiss'; He ate with publicans and sinners, and bade all the
weary and heavy laden come and rest under His wing; but in this He 'did
nothing amiss': He claimed to be Lord of the Kingdom of God, to shut it
at will, but also to open it at pleasure even to such as we are; but in
this He 'did nothing amiss!'" Does His next speech imply less than this?
Observe: (1) His frank confession and genuine self-condemnation. (2) His
astonishment and horror at the very different state of his fellow's
mind. (3) His anxiety to bring him to a better mind while yet there was
hope. (4) His noble testimony, not only to the innocence of Jesus, but
to all that this implied of the rightfulness of His claims.

[Luke 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 23:42</span></span>

said unto Jesus, &c.--Observe here (1) The "kingdom" referred to was one
beyond the grave; for it is inconceivable that he should have expected
Him to come down from the cross to erect any temporal kingdom. (2) This
he calls Christ's own (Thy) kingdom. (3) As such, he sees in Christ the
absolute right to dispose of that kingdom to whom He pleased. (4) He
does not presume to ask a place in that kingdom, though that is what he
means, but with a humility quite affecting, just says, "Lord, remember
me when," &c. Yet was there mighty faith in that word. If Christ will
but "think upon him" ([Neh 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#019).md), at
that august moment when He "cometh into His kingdom," it will do. "Only
assure me that then Thou wilt not forget such a wretch as I, that once
hung by Thy side, and I am content." Now contrast with this bright act
of faith the darkness even of the apostles' minds, who could hardly be
got to believe that their Master would die at all, who now were almost
despairing of Him, and who when dead had almost buried their hopes in
His grave. Consider, too, the man's previous disadvantages and bad life.
And then mark how his faith comes out--not in protestations, "Lord, I
cannot doubt, I am firmly persuaded that Thou art Lord of a kingdom,
that death cannot disannul Thy title nor impede the assumption of it in
due time," &c.--but as having no shadow of doubt, and rising above it as
a question altogether, he just says, "Lord, remember me when Thou
comest," &c. Was ever faith like this exhibited upon earth? It looks as
if the brightest crown had been reserved for the Saviour's head at His
darkest moment!

[Luke 23:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 23:43</span></span>

Jesus said, &c.--The dying Redeemer speaks as if He Himself viewed it in
this light. It was a "song in the night." It ministered cheer to His
spirit in the midnight gloom that now enwrapt it.

Verily I say unto thee--"Since thou speakest as to the king, with kingly
authority speak I to thee."

To-day--"Thou art prepared for a long delay before I come into My
kingdom, but not a day's delay shall there be for thee; thou shalt not
be parted from Me even for a moment, but together we shall go, and with
Me, ere this day expire, shalt thou be in Paradise" (future bliss, [Co2
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004.md); [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)). Learn (1.md) How "One is taken and
another left"; (2) How easily divine teaching can raise the rudest and
worst above the best instructed and most devoted servants of Christ; (3)
How presumption and despair on a death hour are equally discountenanced
here, the one in the impenitent thief, the other in his penitent fellow.
