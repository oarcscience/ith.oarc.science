Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 38:1</span></span>

HEZEKIAH'S SICKNESS; PERHAPS CONNECTED WITH THE PLAGUE OR BLAST WHEREBY
THE ASSYRIAN ARMY HAD BEEN DESTROYED. (Isa. 38:1-22)

Set . . . house in order--Make arrangement as to the succession to the
throne; for he had then no son; and as to thy other concerns.

thou shall die--speaking according to the ordinary course of the
disease. His being spared fifteen years was not a change in God's mind,
but an illustration of God's dealings being unchangeably regulated by
the state of man in relation to Him.

[Isaiah 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 38:2</span></span>

The couches in the East run along the walls of houses. He turned away
from the spectators to hide his emotion and collect his thoughts for
prayer.

[Isaiah 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 38:3</span></span>

He mentions his past religious consistency, not as a boast or a ground
for justification; but according to the Old Testament dispensation,
wherein temporal rewards (as long life, &c., [Exo
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012).md) followed legal obedience, he
makes his religious conduct a plea for asking the prolongation of his
life.

walked--Life is a journey; the pious "walk with God" ([Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md); [Kg1
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004).md).

perfect--sincere; not absolutely perfect, but aiming towards it ([Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045).md); single-minded in walking as in
the presence of God ([Gen 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001).md). The
letter of the Old Testament legal righteousness was, however, a standard
very much below the spirit of the law as unfolded by Christ (Mat.
5:20-48; [Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md), [Co2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md), [Co2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md).

wept sore--JOSEPHUS says, the reason why he wept so sorely was that
being childless, he was leaving the kingdom without a successor. How
often our wishes, when gratified, prove curses! Hezekiah lived to have a
son; that son was the idolater Manasseh, the chief cause of God's wrath
against Judah, and of the overthrow of the kingdom ([Kg2
23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 38:4</span></span>

In [Kg2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004.md), the quickness of God's
answer to the prayer is marked, "afore Isaiah had gone out into the
middle court, the word of the LORD came to him"; that is, before he had
left Hezekiah, or at least when he had just left him, and Hezekiah was
in the act of praying after having heard God's message by Isaiah
(compare [Isa 65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md); [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md); [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 38:5</span></span>

God of David thy father--God remembers the covenant with the father to
the children ([Exo 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md); [Psa
89:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028).md).

tears-- ([Psa 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008).md).

days . . . years--Man's years, however many, are but as so many days
([Gen 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#027).md).

[Isaiah 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 38:6</span></span>

In [Kg2 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#008.md), after this verse comes
the statement which is put at the end, in order not to interrupt God's
message ([Isa 38:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021).md) by Isaiah
([Isa 38:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005).md).

will deliver--The city was already delivered, but here assurance is
given, that Hezekiah shall have no more to fear from the Assyrians.

[Isaiah 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 38:7</span></span>

sign--a token that God would fulfil His promise that Hezekiah should "go
up into the house of the Lord the third day" ([Kg2
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#005.md), [Kg2
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#008).md); the words in italics are not in
Isaiah.

[Isaiah 38:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 38:8</span></span>

bring again--cause to return ([Jos
10:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md). In [Kg2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md), [Kg2
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011.md), the choice is stated to have
been given to Hezekiah, whether the shadow should go forward, or go
back, ten degrees. Hezekiah replied, "It is a light thing (a less
decisive miracle) for the shadow to go down (its usual direction) ten
degrees: nay, but let it return backward ten degrees"; so Isaiah cried
to Jehovah that it should be so, and it was so (compare [Jos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md), [Jos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014).md).

sundial of Ahaz--HERODOTUS (2.109) states that the sundial and the
division of the day into twelve hours, were invented by the Babylonians;
from them Ahaz borrowed the invention. He was one, from his connection
with Tiglath-pileser, likely to have done so ([Kg2
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). "Shadow of the degrees" means
the shadow made on the degrees. JOSEPHUS thinks these degrees were steps
ascending to the palace of Ahaz; the time of day was indicated by the
number of steps reached by the shadow. But probably a sundial, strictly
so called, is meant; it was of such a size, and so placed, that
Hezekiah, when convalescent, could witness the miracle from his chamber.
Compare [Isa 38:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021.md) with [Kg2
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009.md), where translate, shall this
shadow go forward, &c.; the dial was no doubt in sight, probably "in the
middle court" ([Kg2 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004).md), the point
where Isaiah turned back to announce God's gracious answers to Hezekiah.
Hence this particular sign was given. The retrogression of the shadow
may have been effected by refraction; a cloud denser than the air
interposing between the gnomon and dial would cause the phenomenon,
which does not take from the miracle, for God gave him the choice
whether the shadow should go forward or back, and regulated the time and
place. BOSANQUET makes the fourteenth year of Hezekiah to be 689 B.C.,
the known year of a solar eclipse, to which he ascribes the recession of
the shadow. At all events, there is no need for supposing any revolution
of the relative positions of the sun and earth, but merely an effect
produced on the shadow ([Kg2 20:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#009).md);
that effect was only local, and designed for the satisfaction of
Hezekiah, for the Babylonian astronomers and king "sent to enquire of
the wonder that was done in the land" ([Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031).md), implying that it had not
extended to their country. No mention of any instrument for marking time
occurs before this dial of Ahaz, 700 B.C. The first mention of the
"hour" is made by Daniel at Babylon ([Dan
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 38:9</span></span>

The prayer and thanksgiving song of Hezekiah is only given here, not in
the parallel passages of Second Kings and Second Chronicles. [Isa
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009.md) is the heading or inscription.

[Isaiah 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 38:10</span></span>

cutting off--ROSENMULLER translates, "the meridian"; when the sun stands
in the zenith: so "the perfect day" ([Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md). Rather, "in the tranquillity of
my days," that is, that period of life when I might now look forward to
a tranquil reign \[MAURER\]. The Hebrew is so translated ([Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md).

go to--rather, "go into," as in [Isa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md) \[MAURER\].

residue of my years--those which I had calculated on. God sends sickness
to teach man not to calculate on the morrow, but to live more wholly to
God, as if each day were the last.

[Isaiah 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 38:11</span></span>

Lord . . . Lord--The repetition, as in [Isa
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019.md), expresses the excited feeling
of the king's mind.

See the Lord (Jehovah)--figuratively for "to enjoy His good gifts." So,
in a similar connection ([Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013).md).
"I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in
the land of the living"; ([Psa 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#012).md),
"What man is he that desireth life that he may see good?"

world--rather, translate: "among the inhabitants of the land of
stillness," that is, Hades \[MAURER\], in parallel antithesis to "the
land of the living" in the first clause. The Hebrew comes from a root,
to "rest" or "cease" ([Job 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 38:12</span></span>

age--rather, as the parallel "shepherd's tent" requires habitation, so
the Arabic \[GESENIUS\].

departed--is broken up, or shifted, as a tent to a different locality.
The same image occurs ([Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md); [Pe2
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012).md). He plainly expects to exist,
and not cease to be in another state; as the shepherd still lives, after
he has struck his tent and removed elsewhere.

I have cut off--He attributes to himself that which is God's will with
respect to him; because he declares that will. So Jeremiah is said to
"root out" kingdoms, because he declares God's purpose of doing so ([Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md). The weaver cuts off his web
from the loom when completed. [Job 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006.md)
has a like image. The Greeks represented the Fates as spinning and
cutting off the threads of each man's life.

he--God.

with pining sickness--rather, "from the thrum," or thread, which tied
the loom to the weaver's beam.

from day . . . to night--that is, in the space of a single day between
morning and night ([Job 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 38:13</span></span>

I reckoned . . . that--rather, I composed (my mind, during the night,
expecting relief in the "morning," so [Job
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#004).md): for ("that" is not, as in the
English Version, to be supplied) as a lion He was breaking all my bones
\[VITRINGA\] ([Job 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#016.md); [Lam
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#010).md). The Hebrew, in [Psa
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md), is rendered, "I quieted." Or
else, "I made myself like a lion (namely, in roaring, through pain), He
was so breaking my bones!" Poets often compare great groaning to a
lion's roaring, so, [Isa 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md), he
compares his groans to the sounds of other animals ([Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001).md) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 38:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 38:14</span></span>

Rather, "Like a swallow, or a crane" (from a root; "to disturb the
water," a bird frequenting the water) \[MAURER\], ([Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007).md).

chatter--twitter: broken sounds expressive of pain.

dove--called by the Arabs the daughter of mourning, from its plaintive
note ([Isa 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011).md).

looking upward--to God for relief.

undertake for--literally, "be surety for" me; assure me that I shall be
restored ([Psa 119:122](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#122).md).

[Isaiah 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 38:15</span></span>

The second part of the song passes from prayer to thanksgiving at the
prayer being heard.

What shall I say?--the language of one at a loss for words to express
his sense of the unexpected deliverance.

both spoken . . . and . . . done it-- ([Num
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019).md). Both promised and performed
([Th1 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023).md).

himself--No one else could have done it ([Psa
98:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001).md).

go softly . . . in the bitterness--rather, "on account of the
bitterness"; I will behave myself humbly in remembrance of my past
sorrow and sickness from which I have been delivered by God's mercy (see
[Kg1 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027.md), [Kg1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029).md). In [Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md), the same Hebrew verb expresses
the slow and solemn gait of one going up to the house of God; it is
found nowhere else, hence ROSENMULLER explains it, "I will reverently
attend the sacred festivals in the temple"; but this ellipsis would be
harsh; rather metaphorically the word is transferred to a calm, solemn,
and submissive walk of life.

[Isaiah 38:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 38:16</span></span>

by these--namely, by God's benefits, which are implied in the context
([Isa 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#015.md), "He hath Himself done it"
"unto me"). All "men live by these" benefits ([Psa
104:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027).md), "and in all these is the
life of my spirit," that is, I also live by them ([Deu
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003).md).

and (wilt) make me to live--The Hebrew is imperative, "make me to live."
In this view he adds a prayer to the confident hope founded on his
comparative convalescence, which he expressed, "Thou wilt recover me"
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 38:17</span></span>

for peace--instead of the prosperity which I had previously.

great bitterness--literally, "bitterness to me, bitterness"; expressing
intense emotion.

in love--literally, "attachment," such as joins one to another tenderly;
"Thou hast been lovingly attached to me from the pit"; pregnant phrase
for, Thy love has gone down to the pit, and drawn me out from it. The
"pit" is here simply death, in Hezekiah's sense; realized in its fulness
only in reference to the soul's redemption from hell by Jesus Christ
([Isa 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md), who went down to the pit
for that purpose Himself ([Psa 88:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#004.md);
[Zac 9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011.md); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020).md). "Sin" and sickness are
connected ([Psa 103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md); compare [Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), with [Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md); [Mat
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#005).md), especially under the Old
Testament dispensation of temporal sanctions; but even now, sickness,
though not invariably arising from sin in individuals, is connected with
it in the general moral view.

cast . . . behind back--consigned my sins to oblivion. The same phrase
occurs ([Kg1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009.md); [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026.md); [Psa
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#017).md). Contrast [Psa
90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008.md), "Thou hast set our iniquities
before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance."

[Isaiah 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 38:18</span></span>

death--that is, the dead; Hades and its inhabitants ([Job
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022.md); see on [Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011).md). Plainly Hezekiah believed in a
world of disembodied spirits; his language does not imply what
skepticism has drawn from it, but simply that he regarded the
disembodied state as one incapable of declaring the praises of God
before men, for it is, as regards this world, an unseen land of
stillness; "the living" alone can praise God on earth, in reference to
which only he is speaking; [Isa 57:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)
shows that at this time the true view of the blessedness of the
righteous dead was held, though not with the full clearness of the
Gospel, which "has brought life and immortality to light" ([Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010).md).

hope for thy truth-- ([Psa 104:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027).md).
Their probation is at an end. They can no longer exercise faith and hope
in regard to Thy faithfulness to Thy promises, which are limited to the
present state. For "hope" ceases (even in the case of the godly) when
sight begins ([Rom 8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024).md); the
ungodly have "no hope" ([Th1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).md).
Hope in God's truth is one of the grounds of praise to God ([Psa
71:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#014.md); [Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049).md). Others translate, "cannot
celebrate."

[Isaiah 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 38:19</span></span>

living . . . living--emphatic repetition, as in [Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011.md), [Isa
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#017.md); his heart is so full of the
main object of his prayer that, for want of adequate words, he repeats
the same word.

father to the children--one generation of the living to another. He
probably, also, hints at his own desire to live until he should have a
child, the successor to his throne, to whom he might make known and so
perpetuate the memory of God's truth.

truth--faithfulness to His promises; especially in Hezekiah's case, His
promise of hearing prayer.

[Isaiah 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 38:20</span></span>

was ready--not in the Hebrew; "Jehovah was for my salvation," that is,
saved me (compare [Isa 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002).md).

we--I and my people.

in the house of the Lord--This song was designed, as many of the other
Psalms, as a form to be used in public worship at stated times, perhaps
on every anniversary of his recovery; hence "all the days of our life."

lump of figs--a round cake of figs pressed into a mass ([Sa1
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#018).md). God works by means; the
meanest of which He can make effectual.

boil--inflamed ulcer, produced by the plague.

[Isaiah 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 38:22</span></span>

house of the Lord--Hence he makes the praises to be sung there prominent
in his song ([Isa 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020.md); [Psa
116:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md), [Psa
116:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017).md).
