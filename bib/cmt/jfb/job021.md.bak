### [Job Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#001.md)

[Job 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 21:2</span></span>

JOB'S ANSWER. (Job 21:1-34)

consolations--If you will listen calmly to me, this will be regarded as
"consolations"; alluding to Eliphaz' boasted "consolations" ([Job
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011).md), which Job felt more as
aggravations ("mockings," [Job 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#003).md)
than consolations ([Job 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002).md).

[Job 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 21:3</span></span>

literally, "Begin your mockings" ([Job
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002).md).

[Job 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 21:4</span></span>

Job's difficulty was not as to man, but as to God, why He so afflicted
him, as if he were the guilty hypocrite which the friends alleged him to
be. Vulgate translates it, "my disputation."

if it were--rather, "since this is the case."

[Job 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 21:5</span></span>

lay . . . hand upon . . . mouth-- ([Pro
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#032.md); [Jdg
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#019).md). So the heathen god of silence
was pictured with his hand on his mouth. There was enough in Job's case
to awe them into silence ([Job 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#008).md).

[Job 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 21:6</span></span>

remember--Think on it. Can you wonder that I broke out into complaints,
when the struggle was not with men, but with the Almighty? Reconcile, if
you can, the ceaseless woes of the innocent with the divine justice! Is
it not enough to make one tremble? \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 21:7</span></span>

The answer is [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md); [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md); [Psa
73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md); [Ecc
8:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md); [Luk
2:35-](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035.md)end; [Pro
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004.md); [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022.md).

old--in opposition to the friends who asserted that sinners are "cut
off" early ([Job 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#012.md), [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014).md).

[Job 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 21:8</span></span>

In opposition to [Job 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#019.md); [Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004.md).

[Job 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 21:9</span></span>

Literally, "peace from fear"; with poetic force. Their house is peace
itself, far removed from fear. Opposed to the friends' assertion, as to
the bad ([Job 15:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#021.md); [Job
20:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026).md), and conversely, the good
([Job 5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023).md).

[Job 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 21:10</span></span>

Rather, "their cattle conceive." The first clause of the verse describes
an easy conception, the second, a happy birth \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 21:11</span></span>

send forth--namely, out of doors, to their happy sports under the skies,
like a joyful flock sent to the pastures.

little ones--like lambkins.

children--somewhat older than the former.

dance--not formal dances; but skip, like lambs, in joyous and healthful
play.

[Job 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 21:12</span></span>

take--rather, "lift up the voice" (sing) to the note of \[UMBREIT\].

timbrel--rather, "tambourine."

organ--not the modern "organ," but the "pipe" ([Gen
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#021).md). The first clause refers to
stringed, the latter, to wind instruments; thus, with "the voice" all
kinds of music are enumerated.

[Job 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 21:13</span></span>

wealth--Old English Version for "prosperity."

in a moment--not by a lingering disease. Great blessings! Lengthened
life with prosperity, and a sudden painless death ([Psa
73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004).md).

[Job 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 21:14</span></span>

Therefore--rather, "And yet they are such as say," &c., that is, say,
not in so many words, but virtually, by their conduct (so the
Gergesenes, [Mat 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034).md). How
differently the godly ([Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003).md).

ways--The course of action, which God points out; as in [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023.md), Margin.

[Job 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 21:15</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Pro
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#009.md), Margin, [Exo
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002).md).

what profit-- ([Job 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014.md); [Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md). Sinners ask, not what is
right, but what is for the profit of self. They forget, "If religion
cost self something, the want of it will cost self infinitely more."

[Job 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 21:16</span></span>

not in their hand--but in the hand of God. This is Job's difficulty,
that God who has sinners prosperity (good) in His hand should allow them
to have it.

is--rather, "may the counsel of the wicked be far from me!" \[UMBREIT\].
This naturally follows the sentiment of the first clause: Let me not
hereby be thought to regard with aught but horror the ways of the
wicked, however prosperous.

[Job 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 21:17</span></span>

Job in this whole passage down to [Job
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md) quotes the assertion of the
friends, as to the short continuance of the sinner's prosperity, not his
own sentiments. In [Job 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022.md) he
proceeds to refute them. "How oft is the candle" (lamp), &c., quoting
Bildad's sentiment ([Job 18:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005).md), in
order to question its truth (compare [Mat
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#008).md).

how oft--"God distributeth," &c. (alluding to [Job
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md), [Job
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029).md).

sorrows--UMBREIT translates "snares," literally, "cords," which
lightning in its twining motion resembles ([Psa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006).md).

[Job 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 21:18</span></span>

Job alludes to a like sentiment of Bildad ([Job
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#018).md), using his own previous words
([Job 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025).md).

[Job 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 21:19</span></span>

Equally questionable is the friends' assertion that if the godless
himself is not punished, the children are ([Job
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#019.md); [Job
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010).md); and that God rewardeth him
here for his iniquity, and that he shall know it to his cost. So "know"
([Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md).

[Job 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 21:20</span></span>

Another questionable assertion of the friends, that the sinner sees his
own and his children's destruction in his lifetime.

drink-- ([Psa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021).md).

[Job 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 21:21</span></span>

The argument of the friends, in proof of [Job
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#020.md), What pleasure can he have from
his house (children) when he is dead--("after him," [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022).md).

when the number, &c.--Or, rather, "What hath he to do with his
children?" &c. (so the Hebrew in [Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001.md); [Ecc
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#006).md). It is therefore necessary that
"his eyes should see his and their destruction" (see [Job
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021).md).

cut off--rather, when the number of his allotted months is fulfilled
([Job 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005).md). From an Arabic word,
"arrow," which was used to draw lots with. Hence "arrow"--inevitable
destiny \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 21:22</span></span>

Reply of Job, "In all these assertions you try to teach God how He ought
to deal with men, rather than prove that He does in fact so deal with
them. Experience is against you. God gives prosperity and adversity as
it pleases Him, not as man's wisdom would have it, on principles
inscrutable to us" ([Isa 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md); [Rom
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034).md).

those . . . high--the high ones, not only angels, but men ([Isa
2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012).md).

[Job 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 21:23</span></span>

Literally, "in the bone of his perfection," that is, the full strength
of unimpaired prosperity \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 21:24</span></span>

breasts--rather, "skins," or "vessels" for fluids \[LEE\]. But
\[UMBREIT\] "stations or resting-places of his herds near water"; in
opposition to Zophar ([Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017).md); the
first clause refers to his abundant substance, the second to his
vigorous health.

moistened--comparing man's body to a well-watered field ([Pro
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md); [Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011).md).

[Job 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 21:26</span></span>

([Ecc 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002).md).

[Job 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 21:27</span></span>

Their wrongful thoughts against Job are stated by him in [Job
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028.md). They do not honestly name Job,
but insinuate his guilt.

[Job 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 21:28</span></span>

ye say--referring to Zophar ([Job
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#007).md).

the house--referring to the fall of the house of Job's oldest son ([Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019).md) and the destruction of his
family.

prince--The parallel "wicked" in the second clause requires this to be
taken in a bad sense, tyrant, oppressor ([Isa
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002).md), the same Hebrew,
"nobles"--oppressors.

dwelling-places--rather, "pavilions," a tent containing many dwellings,
such as a great emir, like Job, with many dependents, would have.

[Job 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 21:29</span></span>

Job, seeing that the friends will not admit him as an impartial judge,
as they consider his calamities prove his guilt, begs them to ask the
opinion of travellers ([Lam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012).md), who
have the experience drawn from observation, and who are no way connected
with him. Job opposes this to Bildad ([Job
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008).md) and Zophar ([Job
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#004).md).

tokens--rather, "intimations" (for example, inscriptions, proverbs,
signifying the results of their observation), testimony. Literally,
"signs" or proofs in confirmation of the word spoken ([Isa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011).md).

[Job 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 21:30</span></span>

Their testimony (referring perhaps to those who had visited the region
where Abraham who enjoyed a revelation then lived) is that "the wicked
is (now) spared (reserved) against the day of destruction (hereafter)."
The Hebrew does not so well agree with \[UMBREIT\] "in the day of
destruction." Job does not deny sinners' future punishment, but their
punishment in this life. They have their "good things" now. Hereafter,
their lot, and that of the godly, shall be reversed ([Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025).md). Job, by the Spirit, often
utters truths which solve the difficulty under which he labored. His
afflictions mostly clouded his faith, else he would have seen the
solution furnished by his own words. This answers the objection, that if
he knew of the resurrection in [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md), and future retribution ([Job
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#030).md), why did he not draw his
reasonings elsewhere from them, which he did not? God's righteous
government, however, needs to be vindicated as to this life also, and
therefore the Holy Ghost has caused the argument mainly to turn on it at
the same time giving glimpses of a future fuller vindication of God's
ways.

brought forth--not "carried away safe" or "escape" (referring to this
life), as UMBREIT has it.

wrath--literally, "wraths," that is, multiplied and fierce wrath.

[Job 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 21:31</span></span>

That is, who dares to charge him openly with his bad ways? namely, in
this present life. He shall, I grant ([Job
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#030).md), be "repaid" hereafter.

[Job 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 21:32</span></span>

Yet--rather, "and."

brought--with solemn pomp ([Psa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015).md).

grave--literally, "graves"; that is, the place where the graves are.

remain in--rather, watch on the tomb, or sepulchral mound. Even after
death he seems still to live and watch (that is, have his "remembrance"
preserved) by means of the monument over the grave. In opposition to
Bildad ([Job 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#017).md).

[Job 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 21:33</span></span>

As the classic saying has it, "The earth is light upon him." His repose
shall be "sweet."

draw--follow. He shall share the common lot of mortals; no worse off
than they ([Heb 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027).md). UMBREIT not so
well (for it is not true of "every man"). "Most men follow in his bad
steps, as countless such preceded him."

[Job 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 21:34</span></span>

falsehood--literally, "transgression." Your boasted "consolations" ([Job
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#011).md) are contradicted by facts
("vain"); they therefore only betray your evil intent ("wickedness")
against me.
