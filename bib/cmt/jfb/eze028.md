### [Ezekiel Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 28:2</span></span>

PROPHETICAL DIRGE ON THE KING OF TYRE, AS THE CULMINATION AND EMBODIMENT
OF THE SPIRIT OF CARNAL PRIDE AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY OF THE WHOLE STATE.
THE FALL OF ZIDON, THE MOTHER CITY. THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL IN
CONTRAST WITH TYRE AND ZIDON. (Eze. 28:1-26)

Because, &c.--repeated resumptively in [Eze
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#006). The apodosis begins at [Eze
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007). "The prince of Tyrus" at the
time was Ithobal, or Ithbaal II; the name implying his close connection
with Baal, the PhÅ“nician supreme god, whose representative he was.

I am a god, I sit in . . . seat of God . . . the seas--As God sits
enthroned in His heavenly citadel exempt from all injury, so I sit
secure in my impregnable stronghold amidst the stormiest elements, able
to control them at will, and make them subserve my interests. The
language, though primarily here applied to the king of Tyre, as similar
language is to the king of Babylon ([Isa
14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)), yet has an ulterior and
fuller accomplishment in Satan and his embodiment in Antichrist ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025); [Dan
11:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036); [Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004); [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006)). This feeling of superhuman
elevation in the king of Tyre was fostered by the fact that the island
on which Tyre stood was called "the holy island" \[SANCONIATHON\], being
sacred to Hercules, so much so that the colonies looked up to Tyre as
the mother city of their religion, as well as of their political
existence. The Hebrew for "God" is El, that is, "the Mighty One."

yet, &c.--keen irony.

set thine heart as . . . heart of God--Thou thinkest of thyself as if
thou wert God.

[Ezekiel 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 28:3</span></span>

Ezekiel ironically alludes to Ithbaal's overweening opinion of the
wisdom of himself and the Tyrians, as though superior to that of Daniel,
whose fame had reached even Tyre as eclipsing the Chaldean sages. "Thou
art wiser," namely, in thine own opinion ([Zac
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#002)).

no secret--namely, forgetting riches ([Eze
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#004)).

that they can hide--that is, that can be hidden.

[Ezekiel 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 28:5</span></span>

([Psa 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 28:6</span></span>

Because, &c.--resumptive of [Eze 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002).

[Ezekiel 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 28:7</span></span>

therefore--apodosis.

strangers . . . terrible of the nations--the Chaldean foreigners noted
for their ferocity ([Eze 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#011); [Eze
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012)).

against the beauty of thy wisdom--that is, against thy beautiful
possessions acquired by thy wisdom on which thou pridest thyself ([Eze
28:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)).

defile thy brightness--obscure the brightness of thy kingdom.

[Ezekiel 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 28:8</span></span>

the pit--that is, the bottom of the sea; the image being that of one
conquered in a sea-fight.

the deaths--plural, as various kinds of deaths are meant ([Jer
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004)).

of them . . . slain--literally, "pierced through." Such deaths as those
pierced with many wounds die.

[Ezekiel 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 28:9</span></span>

yet say--that is, still say; referring to [Eze
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#002).

but, &c.--But thy blasphemous boastings shall be falsified, and thou
shalt be shown to be but man, and not God, in the hand (at the mercy) of
Him.

[Ezekiel 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 28:10</span></span>

deaths of . . . uncircumcised--that is, such a death as the
uncircumcised or godless heathen deserve; and perhaps, also, such as the
uncircumcised inflict, a great ignominy in the eyes of a Jew ([Sa1
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1031.htm#004)); a fit retribution on him who
had scoffed at the circumcised Jews.

[Ezekiel 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 28:12</span></span>

sealest up the sum--literally, "Thou art the one sealing the sum of
perfection." A thing is sealed when completed ([Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)). "The sum" implies the full
measure of beauty, from a Hebrew root, "to measure." The normal man--one
formed after accurate rule.

[Ezekiel 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 28:13</span></span>

in Eden--The king of Tyre is represented in his former high state
(contrasted with his subsequent downfall), under images drawn from the
primeval man in Eden, the type of humanity in its most Godlike form.

garden of God--the model of ideal loveliness ([Eze
31:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008); [Eze
36:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#035)). In the person of the king of
Tyre a new trial was made of humanity with the greatest earthly
advantages. But as in the case of Adam, the good gifts of God were only
turned into ministers to pride and self.

every precious stone--so in Eden ([Gen
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#012)), "gold, bdellium, and the onyx
stone." So the king of Tyre was arrayed in jewel-bespangled robes after
the fashion of Oriental monarchs. The nine precious stones here
mentioned answer to nine of the twelve (representing the twelve tribes)
in the high priest's breastplate ([Exo
39:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#010); [Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014), [Rev
21:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019)). Of the four rows of three
in each, the third is omitted in the Hebrew, but is supplied in the
Septuagint. In this, too, there is an ulterior reference to Antichrist,
who is blasphemously to arrogate the office of our divine High Priest
([Zac 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)).

tabrets--tambourines.

pipes--literally, "holes" in musical pipes or flutes.

created--that is, in the day of thine accession to the throne.
Tambourines and all the marks of joy were ready prepared for thee ("in
thee," that is, "with and for thee"). Thou hadst not, like others, to
work thy way to the throne through arduous struggles. No sooner created
than, like Adam, thou wast surrounded with the gratifications of Eden.
FAIRBAIRN, for "pipes," translates, "females" (having reference to [Gen
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027)), that is, musician-women. MAURER
explains the Hebrew not as to music, but as to the setting and mounting
of the gems previously mentioned.

[Ezekiel 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 28:14</span></span>

anointed cherub--GESENIUS translates from an Aramaic root, "extended
cherub." English Version, from a Hebrew root, is better. "The cherub
consecrated to the Lord by the anointing oil" \[FAIRBAIRN\].

covereth--The imagery employed by Ezekiel as a priest is from the Jewish
temple, wherein the cherubim overshadowed the mercy seat, as the king of
Tyre, a demi-god in his own esteem, extended his protection over the
interests of Tyre. The cherub--an ideal compound of the highest kinds of
animal existence and the type of redeemed man in his ultimate state of
perfection--is made the image of the king of Tyre, as if the beau ideal
of humanity. The pretensions of Antichrist are the ulterior reference,
of whom the king of Tyre is a type. Compare "As God . . . in the temple
of God" ([Th2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)).

I have set thee--not thou set thyself ([Pro
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#016); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)).

upon the holy mountain of God--Zion, following up the image.

in . . . midst of . . . stones of fire--In ambitious imagination he
stood in the place of God, "under whose feet was, as it were, a pavement
of sapphire," while His glory was like "devouring fire" ([Exo
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010), [Exo
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 28:15</span></span>

perfect--prosperous \[GROTIUS\], and having no defect. So Hiram was a
sample of the Tyrian monarch in his early days of wisdom and prosperity
([Kg1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007), &c.).

till iniquity . . . in thee--Like the primeval man thou hast fallen by
abusing God's gifts, and so hast provoked God's wrath.

[Ezekiel 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 28:16</span></span>

filled the midst of thee--that is, they have filled the midst of the
city; he as the head of the state being involved in the guilt of the
state, which he did not check, but fostered.

cast thee as profane--no longer treated as sacred, but driven out of the
place of sanctity (see [Eze 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014))
which thou hast occupied (compare [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039)).

[Ezekiel 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 28:17</span></span>

brightness--thy splendor.

lay thee before kings--as an example of God's wrath against presumptuous
pride.

[Ezekiel 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 28:18</span></span>

thy sanctuaries--that is, the holy places, attributed to the king of
Tyre in [Eze 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#014), as his ideal
position. As he "profaned" it, so God will "profane" him ([Eze
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016)).

fire . . . devour--As he abused his supposed elevation amidst "the
stones of fire" ([Eze 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#016)), so God
will make His "fire" to "devour" him.

[Ezekiel 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 28:21</span></span>

Zidon--famous for its fishery (from a root, Zud, "to fish"); and
afterwards for its wide extended commerce; its artistic elegance was
proverbial. Founded by Canaan's first-born ([Gen
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#015)). Tyre was an offshoot from it,
so that it was involved in the same overthrow by the Chaldeans as Tyre.
It is mentioned separately, because its idolatry (Ashtaroth, Tammuz, or
Adonis) infected Israel more than that of Tyre did ([Eze
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014); [Jdg
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006); [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033)). The notorious Jezebel was a
daughter of the Zidonian king.

[Ezekiel 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 28:22</span></span>

shall be sanctified in her--when all nations shall see that I am the
Holy Judge in the vengeance that I will inflict on her for sin.

[Ezekiel 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 28:24</span></span>

no more . . . brier . . . unto . . . Israel--as the idolatrous nations
left in Canaan (among which Zidon is expressly specified in the limits
of Asher, [Jdg 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031)) had been ([Num
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055); [Jos
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#013)). "A brier," first ensnaring the
Israelites in sin, and then being made the instrument of punishing them.

pricking--literally, "causing bitterness." The same Hebrew is translated
"fretting" ([Lev 13:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#051)). The wicked
are often called "thorns" ([Sa2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 28:25</span></span>

Fulfilled in part at the restoration from Babylon, when Judaism, so far
from being merged in heathenism, made inroads by conversions on the
idolatry of surrounding nations. The full accomplishment is yet future,
when Israel, under Christ, shall be the center of Christendom; of which
an earnest was given in the woman from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon who
sought the Saviour ([Mat 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021), [Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024), [Mat
15:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026); compare [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012)).

dwell safely-- ([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)).

This is the last of the world kingdoms against which Ezekiel's
prophecies are directed, and occupies the largest space in them, namely,
the next four chapters. Though farther off than Tyre, it exercised a
more powerful influence on Israel.
