### [Genesis Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 8:1</span></span>

ASSUAGING OF THE WATERS. ([Gen 8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001).md)

And God remembered Noah--The divine purpose in this awful dispensation
had been accomplished, and the world had undergone those changes
necessary to fit it for becoming the residence of man under a new
economy of Providence.

and every living thing . . . in the ark--a beautiful illustration of
[Mat 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029.md).

and God made a wind to pass over the earth--Though the divine will could
have dried up the liquid mass in an instant, the agency of a wind was
employed ([Psa 104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004).md) --probably a hot
wind, which, by rapid evaporation, would again absorb one portion of the
waters into the atmosphere; and by which, the other would be gradually
drained off by outlets beneath.

[Genesis 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 8:4</span></span>

seventh month--of the year--not of the flood--which lasted only five
months.

rested--evidently indicating a calm and gentle motion.

upon the mountains of Ararat--or Armenia, as the word is rendered ([Kg2
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md); [Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).md). The mountain which tradition
points to as the one on which the ark rested is now called Ara Dagh, the
"finger mountain." Its summit consists of two peaks, the higher of which
is 17,750 feet and the other 13,420 above the level of the sea.

[Genesis 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 8:5</span></span>

And the waters decreased continually--The decrease of the waters was for
wise reasons exceedingly slow and gradual--the period of their return
being nearly twice as long as that of their rise.

[Genesis 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 8:6</span></span>

at the end of forty days--It is easy to imagine the ardent longing Noah
and his family must have felt to enjoy again the sight of land as well
as breathe the fresh air; and it was perfectly consistent with faith and
patience to make inquiries whether the earth was yet ready.

[Genesis 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 8:7</span></span>

And he sent forth a raven--The smell of carrion would allure it to
remain if the earth were in a habitable state. But it kept hovering
about the spot, and, being a solitary bird, probably perched on the
covering.

[Genesis 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 8:8</span></span>

Also he sent forth a dove--a bird flying low and naturally disposed to
return to the place of her abode.

[Genesis 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 8:10</span></span>

again he sent forth the dove--Her flight, judging by the time she was
abroad, was pursued to a great distance, and the newly plucked olive
leaf, she no doubt by supernatural impulse brought in her bill, afforded
a welcome proof that the declivities of the hills were clear.

[Genesis 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 8:12</span></span>

he . . . sent forth the dove: which returned not . . . any more--In
these results, we perceive a wisdom and prudence far superior to the
inspiration of instinct--we discern the agency of God guiding all the
movements of this bird for the instruction of Noah, and reviving the
hopes of his household.

other seven days--a strong presumptive proof that Noah observed the
Sabbath during his residence in the ark.

[Genesis 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 8:13</span></span>

Noah removed the covering of the ark--probably only as much of it as
would afford him a prospect of the earth around. Yet for about two
months he never stirred from his appointed abode till he had received
the express permission of God. We should watch the leading of Providence
to direct us in every step of the journey of life.

[Genesis 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 8:15</span></span>

DEPARTURE FROM THE ARK. ([Gen 8:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#015).md)

And God spake . . . Go forth--They went forth in the most orderly
manner--the human occupants first, then each species "after their kinds"
\[[Gen 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#019.md)\], literally, "according
to their families," implying that there had been an increase in the ark.

[Genesis 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 8:20</span></span>

Noah builded an altar--literally, "a high place"--probably a mound of
earth, on which a sacrifice was offered. There is something exceedingly
beautiful and interesting to know that the first care of this devout
patriarch was to return thanks for the signal instance of mercy and
goodness which he and his family had experienced.

took of every clean beast . . . fowl--For so unparalleled a deliverance,
a special acknowledgment was due.

[Genesis 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 8:21</span></span>

And the Lord smelled a sweet savour--The sacrifice offered by a
righteous man like Noah in faith was acceptable as the most fragrant
incense.

Lord said in his heart--same as "I have sworn that the waters of Noah
should no more go over the earth" ([Isa
54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009).md).

for--that is, "though the imagination is evil"; instead of inflicting
another destructive flood, I shall spare them--to enjoy the blessings of
grace, through a Saviour.

[Genesis 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 8:22</span></span>

While the earth remaineth--The consummation, as intimated in [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md), does not frustrate a promise
which held good only during the continuance of that system. There will
be no flood between this and that day, when the earth therein shall be
burnt up \[CHALMERS\].
