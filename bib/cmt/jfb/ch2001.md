[2 Chronicles 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 1:2</span></span>

SOLEMN OFFERING OF SOLOMON AT GIBEON. ([Ch2
1:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#001).md)

Then Solomon spake unto all Israel--The heads, or leading officers, who
are afterwards specified, were summoned to attend their sovereign in a
solemn religious procession. The date of this occurrence was the second
year of Solomon's reign, and the high place at Gibeon was chosen for the
performance of the sacred rites, because the tabernacle and all the
ancient furniture connected with the national worship were deposited
there. Zadok was the officiating high priest ([Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039).md). It is true that the ark had
been removed and placed in a new tent which David had made for it at
Jerusalem \[[Ch2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#004.md)\]. But the brazen
altar, "before the tabernacle of the Lord," on which the burnt offerings
were appointed by the law to be made, was at Gibeon. And although David
had been led by extraordinary events and tokens of the divine presence
to sacrifice on the threshing-floor of Araunah, Solomon considered it
his duty to present his offerings on the legally appointed spot "before
the tabernacle," and on the time-honored altar prepared by the skill of
Bezaleel in the wilderness ([Exo
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#001).md).

[2 Chronicles 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 1:6</span></span>

offered a thousand burnt offerings--This holocaust he offered, of
course, by the hands of the priests. The magnitude of the oblation
became the rank of the offerer on this occasion of national solemnity.

[2 Chronicles 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 1:7</span></span>

HIS CHOICE OF WISDOM IS BLESSED BY GOD. ([Ch2
1:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#007).md)

In that night did God appear unto Solomon--(See on [Kg1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#005).md).

[2 Chronicles 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 1:14</span></span>

HIS STRENGTH AND WEALTH. ([Ch2
1:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014).md)

Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen--His passion for horses was
greater than that of any Israelitish monarch before or after him. His
stud comprised fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses.
This was a prohibited indulgence, whether as an instrument of luxury or
power. But it was not merely for his own use that he imported the horses
of Egypt. The immense equestrian establishment he erected was not for
show merely, but also for profit. The Egyptian breed of horses was
highly valued; and being as fine as the Arabian, but larger and more
powerful, they were well fitted for being yoked in chariots. These were
light but compact and solid vehicles, without springs. From the price
stated ([Ch2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017).md) as given for a
chariot and a horse, it appears that the chariot cost four times the
value of a horse. A horse brought a 150 shekels, which, estimating the
shekels at 2s. 3d. or 2s. 6d., amount to Â£17 2s. or Â£18 15s., while a
chariot brought 600 shekels, equal to Â£68 9s. or Â£75; and as an
Egyptian chariot was usually drawn by two horses, a chariot and pair
would cost Â£112 sterling. As the Syrians, who were fond of the Egyptian
breed of horses, could import them into their own country only through
Judea, Solomon early perceived the commercial advantages to be derived
from this trade, and established a monopoly. His factors or agents
purchased them in the markets or fairs of Egypt and brought them to the
"chariot cities," the depots and stables he had erected on the frontiers
of his kingdom, such as Bethmarcaboth, "the house of chariots," and
Hazarsusah, "the village of horses" ([Jos
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#005.md); [Kg1
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028).md).

[2 Chronicles 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 1:17</span></span>

brought . . . for all the kings of the Hittites--A branch of this
powerful tribe, when expelled from Palestine, had settled north of
Lebanon, where they acquired large possessions contiguous to the
Syrians.
