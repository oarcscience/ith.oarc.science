### [2 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)

[2 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 1:1</span></span>

This Epistle is the last testament and swan-like death song of Paul
\[BENGEL\].

according to the promise of life . . . in Christ--Paul's apostleship is
in order to carry into effect this promise. Compare "according to the
faith . . . in hope of eternal life . . . promise," &c. ([Tit
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)). This "promise of life in
Christ" (compare [Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Ti2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008)) was needed to nerve Timothy to
fortitude amidst trials, and to boldness in undertaking the journey to
Rome, which would be attended with much risk ([Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)).

[2 Timothy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 1:2</span></span>

my dearly beloved son--In [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002),
and [Tit 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004), written at an earlier
period than this Epistle, the expression used is in the Greek, "my
genuine son." ALFORD sees in the change of expression an intimation of
an altered tone as to Timothy, more of mere love, and less of
confidence, as though Paul saw m him a want of firmness, whence arose
the need of his stirring up afresh the faith and grace in Him ([Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006)). But this seems to me not
justified by the Greek word agapetos, which implies the attachment of
reasoning and choice, on the ground of merit in the one "beloved," not
of merely instinctive love. See TRENCH \[Greek Synonyms of the New
Testament\].

[2 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 1:3</span></span>

I thank--Greek, "I feel gratitude to God."

whom I serve from my forefathers--whom I serve ([Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)) as did my forefathers. He does
not mean to put on the same footing the Jewish and Christian service of
God; but simply to assert his own conscientious service of God as he had
received it from his progenitors (not Abraham, Isaac, &c., whom he calls
"the fathers," not "progenitors" as the Greek is here; [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)). The memory of those who had gone
before to whom he is about to be gathered, is now, on the eve of death,
pleasant to him; hence also, he calls to mind the faith of the mother
and grandmother of Timothy; as he walks in the faith of his forefathers
([Act 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001); [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014); [Act
26:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006); [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020)), so Timothy should persevere
firmly in the faith of his parent and grandparent. Not only Paul, but
the Jews who reject Christ, forsake the faith of their forefathers, who
looked for Christ; when they accept Him, the hearts of the children
shall only be returning to the faith of their forefathers ([Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006); [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017); [Rom
11:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023), [Rom
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028)). Probably Paul had, in his
recent defense, dwelt on this topic, namely, that he was, in being a
Christian, only following his hereditary faith.

that . . . I have remembrance of thee--"how unceasing I make my mention
concerning thee" (compare [Plm 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004)).
The cause of Paul's feeling thankful is, not that he remembers Timothy
unceasingly in his prayers, but for what Timothy is in faith ([Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005)) and graces; compare [Rom
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008), from which supply the
elliptical sentence thus, "I thank God (for thee, for God is my witness)
whom I serve . . . that (or how) without ceasing I have remembrance (or
make mention) of thee," &c.

night and day--(See on [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005)).

[2 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 1:4</span></span>

desiring--Greek, "with yearning as for one much missed."

mindful of thy tears--not only at our parting ([Act
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037)), but also often when under
pious feelings.

that I may be filled with joy--to be joined with "desiring to see thee"
([Rom 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011); [Rom
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032)).

[2 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 1:5</span></span>

When I call to remembrance--This increased his "desire to see" Timothy.
The oldest manuscripts read, "When I called to remembrance"; implying
that some recent incident (perhaps the contrasted cowardice of the
hypocrite Demas, who forsook him) had reminded him of the sincerity of
Timothy's faith.

faith that is in thee--ALFORD translates, "that was in thee." He
remembers Timothy's faith in the past as a fact; its present existence
in him is only matter of his confident persuasion or hope.

which--Greek, "such as."

dwelt--"made its dwelling" or abode ([Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)). The past tense implies they
were now dead.

first--before it dwelt in thee. She was the furthest back of the
progenitors of Timothy whom Paul knew.

mother Eunice--a believing Jewess; but his father was a Greek, that is,
a heathen ([Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001)). The faith of
the one parent sanctified the child ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015); [Co1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014)). She was probably converted at
Paul's first visit to Lystra ([Act
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)). It is an undesigned
coincidence, and so a mark of truth, that in [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001) the belief of the mother alone is
mentioned, just as here praise is bestowed on the faith of the mother,
while no notice is taken of the father \[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr;
PaulinÃ&brvbr;\].

and--Greek, "but," that is, notwithstanding appearances \[ALFORD\].

persuaded that--it dwells, or it shall dwell "in thee also." The mention
of the faith of his mother and grandmother is designed as an incentive
to stir up his faith.

[2 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 1:6</span></span>

Wherefore--Greek, "For which cause," namely, because thou hast
inherited, didst once possess, and I trust ("am persuaded") still dost
possess, such unfeigned faith \[ALFORD\].

stir up--literally, "rekindle," "revive the spark of"; the opposite of
"quench" or "extinguish" ([Th1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)).
Paul does not doubt the existence of real faith in Timothy, but he
desires it to be put into active exercise. Timothy seems to have become
somewhat remiss from being so long without Paul ([Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022)).

gift of God--the spiritual grace received for his ministerial office,
either at his original ordination, or at his consecration to the
particular office of superintending the Ephesian Church (see on [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)), imparting fearlessness, power,
love, and a sound mind ([Ti2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)).

by the putting on of my hands--In [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014), it is "with \[not by\] the
laying on of the hands of the presbytery." The apostle was chief in the
ordination, and to him "BY" is applied. The presbytery were his
assistants; so "with," implying merely accompaniment, is said of them.
Paul was the instrument in Timothy's ordination and reception of the
grace then conferred; the presbyters were the concurrent participants in
the act of ordination; so the Greek, "dia" and "meta." So in ordinations
by a bishop in our days, he does the principal act; they join in laying
on hands with him.

[2 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 1:7</span></span>

For, &c.--implying that Timothy needed the exhortation "to stir up the
gift of God in him," being constitutionally "timid": "For God did not
give us (so the Greek, namely, at our ordination or consecration) the
spirit of fear." The spirit which He gave us, was not the spirit of
timidity (literally, "cowardice," which is weakness), but of "power"
(exhibited in a fearless "testimony" for Christ, [Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)). "Power is the invariable
accompaniment of the gift of the Holy Ghost. [Luk
24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008); compare [Act
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006), "full of faith and of the Holy
Ghost," with [Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008), "full of faith
and power." Fear is the result of "the spirit of bondage" ([Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015)). Fear within exaggerates the
causes of fear without. "The spirit of power" is the spirit of man dwelt
in by the Spirit of God imparting power; this power "casteth out fear"
from ourselves, and stimulates us to try to cast it out of others ([Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)).

love--which moves the believer while "speaking the truth" with power,
when giving his testimony for Christ ([Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)), at the same time to do so "in
love" ([Eph 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015)).

a sound mind--The Greek, is rather, "the bringing of men to a sound
mind" \[WAHL\]. BENGEL supports English Version, "a sound mind," or
"sober-mindedness"; a duty to which a young man like Timothy especially
needed to be exhorted ([Ti2 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012); [Tit
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004), [Tit
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006)). So Paul urges him, in [Ti2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004), to give up worldly entanglements,
which as thorns ([Luk 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014)) choke the
word. These three gifts are preferable to any miraculous powers
whatever.

[2 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 1:8</span></span>

therefore--seeing that God hath given us such a spirit, not that of
fear.

Be not thou . . . ashamed--I agree with ELLICOTT, in opposition to
ALFORD, that the Greek subjunctive here, with the negative, implies
action completed at one time, not continued action, which the present
imperative would express; thus implying that Timothy had not decidedly
yet evinced such feeling of shame; though I think, Paul, amidst the
desertion of others who once promised fair, and from being aware of
Timothy's constitutional timidity (see on [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)), felt it necessary to stir him up
and guard him against the possibility of unchristian dereliction of duty
as to bold confession of Christ. Shame ([Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)) is the companion of fear ([Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)); if fear be overcome, false shame
flees \[BENGEL\]. Paul himself ([Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)), and Onesiphorus ([Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)), were instances of fearless
profession removing false shame. He presents in contrast sad instances
of fear and shame ([Ti2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015)).

of the testimony of our Lord--of the testimony which thou art bound to
give in the cause of our Lord; he says "our," to connect Timothy and
himself together in the testimony which both should give for their
common Lord. The testimony which Christ gave before Pilate ([Ti1
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012)), is an incentive to the
believer that he should, after His Lord's example, witness a good
testimony or confession.

nor of me his prisoner--The cause of God's servants is the cause of God
Himself ([Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)). Timothy might
easily be tempted to be ashamed of one in prison, especially as not only
worldly shame, but great risk, attended any recognition of Paul the
prisoner.

be thou partaker--with me.

of the gospel--rather, as Greek, "for the Gospel," that is, suffered for
the Gospel ([Ti2 2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003); [Plm
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#013)).

according to the power of God--exhibited in having saved and called us
([Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)). God who has done the
greater act of power (that is, saved us), will surely do the less (carry
us safe through afflictions borne for the Gospel). "Think not that thou
hast to bear these afflictions by thine own power; nay, it is by the
power of God. It was a greater exercise of power than His making the
heaven, His persuading the world to embrace salvation" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[2 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 1:9</span></span>

Who . . . called us--namely, God the Father ([Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)). The having "saved us" in His
eternal purpose of "grace, given us in Christ before the world began,"
precedes his actual "calling" of us in due time with a call made
effective to us by the Holy Spirit; therefore, "saved us" comes before
"called us" ([Rom 8:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)).

holy calling--the actual call to a life of holiness. [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001), "heavenly calling" \[TITTMANN,
Greek Synonyms of the New Testament\]; whereas we were sinners and
enemies ([Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)). The call comes wholly from God
and claims us wholly for God. "Holy" implies the separation of believers
from the rest of the world unto God.

not according to--not having regard to our works in His election and
calling of grace ([Rom 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011); [Eph
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008)).

his own purpose--The origination of salvation was of His own purpose,
flowing from His own goodness, not for works of ours coming first, but
wholly because of His own gratuitous, electing love \[THEODORET and
CALVIN\].

grace . . . given us--in His everlasting purpose, regarded as the same
as when actually accomplished in due time.

in Christ--believers being regarded by God as IN HIM, with whom the
Father makes the covenant of salvation ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)).

before the world began--Greek, "before the times (periods) of ages"; the
enduring ages of which no end is contemplated ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007); [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)).

[2 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 1:10</span></span>

But . . . now . . . manifest--in contrast to its concealment heretofore
in the eternal purpose of God "before the world began" ([Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016); [Tit
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)).

appearing--the visible manifestation in the flesh.

abolished death--Greek, "taken away the power from death" \[TITTMANN\].
The Greek article before "death" implies that Christ abolished death,
not only in some particular instance, but in its very essence, being,
and idea, as well as in all its aspects and consequences ([Joh
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026); [Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002), [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038); [Co1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026), [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055); [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)). The carrying out of the
abolition of death into full effect is to be at the resurrection ([Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014)). The death of the body
meanwhile is but temporary, and is made no account of by Christ and the
apostles.

brought . . . to light--making visible by the Gospel what was before
hidden in God's purpose.

life--of the Spirit, acting first on the soul here, about to act on the
body also at the resurrection.

immortality--Greek, "incorruptibility" of the new life, not merely of
the risen body \[ALFORD\], ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)).

through--by means of the Gospel, which brings to light the life and
immortality purposed by God from eternity, but manifested now first to
man by Christ, who in His own resurrection has given the pledge of His
people's final triumph over death through Him. Before the Gospel
revelation from God, man, by the light of nature, under the most
favorable circumstances, had but a glimmering idea of the possibility of
a future being of the soul, but not the faintest idea of the
resurrection of the body ([Act 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018),
[Act 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032)). If Christ were not "the
life," the dead could never live; if He were not the resurrection, they
could never rise; had He not the keys of hell and death ([Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)), we could never break through
the bars of death or gates of hell \[BISHOP PEARSON\].

[2 Timothy 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 1:11</span></span>

Whereunto--For the publication of which Gospel.

I am appointed--Greek, "I was appointed."

preacher--Greek, "herald."

teacher of the Gentiles-- ([Ti1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#007)).
He brings forward his own example in this verse and [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012), as a pattern for Timothy, as a
public "preacher," an "apostle," or missionary from place to place, and
a "teacher" in private instructing His flock with patient perseverance.

[2 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 1:12</span></span>

For the which cause--For the Gospel cause of which I was appointed a
preacher ([Ti2 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)).

I also suffer--besides my active work as a missionary. ELLICOTT
translates, "I suffer even these things"; the sufferings attendant on my
being a prisoner ([Ti2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008), [Ti2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015)).

I am not ashamed--neither be thou ([Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008)).

for--Confidence as to the future drives away shame \[BENGEL\].

I know--though the world knows Him not ([Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014); [Joh
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025)).

whom--I know what a faithful, promise-keeping God He is ([Ti2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013)). It is not, I know how I have
believed, but, I know WHOM I have believed; a feeble faith may clasp a
strong Saviour.

believed--rather, "trusted"; carrying out the metaphor of a depositor
depositing his pledge with one whom he trusts.

am persuaded-- ([Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038)).

he is able--in spite of so many foes around me.

that which I have committed unto him--Greek, "my deposit"; the body,
soul, and spirit, which I have deposited in God's safe keeping ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019)). So Christ Himself in dying
([Luk 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046)). "God deposits with us
His word; we deposit with God our spirit" \[GROTIUS\]. There is one
deposit (His revelation) committed by God to us, which we ought to keep
([Ti2 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013)) and transmit to others
([Ti2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)); there is another committed
by God to us, which we should commit to His keeping, namely, ourselves
and our heavenly portion.

that day--the day of His appearing ([Ti2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)).

[2 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 1:13</span></span>

Hold fast the form--rather as Greek, "Have (that is, keep) a pattern of
sound (Greek, 'healthy') words which thou hast heard from me, in faith
and love." "Keep" suits the reference to a deposit in the context. The
secondary position of the verb in the Greek forbids our taking it so
strongly as English Version, "Hold fast." The Greek for "form" is
translated "pattern" in [Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016), the
only other passage where it occurs. Have such a pattern drawn from my
sound words, in opposition to the unsound doctrines so current at
Ephesus, vividly impressed (WAHL translates it "delineation"; the verb
implies "to make a lively and lasting impress") on thy mind.

in faith and love--the element IN which my sound words had place, and in
which thou art to have the vivid impression of them as thy inwardly
delineated pattern, moulding conformably thy outward profession. So
nearly BENGEL explains, [Ti1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009).

[2 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 1:14</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "That goodly deposit keep through the Holy Ghost,"
namely, "the sound words which I have committed to thee" ([Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002)).

in us--in all believers, not merely in you and me. The indwelling Spirit
enables us to keep from the robbers of the soul the deposit of His word
committed to us by God.

[2 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 1:15</span></span>

all they which are in Asia--Proconsular Asia; "all who are there now,
when they were in Rome (not 'be' or 'are,' but) turned from me" then;
were "ashamed of my chain," in contrast to ONESIPHORUS; did not stand
with me but forsook me ([Ti2 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)). It
is possible that the occasion of their turning from him was at his
apprehension in Nicopolis, whither they had escorted him on his way to
Rome, but from which they turned back to Asia. A hint to Timothy, now in
Asia, not to be like them, but to imitate rather ONESIPHORUS, and to
come to him ([Ti2 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021)).

Phygellus and Hermogenes--specified perhaps, as being persons from whom
such pusillanimous conduct could least be expected; or, as being well
known to Timothy, and spoken of before in conversations between him and
Paul, when the latter was in Asia Minor.

[2 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 1:16</span></span>

The Lord give mercy--even as ONESIPHORUS had abounded in works of mercy.

the house of Onesiphorus--He himself was then absent from Ephesus, which
accounts for the form of expression ([Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019)). His household would hardly
retain his name after the master was dead, as BENGEL supposes him to
have been. Nowhere has Paul prayers for the dead, which is fatal to the
theory, favored by ALFORD also, that he was dead. God blesses not only
the righteous man himself, but all his household.

my chain--Paul in the second, as in his first imprisonment, was bound by
a chain to the soldier who guarded him.

found me--in the crowded metropolis. So in turn "may he find mercy of
the Lord in that day" when the whole universe shall be assembled.

grant unto him--as well as "unto his house" ([Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)).

the Lord--who rewards a kindness done to His disciples as if done to
Himself ([Mat 25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045)).

of--from the Lord; "the Lord" is emphatically put instead of "from
Himself," for solemnity and emphasis ([Th2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005)).

in how many things--"how many acts of ministry he rendered."

unto me--omitted in the oldest manuscripts, so that the "ministered" may
include services rendered to others as well as to Paul.

very well--rather as Greek, "Thou knowest better" (than I can tell thee,
seeing that thou art more of a regular resident at Ephesus).
