<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_000">hos 0:0</A></FONT></span></p>THE first of the twelve minor prophets in the order of the canon (called "minor," not as less in point of inspired authority, but simply in point of size). The twelve are first mentioned by Jesus, the son of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus 49:10). St. Stephen, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042">Act 7:42</A> (in referring to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027">Amo 5:27</A>), quotes them as forming one collective body of writings, "the book of the prophets." So JEROME and MELITO, the first Greek father who has left us a catalogue of these books. The collection of the sacred books is by Jewish tradition attributed to the great synagogue of learned scribes formed by Ezra. Many think Nehemiah completed this collection by adding to the books already in the canon those of his own times. Malachi, the last in the series, probably aided him in determining with infallible authority what books were entitled to be ranked in the inspired canon. The chronological order differs from the canonical. Joel, about 810 B.C.; Jonah, about 810 B.C., or, as others, first, 862 B.C.; Amos, about 790 B.C.; Hosea, about 784 B.C. Hosea, the contemporary of Isaiah, Micah, and Amos, seems to have entered on his prophetical office in the last years of Jeroboam (contemporary in part with Uzziah), and to have ended it in the beginning of Hezekiah's reign, 722 B.C., that is, about sixty years in all, from 784 B.C. to 722 B.C. The prophets, however, were not uninterruptedly engaged in prophesying. Considerable intervals elapsed, though their office as divinely commissioned public teachers was never wholly laid aside. The Book of Hosea which we have constitutes only that portion of his public teachings which the Holy Spirit saw fit to preserve for the benefit of the Church. The cause of his being placed first of the twelve was, probably, the length, the vivid earnestness, and patriotism of his prophecies, as well as their closer resemblance to those of the greater prophets. His style is abrupt, sententious, and unrounded; the connecting particles are few; there are changes of person, and anomalies of gender, number, and construction. His name means Salvation. He was son of Beeri, of the tribe of Issachar, born in Beth-shemesh [JEROME]. His mention, in the inscription, of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, is no proof that he belonged to Judah: for the prophets in Israel regarded its separation from Judah, civil as well as religious, as an apostasy from God, who promised the dominion of the theocracy to the line of David. Hence Elijah in Israel took twelve stones to represent Judah, as well as Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#031">Kg1 18:31</A>). Hence Hosea dates from Judah's kings, as well as from Jeroboam of Israel, though he belonged to Israel, with whose sins and fate his book is chiefly occupied. He, however, makes incidental references to Judah. His first prophecy foretells the overthrow of Jehu's house, fulfilled on the death of Jeroboam, Jehu's great-grandson (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#012">Kg2 15:12</A>), in Zachariah, Jeroboam's son, the fourth and last from Jehu, conspired against by Shallum. This first prediction was doubtless in Jeroboam's life, as Zachariah, his son, was only suffered to reign six months; thus the inscription is verified that "the word of the Lord came unto him in the days of Jeroboam" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</A>). Again, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014">Hos 10:14</A>, Shalmaneser's expedition against Israel is alluded to as past, that is, the first inroad against King Hoshea, who began to reign in the twelfth year of Ahaz; so that as Ahaz' whole reign was sixteen years, the prophecy seems to have been given about the beginning of Hezekiah's reign. Thus the inscription is confirmed that the exercise of his prophetical functions was of such a protracted duration.

<p>Hosea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001">Hos 11:1</A>) is quoted in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015">Mat 2:15</A>; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hos 6:6</A> in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013">Mat 9:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007">Mat 12:7</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025">Rom 9:25-26</A>, quoting <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001">Hos 2:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055">Co1 15:55</A>, quoting <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014">Hos 13:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010">Pe1 2:10</A>, quoting <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009">Hos 1:9-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</A>. Messianic references are not frequent; but the predictions of the future conversion of Israel to the Lord their God, and David their king, and of the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham that his spiritual seed should be as the sand of the sea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hos 3:5</A>), clearly refer to the New Testament dispensation.
