### [Nehemiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 8:1</span></span>

RELIGIOUS MANNER OF READING AND HEARING THE LAW. ([Neh
8:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#001).md)

all the people gathered themselves together as one man--The occasion was
the celebration of the feast of the seventh month ([Neh
7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073).md). The beginning of every month
was ushered in as a sacred festival; but this, the commencement of the
seventh month, was kept with distinguished honor as "the feast of
trumpets," which extended over two days. It was the first day of the
seventh ecclesiastical year, and the new year's day of the Jewish civil
year, on which account it was held as "a great day." The place where the
general concourse of people was held was "at the water gate," on the
south rampart. Through that gate the Nethinims or Gibeonites brought
water into the temple, and there was a spacious area in front of it.

they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of
Moses--He had come to Jerusalem twelve or thirteen years previous to
Nehemiah. He either remained there or had returned to Babylon in
obedience to the royal order, and for the discharge of important duties.
He had returned along with Nehemiah, but in a subordinate capacity. From
the time of Nehemiah's appointment to the dignity of tirshatha, Ezra had
retired into private life. Although cordially and zealously co-operating
with the former patriot in his important measures of reform, the pious
priest had devoted his time and attention principally toward producing a
complete edition of the canonical Scriptures. The public reading of the
Scriptures was required by the law to be made every seventh year; but
during the long period of the captivity this excellent practice, with
many others, had fallen into neglect, till revived, on this occasion.
That there was a strong and general desire among the returned exiles in
Jerusalem to hear the word of God read to them indicates a greatly
improved tone of religious feeling.

[Nehemiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 8:4</span></span>

Ezra . . . stood upon a pulpit of wood--Not made in the form known to
us, but only a raised scaffold or platform, broad enough to allow
fourteen persons to stand with ease upon it. Ezra's duty was very
laborious, as he continued reading aloud from morning until midday, but
his labor was lightened by the aid of the other priests present. Their
presence was of importance, partly to show their cordial agreement with
Ezra's declaration of divine truth; and partly to take their share with
him in the important duty of publicly reading and expounding the
Scripture.

[Nehemiah 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 8:5</span></span>

when he opened it, all the people stood up--This attitude they assumed
either from respect to God's word, or, rather, because the reading was
prefaced by a solemn prayer, which was concluded by a general expression
of "Amen, Amen."

[Nehemiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">neh 8:7</span></span>

caused the people to understand the law . . . gave the
sense--Commentators are divided in opinion as to the import of this
statement. Some think that Ezra read the law in pure Hebrew, while the
Levites, who assisted him, translated it sentence by sentence into
Chaldee, the vernacular dialect which the exiles spoke in Babylon.
Others maintain that the duty of these Levites consisted in explaining
to the people, many of whom had become very ignorant, what Ezra had
read.

[Nehemiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">neh 8:9</span></span>

THE PEOPLE COMFORTED. ([Neh 8:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#009).md)

This day is holy unto the Lord . . . mourn not, nor weep--A deep sense
of their national sins, impressively brought to their remembrance by the
reading of the law and its denunciations, affected the hearts of the
people with penitential sorrow. But notwithstanding the painful
remembrances of their national sins which the reading of the law
awakened, the people were exhorted to cherish the feelings of joy and
thankfulness associated with a sacred festival (see on [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024).md). By sending portions of it to
their poorer brethren ([Deu 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md),
[Deu 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014.md); [Est
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019).md), they would also enable them to
participate in the public rejoicings.

[Nehemiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 8:16</span></span>

THEY KEEP THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES. ([Neh
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#016).md)

the people went forth, and brought . . . and made themselves booths,
&c.--(See on [Lev 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md); [Deu
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013).md).

[Nehemiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">neh 8:17</span></span>

since the days of Jeshua . . . had not the children of Israel done
so--This national feast had not been neglected for so protracted a
period. Besides that it is impossible that such a flagrant disregard of
the law could have been tolerated by Samuel, David, and other pious
rulers, its observance is sufficiently indicated ([Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md), [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md); [Ch2
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009).md) and expressly recorded ([Ezr
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#004).md). But the meaning is, that the
popular feelings had never been raised to such a height of enthusiastic
joy since the time of their entrance into Canaan, as now on their return
after a long and painful captivity.

[Nehemiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">neh 8:18</span></span>

Also day by day . . . he read in the book of the law of God--This was
more than was enjoined ([Deu
31:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010).md), and arose from the
exuberant zeal of the time.

on the eighth day was a solemn assembly--This was the last and great day
of the feast (see on [Num 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035).md). In
later times, other ceremonies which increased the rejoicing were added
([Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md).
