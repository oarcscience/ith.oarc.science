### [1 Corinthians Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 13:1</span></span>

CHARITY OR LOVE SUPERIOR TO ALL GIFTS. ([Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001))

tongues--from these he ascends to "prophecy" ([Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002)); then, to "faith"; then to
benevolent and self-sacrificing deeds: a climax. He does not except even
himself, and so passes from addressing them ("unto you," [Co1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#031)) to putting the case in his own
person, "Though I," &c.

speak with the tongues--with the eloquence which was so much admired at
Corinth (for example, Apollos, [Act
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024); compare [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012); [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)), and with the command of
various languages, which some at Corinth abused to purposes of mere
ostentation ([Co1 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#002), &c.).

of angels--higher than men, and therefore, it is to be supposed,
speaking a more exalted language.

charity--the principle of the ordinary and more important gifts of the
Spirit, as contrasted with the extraordinary gifts (1Co. 12:1-31).

sounding . . . tinkling--sound without soul or feeling: such are
"tongues" without charity.

cymbal--Two kinds are noticed ([Psa
150:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa150.htm#005)), the loud or clear, and the
high-sounding one: hand cymbals and finger cymbals, or castanets. The
sound is sharp and piercing.

[1 Corinthians 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 13:2</span></span>

mysteries-- ([Rom 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025)). Mysteries refer to the deep
counsels of God hitherto secret, but now revealed to His saints.
Knowledge, to truths long known.

faith . . . remove mountains-- ([Mat
17:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020); [Mat
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#021)). The practical power of the
will elevated by faith \[NEANDER\]; confidence in God that the
miraculous result will surely follow the exercise of the will at the
secret impulse of His Spirit. Without "love" prophecy, knowledge, and
faith, are not what they seem (compare [Co1
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001); [Mat
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022); [Jam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014); compare [Co1
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)), and so fail of the heavenly
reward ([Mat 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#002)). Thus Paul, who
teaches justification by faith only ([Rom
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016); [Gal
3:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007)), is shown to agree with James,
who teaches ([Jam 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#024)) "by works"
(that is, by LOVE, which is the "spirit" of faith, [Jam
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#026)) a man is justified, "and not by
faith only."

[1 Corinthians 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 13:3</span></span>

bestow . . . goods . . . poor--literally, "dole out in food" all my
goods; one of the highest functions of the "helps" ([Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028)).

give . . . body to be burned--literally, "to such a degree as that I
should be burned." As the three youths did ([Dan
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028)), "yielded their bodies" (compare
[Co2 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#015)). These are most noble
exemplifications of love in giving and in suffering. Yet they may be
without love; in which case the "goods" and "body" are given, but not
the soul, which is the sphere of love. Without the soul God rejects all
else, and so rejects the man, who is therefore "profited" nothing ([Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026); [Luk
9:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)). Men will fight for
Christianity, and die for Christianity, but not live in its spirit,
which is love.

[1 Corinthians 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 13:4</span></span>

suffereth long--under provocations of evil from others. The negative
side of love.

is kind--the positive side. Extending good to others. Compare with
love's features here those of the "wisdom from above" ([Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017)).

envieth--The Greek includes also jealousy.

vaunteth not--in words, even of gifts which it really possesses; an
indirect rebuke of those at Corinth who used the gift of tongues for
mere display.

not puffed up--with party zeal, as some at Corinth were ([Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006)).

[1 Corinthians 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 13:5</span></span>

not . . . unseemly--is not uncourteous, or inattentive to civility and
propriety.

thinketh no evil--imputeth not evil \[ALFORD\]; literally, "the evil"
which actually is there ([Pro 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012);
[Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008)). Love makes allowances for
the falls of others, and is ready to put on them a charitable
construction. Love, so far from devising evil against another, excuses
"the evil" which another inflicts on her \[ESTIUS\]; doth not meditate
upon evil inflicted by another \[BENGEL\]; and in doubtful cases, takes
the more charitable view \[GROTIUS\].

[1 Corinthians 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 13:6</span></span>

rejoiceth in the truth--rather, "rejoiceth with the truth." Exults not
at the perpetration of iniquity (unrighteousness) by others (compare
[Gen 9:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#022)), but rejoices when the
truth rejoices; sympathizes with it in its triumphs ([Jo2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004)). See the opposite ([Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)), "Resist the truth." So "the
truth" and "unrighteousness" are contrasted ([Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008)). "The truth" is the Gospel truth,
the inseparable ally of love ([Eph
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015); [Jo2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012)). The false charity which
compromises "the truth" by glossing over "iniquity" or unrighteousness
is thus tacitly condemned ([Pro
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015)).

[1 Corinthians 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 13:7</span></span>

Beareth all things--without speaking of what it has to bear. The same
Greek verb as in [Co1 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012). It endures
without divulging to the world personal distress. Literally said of
holding fast like a watertight vessel; so the charitable man contains
himself in silence from giving vent to what selfishness would prompt
under personal hardship.

believeth all things--unsuspiciously believes all that is not palpably
false, all that it can with a good conscience believe to the credit of
another. Compare [Jam 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017), "easy to
be entreated"; Greek, "easily persuaded."

hopeth--what is good of another, even when others have ceased to hope.

endureth--persecutions in a patient and loving spirit.

[1 Corinthians 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 13:8</span></span>

never faileth--never is to be out of use; it always holds its place.

shall fail . . . vanish away--The same Greek verb is used for both; and
that different from the Greek verb for "faileth." Translate, "Shall be
done away with," that is, shall be dispensed with at the Lord's coming,
being superseded by their more perfect heavenly analogues; for instance,
knowledge by intuition. Of "tongues," which are still more temporary,
the verb is "shall cease." A primary fulfilment of Paul's statement took
place when the Church attained its maturity; then "tongues" entirely
"ceased," and "prophesyings" and "knowledge," so far as they were
supernatural gifts of the Spirit, were superseded as no longer required
when the ordinary preaching of the word, and the Scriptures of the New
Testament collected together, had become established institutions.

[1 Corinthians 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 13:9</span></span>

in part--partially and imperfectly. Compare a similar contrast to the
"perfect man," "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"
([Eph 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)).

[1 Corinthians 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 13:10</span></span>

that which is in part--fragmentary and isolated.

[1 Corinthians 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 13:11</span></span>

When . . . a child-- ([Co1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001); [Co1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020)).

I spake--alluding to "tongues."

understood--or, "had the sentiments of." Alluding to "prophecy."

I thought--Greek "reasoned" or "judged"; alluding to "knowledge."

when I became . . . I put away--rather, "now that I am become a man, I
have done away with the things of the child."

[1 Corinthians 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 13:12</span></span>

now--in our present state.

see--an appropriate expression, in connection with the "prophets" of
seers ([Sa1 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009)).

through a glass--that is, in a mirror; the reflection seeming to the eye
to be behind the mirror, so that we see it through the mirror. Ancient
mirrors were made of polished brass or other metals. The contrast is
between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by seeing it
reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were), compared with
the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself directly.

darkly--literally, "in enigma." As a "mirror" conveys an image to the
eye, so an "enigma" to the ear. But neither "eye nor ear" can fully
represent (though the believer's soul gets a small revelation now of)
"the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him" ([Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)). Paul alludes to [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008), "not in dark speeches"; the
Septuagint, "not in enigmas." Compared with the visions and dreams
vouchsafed to other prophets, God's communications with Moses were "not
in enigmas." But compared with the intuitive and direct vision of God
hereafter, even the revealed word now is "a dark discourse," or a
shadowing forth by enigma of God's reflected likeness. Compare [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019), where the "light" or candle in a
dark place stands in contrast with the "day" dawning. God's word is
called a glass or mirror also in [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).

then--"when that which is perfect is come" ([Co1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#010)).

face to face--not merely "mouth to mouth" ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008)). [Gen
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#030) was a type ([Joh
1:50-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050)).

know . . . known--rather as Greek, "fully know . . . fully known." Now
we are known by, rather than know, God ([Co1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003); [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)).

[1 Corinthians 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 13:13</span></span>

And now--Translate, "But now." "In this present state" \[HENDERSON\].
Or, "now" does not express time, but opposition, as in [Co1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011), "the case being so" \[GROTIUS\];
whereas it is the case that the three gifts, "prophecy," "tongues," and
"knowledge" (cited as specimens of the whole class of gifts) "fail"
([Co1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)), there abide permanently
only these three--faith, hope, charity. In one sense faith and hope
shall be done away, faith being superseded by sight, and hope by actual
fruition ([Rom 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024); [Co2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007)); and charity, or love, alone
never faileth ([Co1 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008)). But in
another sense, "faith and hope," as well as "charity," ABIDE; namely,
after the extraordinary gifts have ceased; for those three are necessary
and sufficient for salvation at all times, whereas the extraordinary
gifts are not at all so; compare the use of "abide," [Co1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#014). Charity, or love, is connected
specially with the Holy Spirit, who is the bond of the loving union
between the brethren ([Rom 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030); [Col
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008)). Faith is towards God. Hope is in
behalf of ourselves. Charity is love to God creating in us love towards
our neighbor. In an unbeliever there is more or less of the three
opposites--unbelief, despair, hatred. Even hereafter faith in the sense
of trust in God "abideth"; also "hope," in relation to ever new joys in
prospect, and at the anticipation of ever increasing blessedness, sure
never to be disappointed. But love alone in every sense "abideth"; it is
therefore "the greatest" of the three, as also because it presupposes
"faith," which without "love" and its consequent "works" is dead ([Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006); [Jam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#017), [Jam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020)).

but--rather, "and"; as there is not so strong opposition between charity
and the other two, faith and hope, which like it also "abide."
