### [Isaiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 42:1</span></span>

MESSIAH THE ANTITYPE OF CYRUS. (Isa. 42:1-25)

my servant--The law of prophetic suggestion leads Isaiah from Cyrus to
the far greater Deliverer, behind whom the former is lost sight of. The
express quotation in [Mat 12:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md),
and the description can apply to Messiah alone ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); with which compare [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md); [Joh
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md); [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md). Israel, also, in its highest
ideal, is called the "servant" of God ([Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003).md). But this ideal is realized only
in the antitypical Israel, its representative-man and Head, Messiah
(compare [Mat 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md), with [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md). "Servant" was the position
assumed by the Son of God throughout His humiliation.

elect--chosen by God before the foundation of the world for an atonement
([Pe1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md); [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md). Redemption was no afterthought
to remedy an unforeseen evil ([Rom
16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009.md), [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011.md); [Ti2
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Tit
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002).md). In [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md) it is rendered "My beloved"; the
only beloved Son, beloved in a sense distinct from all others. Election
and the love of God are inseparably joined.

soul--a human phrase applied to God, because of the intended union of
humanity with the Divinity: "I Myself."

delighteth--is well pleased with, and accepts, as a propitiation. God
could have "delighted" in no created being as a mediator (compare [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md); [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017).md).

spirit upon him-- ([Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md).

judgment--the gospel dispensation, founded on justice, the canon of the
divine rule and principle of judgment called "the law" ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); compare [Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md); [Isa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#004.md); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006).md). The Gospel has a discriminating
judicial effect: saving to penitents; condemnatory to Satan, the enemy
([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011).md), and the wilfully impenitent
([Joh 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039).md). [Mat
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018.md) has, "He shall show," for "He
shall bring forth," or "cause to go forth." Christ both produced and
announced His "judgment." The Hebrew dwells most on His producing it;
Matthew on His announcement of it: the two are joined in Him.

[Isaiah 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 42:2</span></span>

Matthew ([Mat 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019).md) marks the kind of
"cry" as that of altercation by quoting it, "He shall not strive" ([Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007).md).

street--the Septuagint translates "outside." An image from an
altercation in a house, loud enough to be heard in the street outside:
appropriate of Him who "withdrew Himself" from the public fame created
by His miracles to privacy ([Mat
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#015.md); [Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md), there, shows another and sterner
aspect of His character, which is also implied in the term "judgment").

[Isaiah 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 42:3</span></span>

bruised--"It pleased the Lord to bruise Him" ([Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md), [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md); so He can feel for the bruised.
As [Isa 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md) described His unturbulent
spirit towards His violent enemies ([Mat
12:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014).md), and His utter freedom from
love of notoriety, so [Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md), His
tenderness in cherishing the first spark of grace in the penitent ([Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md).

reed--fragile: easily "shaken with the wind" ([Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007).md). Those who are at best feeble,
and who besides are oppressed by calamity or by the sense of sin.

break--entirely crush or condemn. Compare "bind up the broken-hearted"
([Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028).md).

flax--put for the lamp-wick, formed of flax. The believer is the lamp
(so the Greek, [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015.md); [Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).md): his conscience enlightened by
the Holy Ghost is the wick. "Smoking" means "dimly burning,"
"smouldering," the flame not quite extinct. This expresses the positive
side of the penitent's religion; as "bruised reed," the negative.
Broken-hearted in himself, but not without some spark of flame:
literally, "from above." Christ will supply such a one with grace as
with oil. Also, the light of nature smouldering in the Gentiles amidst
the hurtful fumes of error. He not only did not quench, but cleared away
the mists and superadded the light of revelation. See JEROME, To
Algasia, Question 2.

truth--[Mat 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020.md) quotes it, "send
forth judgment unto victory." Matthew, under the Spirit, gives the
virtual sense, but varies the word, in order to bring out a fresh aspect
of the same thing. Truth has in itself the elements of victory over all
opposing forces. Truth is the victory of Him who is "the truth" ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md). The gospel judicial sifting
("judgment") of believers and unbelievers, begun already in part ([Joh
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039).md), will be consummated
victoriously in truth only at His second coming; [Isa
42:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md), here, and [Mat
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#032.md), [Mat
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036.md), [Mat
12:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041.md), show that there is reference
to the judicial aspect of the Gospel, especially finally: besides the
mild triumph of Jesus coming in mercy to the penitent now ([Isa
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002).md), there shall be finally the
judgment on His enemies, when the "truth" shall be perfectly developed.
Compare [Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), where the two
comings are similarly joined ([Psa
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md), [Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004.md); [Rev
19:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md). On "judgment," see on [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md).

[Isaiah 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 42:4</span></span>

fail--faint; man in religion may become as the almost expiring flax-wick
([Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003).md), but not so He in His
purposes of grace.

discouraged--literally, "broken," that is, checked in zeal by
discouragements (compare [Isa 49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004).md).
ROSENMULLER not so well translates, "He shall not be too slow on the one
hand, nor run too hastily on the other."

judgment--His true religion, the canon of His judgments and righteous
reign.

isles . . . wait, &c.--The distant lands beyond sea shall put their
trust in His gospel way of salvation. [Mat
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#021.md) virtually gives the sense, with
the inspired addition of another aspect of the same thing, "In his name
shall the Gentiles trust" (as "wait for" here means, [Isa
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md). "His law" is not something
distinct from Himself, but is indeed Himself, the manifestation of God's
character ("name") in Christ, who is the embodiment of the law ([Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md); [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md). "Isles" here, and in [Isa
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#012.md), may refer to the fact that the
populations of which the Church was primarily formed were Gentiles of
the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.

[Isaiah 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 42:5</span></span>

Previously God had spoken of Messiah; now ([Isa
42:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md) He speaks to Him. To show to
all that He is able to sustain the Messiah in His appointed work, and
that all might accept Messiah as commissioned by such a mighty God, He
commences by announcing Himself as the Almighty Creator and Preserver of
all things.

spread . . . earth-- ([Psa 136:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 42:6</span></span>

in righteousness--rather, "for a righteous purpose" \[LOWTH\]. (See [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021).md). God "set forth" His Son "to be
a propitiation (so as) to declare His (God's) righteousness, that God
might be just, and (yet) the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus"
([Rom 3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); compare see on [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md); [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md); [Isa
50:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008).md).

hold . . . hand--compare as to Israel, the type of Messiah, [Hos
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003.md).

covenant--the medium of the covenant, originally made between God and
Abraham ([Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008).md). "The mediator of
a better covenant" ([Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006).md) than the
law (see [Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); [Jer
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005).md). So the abstract "peace," for
peace-maker ([Mic 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md).

the people--Israel; as [Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md),
compared with [Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md), proves ([Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032).md).

[Isaiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 42:7</span></span>

blind--spiritually ([Isa 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016.md), [Isa
42:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018.md); [Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039).md).

prison-- ([Isa 61:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001).md).

darkness--opposed to "light" ([Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 42:8</span></span>

God turns from addressing Messiah to the people.

Lord--JEHOVAH: God's distinguishing and incommunicable name, indicating
essential being and immutable faithfulness (compare [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003.md); [Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018.md); [Psa
96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md); [Hos
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005).md).

my--that is due to Me, and to Me alone.

[Isaiah 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 42:9</span></span>

former things--Former predictions of God, which were now fulfilled, are
here adduced as proof that they ought to trust in Him alone as God;
namely, the predictions as to Israel's restoration from Babylon.

new--namely, predictions as to Messiah, who is to bring all nations to
the worship of Jehovah ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md),
[Isa 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004.md), [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006).md).

spring forth--The same image from plants just beginning to germinate
occurs in [Isa 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md); [Isa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008.md). Before there is the slightest
indication to enable a sagacious observer to infer the coming event, God
foretells it.

[Isaiah 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 42:10</span></span>

new song--such as has never before been sung, called for by a new
manifestation of God's grace, to express which no hymn for former
mercies would be appropriate. The new song shall be sung when the Lord
shall reign in Jerusalem, and all "nations shall flow unto it" ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003).md).

ye that go down to the sea--whose conversion will be the means of
diffusing the Gospel to distant lands.

all . . . therein--all the living creatures that fill the sea ([Psa
96:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#011).md) \[MAURER\]. Or, all sailors and
voyagers \[GESENIUS\]. But these were already mentioned in the previous
clause: there he called on all who go upon the sea; in this clause all
animals in the sea; so in [Isa 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md),
he calls on the inanimate wilderness to lift up its voice. External
nature shall be so renovated as to be in unison with the moral
renovation.

[Isaiah 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 42:11</span></span>

cities--in a region not wholly waste, but mainly so, with an oasis here
and there.

Kedar--in Arabia-Deserta ([Isa 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md);
[Gen 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013).md). The Kedarenians led a
nomadic, wandering life. So Kedar is here put in general for that class
of men.

rock--Sela, that is, Petra, the metropolis of Idumea and the Nabathoean
Ishmaelites. Or it may refer in general to those in
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, who had their dwellings cut out of the rock.

the mountains--namely, of Paran, south of Sinai, in Arabic PetrÃ&brvbr;a
\[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 42:12</span></span>

glory . . . islands-- ([Isa 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 42:13</span></span>

Jehovah will no longer restrain His wrath: He will go forth as a mighty
warrior ([Exo 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003).md) to destroy His
people's and His enemies, and to deliver Israel (compare [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003).md).

stir up jealousy--rouse His indignation.

roar--image from the battle cry of a warrior.

[Isaiah 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 42:14</span></span>

long time--namely, during the desolation of Israel ([Isa
32:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#014).md).

holden my peace--(Compare [Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021.md);
[Hab 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002).md).

cry like a travailing woman, &c.--Like a woman in parturition, who,
after having restrained her breathing for a time, at last, overcome with
labor pain, lets out her voice with a panting sigh; so Jehovah will give
full vent to His long pent-up wrath. Translate, instead of "destroy . .
. devour"; I will at once breathe hard and pant, namely, giving loose to
My wrath.

[Isaiah 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 42:15</span></span>

I will destroy all My foes.

mountains--in Palestine usually planted with vines and olives in
terraces, up to their tops.

islands--rather, "dry lands." God will destroy His foes, the heathen,
and their idols, and "dry up" the fountains of their oracles, their
doctrines and institutions, the symbol of which is water, and their
schools which promoted idolatry \[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 42:16</span></span>

blind--God's people, Israel, in captivity, needing a guide. In the
ulterior sense the New Testament Church, which was about to be led and
enlightened by the Son of God as its leader and shepherd in the
wilderness of the Roman empire, until it should reach a city of
habitation. "A way . . . they knew not," refers to the various means
ployed by Providence for the establishment of the Church in the world,
such as would never have occurred to the mind of mere man. "Blind," they
are called, as not having heretofore seen God's ways in ordering His
Church.

make darkness light, &c.--implies that the glorious issue would only be
known by the event itself \[VITRINGA\]. The same holds good of the
individual believer ([Isa 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md); [Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md); compare [Hos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md), [Hos
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008.md); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 42:17</span></span>

turned back . . . ashamed--disappointed in their trust; the same phrase
occurs in [Psa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md).

[Isaiah 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 42:18</span></span>

deaf--namely, to the voice of God.

blind--to your duty and interest; wilfully so ([Isa
42:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020).md). In this they differ from "the
blind" ([Isa 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#016).md). The Jews are
referred to. He had said, God would destroy the heathen idolatry; here
he remembers that even Israel, His "servant" ([Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019).md), from whom better things might
have been expected, is tainted with this sin.

[Isaiah 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 42:19</span></span>

my servant--namely, Israel. Who of the heathen is so blind? Considering
Israel's high privileges, the heathen's blindness was as nothing
compared with that of Israelite idolaters.

my messenger . . . sent--Israel was designed by God to be the herald of
His truth to other nations.

perfect--furnished with institutions, civil and religious, suited to
their perfect well-being. Compare the title, "Jeshurun," the perfect
one, applied to Israel (compare [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002).md), as the type of Messiah Or
translate, the friend of God, which Israel was by virtue of descent from
Abraham, who was so called ([Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md), \[GESENIUS\]. The language, "my
servant" (compare [Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md),
"messenger" ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md), "perfect"
([Rom 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010.md); [Pe1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022).md), can, in the full antitypical
sense, only apply to Christ. So [Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md) plainly refers to Him. "Blind"
and "deaf" in His case refer to His endurance of suffering and reproach,
as though He neither saw nor heard ([Psa
38:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013).md). Thus there is a transition
by contrast from the moral blindness of Israel ([Isa
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018).md) to the patient blindness and
deafness of Messiah \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 42:20</span></span>

observest--Thou dost not keep them. The "many things" are the many
proofs which all along from the first God had given Israel of His
goodness and His power ([Deu 4:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032.md);
[Deu 29:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#002.md); Psa. 78:1-72; Psa.
105:1-45).

he--transition from the second to the third person. "Opening . . .
ears," that is, though he (Israel) hath his ears open (see on [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010).md). This language, too (see on [Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019).md), applies to Messiah as
Jehovah's servant ([Isa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md); [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 42:21</span></span>

his righteousness--not His people's, but His own; [Isa
42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024.md) shows that they had no
righteousness ([Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md); [Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016).md). God is well pleased with His
Son ("in whom My soul delighteth," [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md), "who fulfils all righteousness"
([Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015).md) for them, and with them
for His sake (compare [Isa 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006.md); [Psa
71:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#016.md), [Psa
71:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#019.md); [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md); [Rom
10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md); [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009).md). Perhaps in God's "righteousness"
here is included His faithfulness to His promises given to Israel's
forefathers \[ROSENMULLER\]; because of this He is well pleased with
Israel, even though displeased with their sin, which He here reproves;
but that promise could only be based on the righteousness of Messiah,
the promised seed, which is God's righteousness.

[Isaiah 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 42:22</span></span>

holes--caught by their foes in the caverns where they had sought refuge
\[BARNES\]. Or bound in subterranean dungeons \[BARNES\].

prison-houses--either literal prisons, or their own houses, whence they
dare not go forth for fear of the enemy. The connection is:
Notwithstanding God's favor to His people for His righteousness' sake
([Isa 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021).md), they have fallen into
misery (the Babylonish and Romish captivities and their present
dispersion), owing to their disregard of the divine law: spiritual
imprisonment is included ([Isa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#007).md).

none saith, Restore--There is no deliverer ([Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 42:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 42:23</span></span>

A call that they should be warned by the past judgments of God to obey
Him for the time to come.

[Isaiah 42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 42:24</span></span>

Who--Their calamity was not the work of chance, but God's immediate act
for their sins.

Jacob . . . Israel . . . we--change from the third to the first person;
Isaiah first speaking to them as a prophet, distinct from them; then
identifying himself with them, and acknowledging His share in the
nation's sins (compare [Jos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 42:25</span></span>

him--Israel ([Isa 42:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#024).md).

strength of battle--violence of war.

it--the battle or war (compare [Isa
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#016).md).

knew not--knew not the lesson of repentance which the judgment was
intended to teach ([Isa 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md); [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003).md).
