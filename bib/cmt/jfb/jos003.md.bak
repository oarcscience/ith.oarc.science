### [Joshua Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 3:1</span></span>

JOSHUA COMES TO JORDAN. ([Jos 3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#001).md)

Joshua rose early in the morning--On the day following that on which the
spies had returned with their encouraging report. The camp was broken up
in "Shittim" (the acacia groves), and removed to the eastern bank of the
Jordan. The duration of their stay is indicated ([Jos
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002).md), being, according to Hebrew
reckoning, only one entire day, including the evening of arrival and the
morning of the passage; and such a time would be absolutely necessary
for so motley an assemblage of men, women, and children, with all their
gear and cattle to make ready for going into an enemy's country.

[Joshua 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 3:2</span></span>

the officers went through the host; And they commanded the people--The
instructions given at this time and in this place were different from
those described ([Jos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#011).md).

[Joshua 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 3:3</span></span>

When ye see the ark . . ., and the priests the Levites bearing it--The
usual position of the ark, when at rest, was in the center of the camp;
and, during a march, in the middle of the procession. On this occasion
it was to occupy the van, and be borne, not by the Kohathite Levites,
but the priests, as on all solemn and extraordinary occasions (compare
[Num 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md); [Jos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#006.md); [Kg1
8:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#003).md).

then ye shall . . . go after it. Yet there shall be a space between you
and it--These instructions refer exclusively to the advance into the
river. The distance which the people were to keep in the rear of the ark
was nearly a mile. Had they crowded too near the ark, the view would
have been intercepted, and this intervening space, therefore, was
ordered, that the chest containing the sacred symbols might be
distinctly visible to all parts of the camp, and be recognized as their
guide in the untrodden way.

[Joshua 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 3:5</span></span>

Joshua said unto the people--rather "had said," for as he speaks of
"to-morrow," the address must have been made previous to the day of
crossing, and the sanctification was in all probability the same as
Moses had commanded before the giving of the law, consisting of an
outward cleansing ([Exo 19:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010).md)
preparatory to that serious and devout state of mind with which so great
a manifestation should be witnessed.

[Joshua 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 3:6</span></span>

Joshua spake unto the priests--This order to the priests would be given
privately, and involving as it did an important change in the
established order of march, it must be considered as announced in the
name and by the authority of God. Moreover, as soon as the priests
stepped into the waters of Jordan, they were to stand still. The ark was
to accomplish what had been done by the rod of Moses.

[Joshua 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 3:7</span></span>

THE LORD ENCOURAGES JOSHUA. ([Jos
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#007).md)

the Lord said to Joshua, This day will I . . . magnify thee in the sight
of all Israel--Joshua had already received distinguished honors ([Exo
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013.md); [Deu
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#007).md). But a higher token of the
divine favor was now to be publicly bestowed on him, and evidence given
in the same unmistakable manner that his mission and authority were from
God as was that of Moses ([Exo 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031).md).

[Joshua 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 3:9</span></span>

JOSHUA ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE. ([Jos
3:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#009).md)

Come hither, and hear the words of the Lord--It seems that the
Israelites had no intimation how they were to cross the river till
shortly before the event. The premonitory address of Joshua, taken in
connection with the miraculous result exactly as he had described it,
would tend to increase and confirm their faith in the God of their
fathers as not a dull, senseless, inanimate thing like the idols of the
nations, but a Being of life, power, and activity to defend them and
work for them.

[Joshua 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 3:14</span></span>

THE WATERS OF JORDAN ARE DIVIDED. ([Jos
3:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014).md)

And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, &c.--To
understand the scene described we must imagine the band of priests with
the ark on their shoulders, standing on the depressed edge of the river,
while the mass of the people were at a mile's distance. Suddenly the
whole bed of the river was dried up; a spectacle the more extraordinary
in that it took place in the time of harvest, corresponding to our April
or May--when "the Jordan overfloweth all its banks." The original words
may be more properly rendered "fills all its banks." Its channel,
snow-fed from Lebanon, was at its greatest height--brimful; a
translation which gives the only true description of the state of Jordan
in harvest as observed by modern travellers. The river about Jericho is,
in ordinary appearance, about fifty or sixty yards in breadth. But as
seen in harvest, it is twice as broad; and in ancient times, when the
hills on the right and left were much more drenched with rain and snow
than since the forests have disappeared, the river must, from a greater
accession of water, have been broader still than at harvest-time in the
present day.

[Joshua 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 3:16</span></span>

the waters which came down from above--that is, the Sea of Galilee

stood and rose up upon a heap--"in a heap," a firm, compact barrier
([Exo 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#008.md); [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013).md);

very far--high up the stream;

from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan--near mount Sartabeh, in the
northern part of the Ghor ([Kg1 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#046).md);
that is, a distance of thirty miles from the Israelitish encampment; and

those that came down toward the sea of the desert--the Dead Sea--were
cut off ([Psa 114:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002).md). The river was
thus dried up as far as the eye could reach. This was a stupendous
miracle; Jordan takes its name, "the Descender," from the force of its
current, which, after passing the Sea of Galilee, becomes greatly
increased as it plunges through twenty-seven "horrible rapids and
cascades," besides a great many lesser through a fall of a thousand
feet, averaging from four to five miles an hour \[LYNCH\]. When swollen
"in time of harvest," it flows with a vastly accelerated current.

the people passed over right against Jericho--The exact spot is unknown;
but it cannot be that fixed by Greek tradition--the pilgrims'
bathing-place--both because it is too much to the north, and the eastern
banks are there sheer precipices ten or fifteen feet high.

[Joshua 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 3:17</span></span>

the priests . . . and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground--the
river about Jericho has a firm pebbly bottom, on which the host might
pass, without inconvenience when the water was cleared off.
