### [Psalms Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 20:1</span></span>

David probably composed this Psalm to express the prayers of the pious
for his success as at once the head of the Church and nation. Like other
compositions of which David in such relations is the subject, its
sentiments have a permanent value--the prosperity of Christ's kingdom
being involved, as well as typified, in that of Israel and its king.
([Psa 20:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001).md)

hear thee--graciously ([Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001).md).

name of--or manifested perfections, as power, wisdom, &c.

defend thee--set thee on high from danger ([Psa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 20:2</span></span>

strengthen thee--sustain in conflict; even physical benefits may be
included, as courage for war, &c., as such may proceed from a sense of
divine favor, secured in the use of spiritual privileges.

[Psalms 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 20:3</span></span>

all thy offerings--or gifts, vegetable offerings.

accept--literally, "turn to ashes" (compare [Kg1
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038).md).

Selah--(See on [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 20:4</span></span>

thy counsel--or plan.

[Psalms 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 20:5</span></span>

salvation--that wrought and experienced by him.

set up our banners-- ([Num 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md), [Num
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010).md). In usual sense, or, as some
render, "may we be made great."

[Psalms 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 20:6</span></span>

He speaks as if suddenly assured of a hearing.

his anointed--not only David personally, but as the specially appointed
head of His Church.

his holy heaven--or, literally, "the heavens of His holiness," where He
resides ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004).md).

saving . . . hand--His power which brings salvation.

[Psalms 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 20:7</span></span>

remember--or cause to remember, mention thankfully ([Sa1
17:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#045.md); [Psa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 20:8</span></span>

They--that is, who trust in horses, &c.

stand upright--literally, "we have straightened ourselves up from our
distress and fears."

[Psalms 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 20:9</span></span>

let the king hear--as God's representative, delivered to deliver.
Perhaps a better sense is, "LORD, save the king; hear us when we call,"
or pray.
