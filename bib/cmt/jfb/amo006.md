### [Amos Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)

[Amos 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 6:1</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF BOTH THE SISTER NATIONS (ESPECIALLY THEIR NOBLES) FOR
WANTON SECURITY--ZION, AS WELL AS SAMARIA: THREAT OF THE EXILE: RUIN OF
THEIR PALACES AND SLAUGHTER OF THE PEOPLE: THEIR PERVERSE INJUSTICE.
([Amo 6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001))

named chief of the nations--that is, you nobles, so eminent in
influence, that your names are celebrated among the chief nations
\[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. Hebrew, "Men designated by name among the
first-fruits of the nations," that is, men of note in Israel, the people
chosen by God as first of the nations ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); compare [Num
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#020)) \[PISCATOR\].

to whom . . . Israel came--that is, the princes to whom the Israelites
used to repair for the decision of controversies, recognizing their
authority \[MAURER\]. I prefer to refer "which" to the antecedent "Zion"
and "Samaria"; these were esteemed "chief" strongholds among the heathen
nations "to whom . . . Israel came" when it entered Canaan; [Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002) accords with this.

[Amos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 6:2</span></span>

Calneh--on the east bank of the Tigris. Once powerful, but recently
subjugated by Assyria ([Isa 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009);
about 794 B.C.).

Hameth--subjugated by Jeroboam II ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)). Also by Assyria subsequently
([Kg2 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034)). Compare [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014).

Gath--subjugated by Uzziah ([Ch2
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006)).

be they better--no. Their so recent subjugation renders it needless for
Me to tell you they are not. And yet they once were; still they could
not defend themselves against the enemy. How vain, then, your secure
confidence in the strength of Mounts Zion and Samaria! He takes cities
respectively east, north, south, and west of Israel (compare [Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008)).

[Amos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 6:3</span></span>

Ye persuade yourselves that "the evil day" foretold by the prophets is
"far off," though they declare it near ([Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022), [Eze
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027)). Ye in your imagination put it
far off, and therefore bring near violent oppression, suffering it to
sit enthroned, as it were, among you ([Psa
94:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#020)). The notion of judgment being
far off has always been an incentive to the sinner's recklessness of
living ([Ecc 8:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#012); [Mat
24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048)). Yet that very recklessness
brings near the evil day which he puts far off. "Ye bring on fever by
your intemperance, and yet would put it far off" \[CALVIN\].

[Amos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 6:4</span></span>

(See [Amo 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008)).

beds of ivory--that is, adorned, or inlaid, with ivory ([Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015)).

stretch themselves--in luxurious self-indulgence.

lambs out of the flock--picked out as the choicest, for their owners
selfish gratification.

[Amos 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 6:5</span></span>

chant--literally, "mark distinct sounds and tones."

viol--the lyre, or lute.

invent . . . instruments . . . like David--They fancy they equal David
in musical skill ([Ch1 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005); [Neh
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#036)). They defend their luxurious
passion for music by his example: forgetting that he pursued this study
when at peace and free from danger, and that for the praise of God; but
they pursue for their own self-gratification, and that when God is angry
and ruin is imminent.

[Amos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 6:6</span></span>

drink . . . in bowls--in the large vessels or basins in which wine was
mixed; not satisfied with the smaller cups from which it was ordinarily
drunk, after having been poured from the large mixer.

chief ointments--that is, the most costly: not for health or
cleanliness, but wanton luxury.

not grieved for the affliction of Joseph--literally, "the breach," that
is, the national wound or calamity ([Psa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#002); [Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004)) of the house of Joseph ([Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006)); resembling in this the
heartlessness of their forefathers, the sons of Jacob, towards Joseph,
"eating bread" while their brother lay in the pit, and then selling him
to Ishmaelites.

[Amos 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 6:7</span></span>

Therefore . . . shall they go captive with the first--As they were first
among the people in rank ([Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)),
and anointed themselves "with the chief ointments" ([Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)), so shall they be among the
foremost in going into captivity.

banquet--literally, the "merry-making shout of revellers"; from an
Arabic root, "to cry out." In the Hebrew, marzeach; here, there is an
allusion to mizraqu, "bowls" ([Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)).

them that stretched themselves--on luxurious couches ([Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004)).

[Amos 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 6:8</span></span>

the excellency of Jacob-- ([Psa 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004)).
The sanctuary which was the great glory of the covenant-people
\[VATABLUS\], ([Eze 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#021)). The
priesthood, and kingdom, and dignity, conferred on them by God. These,
saith God, are of no account in My eyes towards averting punishment
\[CALVIN\].

hate his palaces--as being the storehouses of "robbery" ([Amo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010), [Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015)). How sad a change from God's
love of Zion's gates ([Psa 87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002)) and
palaces ([Psa 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003), [Psa
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#013)), owing to the people's sin!

the city--collectively: both Zion and Samaria ([Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)).

all that is therein--literally, "its fulness"; the multitude of men and
of riches in it (compare [Psa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001)).

[Amos 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 6:9</span></span>

If as many as ten ([Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026); [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023)) remain in a house (a rare case,
and only in the scattered villages, as there will be scarcely a house in
which the enemy will leave any), they shall all, to a man, die of the
plague, a frequent concomitant of war in the East ([Jer
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010); [Jer
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#013); [Eze
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011)).

[Amos 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 6:10</span></span>

a man's uncle--The nearest relatives had the duty of burying the dead
([Gen 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#009); [Gen
35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029); [Jdg
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#031)). No nearer relative was left of
this man than an uncle.

and he that burneth him--the uncle, who is also at the same time the one
that burneth him (one of the "ten," [Amo
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#009)). Burial was the usual Hebrew mode
of disposing of their dead. But in cases of necessity, as when the men
of Jabesh-gilead took the bodies of Saul and his three sons from the
walls of Beth-shan and burned them to save them from being insulted by
the Philistines, burning was practised. So in this case, to prevent
contagion.

the bones--that is, the dead body ([Gen
50:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#025)). Perhaps here there is an
allusion in the phrase to the emaciated condition of the body, which was
little else but skin and bones.

say unto him that is by the sides of the house--that is, to the only one
left of the ten in the interior of the house \[MAURER\] (compare Note,
see on [Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)).

Hold thy tongue . . . we may not . . . mention . . . the Lord--After
receiving the reply, that none is left besides the one addressed, when
the man outside fancies the man still surviving inside to be on the
point, as was customary, of expressing devout gratitude to God who
spared him, the man outside interrupts him, "Hold thy tongue! for there
is not now cause for mentioning with praise ([Jos
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos023.htm#007)) the name of Jehovah"; for thou
also must die; as all the ten are to die to the last man ([Amo
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#009); compare [Amo
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003)). Formerly ye boasted in the name
of Jehovah, as if ye were His peculiar people; now ye shall be silent
and shudder at His name, as hostile to you, and as one from whom ye wish
to be hidden ([Rev 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016)), \[CALVIN\].

[Amos 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 6:11</span></span>

commandeth, and he will smite--His word of command, when once given,
cannot but be fulfilled ([Isa 55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011)).
His mere word is enough to smite with destruction.

great house . . . little house--He will spare none, great or small ([Amo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015)). JEROME interprets "the great
house" as Israel, and "the small house" as Judah: the former being
reduced to branches or ruins, literally, "small drops"; the latter,
though injured with "clefts" or rents, which threaten its fall, yet
still permitted to stand.

[Amos 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 6:12</span></span>

In turning "judgment (justice) into gall (poison), and . . .
righteousness into hemlock" (or wormwood, bitter and noxious), ye act as
perversely as if one were to make "horses run upon the rock" or to
"plough with oxen there" \[MAURER\]. As horses and oxen are useless on a
rock, so ye are incapable of fulfilling justice \[GROTIUS\]. Ye impede
the course of God's benefits, because ye are as it were a hard rock on
which His favor cannot run. "Those that will not be tilled as fields,
shall be abandoned as rocks" \[CALVIN\].

[Amos 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 6:13</span></span>

rejoice in a thing of naught--that is, in your vain and fleeting riches.

Have we not taken to us horns--that is, acquired power, so as to conquer
our neighbors ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)). Horns are
the Hebrew symbol of power, being the instrument of strength in many
animals ([Psa 75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010)).

[Amos 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 6:14</span></span>

from the entering in of Hamath--the point of entrance for an invading
army (as Assyria) into Israel from the north; specified here, as Hamath
had been just before subjugated by Jeroboam II ([Amo
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002)). Do not glory in your recently
acquired city, for it shall be the starting-point for the foe to afflict
you. How sad the contrast to the feast of Solomon attended by a
congregation from this same Hamath, the most northern boundary of
Israel, to the Nile, the river of Egypt, the most southern boundary!

unto the river of the wilderness--that is, to Kedron, which empties
itself into the north bay of the Dead Sea below Jericho ([Ch2
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#015)), the southern boundary of the
ten tribes ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025), "from the
entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain") \[MAURER\]. To the river
Nile, which skirts the Arabian wilderness and separates Egypt from
Canaan \[GROTIUS\]. If this verse includes Judah, as well as Israel
(compare [Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001), "Zion" and
"Samaria"), GROTIUS' view is correct; and it agrees with [Kg1
8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065).

The seventh, eighth, and ninth chapters contain VISIONS, WITH THEIR
EXPLANATIONS. The seventh chapter consists of two parts. First ([Amo
7:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001)): PROPHECIES ILLUSTRATED BY
THREE SYMBOLS: (1) A vision of grasshoppers or young locusts, which
devour the grass, but are removed at Amos' entreaty; (2) Fire drying up
even the deep, and withering part of the land, but removed at Amos'
entreaty; (3) A plumb-line to mark the buildings for destruction.
Secondly ([Amo 7:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#010)): NARRATIVE OF
AMAZIAH'S INTERRUPTION OF AMOS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FOREGOING
PROPHECIES, AND PREDICTION OF HIS DOOM.
