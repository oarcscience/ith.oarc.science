### [Hebrews Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 11:1</span></span>

DEFINITION OF THE FAITH JUST SPOKEN OF ([Heb
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039).md): EXAMPLES FROM THE OLD COVENANT
FOR OUR PERSEVERANCE IN FAITH. (Heb. 11:1-40)

Description of the great things which faith (in its widest sense: not
here restricted to faith in the Gospel sense) does for us. Not a full
definition of faith in its whole nature, but a description of its great
characteristics in relation to the subject of Paul's exhortation here,
namely, to perseverance.

substance, &c.--It substantiates promises of God which we hope for, as
future in fulfilment, making them present realities to us. However, the
Greek is translated in [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md),
"confidence"; and it also here may mean "sure confidence." So ALFORD
translates. THOMAS MAGISTER supports English Version, "The whole thing
that follows is virtually contained in the first principle; now the
first commencement of the things hoped for is in us through the assent
of faith, which virtually contains all the things hoped for." Compare
Note, see on [Heb 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005.md), "tasted . . .
powers of the world to come." Through faith, the future object of
Christian hope, in its beginning, is already present. True faith infers
the reality of the objects believed in and honed for ([Heb
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006).md). HUGO DE ST. VICTOR
distinguished faith from hope. By faith alone we are sure of eternal
things that they ARE: but by hope we are confident that WE SHALL HAVE
them. All hope presupposes faith ([Rom
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025).md).

evidence--"demonstration": convincing proof to the believer: the soul
thereby seeing what the eye cannot see.

things not seen--the whole invisible and spiritual world: not things
future and things pleasant, as the "things hoped for," but also the past
and present, and those the reverse of pleasant. "Eternal life is
promised to us, but it is when we are dead: we are told of a blessed
resurrection, but meanwhile we moulder in the dust; we are declared to
be justified, and sin dwells in us; we hear that we are blessed,
meantime we are overwhelmed in endless miseries: we are promised
abundance of all goods, but we still endure hunger and thirst; God
declares He will immediately come to our help, but He seems deaf to our
cries. What should we do if we had not faith and hope to lean on, and if
our mind did not emerge amidst the darkness above the world by the
shining of the Word and Spirit of God?" \[CALVIN\]. Faith is an assent
unto truths credible upon the testimony of God (not on the
reasonableness of the thing revealed, though by this we may judge as to
whether it be what it professes, a genuine revelation), delivered unto
us in the writings of the apostles and prophets. Thus Christ's ascension
is the cause, and His absence the crown, of our faith: because He
ascended, we the more believe, and because we believe in Him who hath
ascended, our faith is the more accepted \[BISHOP PEARSON\]. Faith
believes what it sees not; for if thou seest there is no faith; the Lord
has gone away so as not to be seen: He is hidden that He may be
believed; the yearning desire by faith after Him who is unseen is the
preparation of a heavenly mansion for us; when He shall be seen it shall
be given to us as the reward of faith \[AUGUSTINE\]. As Revelation deals
with spiritual and invisible things exclusively, faith is the faculty
needed by us, since it is the evidence of things not seen. By faith we
venture our eternal interests on the bare word of God, and this is
altogether reasonable.

[Hebrews 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 11:2</span></span>

For--So high a description of faith is not undeserved; for . . .
\[ALFORD\].

by it--Greek, "in it": in respect to . . . in the matter of," it, "or,
as Greek more emphatically, "this."

the elders--as though still living and giving their powerful testimony
to the reasonableness and excellence of faith ([Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md). Not merely the ancients, as
though they were people solely of the past; nay, they belong to the one
and the same blessed family as ourselves ([Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md). "The elders," whom we all
revere so highly. "Paul shows how we ought to seek in all its fulness,
under the veil of history, the essential substance of the doctrine
sometimes briefly indicated" \[BENGEL\]. "The elders," as "the fathers,"
is a title of honor given on the ground of their bright faith and
practice.

obtained a good report--Greek, "were testified of," namely, favorably
(compare [Heb 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#008).md). It is a phrase of
Luke, Paul's companion. Not only men, but God, gave testimony to their
faith ([Heb 11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md), [Heb
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md). Thus they being testified of
themselves have become "witnesses" to all others ([Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md). The earlier elders had their
patience exercised for a long period of life: those later, in sharper
afflictions. Many things which they hoped for and did not see,
subsequently came to pass and were conspicuously seen, the event
confirming faith \[BENGEL\].

[Hebrews 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 11:3</span></span>

we understand--We perceive with our spiritual intelligence the fact of
the world's creation by God, though we see neither Him nor the act of
creation as described in Gen. 1:1-31. The natural world could not,
without revelation, teach us this truth, though it confirms the truth
when apprehended by faith ([Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md).
Adam is passed over in silence here as to his faith, perhaps as being
the first who fell and brought sin on us all; though it does not follow
that he did not repent and believe the promise.

worlds--literally, "ages"; all that exists in time and space, visible
and invisible, present and eternal.

framed--"fitly formed and consolidated"; including the creation of the
single parts and the harmonious organization of the whole, and the
continual providence which maintains the whole throughout all ages. As
creation is the foundation and a specimen of the whole divine economy,
so faith in creation is the foundation and a specimen of all faith
\[BENGEL\].

by the word of God--not here, the personal word (Greek, "logos," [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md) but the spoken word (Greek,
"rhema"); though by the instrumentality of the personal word ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md).

not made, &c.--Translate as Greek, "so that not out of things which
appear hath that which is seen been made"; not as in the case of all
things which we see reproduced from previously existing and visible
materials, as, for instance, the plant from the seed, the animal from
the parent, &c., has the visible world sprung into being from apparent
materials. So also it is implied in the first clause of the verse that
the invisible spiritual worlds were framed not from previously existing
materials. BENGEL explains it by distinguishing "appear," that is, begin
to be seen (namely, at creation), from that which is seen as already in
existence, not merely beginning to be seen; so that the things seen were
not made of the things which appear," that is, which begin to be seen by
us in the act of creation. We were not spectators of creation; it is by
faith we perceive it.

[Hebrews 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 11:4</span></span>

more excellent sacrifice--because offered in faith. Now faith must have
some revelation of God on which it fastens. The revelation in this case
was doubtless God's command to sacrifice animals ("the firstlings of the
flock") in token of the forfeiture of men's life by sin, and as a type
of the promised bruiser of the serpent's head ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), the one coming sacrifice: this
command is implied in God's having made coats of skin for Adam and Eve
([Gen 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021).md): for these skins must have
been taken from animals slain in sacrifice: inasmuch as it was not for
food they were slain, animal food not being permitted till after the
flood; nor for mere clothing, as, were it so, clothes might have been
made of the fleeces without the needless cruelty of killing the animal;
but a coat of skin put on Adam from a sacrificed animal typified the
covering or atonement (the Hebrew for atone means to cover) resulting
from Christ's sacrifice. The Greek is more literally rendered
\[KENNICOTT\] by WYCLIFFE, "a much more sacrifice"; and by Queen
Elizabeth's version "a greater sacrifice." A fuller, more ample
sacrifice, that which partook more largely and essentially of the true
nature and virtue of sacrifice \[ARCHBISHOP MAGEE\]. It was not any
intrinsic merit in "the firstling of the flock" above "the fruit of the
ground." It was God's appointment that gave it all its excellency as a
sacrifice; if it had not been so, it would have been a presumptuous act
of will-worship ([Col 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023).md), and
taking of a life which man had no right over before the flood ([Gen
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001).md). The sacrifice seems to have
been a holocaust, and the sign of the divine acceptance of it was
probably the consumption of it by fire from heaven ([Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017).md). Hence, "to accept" a burnt
sacrifice is in Hebrew "to turn it to ashes" ([Psa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003), Margin.md). A flame seems to have
issued from the Shekinah, or flaming cherubim, east of Eden ("the
presence of the Lord," [Gen 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016).md),
where the first sacrifices were offered. Cain, in unbelieving
self-righteousness, presented merely a thank offering, not like Abel
feeling his need of the propitiatory sacrifice appointed on account of
sin. God "had respect (first) unto Abel, and (then) to his offering"
([Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004).md). Faith causes the
believer's person to be accepted, and then his offering. Even an animal
sacrifice, though of God's appointment, would not have been accepted,
had it not been offered in faith.

he obtained witness--God by fire attesting His acceptance of him as
"righteous by faith."

his gifts--the common term for sacrifices, implying that they must be
freely given.

by it--by faith exhibited in his animal sacrifice.

dead, yet speaketh--His blood crying front the ground to God, shows how
precious, because of his "faith," he was still in God's sight, even when
dead. So he becomes a witness to us of the blessed effects of faith.

[Hebrews 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 11:5</span></span>

Faith was the ground of his pleasing God; and his pleasing God was the
ground of his translation.

translated-- ([Gen 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md), [Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024).md). Implying a sudden removal (the
same Greek as in [Gal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).md) from
mortality without death to immortality: such a CHANGE as shall pass over
the living at Christ's coming ([Co1
15:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).md).

had this testimony--namely of Scripture; the Greek perfect implies that
this testimony continues still: "he has been testified of."

pleased God--The Scripture testimony virtually expresses that he pleased
God, namely, "Enoch walked with God." The Septuagint translates the
Hebrew for "walked with God," [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md), pleased God.

[Hebrews 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 11:6</span></span>

without--Greek, "apart from faith": if one be destitute of faith
(compare [Rom 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023).md).

to please--Translate, as ALFORD does, the Greek aorist, "It is
impossible to please God at all" ([Rom
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008).md). Natural amiabilities and "works
done before the grace of Christ are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as
they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ; yea, rather, for that they are
not done as God hath willed them to be done, we doubt not but they have
the nature of sin" \[Article XIII, Book of Common Prayer\]. Works not
rooted in God are splendid sins \[AUGUSTINE\].

he that cometh to God--as a worshipper ([Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019).md).

must believe--once for all: Greek aorist tense.

that God is--is the true self-existing Jehovah (as contrasted with all
so-called gods, not gods, [Gal 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008).md),
the source of all being, though he sees Him not ([Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001).md) as being "invisible" ([Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md). So Enoch; this passage implies
that he had not been favored with visible appearances of God, yet he
believed in God's being, and in God's moral government, as the Rewarder
of His diligent worshippers, in opposition to antediluvian skepticism.
Also Moses was not so favored before he left Egypt the first time ([Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md); still he believed.

and . . . is--a different Greek verb from the former "is." Translate,
"is eventually"; proves to be; literally, "becomes."

rewarder--renderer of reward \[ALFORD\]. So God proved to be to Enoch.
The reward is God Himself diligently "sought" and "walked with" in
partial communion here, and to be fully enjoyed hereafter. Compare [Gen
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001.md), "I am thy exceeding great
reward."

of them--and them only.

diligently seek--Greek, "seek out" God. Compare "seek early," [Pro
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#017.md). Not only "ask" and "seek," but
"knock," [Mat 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md); compare [Heb
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012.md); [Luk
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024.md), "Strive" as in an agony of
contest.

[Hebrews 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 11:7</span></span>

warned of God--The same Greek, [Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005.md), "admonished of God."

moved with fear--not mere slavish fear, but as in [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); see on [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); Greek, "reverential fear":
opposed to the world's sneering disbelief of the revelation, and
self-deceiving security. Join "by faith" with "prepared an ark" ([Pe1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020).md).

by the which--faith.

condemned the world--For since he believed and was saved, so might they
have believed and been saved, so that their condemnation by God is by
his case shown to be just.

righteousness which is by faith--Greek, "according to faith." A Pauline
thought. Noah is first called "righteous" in [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md). Christ calls Abel so, [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md). Compare as to Noah's
righteousness, [Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md), [Eze
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020.md); [Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md), "a preacher of righteousness."
Paul here makes faith the principle and ground of his righteousness.

heir--the consequence of sonship which flows from faith.

[Hebrews 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 11:8</span></span>

From the antediluvian saints he passes to the patriarchs of Israel, to
whom "the promises" belonged.

called--by God ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001).md). The oldest
manuscripts and Vulgate read, "He that was called Abraham," his name
being changed from Abram to Abraham, on the occasion of God's making
with him and his seed a covenant sealed by circumcision, many years
after his call out of Ur. "By faith, he who was (afterwards) called
Abraham (father of nations, [Gen 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md),
in order to become which was the design of God's bringing him out of Ur)
obeyed (the command of God: to be understood in this reading), so as to
go out," &c.

which he should after receive--He had not fully received even this
promise when he went out, for it was not explicitly given him till he
had reached Canaan ([Gen 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md), [Gen
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006).md). When the promise of the land
was given him the Canaanite was still in the land, and himself a
stranger; it is in the new heaven and new earth that he shall receive
his personal inheritance promised him; so believers sojourn on earth as
strangers, while the ungodly and Satan lord it over the earth; but at
Christ's coming that same earth which was the scene of the believer's
conflict shall be the inheritance of Christ and His saints.

[Hebrews 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 11:9</span></span>

sojourned--as a "stranger and pilgrim."

in--Greek, "into," that is, he went into it and sojourned there.

as in a strange country--a country not belonging to him, but to others
(so the Greek), [Act 7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005.md).

dwelling in tabernacles--tents: as strangers and sojourners do: moving
from place to place, as having no fixed possession of their own. In
contrast to the abiding "city" ([Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010).md).

with--Their kind of dwelling being the same is a proof that their faith
was the same. They all alike were content to wait for their good things
hereafter ([Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025).md). Jacob was
fifteen years old at the death of Abraham.

heirs with him of the same promise--Isaac did not inherit it from
Abraham, nor Jacob from Isaac, but they all inherited it from God
directly as "fellow heirs." In [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md), [Heb
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md), [Heb
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md), "the promise" means the thing
promised as a thing in part already attained; but in this chapter "the
promise" is of something still future. However, see on [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012.md).

[Hebrews 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 11:10</span></span>

looked for--Greek, "he was expecting"; waiting for with eager
expectation ([Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md).

a city--Greek, "the city," already alluded to. Worldly Enoch, son of the
murderer Cain, was the first to build his city here: the godly
patriarchs waited for their city hereafter ([Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014).md).

foundations--Greek, "the foundations" which the tents had not, nor even
men's present cities have.

whose builder and maker--Greek, "designer \[[Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md)\] and master-builder," or
executor of the design. The city is worthy of its Framer and Builder
(compare [Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md); [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002).md). Compare Note, see on [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), on "found."

[Hebrews 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 11:11</span></span>

also Sara herself--though being the weaker vessel, and though at first
she doubted.

was delivered of a child--omitted in the oldest manuscripts: then
translate, "and that when she was past age" ([Rom
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019).md).

she judged him faithful who had promised--after she had ceased to doubt,
being instructed by the angel that it was no jest, but a matter in
serious earnest.

[Hebrews 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 11:12</span></span>

as good as dead--literally, "deadened"; no longer having, as in youth,
energetic vital powers.

stars . . . sand-- ([Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md).

[Hebrews 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 11:13</span></span>

Summary of the characteristic excellencies of the patriarchs' faith

died in faith--died as believers, waiting for, not actually seeing as
yet their good things promised to them. They were true to this principle
of faith even unto, and especially in, their dying hour (compare [Heb
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020).md).

These all--beginning with "Abraham" ([Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008).md), to whom the promises were made
([Gal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md), and who is alluded to in
the end of [Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md) and in [Heb
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015.md) \[BENGEL and ALFORD\]. But the
"ALL" can hardly but include Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Now as these did not
receive the promise of entering literal Canaan, some other promise made
in the first ages, and often repeated, must be that meant, namely, the
promise of a coming Redeemer made to Adam, namely, "the seed of the
woman shall bruise the serpent's head." Thus the promises cannot have
been merely temporal, for Abel and Enoch mentioned here received no
temporal promise \[ARCHBISHOP MAGEE\]. This promise of eternal
redemption is the inner essence of the promises made to Abraham ([Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md).

not having received--It was this that constituted their "faith." If they
had "received" THE THING PROMISED (so "the promises" here mean: the
plural is used because of the frequent renewal of the promise to the
patriarchs: [Heb 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md) says he did
receive the promises, but not the thing promised), it would have been
sight, not faith.

seen them afar off-- ([Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056).md).
Christ, as the Word, was preached to the Old Testament believers, and so
became the seed of life to their souls, as He is to ours.

and were persuaded of them--The oldest manuscripts omit this clause.

embraced them--as though they were not "afar off," but within reach, so
as to draw them to themselves and clasp them in their embrace. TRENCH
denies that the Old Testament believers embraced them, for they only saw
them afar off: he translates, "saluted them," as the homeward-bound
mariner, recognizing from afar the well-known promontories of his native
land. ALFORD translates, "greeted them." Jacob's exclamation, "I have
waited for Thy salvation, O Lord" ([Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018).md) is such a greeting of salvation
from afar \[DELITZSCH\].

confessed . . . were strangers--so Abraham to the children of Heth ([Gen
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#004).md); and Jacob to Pharaoh ([Gen
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009.md); [Psa
119:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#019).md). Worldly men hold fast the
world; believers sit loose to it. Citizens of the world do not confess
themselves "strangers on the earth."

pilgrims--Greek, "temporary (literally, 'by the way') sojourners."

on the earth--contrasted with "an heavenly" ([Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md): "our citizenship is in heaven"
(Greek: [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md); [Psa
119:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#054.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). "Whosoever professes that he
has a Father in heaven, confesses himself a stranger on earth; hence
there is in the heart an ardent longing, like that of a child living
among strangers, in want and grief, far from his fatherland" \[LUTHER\].
"Like ships in seas while in, above the world."

[Hebrews 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 11:14</span></span>

For--proof that "faith" ([Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md)
was their actuating principle.

declare plainly--make it plainly evident.

seek--Greek, "seek after"; implying the direction towards which their
desires ever tend.

a country--rather as Greek, "a fatherland." In confessing themselves
strangers here, they evidently imply that they regard not this as their
home or fatherland, but seek after another and a better.

[Hebrews 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 11:15</span></span>

As Abraham, had he desired to leave his pilgrim life in Canaan, and
resume his former fixed habitation in Ur, among the carnal and worldly,
had in his long life ample opportunities to have done so; and so
spiritually, as to all believers who came out from the world to become
God's people, they might, if they had been so minded, have easily gone
back.

[Hebrews 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 11:16</span></span>

Proving the truth that the old fathers did not, as some assert, "look
only for transitory promises" \[Article VII, Book of Common Prayer\].

now--as the case is.

is not ashamed--Greek, "Is not ashamed of them." Not merely once did God
call himself their God, but He is NOW not ashamed to have Himself called
so, they being alive and abiding with Him where He is. For, by the law,
God cannot come into contact with anything dead. None remained dead in
Christ's presence ([Luk 20:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).md). He
who is Lord and Maker of heaven and earth, and all things therein, when
asked, What is Thy name? said, omitting all His other titles, "I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"
\[THEODORET\]. Not only is He not ashamed, but glories in the name and
relation to His people. The "wherefore" does not mean that God's good
pleasure is the meritorious, but the gracious, consequence of their
obedience (that obedience being the result of His Spirit's work in them
in the first instance). He first so "called" Himself, then they so
called Him.

for--proof of His being "their God," namely, "He hath prepared (in His
eternal counsels, [Mat 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023.md); [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md), and by the progressive acts of
redemption, [Joh 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002).md) for them a
city," the city in which He Himself reigns, so that their yearning
desires shall not be disappointed ([Heb
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014.md), [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md).

a city--on its garniture by God (compare Rev. 21:10-27).

[Hebrews 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 11:17</span></span>

offered up--literally, "hath offered up," as if the work and its praise
were yet enduring \[ALFORD\]. As far as His intention was concerned, he
did sacrifice Isaac; and in actual fact "he offered him," as far as the
presentation of him on the altar as an offering to God is concerned.

tried--Greek, "tempted," as in [Gen
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md). Put to the proof of his faith.
Not that God "tempts" to sin, but God "tempts" in the sense of proving
or trying ([Jam 1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md).

and--and so.

he that had received--rather as Greek, "accepted," that is, welcomed and
embraced by faith, not merely "had the promises," as in [Heb
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#006.md). This added to the difficulty in
the way of his faith, that it was in Isaac's posterity the promises were
to be fulfilled; how then could they be fulfilled if Isaac were
sacrificed?

offered up--rather as Greek, "was offering up"; he was in the act of
offering.

his only-begotten son--Compare [Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md), "Take now thy son, thine only
son." EUSEBIUS \[The Preparation of the Gospel, 1.10, and 4.16\], has
preserved a fragment of a Greek translation of Sanchoniatho, which
mentions a mystical sacrifice of the PhÅ“nicians, wherein a prince in
royal robes was the offerer, and his only son was to be the victim: this
evidently was a tradition derived from Abraham's offering, and handed
down through Esau or Edom, Isaac's son. Isaac was Abraham's
"only-begotten son" in respect of Sarah and the promises: he sent away
his other sons, by other wives ([Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006).md). Abraham is a type of the Father
not sparing His only-begotten Son to fulfil the divine purpose of love.
God nowhere in the Mosaic law allowed human sacrifices, though He
claimed the first-born of Israel as His.

[Hebrews 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 11:18</span></span>

Of whom--rather as Greek "He (Abraham, not Isaac) TO whom it was said"
\[ALFORD\]. BENGEL supports English Version. So [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md) uses the same Greek preposition,
"unto," for "in respect to," or "of." This verse gives a definition of
the "only-begotten Son" ([Heb 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017).md).

in Isaac shall thy seed be called-- ([Gen
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012).md). The posterity of Isaac alone
shall be accounted as the seed of Abraham, which is the heir of the
promises ([Rom 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007).md).

[Hebrews 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 11:19</span></span>

Faith answered the objections which reason brought against God's command
to Abraham to offer Isaac, by suggesting that what God had promised He
both could and would perform, however impossible the performance might
seem ([Rom 4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020).md).

able to raise him--rather, in general, "able to raise from the dead."
Compare [Rom 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md), "God who quickeneth
the dead." The quickening of Sarah's dead womb suggested the thought of
God's power to raise even the dead, though no instance of it had as yet
occurred.

he received him--"received him back" \[ALFORD\].

in a figure--Greek, "in a parable." ALFORD explains, "Received him back,
risen from that death which he had undergone in, under, the figure of
the ram." I prefer with BISHOP PEARSON, ESTIUS, and GREGORY OF NYSSA,
understanding the figure to be the representation which the whole scene
gave to Abraham of Christ in His death (typified by Isaac's offering in
intention, and the ram's actual substitution answering to Christ's
vicarious death), and in His resurrection (typified by Abraham's
receiving him back alive from the jaws of death, compare [Co2
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009).md); just as on the day of
atonement the slain goat and the scapegoat together formed one joint
rite representing Christ's death and resurrection. It was then that
Abraham saw Christ's day ([Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056).md):
accounting God was able to raise even from the dead: from which state of
the dead he received him back as a type of the resurrection in Christ.

[Hebrews 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 11:20</span></span>

Jacob is put before Esau, as heir of the chief, namely, the spiritual
blessing.

concerning things to come--Greek, "even concerning things to come": not
only concerning things present. Isaac, by faith, assigned to his sons
things future, as if they were present.

[Hebrews 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 11:21</span></span>

both the sons--Greek, "each of the sons" ([Gen
47:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#029.md); [Gen
48:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#008).md). He knew not Joseph's sons,
and could not distinguish them by sight, yet he did distinguish them by
faith, transposing his hands intentionally, so as to lay his right hand
on the younger, Ephraim, whose posterity was to be greater than that of
Manasseh: he also adopted these grandchildren as his own sons, after
having transferred the right of primogeniture to Joseph ([Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022).md).

and worshipped--This did not take place in immediate connection with the
foregoing, but before it, when Jacob made Joseph swear that he would
bury him with his fathers in Canaan, not in Egypt. The assurance that
Joseph would do so filled him with pious gratitude to God, which he
expressed by raising himself on his bed to an attitude of worship. His
faith, as Joseph's ([Heb 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022).md),
consisted in his so confidentially anticipating the fulfilment of God's
promise of Canaan to his descendants, as to desire to be buried there as
his proper possession.

leaning upon the top of his staff-- [Gen
47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031.md), Hebrew and English Version,
"upon the bed's head." The Septuagint translates as Paul here. JEROME
justly reprobates the notion of modern Rome, that Jacob worshipped the
top of Joseph's staff, having on it an image of Joseph's power, to which
Jacob bowed in recognition of the future sovereignty of his son's tribe,
the father bowing to the son! The Hebrew, as translated in English
Version, sets it aside: the bed is alluded to afterwards ([Gen
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#002.md); [Gen
49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033).md), and it is likely that Jacob
turned himself in his bed so as to have his face toward the pillow, [Isa
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#002.md) (there were no bedsteads in the
East). Paul by adopting the Septuagint version, brings out, under the
Spirit, an additional fact, namely, that the aged patriarch used his own
(not Joseph's) staff to lean on in worshipping on his bed. The staff,
too, was the emblem of his pilgrim state here on his way to his heavenly
city ([Heb 11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md), wherein God had
so wonderfully supported him. [Gen
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#010.md), "With my staff I passed over
Jordan, and now I am become," &c. (compare [Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011.md); [Mar
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#008).md). In [Kg1
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md), the same thing is said of
David's "bowing on his bed," an act of adoring thanksgiving to God for
God's favor to his son before death. He omits the more leading blessing
of the twelve sons of Jacob; because "he plucks only the flowers which
stand by his way, and leaves the whole meadow full to his readers"
\[DELITZSCH in ALFORD\].

[Hebrews 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 11:22</span></span>

when he died--"when dying."

the departing--"the exodus" ([Gen
50:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#024).md). Joseph's eminent position
in Egypt did not make him regard it as his home: in faith he looked to
God's promise of Canaan being fulfilled and desired that his bones
should rest there: testifying thus: (1) that he had no doubt of his
posterity obtaining the promised land: and (2) that he believed in the
resurrection of the body, and the enjoyment in it of the heavenly
Canaan. His wish was fulfilled ([Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032.md); [Act
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016).md).

[Hebrews 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 11:23</span></span>

parents--So the Septuagint has the plural, namely, Amram and Jochebed
([Num 26:59](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#059).md); but in [Exo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#002.md), the mother alone is mentioned;
but doubtless Amram sanctioned all she did, and secrecy. being their
object, he did not appear prominent in what was done.

a proper child--Greek, "a comely child." [Act
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md), "exceeding fair," Greek, "fair
to God." The "faith" of his parents in saving the child must have had
some divine revelation to rest on (probably at the time of his birth),
which marked their "exceeding fair" babe as one whom God designed to do
a great work by. His beauty was probably "the sign" appointed by God to
assure their faith.

the king's commandment--to slay all the males ([Exo
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#022).md).

[Hebrews 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 11:24</span></span>

So far from faith being opposed to Moses, he was an eminent example of
it \[BENGEL\].

refused--in believing self-denial, when he might possibly have succeeded
at last to the throne of Egypt. Thermutis, Pharaoh's daughter, according
to the tradition which Paul under the Spirit sanctions, adopted him, as
JOSEPHUS says, with the consent of the king. JOSEPHUS states that when a
child, he threw on the ground the diadem put on him in jest, a presage
of his subsequent formal rejection of Thermutis' adoption of him. Faith
made him to prefer the adoption of the King of kings, unseen, and so to
choose ([Heb 11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025).md) things, the
very last which flesh and blood relish.

[Hebrews 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 11:25</span></span>

He balanced the best of the world with the worst of religion, and
decidedly chose the latter. "Choosing" implies a deliberate resolution,
not a hasty impulse. He was forty years old, a time when the judgment is
matured.

for a season--If the world has "pleasure" (Greek, "enjoyment") to offer,
it is but "for a season." If religion bring with it "affliction," it too
is but for a season; whereas its "pleasures are for evermore."

[Hebrews 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 11:26</span></span>

Esteeming--Inasmuch as he esteemed.

the reproach of Christ--that is, the reproach which falls on the Church,
and which Christ regards as His own reproach, He being the Head, and the
Church (both of the Old and New Testament) His body. Israel typified
Christ; Israel's sufferings were Christ's sufferings (compare [Co2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md); [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024).md). As uncircumcision was Egypt's
reproach, so circumcision was the badge of Israel's expectation of
Christ, which Moses especially cherished, and which the Gentiles
reproached Israel on account of. Christ's people's reproach will ere
long be their great glory.

had respect unto, &c.--Greek, "turning his eyes away from other
considerations, he fixed them on the (eternal) recompense" ([Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md).

[Hebrews 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 11:27</span></span>

not fearing the wrath of the king--But in [Exo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#014.md) it is said, "Moses feared, and
fled from the face of Pharaoh." He was afraid, and fled from the danger
where no duty called him to stay (to have stayed without call of duty
would have been to tempt Providence, and to sacrifice his hope of being
Israel's future deliverer according to the divine intimations; his great
aim, see on [Heb 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023).md). He did not
fear the king so as to neglect his duty and not return when God called
him. It was in spite of the king's prohibition he left Egypt, not
fearing the consequences which were likely to overtake him if he should
be caught, after having, in defiance of the king, left Egypt. If he had
stayed and resumed his position as adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter,
his slaughter of the Egyptian would doubtless have been connived at; but
his resolution to take his portion with oppressed Israel, which he could
not have done had he stayed, was the motive of his flight, and
constituted the "faith" of this act, according to the express statement
here. The exodus of Moses with Israel cannot be meant here, for it was
made, not in defiance, but by the desire, of the king. Besides, the
chronological order would be broken thus, the next particular specified
here, namely, the institution of the Passover, having taken place before
the exodus. Besides, it is Moses' personal history and faith which are
here described. The faith of the people ("THEY passed") is not
introduced till [Heb 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029.md).

endured--steadfast in faith amidst trials. He had fled, not so much from
fear of Pharaoh, as from a revulsion of feeling in finding God's people
insensible to their high destiny, and from disappointment at not having
been able to inspire them with those hopes for which he had sacrificed
all his earthly prospects. This accounts for his strange reluctance and
despondency when commissioned by God to go and arouse the people ([Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md); [Exo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md), [Exo
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010).md).

seeing him . . . invisible--as though he had not to do with men, but
only with God, ever before his eyes by faith, though invisible to the
bodily eye ([Rom 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md). Hence he feared not the wrath
of visible man; the characteristic of faith ([Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md); [Luk
12:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004).md).

[Hebrews 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 11:28</span></span>

kept--Greek, "hath kept," the Passover being, in Paul's day, still
observed. His faith here was his belief in the invisible God's promise
that the destroying angel should pass over, and not touch the inmates of
the blood-sprinkled houses ([Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023).md). "He acquiesced in the bare
word of God where the thing itself was not apparent" \[CALVIN\].

the first-born--Greek neuter; both of man and beast.

[Hebrews 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 11:29</span></span>

they--Moses and Israel.

Red Sea--called so from its red seaweed, or rather from Edom (meaning
"red"), whose country adjoined it.

which . . . assaying to do--Greek, "of which (Red Sea) the Egyptians
having made experiment." Rashness and presumption mistaken by many for
faith; with similar rash presumption many rush into eternity. The same
thing when done by the believer, and when done by the unbeliever, is not
the same thing \[BENGEL\]. What was faith in Israel, was presumption in
the Egyptians.

were drowned--Greek, "were swallowed up," or "engulfed." They sank in
the sands as much as in the waves of the Red Sea. Compare [Exo
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#012.md), "the earth swallowed them."

[Hebrews 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 11:30</span></span>

The soundings of trumpets, though one were to sound for ten thousand
years, cannot throw down walls, but faith can do all things
\[CHRYSOSTOM\].

seven days--whereas sieges often lasted for years.

[Hebrews 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 11:31</span></span>

Rahab showed her "faith" in her confession, [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009.md), [Jos
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#011.md), "I know that Jehovah hath given
you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven above, and in earth
beneath."

the harlot--Her former life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith,
and preservation ([Mat 21:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031).md).

believed not--Greek, "were disobedient," namely, to the will of God
manifested by the miracles wrought in behalf of Israel ([Jos
2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#008).md).

received--in her house ([Jos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md), [Jos
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#004.md), [Jos
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#006).md).

with peace--peaceably; so that they had nothing to fear in her house.
Thus Paul, quoting the same examples ([Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md), [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031).md) for the power of faith, as
James ([Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md), [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md); see on [Jam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md); [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025).md) does for justification by works
evidentially, shows that in maintaining justification by faith alone, he
means not a dead faith, but "faith which worketh by love" ([Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006).md).

[Hebrews 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032.md)

the time--suitable for the length of an Epistle. He accumulates
collectively some out of many examples of faith.

Gideon--put before Barak, not chronologically, but as being more
celebrated. Just as Samson for the same reason is put before
JephthÃ&brvbr;. The mention of JephthÃ&brvbr; as an example of "faith,"
makes it unlikely he sacrificed the life of his daughter for a rash vow.
David, the warrior king and prophet, forms the transition from warrior
chiefs to the "prophets," of whom "Samuel" is mentioned as the first.

[Hebrews 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">heb 11:33</span></span>

subdued kingdoms--as David did ([Sa2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#001), &c..md); so also Gideon subdued
Midian (Jdg. 7:1-25).

wrought righteousness--as Samuel did ([Sa1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#009.md); 1Sa. 12:3-23; [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033).md); and David ([Sa2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#015).md).

obtained promises--as "the prophets" ([Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).md) did; for through them the
promises were given (compare [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021).md) \[BENGEL\]. Rather, "obtained
the fulfilment of promises," which had been previously the object of
their faith ([Jos 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#045.md); [Kg1
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056).md). Indeed, Gideon, Barak, &c.,
also obtained the things which God promised. Not "the promises," which
are still future ([Heb 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md), [Heb
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md).

stopped the mouths of lions--Note the words, "because he believed in his
God." Also Samson ([Jdg 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#006).md), David
([Sa1 17:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034).md), Benaiah ([Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020).md).

Quenched the violence of fire-- ([Dan
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027).md). Not merely "quenched the fire,"
but "quenched the power (so the Greek) of the fire." [Dan
3:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#019.md) and [Dan
6:12-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#012.md) record the last miracles of
the Old Testament. So the martyrs of the Reformation, though not
escaping the fire, were delivered from its having power really or
lastingly to hurt them.

escaped . . . sword--So Jephthah ([Jdg
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003).md); and so David escaped Saul's
sword ([Sa1 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#011.md); [Sa1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#010.md), [Sa1

6:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#014).md).

out of weakness . . . made strong--Samson ([Jdg
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028.md); [Jdg
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#019)). Hezekiah (Isa. 37:1-38:22.md).
MILTON says of the martyrs, "They shook the powers of darkness with the
irresistible power of weakness."

valiant in fight--Barak ([Jdg
4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#014).md). And the Maccabees, the sons
of Matthias, Judas, Jonathan, and Simon, who delivered the Jews from
their cruel oppressor, Antiochus of Syria.

armies--literally, "camps" referring to [Jdg
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#021.md). But the reference may be to the
Maccabees having put to flight the Syrians and other foes.

[Hebrews 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 11:35</span></span>

Women received their dead raised--as the widow of Zarephath ([Kg1
17:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#017).md). The Shunammite (2Ki.
4:17-35). The two oldest manuscripts read. "They received women of
aliens by raising their dead." [Kg1
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#024.md) shows that the raising of the
widow's son by Elijah led her to the faith, so that he thus took her
into fellowship, an alien though she was. Christ, in [Luk
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#026.md), makes especial mention of the
fact that Elijah was sent to an alien from Israel, a woman of Sarepta.
Thus Paul may quote this as an instance of Elijah's faith, that at God's
command he went to a Gentile city of Sidonia (contrary to Jewish
prejudices), and there, as the fruit of faith, not only raised her dead
son, but received her as a convert into the family of God, as Vulgate
reads. Still, English Version may be the right reading.

and--Greek, "but"; in contrast to those raised again to life.

tortured--"broken on the wheel." Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6:18, end; 2
Maccabees 19:20,30). The sufferer was stretched on an instrument like a
drumhead and scourged to death.

not accepting deliverance--when offered to them. So the seven brothers,
2 Maccabees 7:9, 11, 14, 29, 36; and Eleazar, 2 Maccabees 6:21, 28, 30,
"Though I might have been delivered from death, I endure these severe
pains, being beaten."

a better resurrection--than that of the women's children "raised to life
again"; or, than the resurrection which their foes could give them by
delivering them from death ([Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md);
[Luk 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035.md); [Phi
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011).md). The fourth of the brethren
(referring to [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md) said to King
Antiochus, "To be put to death by men, is to be chosen to look onward
for the hopes which are of God, to be raised up again by Him; but for
thee there is no resurrection to life." The writer of Second Maccabees
expressly disclaims inspiration, which prevents our mistaking Paul's
allusion here to it as if it sanctioned the Apocrypha as inspired. In
quoting Daniel, he quotes a book claiming inspiration, and so tacitly
sanctions that claim.

[Hebrews 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 11:36</span></span>

others--of a different class of confessors for the truth (the Greek is
different from that for "others," [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035), alloi, heteroi.md).

trial--testing their faith.

imprisonment--as Hanani ([Ch2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010).md),
imprisoned by Asa. Micaiah, the son of Imlah, by Ahab ([Kg1
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026).md).

[Hebrews 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 11:37</span></span>

stoned--as Zechariah, son of Jehoiada ([Ch2
24:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md); [Mat
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035).md).

sawn asunder--as Isaiah was said to have been by Manasseh; but see my
Introduction to Isaiah.

tempted--by their foes, in the midst of their tortures, to renounce
their faith; the most bitter aggravation of them. Or else, by those of
their own household, as Job was \[ESTIUS\]; or by the fiery darts of
Satan, as Jesus was in His last trials \[GLASSIUS\]. Probably it
included all three; they were tempted in every possible way, by friends
and foes, by human and satanic agents, by caresses and afflictions, by
words and deeds, to forsake God, but in vain, through the power of
faith.

sword--literally, "they died in the murder of the sword." In [Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md) the contrary is given as an
effect of faith, "they escaped the edge of the sword." Both alike are
marvellous effects of faith. In both accomplishes great things and
suffers great things, without counting it suffering \[CHRYSOSTOM\].
Urijah was so slain by Jehoiakim ([Jer
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#023).md); and the prophets in Israel
([Kg1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010).md).

in sheepskins--as Elijah ([Kg1 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013.md),
Septuagint). They were white; as the "goat-skins" were black (compare
[Zac 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004).md).

tormented--Greek, "in evil state."

[Hebrews 11:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 11:38</span></span>

Of whom the world was not worthy--So far from their being unworthy of
living in the world, as their exile in deserts, &c., might seem to
imply, "the world was not worthy of them." The world, in shutting them
out, shut out from itself a source of blessing; such as Joseph proved to
Potiphar ([Gen 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005).md), and Jacob to
Laban ([Gen 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#027).md). In condemning
them, the world condemned itself.

caves--literally, "chinks." Palestine, from its hilly character, abounds
in fissures and caves, affording shelter to the persecuted, as the fifty
hid by Obadiah ([Kg1 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004.md), [Kg1
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#013).md) and Elijah ([Kg1
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008.md), [Kg1
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#013).md); and Mattathias and his sons (1
Maccabees 2:28, 29); and Judas Maccabeus (2 Maccabees 5:27).

[Hebrews 11:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">heb 11:39</span></span>

having obtained a good report--Greek, "being borne witness of." Though
they were so, yet "they received not the promise," that is, the final
completion of "salvation" promised at Christ's coming again ([Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md); "the eternal inheritance" ([Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015).md). Abraham did obtain the very
thing promised ([Heb 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015).md) in part,
namely, blessedness in soul after death, by virtue of faith in Christ
about to come. The full blessedness of body and soul shall not be till
the full number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all together, no
one preceding the other, shall enter on the full glory and bliss.
Moreover, in another point of view, "It is probable that some
accumulation of blessedness was added to holy souls, when Christ came
and fulfilled all things even as at His burial many rose from the dead,
who doubtless ascended to heaven with Him" \[FLACIUS in BENGEL\].
(Compare Note, see on [Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008).md). The
perfecting of believers in title, and in respect to conscience, took
place once for all, at the death of Christ, by virtue of His being made
by death perfect as Saviour. Their perfecting in soul at, and ever after
Christ's death, took place, and takes place at their death. But the
universal and final perfecting will not take place till Christ's coming.

[Hebrews 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">heb 11:40</span></span>

provided--with divine forethought from eternity (compare [Gen
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md), [Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014).md).

some better thing for us-- ([Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019).md); than they had here. They had
not in this world, "apart from us" (so the Greek is for "without us,"
that is, they had to wait for us for), the clear revelation of the
promised salvation actually accomplished, as we now have it in Christ;
in their state, beyond the grave their souls also seem to have attained
an increase of heavenly bliss on the death and ascension of Christ; and
they shall not attain the full and final glory in body and soul (the
regeneration of the creature), until the full number of the elect
(including us with them) is completed. The Fathers, CHRYSOSTOM, &c.,
restricted the meaning of [Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039.md) to this last truth, and I
incline to this view. "The connection is, You, Hebrews, may far more
easily exercise patience than Old Testament believers; for they had much
longer to wait, and are still waiting until the elect are all gathered
in; you, on the contrary, have not to wait for them" \[ESTIUS\]. I think
his object in these verses ([Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md) is to warn Hebrew Christians
against their tendency to relapse into Judaism. "Though the Old
Testament worthies attained such eminence by faith, they are not above
us in privileges, but the reverse." It is not we who are perfected with
them, but rather they with us. They waited for His coming; we enjoy Him
as having come ([Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md); [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003).md). Christ's death, the means of
perfecting what the Jewish law could not perfect, was reserved for our
time. Compare [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md), "perfecter
(Greek) of our faith." Now that Christ is come, they in soul share our
blessedness, being "the spirits of the just made perfect" ([Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023).md); so ALFORD; however, see on
[Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md). [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md) shows that the blood of Christ,
brought into the heavenly holy place by Him, first opened an entrance
into heaven (compare [Joh 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013).md).
Still, the fathers were in blessedness by faith in the Saviour to come,
at death ([Heb 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#015.md); [Luk
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022).md).
