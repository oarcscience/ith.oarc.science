### [Genesis Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 29:1</span></span>

THE WELL OF HARAN. (Gen. 29:1-35)

Then Jacob went, &c.--Hebrew, "lifted up his feet." He resumed his way
next morning with a light heart and elastic step after the vision of the
ladder; for tokens of the divine favor tend to quicken the discharge of
duty ([Neh 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010).md).

and came into the land, &c.--Mesopotamia and the whole region beyond the
Euphrates are by the sacred writers designated "the East" ([Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md); [Kg1
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md). Between the first and the second
clause of this verse is included a journey of four hundred miles.

[Genesis 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 29:2</span></span>

And he looked, &c.--As he approached the place of his destination, he,
according to custom, repaired to the well adjoining the town where he
would obtain an easy introduction to his relatives.

[Genesis 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 29:3</span></span>

thither were all the flocks gathered; and a stone, &c.--In Arabia, owing
to the shifting sands and in other places, owing to the strong
evaporation, the mouth of a well is generally covered, especially when
it is private property. Over many is laid a broad, thick, flat stone,
with a round hole cut in the middle, forming the mouth of the cistern.
This hole is covered with a heavy stone which it would require two or
three men to roll away. Such was the description of the well at Haran.

[Genesis 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 29:4</span></span>

Jacob said, My brethren--Finding from the shepherds who were reposing
there with flocks and who all belonged to Haran, that his relatives in
Haran were well and that one of the family was shortly expected, he
enquired why they were idling the best part of the day there instead of
watering their flocks and sending them back to pasture.

[Genesis 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 29:8</span></span>

They said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered--In order to
prevent the consequences of too frequent exposure in places where water
is scarce, the well is not only covered, but it is customary to have all
the flocks collected round it before the covering is removed in presence
of the owner or one of his representatives; and it was for this reason
that those who were reposing at the well of Haran with the three flocks
were waiting the arrival of Rachel.

[Genesis 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 29:9</span></span>

While he yet spake with them, Rachel came--Among the pastoral tribes the
young unmarried daughters of the greatest sheiks tend the flocks, going
out at sunrise and continuing to watch their fleecy charges till sunset.
Watering them, which is done twice a day, is a work of time and labor,
and Jacob rendered no small service in volunteering his aid to the young
shepherdess. The interview was affecting, the reception welcome, and
Jacob forgot all his toils in the society of his Mesopotamian relatives.
Can we doubt that he returned thanks to God for His goodness by the way?

[Genesis 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 29:12</span></span>

Jacob told Rachel, &c.--According to the practice of the East, the term
"brother" is extended to remote degrees of relationship, as uncle,
cousin, or nephew.

[Genesis 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 29:14</span></span>

he abode a month--Among pastoral people a stranger is freely entertained
for three days; on the fourth day he is expected to tell his name and
errand; and if he prolongs his stay after that time, he must set his
hand to work in some way, as may be agreed upon. A similar rule obtained
in Laban's establishment, and the wages for which his nephew engaged to
continue in his employment was the hand of Rachel.

[Genesis 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 29:17</span></span>

Leah tender-eyed--that is, soft blue eyes--thought a blemish.

Rachel beautiful and well-favored--that is, comely and handsome in form.
The latter was Jacob's choice.

[Genesis 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 29:18</span></span>

I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy daughter--A proposal of
marriage is made to the father without the daughter being consulted, and
the match is effected by the suitor either bestowing costly presents on
the family, or by giving cattle to the value the father sets upon his
daughter, or else by giving personal services for a specified period.
The last was the course necessity imposed on Jacob; and there for seven
years he submitted to the drudgery of a hired shepherd, with the view of
obtaining Rachel. The time went rapidly away; for even severe and
difficult duties become light when love is the spring of action.

[Genesis 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 29:21</span></span>

Jacob said, Give me my wife--At the expiry of the stipulated term the
marriage festivities were held. But an infamous fraud was practised on
Jacob, and on his showing a righteous indignation, the usage of the
country was pleaded in excuse. No plea of kindred should ever be allowed
to come in opposition to the claim of justice. But this is often
overlooked by the selfish mind of man, and fashion or custom rules
instead of the will of God. This was what Laban did, as he said, "It
must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the
first-born." But, then, if that were the prevailing custom of society at
Haran, he should have apprized his nephew of it at an early period in an
honorable manner. This, however, is too much the way with the people of
the East still. The duty of marrying an elder daughter before a younger,
the tricks which parents take to get off an elder daughter that is plain
or deformed and in which they are favored by the long bridal veil that
entirely conceals her features all the wedding day, and the prolongation
for a week of the marriage festivities among the greater sheiks, are
accordant with the habits of the people in Arabia and Armenia in the
present day.

[Genesis 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 29:28</span></span>

gave him Rachel also--It is evident that the marriage of both sisters
took place nearly about the same time, and that such a connection was
then allowed, though afterwards prohibited ([Lev
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018).md).

[Genesis 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 29:29</span></span>

gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah to be her maid--A father in good
circumstances still gives his daughter from his household a female
slave, over whom the young wife, independently of her husband, has the
absolute control.

[Genesis 29:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 29:31</span></span>

Leah . . . hated--that is, not loved so much as she ought to have been.
Her becoming a mother ensured her rising in the estimation both of her
husband and of society.

[Genesis 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 29:32</span></span>

son . . . his name Reuben--Names were also significant; and those which
Leah gave to her sons were expressive of her varying feelings of
thankfulness or joy, or allusive to circumstances in the history of the
family. There was piety and wisdom in attaching a signification to
names, as it tended to keep the bearer in remembrance of his duty and
the claims of God.
