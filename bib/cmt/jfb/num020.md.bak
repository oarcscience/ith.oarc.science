### [Numbers Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 20:1</span></span>

THE DEATH OF MIRIAM. (Num. 20:1-29)

Then came the children of Israel . . . into the desert of Zin in the
first month--that is, of the fortieth year (compare [Num
20:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md), with [Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038).md). In this history only the
principal and most important incidents are recorded, those confined
chiefly to the first or second and the last years of the journeyings in
the wilderness, thence called Et-Tih. Between [Num
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#022.md) and [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001.md) there is a long and undescribed
interval of thirty-seven years.

the people abode in Kadesh--supposed to be what is now known as
Ain-el-Weibeh, three springs surrounded by palms. (See on [Num
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#026).md). It was their second arrival
after an interval of thirty-eight years ([Deu
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#014).md). The old generation had nearly
all died, and the new one encamped in it with the view of entering the
promised land, not, however, as formerly on the south, but by crossing
the Edomite region on the east.

Miriam died there--four months before Aaron \[[Num
33:38](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#038.md)\].

[Numbers 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 20:2</span></span>

there was no water for the congregation--There was at Kadesh a fountain,
En-Mishpat ([Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007).md), and at the
first encampment of the Israelites there was no want of water. It was
then either partially dried up by the heat of the season, or had been
exhausted by the demands of so vast a multitude.

[Numbers 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 20:6</span></span>

Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly--Here is a fresh
ebullition of the untamed and discontented spirit of the people. The
leaders fled to the precincts of the sanctuary, both as an asylum from
the increasing fury of the highly excited rabble, and as their usual
refuge in seasons of perplexity and danger, to implore the direction and
aid of God.

[Numbers 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 20:8</span></span>

Take the rod--which had been deposited in the tabernacle ([Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010).md), the wonder-working rod by
which so many miracles had been performed, sometimes called "the rod of
God" ([Exo 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#020).md), sometimes Moses'
([Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md) or Aaron's rod ([Exo
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#012).md).

[Numbers 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 20:10</span></span>

\[Moses\] said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water
out of this rock?--The conduct of the great leader on this occasion was
hasty and passionate ([Psa 106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033).md). He
had been directed to speak to the rock \[[Num
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#008.md)\], but he smote it twice \[[Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md)\] in his impetuosity, thus
endangering the blossoms of the rod, and, instead of speaking to the
rock, he spoke to the people in a fury.

[Numbers 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 20:11</span></span>

the congregation drank, and their beasts--Physically the water afforded
the same kind of needful refreshment to both. But from a religious point
of view, this, which was only a common element to the cattle, was a
sacrament to the people ([Co1 10:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003).md)
--It possessed a relative sanctity imparted to it by its divine origin
and use.

[Numbers 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 20:12</span></span>

The Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not,
&c.--The act of Moses in smiting twice betrayed a doubt, not of the
power, but of the will of God to gratify such a rebellious people, and
his exclamation seems to have emanated from a spirit of incredulity akin
to Sarai's ([Gen 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#013).md). These
circumstances indicate the influence of unbelief, and there might have
been others unrecorded which led to so severe a chastisement.

[Numbers 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 20:13</span></span>

This is the water of Meribah--The word "Kadesh" is added to it \[[Deu
32:51](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#051.md)\] to distinguish it from another
Meribah ([Exo 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#007).md).

[Numbers 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 20:14</span></span>

Moses sent messengers . . . to the king of Edom--The encampment at
Kadesh was on the confines of the Edomite territory, through which the
Israelites would have had an easy passage across the Arabah by
Wady-el-Ghuweir, so that they could have continued their course around
Moab, and approached Palestine from the east \[ROBERTS\]. The Edomites,
being the descendants of Esau and tracing their line of descent from
Abraham as their common stock, were recognized by the Israelites as
brethren, and a very brotherly message was sent to them.

[Numbers 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 20:17</span></span>

we will go by the king's highway--probably Wady-el-Ghuweir \[ROBERTS\],
through which ran one of the great lines of road, constructed for
commercial caravans, as well as for the progress of armies. The
engineering necessary for carrying them over marshes or mountains, and
the care requisite for protecting them from the shifting sands, led to
their being under the special care of the state. Hence the expression,
"the king's highway," which is of great antiquity.

[Numbers 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 20:19</span></span>

if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it--From the
scarcity of water in the warm climates of the East, the practice of
levying a tax for the use of the wells is universal; and the jealousy of
the natives, in guarding the collected treasures of rain, is often so
great that water cannot be procured for money.

[Numbers 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 20:21</span></span>

Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, &c.--A churlish
refusal obliged them to take another route. (See on [Num
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#004.md); [Deu
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md); and [Jdg
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#018.md); see also [Sa1
14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md); [Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014.md), which describe the retribution
that was taken.)

[Numbers 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 20:22</span></span>

the children of Israel . . . came unto mount Hor--now Gebel Haroun, the
most striking and lofty elevation in the Seir range, called emphatically
"the mount" \[[Num 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028.md)\]. It is
conspicuous by its double top.

[Numbers 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 20:24</span></span>

Aaron shall be gathered unto his people--In accordance with his recent
doom, he, attired in the high priest's costume, was commanded to ascend
that mountain and die. But although the time of his death was hastened
by the divine displeasure as a punishment for his sins, the manner of
his death was arranged in tenderness of love, and to do him honor at the
close of his earthly service. His ascent of the mount was to afford him
a last look of the camp and a distant prospect of the promised land. The
simple narrative of the solemn and impressive scene implies, though it
does not describe, the pious resignation, settled faith, and inward
peace of the aged pontiff.

[Numbers 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 20:26</span></span>

strip Aaron of his garments--that is, his pontifical robes, in token of
his resignation. (See [Isa 22:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#020).md).

put them on his son--as the inauguration into his high office. Having
been formerly anointed with the sacred oil, that ceremony was not
repeated, or, as some think, it was done on his return to the camp.

[Numbers 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 20:28</span></span>

Aaron died there in the top of the mount--(See on [Deu
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006).md). A tomb has been erected upon or
close by the spot where he was buried.

[Numbers 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">num 20:29</span></span>

When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead--Moses and Eleazar
were the sole witnesses of his departure ([Num
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#028).md). According to the established
law, the new high priest could not have been present at the funeral of
his father without contracting ceremonial defilement ([Lev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#011).md). But that law was dispensed
with in the extraordinary circumstances. The people learned the event
not only from the recital of the two witnesses, but from their visible
signs of grief and change; and this event betokened the imperfection of
the Levitical priesthood ([Heb 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#012).md).

they mourned for Aaron thirty days--the usual period of public and
solemn mourning. (See on [Deu 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008).md).
