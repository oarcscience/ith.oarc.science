### [Jeremiah Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 33:1</span></span>

PROPHECY OF THE RESTORATION FROM BABYLON, AND OF MESSIAH AS KING AND
PRIEST. (Jer. 33:1-26)

shut up-- ([Jer 32:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md); [Ti2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009).md). Though Jeremiah was shut up in
bondage, the word of God was "not bound."

[Jeremiah 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 33:2</span></span>

maker thereof--rather, "the doer of it," namely, that which Jeremiah is
about to prophesy, the restoration of Israel, an act which is thought
now impossible, but which the Almighty will effect.

formed it--namely, Jerusalem ([Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044).md) \[CALVIN\]. Rather, "that
formed," that is, moulds His purpose into due shape for execution ([Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026).md).

Lord . . . his name-- ([Exo 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 33:3</span></span>

Call . . . I will answer-- ([Jer
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md); [Psa
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015).md). Jeremiah, as the
representative of the people of God, is urged by God to pray for that
which God has determined to grant; namely, the restoration. God's
promises are not to slacken, but to quicken the prayers of His people
([Psa 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md), [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md); [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md).

mighty things--Hebrew, "inaccessible things," that is, incredible, hard
to man's understanding \[MAURER\], namely, the restoration of the Jews,
an event despaired of. "Hidden," or "recondite" \[PISCATOR\].

thou knowest not--Yet God had revealed those things to Jeremiah, but the
unbelief of the people in rejecting the grace of God had caused him to
forget God's promise, as though the case of the people admitted of no
remedy.

[Jeremiah 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 33:4</span></span>

houses . . . thrown down by the mounts--namely, by the missiles cast
from the besiegers' mounds ([Jer
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#024).md); "and by the sword" follows
properly, as, after missiles had prepared the way, the foe next advanced
to close quarters "with the sword."

[Jeremiah 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 33:5</span></span>

They--the Jews; the defenders of the "houses" ([Jer
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#004).md), "come forward to fight with the
Chaldeans," who burst into the city through the "thrown-down houses,"
but all the effect that they produce "is, to fill them (the houses) with
their own "dead bodies."

[Jeremiah 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 33:6</span></span>

([Jer 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017).md). The answer to Jeremiah's
mournful question ([Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022).md).

cure--literally, the long linen bandage employed in dressing wounds.

truth--that is, stability; I will bring forth for them abundant and
permanent peace, that is, prosperity.

[Jeremiah 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 33:7</span></span>

cause . . . to return--that is, reverse ([Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md); [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044).md). The specification, both of
"Judah" and "Israel," can only apply fully to the future restoration.

as at the first-- ([Isa 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 33:8</span></span>

cleanse-- ([Eze 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); [Heb
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013).md). Alluding to the legal rites
of purification.

all their iniquity . . . all their iniquities--both the principle of sin
within, and its outward manifestations in acts. The repetition is in
order that the Jews may consider how great is the grace of God in not
merely pardoning (as to the punishment), but also cleansing them (as to
the pollution of guilt); not merely one iniquity, but all ([Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 33:9</span></span>

it--the city.

a name . . . a praise-- ([Jer 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011.md);
[Isa 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007).md).

them--the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

they shall fear . . . for all the goodness-- ([Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004).md). The Gentiles shall be led to
"fear" God by the proofs of His power displayed in behalf of the Jews;
the ungodly among them shall "tremble" for fear of God's judgments on
them; the penitent shall reverentially fear and be converted to Him
([Psa 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 33:10</span></span>

ye say . . . desolate-- ([Jer 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043).md).

[Jeremiah 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 33:11</span></span>

([Jer 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md); [Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009).md).

Praise the Lord, &c.--the words of [Psa
136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md), which were actually used by the
Jews at their restoration ([Ezr 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#011).md).

sacrifice of praise-- ([Psa 107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022.md);
[Psa 116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017).md). This shall continue when
all other sacrifices shall be at an end.

[Jeremiah 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 33:12</span></span>

habitation of shepherds . . . flocks--in contrast to [Jer
33:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#010.md), "without man . . . inhabitant .
. . without beast" ([Jer 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#043.md);
compare [Jer 31:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#024.md); [Jer
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md); [Isa
65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 33:13</span></span>

pass . . . under . . . hands of him that telleth them--Shepherds, in
sending forth and bringing back their sheep to the folds, count them by
striking each as it passes with a rod, implying the shepherd's provident
care that not one should be lost ([Lev
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#032.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md); compare [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 33:14</span></span>

perform--"I will make to rise"; God's promise having for a time seemed
to "lie" dead and abortive \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 33:15</span></span>

Repeated from [Jer 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md).

the land--the Holy Land: Israel and Judah ([Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 33:16</span></span>

Jerusalem--In [Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md), instead of
this, it is "Israel." "The name" in the Hebrew has here to be supplied
from that passage; and for "he" (Messiah, the antitypical "Israel"), the
antecedent there ([Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003).md), we have
"she" here, that is, Jerusalem. She is called by the same name as
Messiah, "The Lord Our Righteousness," by virtue of the mystical oneness
between her (as the literal representative of the spiritual Church) and
her Lord and Husband. Thus, whatever belongs to the Head belongs also to
the members ([Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md), [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032).md). Hence, the Church is called
"Christ" ([Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md); [Co1
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012).md). The Church hereby professes to
draw all her righteousness from Christ ([Isa
45:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024).md). It is for the sake of
Jerusalem, literal and spiritual, that God the Father gives this name
(Jehovah, Tsidkenu, "The Lord our Righteousness") to Christ.

[Jeremiah 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 33:17</span></span>

The promises of perpetuity of the throne of David fulfilled in Messiah,
the son of David ([Sa2 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016.md); [Kg1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004.md); [Psa
89:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#004.md), [Psa
89:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029.md), [Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036.md); compare [Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md).

[Jeremiah 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 33:18</span></span>

Messiah's literal priesthood ([Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md), [Heb
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#021.md), [Heb
7:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#024).md), and His followers' spiritual
priesthood and sacrifices ([Jer 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md);
[Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md), [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md), shall never cease, according to
the covenant with Levi, broken by the priests, but fulfilled by Messiah
([Num 25:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#012.md); [Mal
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004.md), [Mal
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 33:20</span></span>

covenant of the day--that is, covenant with the day: answering to
"covenant with David" ([Jer 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#021.md),
also [Jer 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025.md), "with day"; compare
[Jer 31:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md); [Lev
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#042.md); [Psa
89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034.md), [Psa
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037).md).

[Jeremiah 33:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 33:22</span></span>

([Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md); [Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017).md). The blessing there promised
belonged to all the tribes; here it is restricted to the family of David
and the tribe of Levi, because it was on these that the welfare of the
whole people rested. When the kingdom and priesthood flourish in the
person of Messiah, the whole nation shall temporally and spiritually
prosper.

[Jeremiah 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 33:24</span></span>

this people--certain of the Jews, especially those who spoke with
Jeremiah in the court of the prison ([Jer
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#012.md); [Jer
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001).md).

the two families--Judah and Israel.

before them--in their judgment. They suppose that I have utterly cast
off Israel so as to he no more a nation. The expression, "My people," of
itself, shows God has not cast off Israel for ever.

[Jeremiah 33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 33:25</span></span>

([Jer 31:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#035.md); [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022.md); [Psa
74:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016).md). I who have established the
laws of nature am the same God who has made a covenant with the Church.

[Jeremiah 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 33:26</span></span>

Isaac-- ([Psa 105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md); [Amo
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#009.md), [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016).md).

The prophecy ([Jer 34:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md) as to
Zedekiah is an amplification of that in [Jer
32:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#001.md), in consequence of which
Jeremiah was then shut up in the court of the prison. The prophecy ([Jer
34:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md) refers to the Jews, who,
afraid of the capture of the city, had, in obedience to the law, granted
freedom to their servants at the end of seven years, but on the
intermission of the siege forced them back into bondage.
