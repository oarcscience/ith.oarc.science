### [Micah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md)

[Micah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 7:1</span></span>

THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE CORRUPTION; THE CHOSEN REMNANT, DRIVEN FROM
EVERY HUMAN CONFIDENCE, TURNS TO GOD; TRIUMPHS BY FAITH OVER HER
ENEMIES; IS COMFORTED BY GOD'S PROMISES IN ANSWER TO PRAYER, AND BY THE
CONFUSION OF HER ENEMIES, AND SO BREAKS FORTH INTO PRAISES OF GOD'S
CHARACTER. (Mic. 7:1-20)

I am as when, &c.--It is the same with me as with one seeking fruits
after the harvest, grapes after the vintage. "There is not a cluster" to
be found: no "first-ripe fruit" (or "early fig"; see on [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004).md) which "my soul desireth"
\[MAURER\]. So I look in vain for any good men left ([Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002).md).

[Micah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 7:2</span></span>

The Hebrew expresses "one merciful and good in relation to man," rather
than to God.

is perished out of the earth-- ([Psa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001).md).

[Micah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 7:3</span></span>

That they may do evil with both hands earnestly--literally, "Their hands
are for evil that they may do it well" (that is, cleverly and
successfully).

the great man, he--emphatic repetition. As for the great man, he no
sooner has expressed his bad desire (literally, the "mischief or lust of
his soul), than the venal judges are ready to wrest the decision of the
case according to his wish.

so they wrap it up--The Hebrew is used of intertwining cords together.
The "threefold cord is not quickly broken" ([Ecc
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#012).md); here the "prince," the "judge,"
and the "great man" are the three in guilty complicity. "They wrap it
up," namely, they conspire to carry out the great man's desire at the
sacrifice of justice.

[Micah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 7:4</span></span>

as a brier--or thorn; pricking with injury all who come in contact with
them ([Sa2 23:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006.md); [Isa
55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013.md); [Eze
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006).md).

the day of thy watchmen--the day foretold by thy (true) prophets, as the
time of "thy visitation" in wrath \[GROTIUS\]. Or, "the day of thy false
prophets being punished"; they are specially threatened as being not
only blind themselves, but leading others blindfold \[CALVIN\].

now--at the time foretold, "at that time"; the prophet transporting
himself into it.

perplexity-- ([Isa 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#005).md). They shall
not know whither to turn.

[Micah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 7:5</span></span>

Trust ye not in a friend--Faith is kept nowhere: all to a man are
treacherous ([Jer 9:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#002).md). When justice
is perverted by the great, faith nowhere is safe. So, in gospel times of
persecution, "a man's foes are they of his own household" ([Mat
10:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#035.md); [Luk
12:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#053).md).

guide--a counsellor \[CALVIN\] able to help and advise (compare [Psa
118:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md); [Psa
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003).md). The head of your family, to
whom all the members of the family would naturally repair in
emergencies. Similarly the Hebrew is translated in [Jos
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#014.md) and "chief friends" in [Pro
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#028.md) \[GROTIUS\].

her that lieth in thy bosom--thy wife ([Deu
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006).md).

[Micah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 7:6</span></span>

son dishonoureth the father--The state of unnatural lawlessness in all
relations of life is here described which is to characterize the last
times, before Messiah comes to punish the ungodly and save Israel
(compare [Luk 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#016.md); [Ti2
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001).md).

[Micah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 7:7</span></span>

Therefore I will look unto the Lord--as if no one else were before mine
eyes. We must not only "look unto the Lord," but also "wait for Him."
Having no hope from man ([Mic 7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005).md),
Micah speaks in the name of Israel, who herein, taught by chastisement
([Mic 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004).md) to feel her sin ([Mic
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009).md), casts herself on the Lord as her
only hope," in patient waiting ([Lam
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#026).md). She did so under the Babylonian
captivity; she shall do so again hereafter when the spirit of grace
shall be poured on her ([Zac
12:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md).

[Micah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 7:8</span></span>

Rejoice not--at my fall.

when I fall, I shall arise-- ([Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024.md); [Pro
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016).md).

when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light--Israel reasons as her
divine representative, Messiah, reasoned by faith in His hour of
darkness and desertion ([Isa 50:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md),
[Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010).md). Israel addresses Babylon,
her triumphant foe (or Edom), as a female; the type of her last and
worst foes ([Psa 137:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md). "Mine
enemy," in Hebrew, is feminine.

[Micah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 7:9</span></span>

bear--patiently.

the indignation of the Lord--His punishment inflicted on me ([Lam
3:39](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039).md). The true penitent "accepts the
punishment of his iniquity" ([Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md), [Lev
26:43](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#043).md); they who murmur against God,
do not yet know their guilt ([Job
40:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004).md).

execute judgment for me--against my foe. God's people plead guilty
before God; but, in respect to their human foes, they are innocent and
undeserving of their foes' injuries.

bring me forth to the light--to the temporal and spiritual redemption.

I shall behold his righteousness--His gracious faithfulness to His
promises ([Psa 103:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#017).md).

[Micah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 7:10</span></span>

shame shall cover her--in seeing how utterly mistaken she was in
supposing that I was utterly ruined.

Where is . . . thy God-- ([Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003.md),
[Psa 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#010).md). If He be "thy God," as
thou sayest, let Him come now and deliver thee. So as to Israel's
representative, Messiah ([Mat 27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043).md).

mine eyes shall behold her--a just retribution in kind upon the foe who
had said, "Let our eye look upon Zion." Zion shall behold her foe
prostrate, not with the carnal joy of revenge, but with spiritual joy in
God's vindicating His own righteousness ([Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md); [Rev
16:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#005).md).

shall she be trodden down--herself, who had trodden down me.

[Micah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 7:11</span></span>

thy walls . . . be built--under Cyrus, after the seventy years'
captivity; and again, hereafter, when the Jews shall be restored ([Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md); [Zac
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006).md).

shall the decree be far removed--namely, thy tyrannical decree or rule
of Babylon shall be put away from thee, "the statutes that were not
good" ([Eze 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025).md) \[CALVIN\]. [Psa
102:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md); [Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md). The Hebrew is against MAURER'S
translation, "the boundary of the city shall be far extended," so as to
contain the people flocking into it from all nations ([Mic
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012.md); [Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md); [Isa
54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002).md).

[Micah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 7:12</span></span>

In that day also--rather, an answer to the supposed question of Zion,
When shall my walls be built? "The day (of thy walls being built) is the
day when he (that is, many) shall come to thee from Assyria," &c.
\[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. The Assyrians (including the Babylonians) who
spoiled thee shall come.

and from the fortified cities--rather, to suit the parallelism, "from
Assyria even to Egypt." (Matzor may be so translated). So Assyria and
Egypt are contrasted in [Isa 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md)
\[MAURER\]. CALVIN agrees with English Version, "from all fortified
cities."

from the fortress even to the river--"from Egypt even to the river"
Euphrates (answering in parallelism to "Assyria") \[MAURER\]. Compare
[Isa 11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); [Isa
19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md); [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md); [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md); [Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010.md).

[Micah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 7:13</span></span>

However glorious the prospect of restoration, the Jews are not to forget
the visitation on their "land" which is to intervene for the "fruit of
(evil caused by) their doings" (compare [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Isa
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md); [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014).md).

[Micah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mic 7:14</span></span>

Feed thy people--Prayer of the prophet, in the name of his people to
God, which, as God fulfils believing prayer, is prophetical of what God
would do. When God is about to deliver His people, He stirs up their
friends to pray for them.

Feed--including the idea of both pastoral rule and care over His people
([Mic 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#004), Margin.md), regarded as a
flock ([Psa 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md); [Psa
100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003).md). Our calamity must be fatal to
the nation, unless Thou of Thy unmerited grace, remembering Thy covenant
with "Thine heritage" ([Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md), shalt restore us.

thy rod--the shepherd's rod, wherewith He directs the flock ([Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md). No longer the rod of punishment
([Mic 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009).md).

which dwell solitarily in the wood, in . . . Carmel--Let Thy people who
have been dwelling as it were in a solitude of woods (in the world, but
not of it), scattered among various nations, dwell in Carmel, that is,
where there are fruit-bearing lands and vineyards \[CALVIN\]. Rather,
"which are about to dwell (that is, that they may dwell) separate in the
wood, in . . . Carmel" \[MAURER\], which are to be no longer mingled
with the heathen, but are to dwell as a distinct people in their own
land. Micah has here Balaam's prophecy in view (compare [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md), where also Balaam is referred
to). "Lo, the people shall dwell alone" ([Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md); compare [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028).md). To "feed in the wood in
Carmel," is to feed in the rich pastures among its woods. To "sleep in
the woods," is the image of most perfect security ([Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025).md). So that the Jews' "security,"
as well as their distinct nationality, is here foretold. Also [Jer
49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md).

Bashan--famed for its cattle ([Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001).md). Parallel to this passage is [Jer
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md). Bashan and Gilead, east of
Jordan, were chosen by Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, as abounding in
pastures suited for their many cattle (Num. 32:1-42; [Deu
3:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#012).md).

[Micah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mic 7:15</span></span>

thy . . . him--both referring to Israel. So in [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md) the person is changed from the
first to the third, "us . . . our . . . their." Jehovah here answers
Micah's prayer in [Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md), assuring
him, that as He delivered His people from Egypt by miraculous power, so
He would again "show" it in their behalf ([Jer
16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014).md).

[Micah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mic 7:16</span></span>

shall see--the "marvellous things" ([Mic
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015.md); [Isa
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md).

confounded at all their might--having so suddenly proved unavailing:
that might wherewith they had thought that there is nothing which they
could not effect against God's people.

lay . . . hand upon . . . mouth--the gesture of silence ([Job
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005.md); [Job
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004.md); [Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042.md); [Isa
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015).md). They shall be struck dumb at
Israel's marvellous deliverance, and no longer boast that God's people
is destroyed.

ears . . . deaf--They shall stand astounded so as not to hear what shall
be said \[GROTIUS\]. Once they had eagerly drunk in all rumors as so
many messages of victories; but then they shall be afraid of hearing
them, because they continually fear new disasters, when they see the God
of Israel to be so powerful \[CALVIN\]. They shall close their ears so
as not to be compelled to hear of Israel's successes.

[Micah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mic 7:17</span></span>

lick the dust--in abject prostration as suppliants ([Psa
72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009.md); compare [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md); [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025).md).

move out of their holes--As reptiles from their holes, they shall come
forth from their hiding-places, or fortresses ([Psa
18:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045).md), to give themselves up to the
conquerors. More literally, "they shall tremble from," that is,
tremblingly come forth from their coverts.

like worms--reptiles or crawlers ([Deu
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024).md).

they shall be afraid of the Lord--or, they shall in fear turn with haste
to the Lord. Thus the antithesis is brought out. They shall tremble
forth from their holes: they shall in trepidation turn to the Lord for
salvation (compare Note, see on [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md), and [Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009).md).

fear because of thee--shall fear Thee, Jehovah (and so fear Israel as
under Thy guardianship). There is a change here from speaking of God to
speaking to God \[MAURER\]. Or rather, "shall fear thee, Israel"
\[HENDERSON\].

[Micah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mic 7:18</span></span>

Grateful at such unlooked-for grace being promised to Israel, Micah
breaks forth into praises of Jehovah.

passeth by the transgression--not conniving at it, but forgiving it;
leaving it unpunished, as a traveller passes by what he chooses not to
look into ([Pro 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#011).md). Contrast [Amo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008.md), and "mark iniquities," [Psa
130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003.md).

the remnant--who shall be permitted to survive the previous judgment:
the elect remnant of grace ([Mic 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007.md);
[Mic 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003.md), [Mic
5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md).

retaineth not . . . anger-- ([Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009).md).

delighteth in mercy--God's forgiving is founded on His nature, which
delights in loving-kindness, and is averse from wrath.

[Micah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mic 7:19</span></span>

turn again--to us, from having been turned away from us.

subdue our iniquities--literally, "tread under foot," as being hostile
and deadly to us. Without subjugation of our bad propensities, even
pardon could not give us peace. When God takes away the guilt of sin
that it may not condemn us, He takes away also the power of sin that it
may not rule us.

cast . . . into . . . depths of the sea--never to rise again to view,
buried out of sight in eternal oblivion: not merely at the shore side,
where they may rise again.

our . . . their--change of person. Micah in the first case identifying
himself and his sins with his people and their sins; in the second,
speaking of them and their sins.

[Micah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mic 7:20</span></span>

perform the truth--the faithful promise.

to Jacob . . . Abraham--Thou shalt make good to their posterity the
promise made to the patriarchs. God's promises are called "mercy,"
because they flow slowly from grace; "truth," because they will be
surely performed ([Luk 1:72-73](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#072.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024).md).

sworn unto our fathers-- ([Psa
105:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009).md). The promise to Abraham is
in [Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md); to Isaac, in [Gen
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#024.md); to Jacob, in [Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md). This unchangeable promise
implied an engagement that the seed of the patriarchs should never
perish, and should be restored to their inheritance as often as they
turned wholly to God ([Deu 30:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md).
