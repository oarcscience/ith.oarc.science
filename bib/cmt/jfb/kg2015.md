AZARIAH'S REIGN OVER JUDAH. ([Kg2
15:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001))

In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam--It is thought that the
throne of Judah continued vacant eleven or twelve years, between the
death of Amaziah and the inauguration of his son Azariah. Being a child
only four years old when his father was murdered, a regency was
appointed during Azariah's minority.

began Azariah . . . to reign--The character of his reign is described by
the brief formula employed by the inspired historian, in recording the
religious policy of the later kings. But his reign was a very active as
well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch. 26:1-23). Elated by the
possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as
did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal
offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital
([Num 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/num008.htm#007)), was equivalent to death,
for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son,
as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom--being about
fifteen years of age (compare [Kg2
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033)) --he had to dwell in a place
apart by himself (see on [Kg2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003)).
After a long reign he died, and was buried in the royal burying-field,
though not in the royal cemetery of "the city of David" ([Ch2
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023)).

ZECHARIAH'S REIGN OVER ISRAEL. ([Kg2
15:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008))

In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the
son of Jeroboam reign over Israel--There was an interregnum from some
unknown cause between the reign of Jeroboam and the accession of his
son, which lasted, according to some, for ten or twelve years, according
to others, for twenty-two years, or more. This prince pursued the
religious policy of the calf-worship, and his reign was short, being
abruptly terminated by the hand of violence. In his fate was fulfilled
the prophecy addressed to Jehu ([Kg2
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030); also [Hos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004)), that his family would possess
the throne of Israel for four generations; and accordingly Jehoahaz,
Joash, Jehoram, and Zechariah were his successors--but there his dynasty
terminated; and perhaps it was the public knowledge of this prediction
that prompted the murderous design of Shallum.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 15:13</span></span>

Shallum . . . reigned a full month--He was opposed and slain by Menahem,
who, according to JOSEPHUS, was commander of the forces, which, on the
report of the king's murder, were besieging Tirzah, a town twelve miles
east of Samaria, and formerly a seat of the kings of Israel. Raising the
siege, he marched directly against the usurper, slew him, and reigned in
his stead.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 15:16</span></span>

Menahem . . . smote Tiphsah--Thapsacus, on the Euphrates, the border
city of Solomon's kingdom ([Kg1 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024)).
The inhabitants refusing to open their gates to him, Menahem took it by
storm. Then having spoiled it, he committed the most barbarous excesses,
without regard either to age or sex.

MENAHEM'S REIGN. ([Kg2 15:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#017))

reigned ten years in Samaria--His government was conducted on the
religious policy of his predecessors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 15:19</span></span>

Pul the king of Assyria--This is the first Assyrian king after Nimrod
who is mentioned in biblical history. His name has been recently
identified with that of Phalluka on the monuments of Nineveh, and that
of Menahem discovered also.

came against the land--Elsewhere it is said "Ephraim \[Israel\] went to
the Assyrian" \[[Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013)\]. The two
statements may be reconciled thus: "Pul, of his own motion, induced,
perhaps, by the expedition of Menahem against Thapsacus, advanced
against the kingdom of Israel; then Menahem sent him a thousand talents
in order not only to divert him from his plans of conquest, but at the
same time to purchase his friendship and aid for the establishment of
his own precarious sovereignty. So Menahem did not properly invite the
Assyrian into the land, but only changed the enemy when marching against
the country, by this tribute, into a confederate for the security of his
usurped dominion. This the prophet Hosea, less concerned about the
historical fact than the disposition betrayed therein, might very well
censure as a going of Ephraim to the Assyrians ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013); [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001); [Hos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009)), and a covenant-making with
Asshur" ([Kg2 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001)) \[KEIL\].

a thousand talents of silver--Equal to Â£262,200. This tribute, which
Menahem raised by a tax on the grandees of Israel, bribed Pul to return
to his own country (see on [Ch1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026)).

PEKAHIAH'S REIGN. ([Kg2 15:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#022))

Pekahiah . . . son of Menahem began to reign--On comparing the date
given with Azariah's reign, it seems that several months had intervened
between the death of Menahem and the accession of Pekahiah, probably
owing to a contest about the throne.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg2 15:25</span></span>

with Argob and Arieh, &c.--Many commentators view these as the captain's
accomplices. But it is more probable that they were influential friends
of the king, who were murdered along with him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 15:29</span></span>

PEKAH'S REIGN. ([Kg2 15:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#027))

in the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser--This monarch,
who succeeded Pul on the throne of Assyria, is the only one of all the
kings who does not give his genealogy, and is therefore supposed to have
been an usurper. His annals have been discovered in the Nimroud mound,
describing this expedition into Syria. The places taken are here
mentioned as they occurred and were conquered in the progress of an
invasion.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg2 15:30</span></span>

Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy . . . and slew him--He did not,
however, obtain possession of the kingdom till about nine or ten years
after the perpetration of this crime \[HALES\].

in the twentieth year of Jotham--Jotham's reign lasted only sixteen
years, but the meaning is that the reign of Hoshea began in the
twentieth after the beginning of Jotham's reign. The sacred historian,
having not yet introduced the name of Ahaz, reckoned the date by Jotham,
whom he had already mentioned (see [Ch2
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#008)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#033)

JOTHAM'S REIGN OVER JUDAH. ([Kg2
15:32-38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032))

Five and twenty years was he when he began to reign--that is, alone--for
he had ruled as his father's viceroy \[[Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005)\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 15:35</span></span>

the higher gate of the house of the Lord--not the temple itself, but one
of its courts; probably that which led into the palace ([Ch2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2023.htm#020)).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">kg2 15:37</span></span>

the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, &c.--This
is the first intimation of the hostile feelings of the kings of Israel
and Syria, to Judah, which led them to form an alliance and make joint
preparations for war. \[See on [Ch2
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005).\] However, war was not actually
waged till the reign of Ahaz.
