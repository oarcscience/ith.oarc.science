history, [Sa1 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#011), &c. The scope is

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 59:4</span></span>

prepare, &c.--literally, "set themselves as in array."

awake--(Compare [Psa 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007); [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)), appeals to God in His covenant
relation to His people ([Psa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#018)).

[Psalms 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 59:6</span></span>

They are as ravening dogs seeking prey, and as such,

belch out--that is, slanders, their impudent barkings.

[Psalms 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 59:7</span></span>

for who, say they--For the full expression with the supplied words,

[Psalms 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 59:9</span></span>

By judicious expositors, and on good grounds, this is better rendered,
"O my strength, on Thee will I wait" ([Psa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017)).

defence--(Compare [Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003)).

[Psalms 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 59:10</span></span>

prevent me-- ([Psa 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#003)).

see my desire--in their overthrow ([Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007)).

enemies--as in [Psa 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008).

[Psalms 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 59:11</span></span>

Slay them not--at once ([Jdg 2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#021));
but perpetuate their punishment ([Gen
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012); [Num

let them even be . . . taken in their pride--while evincing it--that is,
to be punished for their lies, &c.

[Psalms 59:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 59:13</span></span>

Though delayed for wise reasons, the utter destruction of the wicked
must come at last, and God's presence and power in and for His Church
will be known abroad ([Sa1 17:46](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#046); [Psa
46:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010)).

[Psalms 59:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 59:14</span></span>

Meanwhile let the rapacious dogs prowl, they cannot hurt the pious; yea,
they shall wander famished and sleepless.

[Psalms 59:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 59:15</span></span>
