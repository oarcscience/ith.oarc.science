[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 10:1</span></span>

THE QUEEN OF SHEBA ADMIRES THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON. ([Kg1
10:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#001).md)

the queen of Sheba--Some think her country was the Sabean kingdom of
Yemen, of which the capital was Saba, in Arabia-Felix; others, that it
was in African Ethiopia, that is, Abyssinia, towards the south of the
Red Sea. The opinions preponderate in favor of the former. This view
harmonizes with the language of our Lord, as Yemen means "South"; and
this country, extending to the shores of the Indian ocean, might in
ancient times be considered "the uttermost parts of the earth."

heard of the fame of Solomon--doubtless by the Ophir fleet.

concerning the name of the Lord--meaning either his great knowledge of
God, or the extraordinary things which God had done for him.

hard questions--enigmas or riddles. The Orientals delight in this
species of intellectual exercise and test wisdom by the power and
readiness to solve them.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 10:2</span></span>

she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels--A long train
of those beasts of burden forms the common way of travelling in Arabia;
and the presents specified consist of the native produce of that
country. Of course, a royal equipage would be larger and more imposing
than an ordinary caravan.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 10:6</span></span>

It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of
thy wisdom--The proofs she obtained of Solomon's wisdom--not from his
conversation only, but also from his works; the splendor of his palace;
the economy of his kitchen and table; the order of his court; the
gradations and gorgeous costume of his servants; above all, the arched
viaduct that led from his palace to the temple ([Kg2
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018).md), and the remains of which have
been recently discovered \[ROBINSON\]--overwhelmed her with
astonishment. \[See on [Ch2 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#004.md).\]

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 10:9</span></span>

Blessed be the Lord thy God--(See on [Kg1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007).md). It is quite possible, as Jewish
writers say, that this queen was converted, through Solomon's influence,
to the worship of the true God. But there is no record of her making any
gift or offering in the temple.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 10:10</span></span>

she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold--Â£720,00.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 10:11</span></span>

almug trees--Parenthetically, along with the valuable presents of the
queen of Sheba, is mentioned a foreign wood, which was brought in the
Ophir ships. It is thought by some to be the sandalwood; by others, to
be the deodar--a species of fragrant fir, much used in India for sacred
and important works. Solomon used it for stairs in his temple and palace
([Ch2 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#011).md), but chiefly for musical
instruments.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 10:13</span></span>

King Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she
asked, beside--that is, Solomon not only gave his illustrious guest all
the insight and information she wanted; but, according to the Oriental
fashion, he gave her ample remuneration for the presents she had
brought.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 10:14</span></span>

HIS RICHES. (1Ki. 10:14-29)

Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year--666 talents,
equal to Â£3,996,000. The sources whence this was derived are not
mentioned; nor was it the full amount of his revenue; for this was
"Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice
merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the
country." The great encouragement he gave to commerce was the means of
enriching his royal treasury. By the fortifications which he erected in
various parts of his kingdom, (particularly at such places as Thapsacus,
one of the passages of Euphrates, and at Tadmor, in the Syrian desert),
he gave complete security to the caravan trade from the depredations of
the Arab marauders; and it was reasonable that, in return for this
protection, he should exact a certain toll or duty for the importation
of foreign goods. A considerable revenue, too, would arise from the use
of the store cities and khans he built; and it is not improbable that
those cities were emporia, where the caravan merchants unloaded their
bales of spices and other commodities and sold them to the king's
factors, who, according to the modern practice in the East, retailed
them in the Western markets at a profit. "The revenue derived from the
tributary kings and from the governors of the country" must have
consisted in the tribute which all inferior magistrates periodically
bring to their sovereigns in the East, in the shape of presents of the
produce of their respective provinces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg1 10:16</span></span>

two hundred targets, six hundred shekels--These defensive arms were
anciently made of wood and covered with leather; those were covered with
fine gold. 600 shekels were used in the gilding of each target--300 for
each shield. They were intended for the state armory of the palace (see
[Kg1 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#026).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 10:18</span></span>

a great throne of ivory--It seems to have been made not of solid ivory,
but veneered. It was in the form of an armchair, with a carved back. The
ascent to it was by six steps, on each of which stood lions, in place of
a railing--while a lion, probably of gilt metal, stood at each side,
which, we may suppose from the analogy of other Oriental thrones,
supported a canopy. A golden footstool is mentioned ([Ch2
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#018).md) as attached to this throne,
whose magnificence is described as unrivalled.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 10:22</span></span>

a navy of Tharshish--Tartessus in Spain. There gold, and especially
silver, was obtained, anciently, in so great abundance that it was
nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. But "Tarshish" came to be a
general term for the West ([Jon 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003).md).

at sea--on the Mediterranean.

once in three years--that is, every third year. Without the mariner's
compass they had to coast along the shore. The ivory, apes, and peacocks
might have been purchased, on the outward or homeward voyage, on the
north coast of Africa, where the animals were to be found. They were
particularized, probably as being the rarest articles on board.
