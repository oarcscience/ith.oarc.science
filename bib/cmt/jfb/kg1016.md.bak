### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 16:1</span></span>

JEHU'S PROPHECY AGAINST BAASHA. ([Kg1
16:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001).md)

Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu--This is the only incident
recorded in the life of this prophet. His father was also a prophet
([Ch2 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 16:2</span></span>

Forasmuch as I exalted thee--The doom he pronounced on Baasha was
exactly the same as denounced against Jeroboam and his posterity. Though
he had waded through slaughter to his throne, he owed his elevation to
the appointment or permission of Him "by whom kings reign."

over my people Israel--With all their errors and lapses into idolatry,
they were not wholly abandoned by God. He still showed His interest in
them by sending prophets and working miracles in their favor, and
possessed a multitude of faithful worshippers in the kingdom of Israel.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 16:7</span></span>

also by the hand of the prophet Jehu--This is not another prophecy, but
merely an addition by the sacred historian, explanatory of the death of
Baasha and the extinction of his family. The doom pronounced against
Jeroboam ([Kg1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009).md), did not entitle
him to take the execution of the sentence into his own hands; but from
his following the same calf-worship, he had evidently plotted the
conspiracy and murder of that king in furtherance of his own ambitious
designs; and hence, in his own assassination, he met the just reward of
his deeds. The similitude to Jeroboam extends to their deaths as well as
their lives--the reign of their sons, and the ruin of their families.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 16:8</span></span>

began Elah the son of Baasha to reign--(compare [Kg1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#033).md). From this it will appear that
Baasha died in the twenty-third year of his reign (see on [Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002).md), and Elah, who was a prince of
dissolute habits, reigned not fully two years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 16:9</span></span>

ZIMRI'S CONSPIRACY. ([Kg1 16:9-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#009).md)

Zimri . . . conspired against him--"Arza which was over his house."
During a carousal in the house of his chamberlain, Zimri slew him, and
having seized the sovereignty, endeavored to consolidate his throne by
the massacre of all the royal race.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 16:15</span></span>

did Zimri reign seven days--The news of his conspiracy soon spread, and
the army having proclaimed their general, Omri, king, that officer
immediately raised the siege at Gibbethon and marched directly against
the capital in which the usurper had established himself. Zimri soon saw
that he was not in circumstances to hold out against all the forces of
the kingdom; so, shutting himself up in the palace, he set it on fire,
and, like Sardanapalus, chose to perish himself and reduce all to ruin,
rather than that the palace and royal treasures should fall into the
hands of his successful rival. The seven days' reign may refer either to
the brief duration of his royal authority, or the period in which he
enjoyed unmolested tranquillity in the palace.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 16:19</span></span>

For his sins which he sinned--This violent end was a just retribution
for his crimes. "His walking in the ways of Jeroboam" might have been
manifested either by the previous course of his life, or by his decrees
published on his ascension, when he made a strong effort to gain
popularity by announcing his continued support of the calf worship.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 16:21</span></span>

Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts--The factions that
ensued occasioned a four years' duration (compare [Kg1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#015.md) with [Kg1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023).md), of anarchy or civil war.
Whatever might be the public opinion of Omri's merits a large body of
the people disapproved of the mode of his election, and declared for
Tibni. The army, however, as usual in such circumstances (and they had
the will of Providence favoring them), prevailed over all opposition,
and Omri became undisputed possessor of the throne.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 16:22</span></span>

Tibni died--The Hebrew does not enable us to determine whether his death
was violent or natural.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 16:23</span></span>

OMRI BUILDS SAMARIA. ([Kg1 16:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#023).md)

In the thirty and first year of Asa . . . began Omri to reign--The
twelve years of his reign are computed from the beginning of his reign,
which was in the twenty-seventh year of Asa's reign. He held a contested
reign for four years with Tibni; and then, at the date stated in this
verse, entered on a sole and peaceful reign of eight years.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 16:24</span></span>

he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer--The palace of Tirzah being in
ruins, Omri, in selecting the site of his royal residence, was naturally
influenced by considerations both of pleasure and advantage. In the
center of a wide amphitheatre of mountains, about six miles from
Shechem, rises an oblong hill with steep, yet accessible sides, and a
long flat top extending east and west, and rising five hundred or six
hundred feet above the valley. What Omri in all probability built as a
mere palatial residence, became the capital of the kingdom instead of
Shechem. It was as though Versailles had taken the place of Paris, or
Windsor of London. The choice of Omri was admirable, in selecting a
position which combined in a union not elsewhere found in Palestine:
strength, beauty, and fertility \[STANLEY\].

two talents of silver--Â£684. Shemer had probably made it a condition of
the sale, that the name should be retained. But as city and palace were
built there by Omri, it was in accordance with Eastern custom to call it
after the founder. The Assyrians did so, and on a tablet dug out of the
ruins of Nineveh, an inscription was found relating to Samaria, which is
called Beth-khumri--the house of Omri \[LAYARD\]. (See [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 16:25</span></span>

But Omri wrought evil--The character of Omri's reign and his death are
described in the stereotyped form used towards all the successors of
Jeroboam in respect both to policy as well as time.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 16:29</span></span>

Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that
were before him--The worship of God by symbols had hitherto been the
offensive form of apostasy in Israel, but now gross idolatry is openly
patronized by the court. This was done through the influence of Jezebel,
Ahab's queen. She was "the daughter of Eth-baal, king of the Zidonians."
He was priest of Ashtaroth or Astarte, who, having murdered Philetes,
king of Tyre, ascended the throne of that kingdom, being the eighth king
since Hiram. Jezebel was the wicked daughter of this regicide and idol
priest--and, on her marriage with Ahab, never rested till she had got
all the forms of her native Tyrian worship introduced into her adopted
country.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 16:32</span></span>

reared up an altar for Baal--that is, the sun, worshipped under various
images. Ahab set up one ([Kg2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#002).md),
probably as the Tyrian Hercules, in the temple in Samaria. No human
sacrifices were offered--the fire was kept constantly burning --the
priests officiated barefoot. Dancing and kissing the image ([Kg1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018).md) were among the principal rites.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 16:34</span></span>

JOSHUA'S CURSE FULFILLED UPON HIEL THE BUILDER OF JERICHO. ([Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034).md)

In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho--(see on [Jos
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026).md). The curse took effect on the
family of this reckless man but whether his oldest son died at the time
of laying the foundation, and the youngest at the completion of the
work, or whether he lost all his sons in rapid succession, till, at the
end of the undertaking, he found himself childless, the poetical form of
the ban does not enable us to determine. Some modern commentators think
there is no reference either to the natural or violent deaths of Hiel's
sons; but that he began in presence of his oldest son, but some
unexpected difficulties, losses, or obstacles, delayed the completion
till his old age, when the gates were set up in the presence of his
youngest son. But the curse was fulfilled more than five hundred years
after it was uttered; and from Jericho being inhabited after Joshua's
time ([Jdg 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#013.md); [Sa2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005).md), it has been supposed that the
act against which the curse was directed, was an attempt at the
restoration of the walls--the very walls which had been miraculously
cast down. It seems to have been within the territory of Israel; and the
unresisted act of Hiel affords a painful evidence how far the people of
Israel had lost all knowledge of, or respect for, the word of God.
