### [Ezekiel Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 48:1</span></span>

ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND TO SEVERAL TRIBES. (Eze. 48:1-35)

Dan--The lands are divided into portions of ideal exactness, running
alongside of each other, the whole breadth from west to east, standing
in a common relation to the temple in the center: seven tribes' portions
on the north, five in the smaller division in the south. The portions of
the city, the temple, the prince, and the priesthood, are in the middle,
not within the boundaries of any tribe, all alike having a common
interest in them. Judah has the place of honor next the center on the
north, Benjamin the corresponding place of honor next the center on the
south; because of the adherence of these two to the temple ordinances
and to the house of David for so long, when the others deserted them.
Dan, on the contrary, so long locally and morally semi-heathen (Jdg.
18:1-31), is to have the least honorable place, at the extreme north.
For the same reason, St. John ([Rev
7:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#005).md) omits Dan altogether.

[Ezekiel 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 48:3</span></span>

Asher--a tribe of which no one of note is mentioned in the Old
Testament. In the New Testament one is singled out of it, the prophetess
Anna.

[Ezekiel 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 48:4</span></span>

Manasseh--The intercourse and unity between the two and a half tribes
east of the Jordan, and the nine and a half west of it, had been much
kept up by the splitting of Manasseh, causing the visits of kinsmen one
to the other from both sides of the Jordan. There shall be no need for
this in the new order of things.

[Ezekiel 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 48:5</span></span>

Ephraim--This tribe, within its two dependent tribes, Manasseh and
Benjamin, for upwards of four hundred years under the judges held the
pre-eminence.

[Ezekiel 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 48:6</span></span>

Reuben--doomed formerly for incest and instability "not to excel" ([Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004).md). So no distinguished prophet,
priest, or king had come from it. Of it were the notorious Dathan and
Abiram, the mutineers. A pastoral and Bedouin character marked it and
Gad ([Jdg 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 48:15</span></span>

The five thousand rods, apportioned to the city out of the twenty-five
thousand square, are to be laid off in a square of four thousand five
hundred, with the two hundred fifty all around for suburbs.

profane--that is, not strictly sacred as the sacerdotal portions, but
applied to secular uses.

[Ezekiel 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 48:24</span></span>

Benjamin--Compare Jacob's prophecy ([Gen
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md); [Deu
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012).md). It alone with Judah had been
throughout loyal to the house of David, so its prowess at the "night" of
the national history was celebrated as well as in the "morning."

[Ezekiel 48:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 48:25</span></span>

Simeon--omitted in the blessing of Moses in Deu. 33:1-29 perhaps because
of the Simeonite "prince," who at Baal-peor led the Israelites in their
idolatrous whoredoms with Midian ([Num
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#014).md).

[Ezekiel 48:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 48:26</span></span>

Issachar--Its ancient portion had been on the plain of Esdraelon.
Compared ([Gen 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014).md) to "a strong ass
crouching between two burdens," that is, tribute and tillage; never
meddling with wars except in self-defense.

[Ezekiel 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 48:31</span></span>

gates-- ([Rev 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012), &c..md). The twelve
gates bear the names of the twelve tribes to imply that all are regarded
as having an interest in it.

[Ezekiel 48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">eze 48:35</span></span>

Lord is there--Jehovah-Shammah. Not that the city will be called so in
mere name, but that the reality will be best expressed by this
descriptive title ([Jer 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md); [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016.md); [Zac
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md); [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003).md).
