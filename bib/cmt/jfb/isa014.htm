<p>
<p>proverb--The Orientals, having few books, embodied their thoughts in weighty, figurative, briefly expressed gnomes. Here a taunting song of triumph (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004">Mic 2:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006">Hab 2:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>the king--the ideal representative of Babylon; perhaps Belshazzar (Dan. 5:1-31). The mystical Babylon is ultimately meant. 
<p>
<p>golden city--rather, "the exactress of gold" [MAURER]. But the old translators read differently in the Hebrew, "oppression," which the parallelism favors (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#005">Isa 3:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#005">Isaiah 14:5</A></p>

<p>
<p>rulers--tyrants, as the parallelism "the wicked" proves (compare see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#002">Isa 13:2</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006">Isaiah 14:6</A></p>

<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">isa 14:7</A></FONT></span></p>they--the once subject nations of the whole earth. HOUBIGANT places the stop after "fir trees" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008">Isa 14:8</A>), "The very fir trees break forth," &amp;c. But the parallelism is better in English Version.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008">Isaiah 14:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">isa 14:8</A></FONT></span></p>the fir trees--now left undisturbed. Probably a kind of evergreen. 
<p>
<p>rejoice at thee-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#012">Psa 96:12</A>). At thy fall (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019">Psa 35:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#024">Psa 35:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>no feller--as formerly, when thou wast in power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034">Isa 10:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024">Isa 37:24</A>).
<p>
<p>Hades (the Amenthes of Egypt), the unseen abode of the departed; some of its tenants, once mighty monarchs, are represented by a bold personification as rising from their seats in astonishment at the descent among them of the humbled king of Babylon. This proves, in opposition to WARBURTON [The Divine Legation], that the belief existed among the Jews that there was a Sheol or Hades, in which the "Rephaim" or manes of the departed abode.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isaiah 14:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 14:9</A></FONT></span></p>THE SCENE CHANGES FROM EARTH TO HELL. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009">Isa 14:9-11</A>)
<p>
<p>moved--put into agitation. 
<p>
<p>for thee--that is, "at thee"; towards thee; explained by "to meet thee at thy coming" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>chief ones--literally, "goats"; so rams, leaders of the flock; princes (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003">Zac 10:3</A>). The idea of wickedness on a gigantic scale is included (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017">Eze 34:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032">Mat 25:32-33</A>). MAGEE derives "Rephaim" (English Version, "the dead") from a Hebrew root, "to resolve into first elements"; so "the deceased" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014">Isa 26:14</A>) "ghosts" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016">Pro 21:16</A>). These being magnified by the imagination of the living into gigantic stature, gave their name to giants in general (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#004">Gen 6:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005">Gen 14:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018">Eze 32:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021">Eze 32:21</A>). "Rephaim," translated in the Septuagint, "giants" (compare see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005">Job 26:5-6</A>). Thence, as the giant Rephaim of Canaan were notorious even in that guilty land, enormous wickedness became connected with the term. So the Rephaim came to be the wicked spirits in Gehenna, the lower of the two portions into which Sheol is divided.

<p>
<p>weak--as a shade bereft of blood and life. Rephaim, "the dead," may come from a Hebrew root, meaning similarly "feeble," "powerless." The speech of the departed closes with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isa 14:11</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011">Isaiah 14:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 14:11</A></FONT></span></p>"Pomp" and music, the accompaniment of Babylon's former feastings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012">Isa 5:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008">Isa 24:8</A>), give place to the corruption and the stillness of the grave (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027">Eze 32:27</A>). 
<p>
<p>worm--that is bred in putridity. 
<p>
<p>worms--properly those from which the crimson dye is obtained. Appropriate here; instead of the crimson coverlet, over thee shall be "worms." Instead of the gorgeous couch, "under thee" shall be the maggot.
<p>
<p>The language is so framed as to apply to the Babylonian king primarily, and at the same time to shadow forth through him, the great final enemy, the man of sin, Antichrist, of Daniel, St. Paul, and St. John; he alone shall fulfil exhaustively all the lineaments here given.

<p>
<p>Lucifer--"day star." A title truly belonging to Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016">Rev 22:16</A>), "the bright and morning star," and therefore hereafter to be assumed by Antichrist. GESENIUS, however, renders the Hebrew here as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012">Eze 21:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#002">Zac 11:2</A>, "howl." 
<p>
<p>weaken--"prostrate"; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#013">Exo 17:13</A>, "discomfit."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isaiah 14:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">isa 14:13</A></FONT></span></p>above . . . God--In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010">Dan 8:10</A>, "stars" express earthly potentates. "The stars" are often also used to express heavenly principalities (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007">Job 38:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>mount of the congregation--the place of solemn meeting between God and His people in the temple at Jerusalem. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037">Dan 11:37</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</A>, this is attributed to Antichrist. 
<p>
<p>sides of the north--namely, the sides of Mount Moriah on which the temple was built; north of Mount Zion (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</A>). However, the parallelism supports the notion that the Babylonian king expresses himself according to his own, and not Jewish opinions (so in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010">Isa 10:10</A>) thus "mount of the congregation" will mean the northern mountain (perhaps in Armenia) fabled by the Babylonians to be the common meeting-place of their gods. "Both sides" imply the angle in which the sides meet; and so the expression comes to mean "the extreme parts of the north." So the Hindus place the Meru, the dwelling-place of their gods, in the north, in the Himalayan mountains. So the Greeks, in the northern Olympus. The Persian followers of Zoroaster put the Ai-bordsch in the Caucasus north of them. The allusion to the stars harmonizes with this; namely, that those near the North Pole, the region of the aurora borealis (compare see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009">Job 23:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#022">Job 37:22</A>) [MAURER, Septuagint, Syriac].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014">Isaiah 14:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 14:14</A></FONT></span></p>clouds--rather, "the cloud," singular. Perhaps there is a reference to the cloud, the symbol of the divine presence (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005">Isa 4:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021">Exo 13:21</A>). So this tallies with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004">Th2 2:4</A>, "above all that is called God"; as here "above . . . the cloud"; and as the Shekinah-cloud was connected with the temple, there follows, "he as God sitteth in the temple of God," answering to "I will be like the Most High" here. Moreover, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004">Rev 17:4-5</A>, represents Antichrist as seated in BABYLON, to which city, literal and spiritual, Isaiah refers here.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015">Isaiah 14:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">isa 14:15</A></FONT></span></p>to hell--to Sheol (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#006">Isa 14:6</A>), thou who hast said, "I will ascend into heaven" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023">Mat 11:23</A>). 
<p>
<p>sides of the pit--antithetical to the "sides of the north" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isa 14:13</A>). Thus the reference is to the sides of the sepulcher round which the dead were arranged in niches. But MAURER here, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013">Isa 14:13</A>, translates, "the extreme," or innermost parts of the sepulchre: as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023">Eze 32:23</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003">Sa1 24:3</A>).

<p>This would comfort the Jews when captives in Babylon, being a pledge that God, who had by that time fulfilled the promise concerning Sennacherib (though now still future), would also fulfil His promise as to destroying Babylon, Judah's enemy.

<p>To comfort the Jews, lest they should fear that people; not in order to call the Philistines to repentance, since the prophecy was probably never circulated among them. They had been subdued by Uzziah or Azariah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006">Ch2 26:6</A>); but in the reign of Ahaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018">Ch2 28:18</A>), they took several towns in south Judea. Now Isaiah denounces their final subjugation by Hezekiah.

<p>rod . . . broken--The yoke imposed by Uzziah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006">Ch2 26:6</A>) was thrown off under Ahaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#018">Ch2 28:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>serpent's root--the stock of Jesse (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</A>). Uzziah was doubtless regarded by the Philistines as a biting "serpent." But though the effects of his bite have been got rid of, a more deadly viper, or "cockatrice" (literally, "viper's offspring," as Philistia would regard him), namely, Hezekiah awaits you (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008">Kg2 18:8</A>).

Compare "first-born of death" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013">Job 18:13</A>), for the most fatal death. The Jews, heretofore exposed to Philistine invasions and alarms, shall be in safety. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004">Psa 72:4</A>, "Children of the needy," expressing those "needy in condition." 
<p>
<p>feed--image from a flock feeding in safety.

<p>
<p>smoke--from the signal-fire, whereby a hostile army was called together; the Jews' signal-fire is meant here, the "pillar of cloud and fire," (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021">Exo 13:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#019">Neh 9:19</A>); or else from the region devastated by fire [MAURER]. GESENIUS less probably refers it to the cloud of dust raised by the invading army. 
<p>
<p>none . . . alone . . . in . . . appointed times--Rather, "There shall not be a straggler among his (the enemy's) levies." The Jewish host shall advance on Palestine in close array; none shall fall back or lag from weariness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026">Isa 5:26-27</A>), [LOWTH]. MAURER thinks the Hebrew will not bear the rendering "levies" or "armies." He translates, "There is not one (of the Philistine watch guards) who will remain alone (exposed to the enemy) at his post," through fright. On "alone," compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#007">Psa 102:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009">Hos 8:9</A>.

<p>
<p>LOWTH thinks it was delivered in the first years of Hezekiah's reign and fulfilled in the fourth when Shalmaneser, on his way to invade Israel, may have seized on the strongholds of Moab. Moab probably had made common cause with Israel and Syria in a league against Assyria. Hence it incurred the vengeance of Assyria. Jeremiah has introduced much of this prophecy into his forty-eighth chapter.
