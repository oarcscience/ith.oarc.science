### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

to Israel, because of the destined, as well as real, prominence of that
tribe.

[Psalms 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 114:5</span></span>

The questions place the implied answers in a more striking form.

[Psalms 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 114:7</span></span>

at the presence of--literally, "from before," as if affrighted by the
wonderful display of God's power. Well may such a God be trusted, and
great should be His praise.
