### [2 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

[2 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo2 1:1</span></span>

The elder--In a familiar letter John gives himself a less authoritative
designation than "apostle"; so [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001).

lady--BENGEL takes the Greek as a proper name Kyria, answering to the
Hebrew "Martha." Being a person of influence, "deceivers" ([Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)) were insinuating themselves into
her family to seduce her and her children from the faith \[TIRINUS\],
whence John felt it necessary to write a warning to her. (But see my
Introduction and [Pe1 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013)). A
particular Church, probably that at Babylon, was intended. "Church" is
derived from Greek "Kuriake," akin to Kuria, or Kyria here; the latter
word among the Romans and Athenians means the same as ecclesia, the term
appropriated to designate the Church assembly.

love in the truth--Christian love rests on the Christian truth ([Jo2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003), end). Not merely "I love in
truth," but "I love in THE truth."

all--All Christians form one fellowship, rejoicing in the spiritual
prosperity of one another. "The communion of love is as wide as the
communion of faith" \[ALFORD\].

[2 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo2 1:2</span></span>

For the truth's sake--joined with "I love," [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001). "They who love in the truth, also
love on account of the truth."

dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever--in consonance with
Christ's promise.

[2 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo2 1:3</span></span>

Grace be with you--One of the oldest manuscripts and several versions
have "us" for you. The Greek is literally, "Grace shall be with us,"
that is, with both you and me. A prayer, however, is implied besides a
confident affirmation.

grace . . . mercy . . . peace--"Grace" covers the sins of men; "mercy,"
their miseries. Grace must first do away with man's guilt before his
misery can be relieved by mercy. Therefore grace stands before mercy.
Peace is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order.
Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this
peace.

the Lord--The oldest manuscripts and most of the oldest versions omit
"the Lord." John never elsewhere uses this title in his Epistles, but
"the Son of God."

in truth and love--The element or sphere in which alone grace, mercy,
and peace, have place. He mentions truth in [Jo2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004); love, in [Jo2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005). Paul uses FAITH and love; for
faith and truth are close akin.

[2 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo2 1:4</span></span>

I found--probably in one of his missionary tours of superintendence. See
Introduction, at the end, and [Jo2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012); [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010), [Jo3
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#014).

of thy children--some.

in truth--that is, in the Gospel truth.

as--even as. "The Father's commandment" is the standard of "the truth."

[2 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo2 1:5</span></span>

I beseech--rather (compare Note, see on [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016)), "I request thee," implying some
degree of authority.

not . . . new commandment--It was old in that Christians heard it from
the first in the Gospel preaching; new, in that the Gospel rested love
on the new principle of filial imitation of God who first loved us, and
gave Jesus to die for us; and also, in that love is now set forth with
greater clearness than in the Old Testament dispensation. Love performs
both tables of the law, and is the end of the law and the Gospel alike
(compare Notes, see on [Jo1 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007)).

that we--implying that he already had love, and urging her to join him
in the same Christian grace. This verse seems to me to decide that a
Church, not an individual lady, is meant. For a man to urge a woman
("THEE"; not thee and thy children) that he and she should love one
another, is hardly like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the
love enjoined; but all is clear if "the lady" represent a Church.

[2 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo2 1:6</span></span>

"Love is the fulfilling of the law" ([Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)), and the fulfilling of the law
is the sure test of love.

This is the commandment--Greek, "The commandment is this," namely, love,
in which all God's other commandments are summed up.

[2 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo2 1:7</span></span>

As love and truth go hand in hand ([Jo2
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#003)), he feels it needful to give
warning against teachers of untruth.

For--giving the reason why he dwelt on truth and on love, which
manifests itself in keeping God's commandments ([Jo2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#006)).

many-- ([Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)).

are entered--The oldest manuscripts read, "have gone forth," namely,
from us.

confess not . . . Jesus . . . in the flesh--the token of Antichrist.

is come--Greek, "coming." He who denies Christ's coming in the flesh,
denies the possibility of the incarnation; he who denies that he has
come, denies its actuality. They denied the possibility of a Messiah's
appearing, or coming, in the flesh \[NEANDER\]. I think the Greek
present participle implies both the first and the second advent of
Christ. He is often elsewhere called the Coming One (Greek), [Mat
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003); [Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037). The denial of the reality of
His manifestation in the flesh, at His first coming, and of His personal
advent again, constitutes Antichrist. "The world turns away from God and
Christ, busily intent upon its own husks; but to OPPOSE God and Christ
is of the leaven of Satan" \[BENGEL\].

This is a, &c.--Greek, "This (such a one as has been just described) is
the deceiver and the Antichrist." The many who in a degree fulfil the
character, are forerunners of the final personal Antichrist, who shall
concentrate in himself all the features of previous Antichristian
systems.

[2 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo2 1:8</span></span>

Look to yourselves--amidst the widespread prevalence of deception so
many being led astray. So Christ's warning, [Mat
24:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024).

we lose not . . . we receive--The oldest manuscripts and versions read,
"That YE lose not, but that YE receive."

which we have wrought--So one oldest manuscript reads. Other very old
manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, read, "which YE have wrought." The
we being seemingly the more difficult reading is less likely to have
been a transcriber's alteration. Look that ye lose not the believing
state of "truth and love," which WE (as God's workmen, [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001); [Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015)) were the instruments of working
in you.

a full reward--of grace not of debt. Fully consummated glory. If "which
YE have wrought" be read with very old authorities, the reward meant is
that of their "work (of faith) and labor of love." There are degrees of
heavenly reward proportioned to the degrees of capability of receiving
heavenly blessedness. Each vessel of glory hanging on Jesus shall be
fully happy. But the larger the vessel, the greater will be its capacity
for receiving heavenly bliss. He who with one pound made ten, received
authority over ten cities. He who made five pounds received five cities;
each according to his capacity of rule, and in proportion to his
faithfulness. Compare [Co1 15:41](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#041).
"There is no half reward of the saints. It is either lost altogether, or
received in full; in full communion with God" \[BENGEL\]. Still no
service of minister or people shall fail to receive its reward.

[2 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo2 1:9</span></span>

The loss ([Jo2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)) meant is here
explained: the not having God, which results from abiding not in the
doctrine of Christ.

transgresseth--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "Every one who
takes the lead"; literally, "goes," or "leads on before"; compare [Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004), "He goeth before them" (not the
same Greek). Compare [Jo3 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#009), "Loveth
to have the pre-eminence."

hath not God-- ([Jo1 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023); [Jo1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015)). The second "of Christ" is
omitted in the oldest manuscripts, but is understood in the sense.

He--emphatical: He and He alone.

[2 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo2 1:10</span></span>

If there come any--as a teacher or brother. The Greek is indicative, not
subjunctive; implying that such persons do actually come, and are sure
to come; when any comes, as there will. True love is combined with
hearty renunciation and separation from all that is false, whether
persons or doctrines.

receive him not . . . neither bid him God speed--This is not said of
those who were always aliens from the Church, but of those who wish to
be esteemed brethren, and subvert the true doctrine \[GROTIUS\]. The
greeting salutation forbidden in the case of such a one is that usual
among Christian brethren in those days, not a mere formality, but a
token of Christian brotherhood.

[2 John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo2 1:11</span></span>

By wishing a false brother or teacher "God (or 'good') speed," you imply
that he is capable as such of good speed and joy (the literal meaning of
the Greek), and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you
identify yourself with "his evil deeds." The Greek of "partaker" is
"having communion with." We cannot have communion with saints and with
Antichrist at the same time. Here we see John's naturally fiery zeal
directed to a right end. POLYCARP, the disciple of John, told
contemporaries of IRENÃ†US, who narrates the story on their authority,
that on one occasion when John was about to bathe, and heard that
Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, he retired with abhorrence,
exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in ruins since the enemy of the
truth is there.

[2 John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo2 1:12</span></span>

I would not write--A heart full of love pours itself out more freely
face to face, than by letter.

paper--made of Egyptian papyrus. Pens were then reeds split.

ink--made of soot and water, thickened with gum. Parchment was used for
the permanent manuscripts in which the Epistles were preserved. Writing
tablets were used merely for temporary purposes, as our slates.

face to face--literally, "mouth to mouth."

full--Greek, "filled full." Your joy will be complete in hearing from me
in person the joyful Gospel truths which I now defer communicating till
I see you. On other occasions his writing the glad truths was for the
same purpose.

[2 John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo2 1:13</span></span>

ALFORD confesses that the non-mention of the "lady" herself here seems
rather to favor the hypothesis that a Church is meant.
