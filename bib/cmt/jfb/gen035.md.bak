### [Genesis Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 35:1</span></span>

REMOVAL TO BETHEL. ([Gen 35:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001).md)

God said unto Jacob, Arise, &c.--This command was given seasonably in
point of time and tenderly in respect of language. The disgraceful and
perilous events that had recently taken place in the patriarch's family
must have produced in him a strong desire to remove without delay from
the vicinity of Shechem. Borne down by an overwhelming sense of the
criminality of his two sons--of the offense they had given to God and
the dishonor they had brought on the true faith; distracted, too, with
anxiety about the probable consequences which their outrage might bring
upon himself and family, should the Canaanite people combine to
extirpate such a band of robbers and murderers; he must have felt this
call as affording a great relief to his afflicted feelings. At the same
time it conveyed a tender rebuke.

go up to Beth-el--Beth-el was about thirty miles south of Shechem and
was an ascent from a low to a highland country. There, he would not only
be released from the painful associations of the latter place but be
established on a spot that would revive the most delightful and sublime
recollections. The pleasure of revisiting it, however, was not
altogether unalloyed.

make there an altar unto God, that appeared--It too frequently happens
that early impressions are effaced through lapse of time, that promises
made in seasons of distress, are forgotten; or, if remembered on the
return of health and prosperity, there is not the same alacrity and
sense of obligation felt to fulfil them. Jacob was lying under that
charge. He had fallen into spiritual indolence. It was now eight or ten
years since his return to Canaan. He had effected a comfortable
settlement and had acknowledged the divine mercies, by which that return
and settlement had been signally distinguished (compare [Gen
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019).md). But for some unrecorded
reason, his early vow at Beth-el \[[Gen
28:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#020.md)\], in a great crisis of his
life, remained unperformed. The Lord appeared now to remind him of his
neglected duty, in terms, however, so mild, as awakened less the memory
of his fault, than of the kindness of his heavenly Guardian; and how
much Jacob felt the touching nature of the appeal to that memorable
scene at Beth-el, appears in the immediate preparations he made to arise
and go up thither ([Psa 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013).md).

[Genesis 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 35:2</span></span>

Then Jacob said unto his household . . . Put away the strange gods that
are among you--Hebrew, "gods of the stranger," of foreign nations. Jacob
had brought, in his service, a number of Mesopotamian retainers, who
were addicted to superstitious practices; and there is some reason to
fear that the same high testimony as to the religious superintendence of
his household could not have been borne of him as was done of Abraham
([Gen 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019).md). He might have been too
negligent hitherto in winking at these evils in his servants; or,
perhaps, it was not till his arrival in Canaan, that he had learnt, for
the first time, that one nearer and dearer to him was secretly infected
with the same corruption ([Gen 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034).md).
Be that as it may, he resolved on an immediate and thorough reformation
of his household; and in commanding them to put away the strange gods,
he added,

be clean, and change your garments--as if some defilement, from contact
with idolatry, should still remain about them. In the law of Moses, many
ceremonial purifications were ordained and observed by persons who had
contracted certain defilements, and without the observance of which,
they were reckoned unclean and unfit to join in the social worship of
God. These bodily purifications were purely figurative; and as
sacrifices were offered before the law, so also were external
purifications, as appears from the words of Jacob; hence it would seem
that types and symbols were used from the fall of man, representing and
teaching the two great doctrines of revealed truth--namely, the
atonement of Christ and the sanctification of our nature.

[Genesis 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 35:4</span></span>

they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods . . . and earrings--Strange
gods, the "seraphim" (compare [Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030).md), as well, perhaps, as other
idols acquired among the Shechemite spoil--earrings of various forms,
sizes, and materials, which are universally worn in the East, and, then
as now, connected with incantation and idolatry (compare [Hos
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013).md). The decided tone which Jacob
now assumed was the probable cause of the alacrity with which those
favorite objects of superstition were surrendered.

Jacob hid them under the oak--or terebinth--a towering tree, which, like
all others of the kind, was a striking object in the scenery of
Palestine; and beneath which, at Shechem, the patriarch had pitched his
tent. He hid the images and amulets, delivered to him by his
Mesopotamian dependents, at the root of this tree. The oak being deemed
a consecrated tree, to bury them at its root was to deposit them in a
place where no bold hand would venture to disturb the ground; and hence
it was called from this circumstance--"the plain of Meonenim"--that is,
"the oak of enchantments" ([Jdg 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#037).md);
and from the great stone which Joshua set up--"the oak of the pillar"
([Jdg 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#006).md).

[Genesis 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 35:5</span></span>

the terror of God was upon the cities--There was every reason to
apprehend that a storm of indignation would burst from all quarters upon
Jacob's family, and that the Canaanite tribes would have formed one
united plan of revenge. But a supernatural panic seized them; and thus,
for the sake of the "heir of the promise," the protecting shield of
Providence was specially held over his family.

[Genesis 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 35:6</span></span>

So Jacob came to Luz . . . that is, Beth-el--It is probable that this
place was unoccupied ground when Jacob first went to it; and that after
that period \[CALVIN\], the Canaanites built a town, to which they gave
the name of Luz \[[Gen 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md)\], from
the profusion of almond trees that grew around. The name of Beth-el,
which would, of course, be confined to Jacob and his family, did not
supersede the original one, till long after. It is now identified with
the modern Beitin and lies on the western slope of the mountain on which
Abraham built his altar ([Gen 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008).md).

[Genesis 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 35:7</span></span>

El-Beth-el--that is, "the God of Beth-el."

[Genesis 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 35:8</span></span>

Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died--This event seems to have taken place
before the solemnities were commenced. Deborah (Hebrew, a "bee"),
supposing her to have been fifty years on coming to Canaan, had attained
the great age of a hundred eighty. When she was removed from Isaac's
household to Jacob's, is unknown. But it probably was on his return from
Mesopotamia; and she would have been of invaluable service to his young
family. Old nurses, like her, were not only honored, but loved as
mothers; and, accordingly, her death was the occasion of great
lamentation. She was buried under the oak--hence called "the terebinth
of tears" (compare [Kg1 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#014).md). God
was pleased to make a new appearance to him after the solemn rites of
devotion were over. By this manifestation of His presence, God testified
His acceptance of Jacob's sacrifice and renewed the promise of the
blessings guaranteed to Abraham and Isaac \[[Gen
35:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#011.md)\]; and the patriarch observed
the ceremony with which he had formerly consecrated the place,
comprising a sacramental cup, along with the oil that he poured on the
pillar, and reimposing the memorable name \[[Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014.md)\]. The whole scene was in
accordance with the character of the patriarchal dispensation, in which
the great truths of religion were exhibited to the senses, and "the
world's grey fathers" taught in a manner suited to the weakness of an
infantile condition.

[Genesis 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 35:13</span></span>

God went up from him--The presence of God was indicated in some visible
form and His acceptance of the sacrifice shown by the miraculous descent
of fire from heaven, consuming it on the altar.

[Genesis 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 35:16</span></span>

BIRTH OF BENJAMIN--DEATH OF RACHEL, &c. ([Gen
35:16-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016).md)

And they journeyed from Beth-el--There can be no doubt that much
enjoyment was experienced at Beth-el, and that in the religious
observances solemnized, as well as in the vivid recollections of the
glorious vision seen there, the affections of the patriarch were
powerfully animated and that he left the place a better and more devoted
servant of God. When the solemnities were over, Jacob, with his family,
pursued a route directly southward, and they reached Ephrath, when they
were plunged into mourning by the death of Rachel, who sank in
childbirth, leaving a posthumous son \[[Gen
35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018.md)\]. A very affecting death,
considering how ardently the mind of Rachel had been set on offspring
(compare [Gen 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001).md).

[Genesis 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 35:18</span></span>

She called his name Ben-oni--The dying mother gave this name to her
child, significant of her circumstances; but Jacob changed his name into
Benjamin. This is thought by some to have been originally Benjamin, "a
son of days," that is, of old age. But with its present ending it means
"son of the right hand," that is, particularly dear and precious.

[Genesis 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 35:19</span></span>

Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem--The one, the old name; the other, the
later name, signifying "house of bread."

[Genesis 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 35:20</span></span>

and Jacob set a pillar on her grave . . . unto this day--The spot still
marked out as the grave of Rachel exactly agrees with the Scriptural
record, being about a mile from Beth-lehem. Anciently it was surmounted
by a pyramid of stones, but the present tomb is a Mohammedan erection.

[Genesis 35:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 35:26</span></span>

Sons of Jacob . . . born to him in Padan-aram--It is a common practice
of the sacred historian to say of a company or body of men that which,
though true of the majority, may not be applicable to every individual.
(See [Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md); [Joh
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024.md); [Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md). Here is an example, for
Benjamin was born in Canaan \[[Gen
35:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#016.md)\].

[Genesis 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 35:29</span></span>

DEATH OF ISAAC. ([Gen 35:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#028).md)

Isaac gave up the ghost--The death of this venerable patriarch is here
recorded by anticipation for it did not take place till fifteen years
after Joseph's disappearance. Feeble and blind though he was, he lived
to a very advanced age; and it is a pleasing evidence of the permanent
reconciliation between Esau and Jacob that they met at Mamre to perform
the funeral rites of their common father.
