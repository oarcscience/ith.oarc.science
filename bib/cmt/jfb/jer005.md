### [Jeremiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 5:1</span></span>

THE CAUSE OF THE JUDGMENTS TO BE INFLICTED IS THE UNIVERSAL CORRUPTION
OF THE PEOPLE. (Jer. 5:1-31)

a man--As the pious Josiah, Baruch, and Zephaniah lived in Jerusalem at
that time, Jeremiah must here mean the mass of the people, the king, his
counsellors, the false prophets, and the priests, as distinguished from
the faithful few, whom God had openly separated from the reprobate
people; among the latter not even one just person was to be found ([Isa
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016).md) \[CALVIN\]; the godly, moreover,
were forbidden to intercede for them ([Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md); compare [Gen
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023.md), &c.; [Psa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md); [Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030).md).

see . . . know--look . . . ascertain.

judgment--justice, righteousness.

pardon it--rather, her.

[Jeremiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 5:2</span></span>

([Tit 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016).md).

swear falsely--not a judicial oath; but their profession of the worship
of Jehovah is insincere ([Jer 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md);
[Jer 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md). The reformation under
Josiah was merely superficial in the case of the majority.

[Jeremiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 5:3</span></span>

eyes upon the truth-- ([Deu 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009).md). "Truth" is in contrast with
"swear falsely" ([Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002).md). The
false-professing Jews could expect nothing but judgments from the God of
truth.

stricken . . . not grieved-- ([Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030.md); [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005.md); [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md).

refused . . . correction-- ([Jer 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md);
[Zep 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 5:4</span></span>

poor--rather, "the poor." He supposes for the moment that this utter
depravity is confined to the uninstructed poor, and that he would find a
different state of things in the higher ranks: but there he finds
unbridled profligacy.

[Jeremiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 5:5</span></span>

they have known--rather, "they must know." The prophet supposes it as
probable, considering their position.

but these--I found the very reverse to be the case.

burst . . . bonds--set God's law at defiance ([Psa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 5:6</span></span>

lion . . . wolf . . . leopard--the strongest, the most ravenous, and the
swiftest, respectively, of beasts: illustrating the formidable character
of the Babylonians.

of the evenings--Others not so well translate, of the deserts. The
plural means that it goes forth every evening to seek its prey ([Psa
104:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md); [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003).md).

leopard . . . watch . . . cities-- ([Hos
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007).md). It shall lie in wait about
their cities.

[Jeremiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 5:7</span></span>

It would not be consistent with God's holiness to let such wickedness
pass unpunished.

sworn by-- ([Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md); [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md); that is, worshipped.

no gods-- ([Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md).

fed . . . to the full--so the Keri (Hebrew Margin) reads, God's
bountifulness is contrasted with their apostasy ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md). Prosperity, the gift of God,
designed to lead men to Him, often produces the opposite effect. The
Hebrew Chetib (text), reads: "I bound them (to Me) by oath," namely, in
the marriage covenant, sealed at Sinai between God and Israel; in
contrast to which stands their "adultery"; the antithesis favors this.

adultery . . . harlots' houses--spiritually: idolatry in temples of
idols; but literal prostitution is also included, being frequently part
of idol-worship: for example, in the worship of the Babylonian Mylitta.

[Jeremiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 5:8</span></span>

in the morning-- ([Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md). "Rising
early in the morning" is a phrase for unceasing eagerness in any
pursuit; such was the Jews' avidity after idol-worship. MAURER
translates from a different Hebrew root, "continually wander to and
fro," inflamed with lust ([Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023).md).
But English Version is simpler (compare [Jer
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#027.md); [Eze
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 5:9</span></span>

([Jer 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md); [Jer
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#009.md); [Jer
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 5:10</span></span>

Abrupt apostrophe to the Babylonians, to take Jerusalem, but not to
destroy the nation utterly (see on [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md).

battlements--rather, tendrils \[MAURER\]: the state being compared to a
vine ([Jer 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010).md), the stem of which
was to be spared, while the tendrils (the chief men) were to be removed.

[Jeremiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 5:11</span></span>

([Jer 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 5:12</span></span>

belied--denied.

It is not he--rather, "(Jehovah) is not HE," that is, the true and only
God ([Jer 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022.md); [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md); [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md), [Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013).md). By their idolatry they
virtually denied Him. Or, referring to what follows, and to [Jer
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009), "(Jehovah.md) is not," namely, about
to be the punisher of our sins ([Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md); [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 5:13</span></span>

Continuation of the unbelieving language of the Jews.

the prophets--who prophesy punishment coming on us.

the word--the Holy Spirit, who speaks through true prophets, is not in
them \[MAURER\]. Or else, "There is no word (divine communication) in
them" ([Hos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002).md) \[ROSENMULLER\].

thus, &c.--Their ill-omened prophecies shall fall on themselves.

[Jeremiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 5:14</span></span>

ye . . . thy . . . this people--He turns away from addressing the people
to the prophet; implying that He puts them to a distance from Him, and
only communicates with them through His prophet ([Jer
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019).md).

fire . . . wood--Thy denunciations of judgments shall be fulfilled and
shall consume them as fire does wood. In [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md) it is the penetrating energy of
fire which is the point of comparison.

[Jeremiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 5:15</span></span>

([Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); [Jer
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022).md). Alluding to [Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md), &c.

Israel--that is, Judah.

mighty--from an Arabic root, "enduring." The fourfold repetition of
"nation" heightens the force.

ancient--The Chaldeans came originally from the Carduchian and Armenian
mountains north of Mesopotamia, whence they immigrated into Babylonia;
like all mountaineers, they were brave and hardy (see on [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md).

language . . . knowest not-- [Isa
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#011.md) shows that Aramaic was not
understood by the "multitude," but only by the educated classes
\[MAURER\]. HENDERSON refers it to the original language of the
Babylonians, which, he thinks, they brought with them from their native
hills, akin to the Persic, not to the Aramaic, or any other Semitic
tongue, the parent of the modern Kurd.

[Jeremiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 5:16</span></span>

open sepulchre--(Compare [Psa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009).md).
Their quiver is all-devouring, as the grave opened to receive the dead:
as many as are the arrows, so many are the deaths.

[Jeremiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 5:17</span></span>

([Lev 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 5:18</span></span>

Not even in those days of judgments, will God utterly exterminate His
people.

I will not make a full end with you-- ([Jer
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#010.md); [Jer
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 5:19</span></span>

Retribution in kind. As ye have forsaken Me ([Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013).md), so shall ye be forsaken by Me.
As ye have served strange (foreign) gods in your land, so shall ye serve
strangers (foreigners) in a land not yours. Compare the similar
retribution in [Deu 28:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047.md).

[Jeremiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 5:21</span></span>

eyes . . . ears, and--Translate, "and yet" (compare [Deu
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md); [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md). Having powers of perception,
they did not use them: still they were responsible for the exercise of
them.

[Jeremiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 5:22</span></span>

sand--Though made up of particles easily shifting about, I render it
sufficient to curb the violence of the sea. Such is your monstrous
perversity, that the raging, senseless sea sooner obeys Me, than ye do
who profess to be intelligent \[CALVIN\], ([Job
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010.md); [Job
38:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#010.md); [Pro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#029.md); [Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 5:23</span></span>

([Jer 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 5:24</span></span>

rain . . . former . . . latter--The "former" falls from the middle of
October to the beginning of December. The "latter," or spring rain in
Palestine, falls before harvest in March and April, and is essential for
ripening the crops ([Deu 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014.md); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md).

weeks of . . . harvest--the seven weeks between passover and pentecost,
beginning on the sixteenth of Nisan ([Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md). By God's special providence no
rain fell in Palestine during the harvest weeks, so that harvest work
went on without interruption (see [Gen
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 5:25</span></span>

National guilt had caused the suspension of these national mercies
mentioned in [Jer 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024.md) (compare [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 5:26</span></span>

([Pro 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#011.md), [Pro
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#017.md); [Hab
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015).md).

as he that setteth snares--rather, "as fowlers crouch" \[MAURER\].

trap--literally, "destruction": the instrument of destruction.

catch men--not as Peter, to save ([Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010).md), but to destroy men.

[Jeremiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 5:27</span></span>

full of deceit--full of treasures got by deceit.

rich-- ([Psa 73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md), [Psa
73:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 5:28</span></span>

shine--the effect of fatness on the skin ([Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015).md). They live a life of
self-indulgence.

overpass . . . the wicked--exceed even the Gentiles in wickedness ([Jer
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033.md); [Eze
5:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006).md).

judge not . . . fatherless-- ([Isa
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023).md).

yet . . . prosper-- ([Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 5:29</span></span>

([Jer 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#009.md); [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 5:30</span></span>

([Jer 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014.md); [Hos
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 5:31</span></span>

bear rule by their means--literally, "according to their hands," that
is, under their guidance ([Ch1 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#003).md).
As a sample of the priests lending themselves to the deceits of the
false prophets, to gain influence over the people, see [Jer
29:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md).

love to have it so-- ([Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011).md).

end thereof--the fatal issue of this sinful course when divine judgments
shall come.
