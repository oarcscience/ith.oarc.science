### [Job Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#001)

[Job 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 29:1</span></span>

(Job 29:1-25)

Job pauses for a reply. None being made, he proceeds to illustrate the
mysteriousness of God's dealings, as set forth (Job 28:1-28) by his own
case.

[Job 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 29:2</span></span>

preserved me--from calamity.

[Job 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 29:3</span></span>

candle--when His favor shone on me (see on [Job
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006) and [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028)).

darkness--By His safeguard I passed secure through dangers. Perhaps
alluding to the lights carried before caravans in nightly travels
through deserts \[NOYES\].

[Job 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 29:4</span></span>

youth--literally, "autumn"; the time of the ripe fruits of my
prosperity. Applied to youth, as the Orientalists began their year with
autumn, the most temperate season in the East.

secret--when the intimate friendship of God rested on my tent ([Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032); [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020); [Gen
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)). The Hebrew often means a divan
for deliberation.

[Job 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 29:6</span></span>

butter--rather, "cream," literally, "thick milk." Wherever I turned my
steps, the richest milk and oil flowed in to me abundantly. Image from
pastoral life.

When I washed my steps--Literal washing of the feet in milk is not
meant, as the second clause shows; Margin, "with me," that is, "near" my
path, wherever I walked ([Deu 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013)).
Olives amidst rocks yield the best oil. Oil in the East is used for
food, light, anointing, and medicine.

[Job 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 29:7</span></span>

The great influence Job had over young and old, and noblemen.

through . . . street!--rather, When I went out of my house, in the
country (see [Job 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001), prologue) to
the gate (ascending), up to the city (which was on elevated ground), and
when I prepared my (judicial) seat in the market place. The market place
was the place of judgment, at the gate or propylÃ&brvbr;a of the city,
such as is found in the remains of Nineveh and Persepolis ([Isa
59:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#014); [Psa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#011); [Psa
127:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#005)).

[Job 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 29:8</span></span>

hid--not literally; rather, "stepped backwards," reverentially. The
aged, who were already seated, arose and remained standing (Hebrew)
until Job seated himself. Oriental manners.

[Job 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 29:9</span></span>

([Job 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#002); see on [Job
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#005)).

Refrained talking--stopped in the middle of their speech.

[Job 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 29:10</span></span>

Margin, "voice--hid," that is, "hushed" ([Eze
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#026)).

Tongue cleaved, &c.--that is, awed by my presence, the emirs or sheiks
were silent.

[Job 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 29:11</span></span>

blessed--extolled my virtues ([Pro
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#028)). Omit "me" after "heard";
whoever heard of me (in general, not in the market place, [Job
29:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)) praised me.

gave witness--to my honorable character. Image from a court of justice
([Luk 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022)).

the eye--that is, "face to face"; antithesis to

ear--that is, report of me.

[Job 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 29:12</span></span>

The grounds on which Job was praised ([Job
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011)), his helping the afflicted
([Psa 72:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#012)) who cried to him for
help, as a judge, or as one possessed of means of charity. Translate:
"The fatherless who had none to help him."

[Job 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 29:13</span></span>

So far was I from sending "widows" away empty ([Job
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009)).

ready to perish-- ([Pro 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006)).

[Job 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 29:14</span></span>

([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010); [Ch1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#018)).

judgment--justice.

diadem--tiara. Rather, "turban," "head-dress." It and the full flowing
outer mantle or "robe," are the prominent characteristics of an Oriental
grandee's or high priest's dress ([Zac
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005)). So Job's righteousness
especially characterized him.

[Job 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 29:15</span></span>

Literally, "the blind" ([Deu 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#018));
"lame" ([Sa2 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#013)); figuratively, also
the spiritual support which the more enlightened gives to those less so
([Job 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#003); [Heb
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013); [Num
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#031)).

[Job 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 29:16</span></span>

So far was I from "breaking the arms of the fatherless," as Eliphaz
asserts ([Job 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009)), I was a "father"
to such.

the cause which I knew not--rather, "of him whom I knew not," the
stranger ([Pro 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#007) \[UMBREIT\];
contrast [Luk 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001), &c.). Applicable
to almsgiving ([Psa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001)); but here
primarily, judicial conscientiousness ([Job
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#013)).

[Job 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 29:17</span></span>

Image from combating with wild beasts ([Job
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#011); [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007)). So compassionate was Job to the
oppressed, so terrible to the oppressor!

jaws--Job broke his power, so that he could do no more hurt, and tore
from him the spoil, which he had torn from others.

[Job 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 29:18</span></span>

I said--in my heart ([Psa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006)).

in--rather, "with my nest"; as the second clause refers to long life.
Instead of my family dying before me, as now, I shall live so long as to
die with them: proverbial for long life. Job did realize his hope ([Job
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016)). However, in the bosom of my
family, gives a good sense ([Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021); [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004)). Use "nest" for a secure
dwelling.

sand-- ([Gen 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017); [Hab
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009)). But the Septuagint and Vulgate,
and Jewish interpreters, favor the translation, "the phÅ“nix bird."
"Nest" in the parallel clause supports the reference to a bird. "Sand"
for multitude, applies to men, rather than to years. The myth was, that
the phÅ“nix sprang from a nest of myrrh, made by his father before
death, and that he then came from Arabia (Job's country) to Heliopolis
(the city of the Sun) in Egypt, once in every five hundred years, and
there burnt his father \[HERODOTUS, 2:73\]. Modern research has shown
that this was the Egyptian mode of representing hieroglyphically a
particular chronological era or cycle. The death and revival every five
hundred years, and the reference to the sun, implies such a grand cycle
commencing afresh from the same point in relation to the sun from which
the previous one started. Job probably refers to this.

[Job 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 29:19</span></span>

Literally, "opened to the waters." Opposed to [Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016). Vigorous health.

[Job 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 29:20</span></span>

My renown, like my bodily health, was continually fresh.

bow--Metaphor from war, for, my strength, which gains me "renown," was
ever renewed ([Jer 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035)).

[Job 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 29:21</span></span>

Job reverts with peculiar pleasure to his former dignity in assemblies
([Job 29:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)).

[Job 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 29:22</span></span>

not again--did not contradict me.

dropped--affected their minds, as the genial rain does the soil on which
it gently drops ([Amo 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016); [Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Sol
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011)).

[Job 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 29:23</span></span>

Image of [Job 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#022) continued. They
waited for my salutary counsel, as the dry soil does for the refreshing
rain.

opened . . . mouth--panted for; Oriental image ([Psa
119:131](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#131)). The "early rain" is in
autumn and onwards, while the seed is being sown. The "latter rain" is
in March, and brings forward the harvest, which ripens in May or June.
Between the early and latter rains, some rain falls, but not in such
quantities as those rains. Between March and October no rain falls ([Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014); [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007)).

[Job 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 29:24</span></span>

When I relaxed from my wonted gravity (a virtue much esteemed in the
East) and smiled, they could hardly credit it; and yet, notwithstanding
my condescension, they did not cast aside reverence for my gravity. But
the parallelism is better in UMBREIT'S translation, "I smiled kindly on
those who trusted not," that is, in times of danger I cheered those in
despondency. And they could not cast down (by their despondency) my
serenity of countenance (flowing from trust in God) ([Pro
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#015); [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015)). The opposite phrase ([Gen
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#005)). "Gravity" cannot well be meant
by "light of countenance."

[Job 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 29:25</span></span>

I chose out their way--that is, I willingly went up to their assembly
(from my country residence, [Job
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)).

in the army--as a king supreme in the midst of his army.

comforteth the mourners--Here again Job unconsciously foreshadows Jesus
Christ ([Isa 61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002)). Job's
afflictions, as those of Jesus Christ, were fitting him for the office
hereafter ([Isa 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004); [Heb
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018)).
