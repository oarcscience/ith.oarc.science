[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 2:1</span></span>

DAVID, BY GOD'S DIRECTION, GOES UP TO HEBRON, AND IS MADE KING OVER
JUDAH. ([Sa2 2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#001).md)

David inquired of the Lord--By Urim ([Sa1
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#006.md), [Sa1
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#009.md); [Sa1
30:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#007).md). He knew his destination, but
he knew also that the providence of God would pave the way. Therefore he
would take no step in such a crisis of his own and the nation's history,
without asking and obtaining the divine direction. He was told to go
into Judah, and fix his headquarters in Hebron, whither he accordingly
repaired with his now considerable force. There his interests were very
powerful; for he was not only within his own tribe, and near chiefs with
whom he had been long in friendly relations (see on [Sa1
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#026).md), but Hebron was the capital and
center of Judah, and one of the Levitical cities; the inhabitants of
which were strongly attached to him, both from sympathy with his cause
ever since the massacre at Nob, and from the prospect of realizing in
his person their promised pre-eminence among the tribes. The princes of
Judah, therefore, offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was
accepted. More could not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of
the country ([Ch1 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#003).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 2:5</span></span>

David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead--There can be no
doubt that this message of thanks for their bold and dangerous
enterprise in rescuing the bodies of Saul and his sons was an expression
of David's personal and genuine feeling of satisfaction. At the same
time, it was a stroke of sound and timely policy. In this view the
announcement of his royal power in Judah, accompanied by the pledge of
his protection of the men of Jabesh-gilead, should they be exposed to
danger for their adventure at Beth-shan, would bear an important
significance in all parts of the country and hold out an assurance that
he would render them the same timely and energetic succor that Saul had
done at the beginning of his reign.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008.md)

ABNER MAKES ISH-BOSHETH KING OVER ISRAEL. ([Sa2
2:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008).md)

Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host took Ish-bosheth--Here was
the establishment of a rival kingdom, which, however, would probably
have had no existence but for Abner.

Ish-bosheth--or "Esh-baal" ([Ch1 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md);
[Ch1 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#039).md). The Hebrews usually
changed names ending with Baal into Bosheth ("shame") (compare [Jdg
9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md) with [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021).md). This prince was so called from
his imbecility.

Abner--was first cousin of Saul, commander of the forces, and held in
high respect throughout the country. Loyalty to the house of his late
master was mixed up with opposition to David and views of personal
ambition in his originating this factious movement. He, too, was alive
to the importance of securing the eastern tribes; so, taking Ish-bosheth
across the Jordan, he proclaimed him king at Mahanaim, a town on the
north bank of the Jabbok, hallowed in patriarchal times by the divine
presence ([Gen 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002).md). There he rallied
the tribes around the standard of the unfortunate son of Saul.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 2:9</span></span>

over Gilead--used in a loose sense for the land beyond Jordan.

Ashurites--the tribe of Asher in the extreme north.

Jezreel--the extensive valley bordering on the central tribes.

over all Israel . . . But Judah--David neither could nor would force
matters. He was content to wait God's time and studiously avoided any
collision with the rival king, till, at the lapse of two years,
hostilities were threatened from that quarter.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 2:12</span></span>

Abner . . . and the servants of Ish-bosheth . . . went out from Mahanaim
to Gibeon--This town was near the confines of Judah, and as the force
with which Abner encamped there seemed to have some aggressive design,
David sent an army of observation, under the command of Joab, to watch
his movements.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 2:14</span></span>

Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before
us--Some think that the proposal was only for an exhibition of a little
tilting match for diversion. Others suppose that, both parties being
reluctant to commence a civil war, Abner proposed to leave the contest
to the decision of twelve picked men on either side. This fight by
championship instead of terminating the matter, inflamed the fiercest
passions of the two rival parties; a general engagement ensued, in which
Abner and his forces were defeated and put to flight.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 2:19</span></span>

ASAHEL SLAIN. ([Sa2 2:19-32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#019).md)

Asahel pursued after Abner--To gain the general's armor was deemed the
grandest trophy. Asahel, ambitious of securing Abner's, had outstripped
all other pursuers, and was fast gaining on the retreating commander.
Abner, conscious of possessing more physical power, and unwilling that
there should be "blood" between himself and Joab, Asahel's brother,
twice urged him to desist. The impetuous young soldier being deaf to the
generous remonstrance, the veteran raised the pointed butt of his lance,
as the modern Arabs do when pursued, and, with a sudden back thrust,
transfixed him on the spot, so that he fell, and lay weltering in his
blood. But Joab and Abishai continued the pursuit by another route till
sunset. On reaching a rising ground, and receiving a fresh reinforcement
of some Benjamites, Abner rallied his scattered troops and earnestly
appealed to Joab's better feelings to stop the further effusion of
blood, which, if continued, would lead to more serious consequences--a
destructive civil war. Joab, while upbraiding his opponent as the sole
cause of the fray, felt the force of the appeal and led off his men;
while Abner probably dreading a renewal of the attack when Joab should
learn his brother's fate, and vow fierce revenge, endeavored, by a
forced march, to cross the Jordan that night. On David's side the loss
was only nineteen men, besides Asahel. But of Ish-bosheth's party there
fell three hundred and sixty. This skirmish is exactly similar to the
battles of the Homeric warriors, among whom, in the flight of one, the
pursuit by another, and the dialogue held between them, there is vividly
represented the style of ancient warfare.
