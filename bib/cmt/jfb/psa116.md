The writer celebrates the deliverance from extreme perils by which he

(Psa. 116:1-19)

A truly grateful love will be evinced by acts of worship, which calling
on God expresses ([Psa 116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013.md); [Psa
55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016.md); [Psa
86:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#007.md); compare [Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md); [Psa

For similar figures for distress see [Psa
18:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md).

gat hold upon me--Another sense ("found") of the same word follows, as
we speak of disease finding us, and of our finding or catching disease.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 116:5</span></span>

The relief which he asked is the result not of his merit, but of God's
known pity and tenderness, which is acknowledged in assuring himself
(his "soul," [Psa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md); [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).md) of rest and peace. All
calamities \[[Psa 116:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#008.md)\] are

56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013).md).

61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 116:10</span></span>

Confidence in God opposed to distrust of men, as not reliable ([Psa
68:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008).md). He speaks from an experience
of the result of his faith.

[Psalms 116:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 116:11</span></span>

in my haste--literally, "terror," or "agitation," produced by his
affliction (compare [Psa 31:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#022).md).

[Psalms 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012.md)

offering ([Num 15:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 116:14</span></span>

now--(compare [Psa 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002).md). "Oh, that
(I may do it)" in the presence, &c.

[Psalms 116:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 116:15</span></span>

covenant love to His people.
