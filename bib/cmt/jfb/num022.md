### [Numbers Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001)

[Numbers 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 22:1</span></span>

BALAK'S FIRST MESSAGE FOR BALAAM REFUSED. (Num. 22:1-20)

Israel . . . pitched in the plains of Moab--so called from having
formerly belonged to that people, though wrested from them by Sihon. It
was a dry, sunken, desert region on the east of the Jordan valley,
opposite Jericho.

[Numbers 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 22:2</span></span>

Balak--that is, "empty." Terrified ([Deu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#025); [Exo
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015)) at the approach of so vast a
multitude and not daring to encounter them in the field, he resolved to
secure their destruction by other means.

[Numbers 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 22:4</span></span>

elders of Midian--called kings ([Num
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)) and princes ([Jos
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#021)). The Midianites, a distinct
people on the southern frontier of Moab, united with them as
confederates against Israel, their common enemy.

[Numbers 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 22:5</span></span>

He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam--that is, "lord" or "devourer"
of people, a famous soothsayer ([Jos
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#022)).

son of Beor--or, in the Chaldee form, Bosor--that is, "destruction."

Pethor--a city of Mesopotamia, situated on the Euphrates.

[Numbers 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 22:6</span></span>

Come . . . curse me this people--Among the heathen an opinion prevailed
that prayers for evil or curses would be heard by the unseen powers as
well as prayers for good, when offered by a prophet or priest and
accompanied by the use of certain rites. Many examples are found in the
histories of the Greeks and Romans of whole armies being devoted to
destruction, and they occur among the natives of India and other heathen
countries still. In the Burmese war, magicians were employed to curse
the British troops.

[Numbers 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 22:7</span></span>

the elders of Moab and . . . of Midian departed with the rewards of
divination--like the fee of a fortune teller, and being a royal present,
it would be something handsome.

[Numbers 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 22:8</span></span>

Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord
shall speak unto me, &c.--God usually revealed His will in visions and
dreams; and Balaam's birth and residence in Mesopotamia, where the
remains of patriarchal religion still lingered, account for his
knowledge of the true God. His real character has long been a subject of
discussion. Some, judging from his language, have thought him a saint;
others, looking to his conduct, have described him as an irreligious
charlatan; and a third class consider him a novice in the faith, who had
a fear of God, but who had not acquired power over his passions
\[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Numbers 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 22:13</span></span>

the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you--This answer has an
appearance of being good, but it studiously concealed the reason of the
divine prohibition \[[Num 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012)\], and
it intimated his own willingness and desire to go--if permitted. Balak
despatched a second mission, which held out flattering prospects, both
to his avarice and his ambition ([Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030)).

[Numbers 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 22:19</span></span>

tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will say
unto me more--The divine will, as formerly declared, not being according
to his desires, he hoped by a second request to bend it, as he had
already bent his own conscience, to his ruling passions of pride and
covetousness. The permission granted to Balaam is in accordance with the
ordinary procedure of Providence. God often gives up men to follow the
impulse of their own lusts; but there is no approval in thus leaving
them to act at the prompting of their own wicked hearts ([Jos
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027)).

[Numbers 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 22:21</span></span>

THE JOURNEY. (Num. 22:21-41)

Balaam . . . saddled his ass--probably one of the white sprightly
animals which persons of rank were accustomed to ride. The saddle, as
usually in the East, would be nothing more than a pad or his outer
cloak.

[Numbers 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 22:22</span></span>

God's anger was kindled because he went--The displeasure arose partly
from his neglecting the condition on which leave was granted
him--namely, to wait till the princes of Moab "came to call him" \[[Num
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020)\], and because, through desire
for "the wages of unrighteousness" \[[Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)\], he entertained the secret
purpose of acting in opposition to the solemn charge of God.

[Numbers 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">num 22:24</span></span>

the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards--The roads which
lead through fields and vineyards are so narrow that in most parts a man
could not pass a beast without care and caution. A stone or mud fence
flanks each side of these roads, to prevent the soil being washed off by
the rains.

[Numbers 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 22:28</span></span>

the Lord opened the mouth of the ass--to utter, like a parrot,
articulate sounds, without understanding them. That this was a visionary
scene is a notion which seems inadmissible, because of the improbability
of a vision being described as an actual occurrence in the middle of a
plain history. Besides, the opening of the ass's mouth must have been an
external act, and that, with the manifest tenor of Peter's language,
strongly favors the literal view \[[Pe2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015)\]. The absence of any surprise
at such a phenomenon on the part of Balaam may be accounted for by his
mind being wholly engrossed with the prospect of gain, which produced
"the madness of the prophet" \[[Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016)\]. "It was a miracle, wrought to
humble his proud heart, which had to be first subjected in the school of
an ass before he was brought to attend to the voice of God speaking by
the angel" \[CALVIN\].

[Numbers 22:34](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">num 22:34</span></span>

I have sinned . . . if it displease thee, I will get me back
again--Notwithstanding this confession, he evinced no spirit of
penitence, as he speaks of desisting only from the outward act. The
words "go with the men" was a mere withdrawal of further restraint, but
the terms in which leave was given are more absolute and peremptory than
those in [Num 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#020).

[Numbers 22:36](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">num 22:36</span></span>

when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
him--Politeness requires that the higher the rank of the expected guest,
greater distance is to be gone to welcome his arrival.

[Numbers 22:38](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">num 22:38</span></span>

the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak--This appears
a pious answer. It was an acknowledgment that he was restrained by a
superior power.

[Numbers 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 22:39</span></span>

Kirjath-huzoth--that is, "a city of streets."

[Numbers 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">num 22:40</span></span>

Balak offered oxen and sheep--made preparations for a grand
entertainment to Balaam and the princes of Midian.

[Numbers 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">num 22:41</span></span>

high places of Baal--eminences consecrated to the worship of Baal-peor
(see on [Num 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003)) or Chemosh.
