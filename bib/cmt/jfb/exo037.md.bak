FURNITURE OF THE TABERNACLE. (Exo. 37:1-29)

Bezaleel made the ark--The description here given of the things within
the sacred edifice is almost word for word the same as that contained in
Exo. 25:1-40. It is not on that account to be regarded as a useless
repetition of minute particulars; for by the enumeration of these
details, it can be seen how exactly everything was fashioned according
to the "pattern shown on the mount" \[[Exo
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md)\]; and the knowledge of this
exact correspondence between the prescription and the execution was
essential to the purposes of the fabric.

[Exodus 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#006.md)

made the mercy seat of pure gold--To construct a figure, whether the
body of a beast or a man, with two extended wings, measuring from two to
three feet from tip to tip, with the hammer, out of a solid piece of
gold, was what few, if any, artisans of the present day could
accomplish.

[Exodus 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 37:17</span></span>

he made the candlestick of pure gold--Practical readers will be apt to
say, "Why do such works with the hammer, when they could have been cast
so much easier--a process they were well acquainted with?" The only
answer that can be given is, that it was done according to order. We
have no doubt but there were reasons for so distinctive an order,
something significant, which has not been revealed to us \[NAPIER\]. The
whole of that sacred building was arranged with a view to inculcate
through every part of its apparatus the great fundamental principles of
revelation. Every object was symbolical of important truth--every piece
of furniture was made the hieroglyphic of a doctrine or a duty--on the
floor and along the sides of that movable edifice was exhibited, by
emblematic signs addressed to the eye, the whole remedial scheme of the
gospel. How far this spiritual instruction was received by every
successive generation of the Israelites, it may not be easy to
determine. But the tabernacle, like the law of which it was a part, was
a schoolmaster to Christ \[[Gal
3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md)\]. Just as the walls of
schools are seen studded with pictorial figures, by which the children,
in a manner level to their capacities and suited to arrest their
volatile minds, are kept in constant and familiar remembrance of the
lessons of piety and virtue, so the tabernacle was intended by its
furniture and all its arrangements to serve as a "shadow of good things
to come" \[[Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)\]. In this view,
the minute description given in this chapter respecting the ark and
mercy seat, the table of showbread, the candlestick, the altar of
incense, and the holy oil, were of the greatest utility and importance;
and though there are a few things that are merely ornamental appendages,
such as the knops and the flowers, yet, in introducing these into the
tabernacle, God displayed the same wisdom and goodness as He has done by
introducing real flowers into the kingdom of nature to engage and
gratify the eye of man.
