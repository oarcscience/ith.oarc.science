### [Job Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001)

[Job 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 9:2</span></span>

REPLY OF JOB TO BILDAD. (Job 9:1-35)

I know it is so of a truth--that God does not "pervert justice" ([Job
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003)). But (even though I be sure of
being in the right) how can a mere man assert his right--(be just) with
God. The Gospel answers ([Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026)).

[Job 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 9:3</span></span>

If he--God

will contend with him--literally, "deign to enter into judgment."

he cannot answer, &c.--He (man) would not dare, even if he had a
thousand answers in readiness to one question of God's, to utter one of
them, from awe of His Majesty.

[Job 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 9:4</span></span>

wise in heart--in understanding!--and mighty in power! God confounds the
ablest arguer by His wisdom, and the mightiest by His power.

hardened himself--or his neck ([Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001)); that is, defied God. To
prosper, one must fall in with God's arrangements of providence and
grace.

[Job 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 9:5</span></span>

and they know not--Hebrew for "suddenly, unexpectedly, before they are
aware of it" ([Psa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008)); "at
unawares"; Hebrew, which "he knoweth not of" ([Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014); [Pro
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006)).

[Job 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 9:6</span></span>

The earth is regarded, poetically, as resting on pillars, which tremble
in an earthquake ([Psa 75:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#003); [Isa
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#020)). The literal truth as to the
earth is given ([Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007)).

[Job 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 9:7</span></span>

The sun, at His command, does not rise; namely, in an eclipse, or the
darkness that accompanies earthquakes ([Job
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#006)).

sealeth up the stars--that is, totally covers as one would seal up a
room, that its contents may not be seen.

[Job 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 9:8</span></span>

spreadeth out-- ([Isa 40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022); [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)). But throughout it is not so
much God's creating, as His governing, power over nature that is set
forth. A storm seems a struggle between Nature and her Lord! Better,
therefore, "Who boweth the heavens alone," without help of any other.
God descends from the bowed-down heaven to the earth ([Psa
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009)). The storm, wherein the clouds
descend, suggests this image. In the descent of the vault of heaven, God
has come down from His high throne and walks majestically over the
mountain waves (Hebrew, "heights"), as a conqueror taming their
violence. So "tread upon" ([Deu 33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029);
[Amo 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013); [Mat
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026)). The Egyptian hieroglyphic for
impossibility is a man walking on waves.

[Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 9:9</span></span>

maketh--rather, from the Arabic, "covereth up." This accords better with
the context, which describes His boundless power as controller rather
than as creator \[UMBREIT\].

Arcturus--the great bear, which always revolves about the pole, and
never sets. The Chaldeans and Arabs, early named the stars and grouped
them in constellations; often travelling and tending flocks by night,
they would naturally do so, especially as the rise and setting of some
stars mark the distinction of seasons. BRINKLEY, presuming the stars
here mentioned to be those of Taurus and Scorpio, and that these were
the cardinal constellations of spring and autumn in Job's time,
calculates, by the precession of equinoxes, the time of Job to be eight
hundred eighteen years after the deluge, and one hundred eighty-four
before Abraham.

Orion--Hebrew, "the fool"; in [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031) he appears fettered with
"bands." The old legend represented this star as a hero, who
presumptuously rebelled against God, and was therefore a fool, and was
chained in the sky as a punishment; for its rising is at the stormy
period of the year. He is Nimrod (the exceedingly impious rebel) among
the Assyrians; Orion among the Greeks. Sabaism (worship of the heavenly
hosts) and hero-worship were blended in his person. He first subverted
the patriarchal order of society by substituting a chieftainship based
on conquest ([Gen 10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009)).

Pleiades--literally, "the heap of stars"; Arabic, "knot of stars." The
various names of this constellation in the East express the close union
of the stars in it ([Amo 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008)).

chambers of the south--the unseen regions of the southern hemisphere,
with its own set of stars, as distinguished from those just mentioned of
the northern. The true structure of the earth is here implied.

[Job 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 9:10</span></span>

Repeated from Eliphaz ([Job 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009)).

[Job 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 9:11</span></span>

I see him not: he passeth on--The image is that of a howling wind ([Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001)). Like it when it bursts
invisibly upon man, so God is felt in the awful effects of His wrath,
but is not seen ([Joh 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)). Therefore,
reasons Job, it is impossible to contend with Him.

[Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 9:12</span></span>

If "He taketh away," as in my case all that was dear to me, still a
mortal cannot call Him to account. He only takes His own. He is an
absolute King ([Ecc 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#004); [Dan
4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)).

[Job 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 9:13</span></span>

If God--rather, "God will not withdraw His anger," that is, so long as a
mortal obstinately resists \[UMBREIT\].

the proud helpers--The arrogant, who would help one contending with the
Almighty, are of no avail against Him.

[Job 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 9:14</span></span>

How much less shall I? &c.--who am weak, seeing that the mighty have to
stoop before Him. Choose words (use a well-chosen speech, in order to
reason) with Him.

[Job 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 9:15</span></span>

([Job 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015)). Though I were conscious
of no sin, yet I would not dare to say so, but leave it to His judgment
and mercy to justify me ([Co1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)).

[Job 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 9:16</span></span>

would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice--who breaketh me
(as a tree stripped of its leaves) with a tempest.

[Job 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 9:19</span></span>

UMBREIT takes these as the words of God, translating, "What availeth the
might of the strong?" "Here (saith he) behold! what availeth justice?
Who will appoint me a time to plead?" (So [Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019)). The last words certainly apply
better to God than to Job. The sense is substantially the same if we
make "me" apply to Job. The "lo!" expresses God's swift readiness for
battle when challenged.

[Job 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 9:20</span></span>

it-- ([Job 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#006); [Luk
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#022)); or "He," God.

[Job 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 9:21</span></span>

Literally, here (and in [Job 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020)), "I
perfect! I should not know my soul! I would despise," \[that is\],
"disown my life"; that is, Though conscious of innocence, I should be
compelled, in contending with the infinite God, to ignore my own soul
and despise my past life as if it were guilty \[ROSENMULLER\].

[Job 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 9:22</span></span>

one thing--"It is all one; whether perfect or wicked--He destroyeth."
This was the point Job maintained against his friends, that the
righteous and wicked alike are afflicted, and that great sufferings here
do not prove great guilt ([Luk 13:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001);
[Ecc 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)).

[Job 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 9:23</span></span>

If--Rather, "While (His) scourge slays suddenly (the wicked, [Job
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022)), He laughs at (disregards; not
derides) the pining away of the innocent." The only difference, says
Job, between the innocent and guilty is, the latter are slain by a
sudden stroke, the former pine away gradually. The translation, "trial,"
does not express the antithesis to "slay suddenly," as "pining away"
does \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 9:24</span></span>

Referring to righteous "judges," in antithesis to "the wicked" in the
parallel first clause, whereas the wicked oppressor often has the earth
given into his hand, the righteous judges are led to execution--culprits
had their faces covered preparatory to execution ([Est
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008)). Thus the contrast of the wicked
and righteous here answers to that in [Job
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023).

if not, where and who?--If God be not the cause of these anomalies,
where is the cause to be found, and who is he?

[Job 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 9:25</span></span>

a post--a courier. In the wide Persian empire such couriers, on
dromedaries or on foot, were employed to carry the royal commands to the
distant provinces ([Est 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#013), [Est
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#015); [Est
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#014)). "My days" are not like the slow
caravan, but the fleet post. The "days" are themselves poetically said
to "see no good," instead of Job in them ([Pe1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010)).

[Job 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 9:26</span></span>

swift ships--rather, canoes of reeds or papyrus skiffs, used on the
Nile, swift from their lightness ([Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002)).

[Job 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 9:28</span></span>

The apodosis to [Job 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#027) --"If I say,
&c." "I still am afraid of all my sorrows (returning), for I know that
thou wilt (dost) (by removing my sufferings) not hold or declare me
innocent. How then can I leave off my heaviness?"

[Job 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 9:29</span></span>

The "if" is better omitted; I (am treated by God as) wicked; why then
labor I in vain (to disprove His charge)? Job submits, not so much
because he is convinced that God is right, as because God is powerful
and he weak \[BARNES\].

[Job 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 9:30</span></span>

snow water--thought to be more cleansing than common water, owing to the
whiteness of snow ([Psa 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007); [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018)).

never so clean--Better, to answer to the parallelism of the first clause
which expresses the cleansing material, "lye:" the Arabs used alkali
mixed with oil, as soap ([Psa 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013);
[Jer 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022)).

[Job 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 9:32</span></span>

([Ecc 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#010); [Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009)).

[Job 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 9:33</span></span>

daysman--"mediator," or "umpire"; the imposition of whose hand expresses
power to adjudicate between the persons. There might be one on a level
with Job, the one party; but Job knew of none on a level with the
Almighty, the other party ([Sa1 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025)).
We Christians know of such a Mediator (not, however, in the sense of
umpire) on a level with both--the God-man, Christ Jesus ([Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)).

[Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 9:34</span></span>

rod--not here the symbol of punishment, but of power. Job cannot meet
God on fair terms so long as God deals with him on the footing of His
almighty power.

[Job 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">job 9:35</span></span>

it is not so with me--As it now is, God not taking His rod away, I am
not on such a footing of equality as to be able to vindicate myself.
