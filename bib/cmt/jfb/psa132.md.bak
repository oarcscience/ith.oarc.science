### [Psalms Chapter 132](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 132:1</span></span>

The writer, perhaps Solomon (compare [Psa
132:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008).md), after relating David's pious
zeal for God's service, pleads for the fulfilment of the promise ([Sa2
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016).md), which, providing for a
perpetuation of David's kingdom, involved that of God's right worship
and the establishment of the greater and spiritual kingdom of David's
greater Son. Of Him and His kingdom both the temple and its worship, and
the kings and kingdom of Judah, were types. The congruity of such a
topic with the tenor of this series of Psalms is obvious. (Psa.
132:1-18)

This vow is not elsewhere recorded. It expresses, in strong language,
David's intense desire to see the establishment of God's worship as well
as of His kingdom.

remember David--literally, "remember for David," that is, all his
troubles and anxieties on the matter.

[Psalms 132:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 132:5</span></span>

habitation--literally, "dwellings," generally used to denote the
sanctuary.

[Psalms 132:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 132:6</span></span>

These may be the "words of David" and his pious friends, who,

at Ephratah--or Beth-lehem ([Gen
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007).md), where he once lived, may have
heard of the ark, which he found for the first time

in the fields of the wood--or, Jair, or Kirjath-jearim ("City of woods")
([Sa1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md); [Sa2
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003).md), whence it was brought to Zion.

[Psalms 132:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 132:7</span></span>

The purpose of engaging in God's worship is avowed.

[Psalms 132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 132:8</span></span>

The solemn entry of the ark, symbolical of God's presence and power,
with the attending priests, into the sanctuary, is proclaimed in the
words used by Solomon ([Ch2 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041).md).

[Psalms 132:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 132:10</span></span>

For thy servant David's sake--that is, On account of the promise made to
him.

turn . . . anointed--Repulse not him who, as David's descendant, pleads
the promise to perpetuate his royal line. After reciting the promise,
substantially from [Sa2 7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012.md)
(compare [Act 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030), &c..md), an
additional plea,

[Psalms 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 132:13</span></span>

is made on the ground of God's choice of Zion (here used for Jerusalem)
as His dwelling, inasmuch as the prosperity of the kingdom was connected
with that of the Church ([Psa
122:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 132:14</span></span>

That choice is expressed in God's words, "I will sit" or "dwell," or sit
enthroned. The joy of the people springs from the blessings of His
grace, conferred through the medium of the priesthood.

[Psalms 132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 132:17</span></span>

make the horn . . . to bud--enlarge his power.

a lamp--the figure of prosperity ([Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md), [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md); [Psa
89:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#017).md). With the confounding of his
enemies is united his prosperity and the unceasing splendor of his
crown.
