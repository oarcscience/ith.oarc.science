### [Numbers Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 1:1</span></span>

MOSES NUMBERING THE MEN OF WAR. (Num. 1:1-54)

on the first day of the second month, &c.--Thirteen months had elapsed
since the exodus. About one month had been occupied in the journey; and
the rest of the period had been passed in encampment among the recesses
of Sinai, where the transactions took place, and the laws, religious and
civil, were promulgated, which are contained in the two preceding books.
As the tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month, and
the order here mentioned was given on the first day of the second, some
think the laws in Leviticus were all given in one month. The Israelites
having been formed into a separate nation, under the special government
of God as their King, it was necessary, before resuming their march
towards the promised land, to put them into good order. And accordingly
Moses was commissioned, along with Aaron, to take a census of the
people. This census was incidentally noticed ([Exo
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#026).md), in reference to the poll tax
for the works of the tabernacle; but it is here described in detail, in
order to show the relative increase and military strength of the
different tribes. The enumeration was confined to those capable of
bearing arms \[[Num 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md)\], and it was
to be made with a careful distinction of the tribe, family, and
household to which every individual belonged. By this rule of summation
many important advantages were secured: an exact genealogical register
was formed, the relative strength of each tribe was ascertained, and the
reason found for arranging the order of precedence in march as well as
disposing the different tribes in camp around the tabernacle. The
promise of God to Abraham \[[Gen
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md)\] was seen to be fulfilled in
the extraordinary increase of his posterity, and provision made for
tracing the regular descent of the Messiah.

[Numbers 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 1:3</span></span>

Aaron shall number them by their armies--or companies. In their
departure from Egypt they were divided into five grand companies ([Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018).md), but from the sojourn in the
wilderness to the passage of the Jordan, they were formed into four
great divisions. The latter is here referred to.

[Numbers 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 1:4</span></span>

with you there shall be a man of every tribe, &c.--The social condition
of the Israelites in the wilderness bore a close resemblance to that of
the nomad tribes of the East in the present day. The head of the tribe
was a hereditary dignity, vested in the oldest son or some other to whom
the right of primogeniture was transferred, and under whom were other
inferior heads, also hereditary, among the different branches of the
tribe. The Israelites being divided into twelve tribes, there were
twelve chiefs appointed to assist in taking the census of the people.

[Numbers 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 1:5</span></span>

these are the names of the men that shall stand with you, &c.--Each is
designated by adding the name of the ancestors of his tribe, the people
of which were called "Beni-Reuben," "Beni-Levi," sons of Reuben, sons of
Levi, according to the custom of the Arabs still, as well as other
nations which are divided into clans, as the Macs of Scotland, the Aps
of Wales, and the O's and the Fitzes of Ireland \[CHALMERS\].

[Numbers 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 1:16</span></span>

These were the renowned--literally, "the called" of the congregation,
summoned by name; and they entered upon the survey the very day the
order was given.

[Numbers 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 1:18</span></span>

by their polls--individually, one by one.

[Numbers 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 1:19</span></span>

As the Lord commanded Moses, &c.--The numbering of the people was not an
act sinful in itself, as Moses did it by divine appointment; but David
incurred guilt by doing it without the authority of God. (See on [Sa2
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#010).md).

[Numbers 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">num 1:20</span></span>

These are those that were numbered--In this registration the tribe of
Judah appears the most numerous; and accordingly, as the pre-eminence
had been assigned to it by Jacob \[[Gen
49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008.md)\], it got the precedence in
all the encampments of Israel. Of the two half-tribes of Joseph, who is
seen to be "a fruitful bough" \[[Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md)\], that of Ephraim was the
larger, as had been predicted. The relative increase of all, as in the
two just mentioned, was owing to the special blessing of God,
conformably to the prophetic declaration of the dying patriarch. But the
divine blessing is usually conveyed through the influence of secondary
causes; and there is reason to believe that the relative populousness of
the tribes would, under God, depend upon the productiveness of the
respective localities assigned to them. \[For tabular chart, see on [Num
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md).\]

[Numbers 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">num 1:45</span></span>

all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand, &c.--What an
astonishing increase from seventy-five persons who went down to Egypt
about two hundred fifteen years before \[see on [Gen
46:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#008.md)\], and who were subjected to the
greatest privations and hardships! And yet this enumeration was
restricted to men from twenty years and upwards \[[Num
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#003.md)\]. Including women, children, and
old men, together with the Levites, the whole population of Israel, on
the ordinary principles of computation, amounted to about 2,400,000.

[Numbers 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">num 1:47</span></span>

But the Levites . . . were not numbered among them--They were obliged to
keep a register of their own. They were consecrated to the priestly
office, which in all countries has been exempted customarily, and in
Israel by the express authority of God, from military service. The
custody of the things devoted to the divine service was assigned to them
so exclusively, that "no stranger"--that is, no person, not even an
Israelite of any other tribe, was allowed, under penalty of death, to
approach these \[[Num 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#040.md)\]. Hence
they encamped round the tabernacle in order that there should be no
manifestation of the divine displeasure among the people. Thus the
numbering of the people was subservient to the separation of the Levites
from those Israelites who were fit for military service, and to the
practical introduction of the law respecting the first-born, for whom
the tribe of Levi became a substitute \[[Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md); [Num
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#012.md)\].
