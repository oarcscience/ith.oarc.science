### [Jeremiah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 1:1</span></span>

([Jer 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md), probably prefixed by
Jeremiah, when he collected his prophecies and gave them to his
countrymen to take with them to Babylon \[MICHAELIS\])

Anathoth--a town in Benjamin, twenty stadia, that is, two or three miles
north of Jerusalem; now Anata (compare [Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030.md), and the context, [Isa
10:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#028).md). One of the four cities
allotted to the Kohathites in Benjamin ([Jos
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#018).md). Compare [Kg1
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md); a stigma was cast thenceforth
on the whole sacerdotal family resident there; this may be alluded to in
the words here, "the priests . . . in Anathoth." God chooses "the weak,
base, and despised things . . . to confound the mighty."

[Jeremiah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 1:2</span></span>

Jehoiakim . . . Josiah . . . Zedekiah--Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin are
omitted for they reigned only three months each. The first and last of
the kings under whom each prophet prophesied are often thus specified in
the general title. See on these kings, and Jeremiah's life, my
Introduction.

thirteenth . . . of his reign-- ([Jer
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003).md).

fifth month-- ([Kg2 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 1:4</span></span>

Jeremiah's call to the prophetical office.

unto me--other manuscripts read "to him"; but English Version probably
represents the true Hebrew text; this inscription was doubtless made by
Jeremiah himself.

[Jeremiah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 1:5</span></span>

knew--approved of thee as My chosen instrument ([Exo
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012.md), [Exo
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#017.md); compare [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md), [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005.md); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md).

sanctified--rather, "separated." The primary meaning is, "to set apart"
from a common to a special use; hence arose the secondary sense, "to
sanctify," ceremonially and morally. It is not here meant that Jehovah
cleansed Jeremiah from original sin or regenerated him by His Spirit;
but separated him to his peculiar prophetical office, including in its
range, not merely the Hebrews, but also the nations hostile to them
(Jer. 25:12-38; 27:1-21; 46:1-51:64), \[HENDERSON\]. Not the effect, but
the predestination in Jehovah's secret counsel, is meant by the
sanctification here (compare [Luk
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md), [Luk
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#041.md); [Act
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md); [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015.md); [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 1:6</span></span>

From the long duration of his office ([Jer
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002.md); [Jer
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001.md), &c.; [Jer
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008), &c..md), it is supposed that he was
at the time of his call under twenty-five years of age.

child--the same word is translated, "young man" ([Sa2
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005).md). The reluctance often shown by
inspired ministers of God ([Exo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md);
[Exo 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#012.md), [Exo
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#030.md); [Jon
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003).md) to accept the call, shows that
they did not assume the office under the impulse of self-deceiving
fanaticism, as false prophets often did.

[Jeremiah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 1:7</span></span>

to all that--to all "to whom" \[ROSENMULLER\]. Rather, "to all against
whom"; in a hostile sense (compare [Jer
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md), [Jer
1:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017).md) \[MAURER\]. Such was the
perversity of the rulers and people of Judea at that time, that whoever
would desire to be a faithful prophet needed to arm himself with an
intrepid mind; Jeremiah was naturally timid and sensitive; yet the
Spirit moulded him to the necessary degree of courage without taking
away his peculiar individuality.

[Jeremiah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 1:8</span></span>

([Eze 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md); [Eze
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009).md).

I am with thee-- ([Exo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md); [Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 1:9</span></span>

touched my mouth--a symbolical act in supernatural vision, implying that
God would give him utterance, notwithstanding his inability to speak
([Jer 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006).md). So Isaiah's lips were
touched with a living coal ([Isa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#007.md);
compare [Eze 2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008.md); [Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 1:10</span></span>

set thee over--literally, "appointed thee to the oversight." He was to
have his eye upon the nations, and to predict their destruction, or
restoration, according as their conduct was bad or good. Prophets are
said to do that which they foretell shall be done; for their word is
God's word; and His word is His instrument whereby He doeth all things
([Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); [Psa
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006.md), [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009).md). Word and deed are one thing
with Him. What His prophet saith is as certain as if it were done. The
prophet's own consciousness was absorbed into that of God; so closely
united to God did he feel himself, that Jehovah's words and deeds are
described as his. In [Jer 31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028.md), God
is said to do what Jeremiah here is represented as doing (compare [Jer
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007.md); [Kg1
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#017.md); [Eze
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003).md).

root out-- ([Mat 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013).md).

pull down--change of metaphor to architecture ([Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004).md). There is a play on the similar
sounds, lintbosh, linthotz, in the Hebrew for "root out . . . pull
down."

build . . . plant--restore upon their repenting. His predictions were to
be chiefly, and in the first instance, denunciatory; therefore the
destruction of the nations is put first, and with a greater variety of
terms than their restoration.

[Jeremiah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 1:11</span></span>

rod--shoot, or branch.

almond tree--literally, "the wakeful tree," because it awakes from the
sleep of winter earlier than the other trees, flowering in January, and
bearing fruit in March; symbol of God's early execution of His purpose;
[Jer 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#012.md), "hasten My word" (compare
[Amo 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 1:12</span></span>

hasten--rather, "I will be wakeful as to My word," &c.; alluding to [Jer
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011.md), "the wakeful tree" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 1:13</span></span>

Another vision, signifying what is the "word" about to be "performed,"
and by what instrumentality.

seething--literally, "blown under"; so boiling by reason of the flame
under it kept brisk by blowing. An Oriental symbol of a raging war.

toward--rather, "from the north." Literally, "from the face of the
region situated towards the north" (compare [Jer
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014).md) \[MAURER\]. The pot in the
north rested on one side, its mouth being about to pour forth its
contents southwards, namely, on Judea. Babylon, though east of Judea,
was regarded by the Hebrews as north, because they appropriated the term
"east" to Arabia-Deserta, stretching from Palestine to the Euphrates; or
rather \[BOCHART\], the reference here is not to the site, but to the
route of the Babylonians; not being able to cross the desert, they must
enter the Holy Land by the northern frontier, through Riblah in Hamath
([Jer 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md); [Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009).md).

[Jeremiah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 1:14</span></span>

break forth--"shall disclose itself."

Out of the north-- ([Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md); [Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md), [Jer
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md); [Jer
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#022.md); [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md); [Eze
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007).md). The Chaldeans did not cast off
the yoke of Assyria till several years after, under Nabopolassar, 625
B.C.; but long previously they had so increased as to threaten Assyria,
which was now grown weak, and other neighboring peoples.

[Jeremiah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 1:15</span></span>

families--the tribes or clans composing the various kingdoms of Babylon;
the specification of these aggravates the picture of calamity ([Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009).md).

throne at . . . gates--the usual place of administering justice. The
conquering princes will set up their tribunal there ([Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md), [Jer
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md); [Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009).md). Or the reference is to the
military pavilion ([Jer 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010).md)
\[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 1:16</span></span>

utter--pronounce. The judicial sentences, pronounced against the Jews by
the invading princes, would be virtually the "judgments of God" ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

works--idols.

[Jeremiah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 1:17</span></span>

gird . . . loins--resolutely prepare for thy appointed task. Metaphor
from the flowing robes worn in the East, which have to be girt up with a
girdle, so as not to incommode one, when undertaking any active work
([Job 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003.md); [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md); [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013).md).

dismayed . . . confound--the same Hebrew word; literally, "to break." Be
not dismayed at their faces (before them), lest I make thee dismayed
before their faces (before them), that is, "lest I should permit thee to
be overcome by them" (compare [Jer
49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037).md).

[Jeremiah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 1:18</span></span>

defenced city, &c.--that is, I will give thee strength which no power of
thine enemies shall overcome ([Jer
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027.md); [Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020.md); [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007.md); [Isa
54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017.md); [Luk
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015.md); [Act
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010).md).

walls--plural, to express the abundant strength to be given him. DE
ROSSI'S'S manuscripts read singular, "wall."

people of the land--the general masses, as distinguished from the
princes and priests.

Probably in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah ([Jer
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002.md); compare [Jer
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#006.md), "also . . . in . . . days of
Josiah"). The warning not to rely as they did on Egypt ([Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018).md), was in accordance with Josiah's
policy, who took part with Assyria and Babylon against Egypt ([Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029).md). Jeremiah, doubtless, supported
the reformation begun by Josiah, in the previous year (the twelfth of
his reign), and fully carried out in the eighteenth.
