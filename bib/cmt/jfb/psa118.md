### [Psalms Chapter 118](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 118:1</span></span>

After invoking others to unite in praise, the writer celebrates God's
protecting and delivering care towards him, and then represents himself
and the people of God as entering the sanctuary and uniting in solemn
praise, with prayer for a continued blessing. Whether composed by David
on his accession to power, or by some later writer in memory of the
restoration from Babylon, its tone is joyful and trusting, and, in
describing the fortune and destiny of the Jewish Church and its visible
head, it is typically prophetical of the Christian Church and her
greater and invisible Head. (Psa. 118:1-29)

The trine repetitions are emphatic (compare [Psa
118:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md), [Psa
118:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md); [Psa
115:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#012).md).

Let . . . say--Oh! that Israel may say.

now--as in [Psa 115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002.md); so in [Psa
118:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#003.md). After "now say" supply "give
thanks."

that his mercy--or, "for His mercy."

[Psalms 118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 118:5</span></span>

distress--literally, "straits," to which "large place" corresponds, as
in [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001.md); [Psa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008.md).

[Psalms 118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 118:6</span></span>

Men are helpless to hurt him, if God be with him ([Psa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009).md), and, if enemies, they will be
vanquished ([Psa 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 118:8</span></span>

Even the most powerful men are less to be trusted than God.

[Psalms 118:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 118:10</span></span>

Though as numerous and irritating as bees \[[Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md)\], by God's help his enemies
would be destroyed.

[Psalms 118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 118:12</span></span>

as the fire of thorns--suddenly.

in the name, &c.--by the power ([Psa
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005.md); [Psa
124:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 118:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 118:13</span></span>

The enemy is triumphantly addressed as if present.

[Psalms 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 118:15</span></span>

rejoicing and salvation--the latter as cause of the former.

[Psalms 118:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 118:16</span></span>

right hand . . . is exalted--His power greatly exerted.

[Psalms 118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 118:17</span></span>

He would live, because confident his life would be for God's glory.

[Psalms 118:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 118:19</span></span>

Whether an actual or figurative entrance into God's house be meant, the
purpose of solemn praise is intimated, in which only the righteous would
or could engage.

[Psalms 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 118:22</span></span>

These words are applied by Christ ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042).md) to Himself, as the foundation
of the Church (compare [Act 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020.md); [Pe1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md), [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007).md). It may here denote God's
wondrous exaltation to power and influence of him whom the rulers of the
nation despised. Whether (see on [Psa
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001).md) David or Zerubbabel (compare
[Hag 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#002.md); [Zac
4:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007).md) be primarily meant, there is
here typically represented God's more wonderful doings in exalting
Christ, crucified as an impostor, to be the Prince and Saviour and Head
of His Church.

[Psalms 118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 118:24</span></span>

This is the day--or period distinguished by God's favor of all others.

[Psalms 118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 118:25</span></span>

Save now--Hebrew, "Hosanna" (compare [Psa
115:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002), &c., as to now.md) a form of
prayer ([Psa 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#009).md), since, in our use,
of praise.

[Psalms 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 118:26</span></span>

he that cometh . . . Lord--As above intimated, this may be applied to
the visible head of the Jewish Church entering the sanctuary, as leading
the procession; typically it belongs to Him of whom the phrase became an
epithet ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); [Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 118:27</span></span>

showed us light--or favor ([Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md);
[Psa 97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011).md). With the sacrificial
victim brought bound to the altar is united the more spiritual offering
of praise ([Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md), [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md), expressed in the terms with
which the Psalm opened.
