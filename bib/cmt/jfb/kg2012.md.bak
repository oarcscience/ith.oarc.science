### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 12:2</span></span>

JEHOASH REIGNS WELL WHILE JEHOIADA LIVED. (2Ki. 12:1-18)

Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord--so far as
related to his outward actions and the policy of his government. But it
is evident from the sequel of his history that the rectitude of his
administration was owing more to the salutary influence of his preserver
and tutor, Jehoiada, than to the honest and sincere dictates of his own
mind.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 12:3</span></span>

But the high places were not taken away--The popular fondness for the
private and disorderly rites performed in the groves and recesses of
hills was so inveterate that even the most powerful monarchs had been
unable to accomplish their suppression; no wonder that in the early
reign of a young king, and after the gross irregularities that had been
allowed during the maladministration of Athaliah, the difficulty of
putting an end to the superstitions associated with "the high places"
was greatly increased.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 12:4</span></span>

Jehoash said to the priests, &c.--There is here given an account of the
measures which the young king took for repairing the temple by the
levying of taxes: 1. "The money of every one that passeth the account,"
namely, half a shekel, as "an offering to the Lord" ([Exo
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013).md). 2. "The money that every man
is set at," that is, the redemption price of every one who had devoted
himself or any thing belonging to him to the Lord, and the amount of
which was estimated according to certain rules ([Lev
27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#001).md). 3. Free will or voluntary
offerings made to the sanctuary. The first two were paid annually (see
[Ch2 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#005).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 12:7</span></span>

Why repair ye not the breaches of the house?--This mode of collection
not proving so productive as was expected (the dilatoriness of the
priests was the chief cause of the failure), a new arrangement was
proposed. A chest was placed by the high priest at the entrance into the
temple, into which the money given by the people for the repairs of the
temple was to be put by the Levites who kept the door. The object of
this chest was to make a separation between the money to be raised for
the building from the other moneys destined for the general use of the
priests, in the hope that the people would be more liberal in their
contributions when it was known that their offerings would be devoted to
the special purpose of making the necessary repairs. The duty of
attending to this work was no longer to devolve on the priests, but to
be undertaken by the king.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 12:11</span></span>

they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the
work--The king sent his secretary along with an agent of the high priest
to count the money in the chest from time to time ([Ch2
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#011).md), and deliver the amount to the
overseers of the building, who paid the workmen and purchased all
necessary materials. The custom of putting sums of certain amount in
bags, which are labelled and sealed by a proper officer, is a common way
of using the currency in Turkey and other Eastern countries.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 12:13</span></span>

Howbeit there were not made . . . bowls, &c.--When the repairs of the
temple had been completed, the surplus was appropriated to the purchase
of the temple furniture. The integrity of the overseers of the work
being undoubted, no account was exacted of the way in which they applied
the money given to them, while other moneys levied at the temple were
left to the disposal of the priests as the law directed ([Lev
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#016.md); [Num
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#008).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 12:17</span></span>

Then Hazael . . . fought against Gath--(See on [Ch2
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#023).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 12:20</span></span>

HE IS SLAIN. ([Kg2 12:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#019).md)

his servants arose . . . and slew Joash in the house of Millo--(See on
[Ch2 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#025).md).
