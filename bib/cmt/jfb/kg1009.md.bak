GOD'S COVENANT IN A SECOND VISION WITH SOLOMON. ([Kg1
9:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001).md)

And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
house--This first verse is connected with [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011.md), all that is contained between
[Kg1 9:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md) being parenthetical.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 9:2</span></span>

That--rather, "For."

the Lord appeared--This appearance was, like the former one at Gibeon,
most probably made in a supernatural vision, and on the night
immediately following the dedication of the temple ([Ch2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012).md). The strain of it corresponds to
this view, for it consists of direct answers to his solemn inaugural
prayer ([Kg1 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#003.md) is in answer to [Kg1
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md); [Kg1
9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#004.md) is in answer to [Kg1
8:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md); [Kg1
9:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006.md) to [Kg1
8:33-46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#033.md); see also [Deu
29:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#022).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 9:8</span></span>

this house, which is high--"high," either in point of situation, for it
was built on a hill, and therefore conspicuous to every beholder; or
"high" in respect to privilege, honor, and renown; or this "house of the
Most High," notwithstanding all its beauty and magnificence, shall be
destroyed, and remain in such a state of ruin and degradation as to be a
striking monument of the just judgment of God. The record of this second
vision, in which were rehearsed the conditions of God's covenant with
Solomon and the consequences of breaking them, is inserted here as a
proper introduction to the narrative about to be given of this king's
commercial enterprises and ambitious desire for worldly glory; for this
king, by encouraging an influx of foreign people and a taste for foreign
luxuries, rapidly corrupted his own mind and that of this subjects, so
that they turned from following God, they and their children ([Kg1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#006).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010.md)

THE MUTUAL PRESENTS OF SOLOMON AND HIRAM. ([Kg1
9:10-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#010).md)

at the end of twenty years--Seven and a half years were spent in
building the temple, and twelve and a half or thirteen in the erection
of his palace ([Kg1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md); [Ch2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001).md). This verse is only a
recapitulation of [Kg1 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md), necessary
to recover the thread of connection in the narrative.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 9:11</span></span>

Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee--According to
JOSEPHUS, they were situated on the northwest of it, adjacent to Tyre.
Though lying within the boundaries of the promised land ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Jos
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#004).md), they had never been conquered
till then, and were inhabited by Canaanite heathens ([Jdg
4:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md); [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). They were probably given to
Hiram, whose dominions were small, as a remuneration for his important
services in furnishing workmen, materials, and an immense quantity of
wrought gold ([Kg1 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#014).md) for the
temple and other buildings \[MICHAELIS\]. The gold, however, as others
think, may have been the amount of forfeits paid to Solomon by Hiram for
not being able to answer the riddles and apothegms, with which,
according to JOSEPHUS, in their private correspondence, the two
sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities,
probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to
his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some
other way; and, taking these cities into his own hands, he first
repaired their shattered walls, then filled them with a colony of
Hebrews ([Ch2 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg1 9:15</span></span>

this is the reason of the levy--A levy refers both to men and money, and
the necessity for Solomon making it arose from the many gigantic works
he undertook to erect.

Millo--part of the fort of Jerusalem on Mount Zion ([Sa2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#009.md); [Ch1
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#008).md), or a row of stone bastions
around Mount Zion, Millo being the great corner tower of that fortified
wall ([Kg1 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027.md); [Ch2
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#005).md).

the wall of Jerusalem--either repairing some breaches in it ([Kg1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#027).md), or extending it so as to
enclose Mount Zion.

Hazor--fortified on account of its importance as a town in the northern
boundary of the country.

Megiddo--(now Leijun)--Lying in the great caravan road between Egypt and
Damascus, it was the key to the north of Palestine by the western
lowlands, and therefore fortified.

Gezer--on the western confines of Ephraim, and, though a Levitical city,
occupied by the Canaanites. Having fallen by right of conquest to the
king of Egypt, who for some cause attacked it, it was given by him as a
dowry to his daughter, and fortified by Solomon.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 9:17</span></span>

Beth-horon the nether--situated on the way from Joppa to Jerusalem and
Gibeon; it required, from so public a road, to be strongly garrisoned.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 9:18</span></span>

Baalath--Baal-bek.

Tadmor--Palmyra, between Damascus and the Euphrates, was rebuilt and
fortified as a security against invasion from northern Asia. In
accomplishing these and various other works which were carried on
throughout the kingdom, especially in the north, where Rezon of
Damascus, his enemy, might prove dangerous, he employed vast numbers of
the Canaanites as galley slaves ([Ch2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018).md), treating them as prisoners of
war, who were compelled to do the drudgery and hard labor, while the
Israelites were only engaged in honorable employment.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 9:23</span></span>

These were the chief of the officers--(See on [Ch2
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 9:24</span></span>

SOLOMON'S YEARLY SACRIFICES. ([Kg1
9:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#024).md)

three times in a year--namely, at the passover, pentecost, and feast of
tabernacles ([Ch2 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#013.md); [Ch2
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#003).md). The circumstances mentioned in
these two verses form a proper conclusion to the record of his buildings
and show that his design in erecting those at Jerusalem was to remedy
defects existing at the commencement of his reign (see [Kg1
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 9:26</span></span>

Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth--These were neighboring ports at the
head of the eastern or Elanitic branch of the Red Sea. Tyrian ship
carpenters and sailors were sent there for Solomon's vessels (see on
[Ch2 8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017).md).

Ezion-geber--that is, "the giant's backbone"; so called from a reef of
rocks at the entrance of the harbor.

Eloth--Elim or Elath; that is, "the trees"; a grove of terebinths still
exists at the head of the gulf.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 9:28</span></span>

Ophir--a general name, like the East or West Indies with us, for all the
southern regions lying on the African, Arabian, or Indian seas, in so
far as at that time known \[HEEREN\].

gold, four hundred and twenty talents--(See on [Ch2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018).md). At 125 pounds Troy, or 1500
ounces to the talent, and about Â£4 to the ounce, this would make
Â£2,604,000.
