<p>
<p>Pharaoh--a common name of all the kings of Egypt, meaning "the sun"; or, as others say, a "crocodile," which was worshipped in parts of Egypt (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003">Eze 29:3</A>). Hophra or Apries was on the throne at this time. His reign began prosperously. He took Gaza (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001">Jer 47:1</A>) and Zidon and made himself master of Ph&Aring;&#147;nicia and Palestine, recovering much that was lost to Egypt by the victory of Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007">Kg2 24:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002">Jer 46:2</A>), in the fourth year of Jehoiakim [WILKINSON, Ancient Egypt, 1.169]. So proudly secure because of his successes for twenty-five years did he feel, that he said not even a god could deprive him of his kingdom [HERODOTUS, 2.169]. Hence the appropriateness of the description of him in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003">Eze 29:3</A>. No mere human sagacity could have enabled Ezekiel to foresee Egypt's downfall in the height of its prosperity. There are four divisions of these prophecies; the first in the tenth year of Ezekiel's captivity; the last in the twelfth. Between the first and second comes one of much later date, not having been given till the twenty-seventh year (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017">Eze 29:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019">Eze 30:19</A>), but placed there as appropriate to the subject matter. Pharaoh-hophra, or Apries, was dethroned and strangled, and Amasis substituted as king, by Nebuchadnezzar (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030">Jer 44:30</A>). The Egyptian priests, from national vanity, made no mention to HERODOTUS of the Egyptian loss of territory in Syria through Nebuchadnezzar, of which JOSEPHUS tells us, but attributed the change in the succession from Apries to Amasis solely to the Egyptian soldiery. The civil war between the two rivals no doubt lasted several years, affording an opportunity to Nebuchadnezzar of interfering and of elevating the usurper Amasis, on condition of his becoming tributary to Babylon [WILKINSON]. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010">Jer 43:10-12</A>, and see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013">Jer 43:13</A>, for another view of the grounds of interference of Nebuchadnezzar.

<p>
<p>lieth--restest proudly secure. 
<p>
<p>his rivers--the mouths, branches, and canals of the Nile, to which Egypt owed its fertility.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004">Ezekiel 29:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 29:4</A></FONT></span></p>hooks in thy jaws-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#029">Isa 37:29</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1-2</A>). Amasis was the "hook." In the Assyrian sculptures prisoners are represented with a hook in the underlip, and a cord from it held by the king. 
<p>
<p>cause . . . fish . . . stick unto . . . scales--Pharaoh, presuming on his power as if he were God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003">Eze 29:3</A>, "I have made it"), wished to stand in the stead of God as defender of the covenant-people, his motive being, not love to them, but rivalry with Babylon. He raised the siege of Jerusalem, but it was only for a time (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#006">Eze 29:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005">Jer 37:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007">Jer 37:7-10</A>); ruin overtook not only them, but himself. As the fish that clung to the horny scales of the crocodile, the lord of the Nile, when he was caught, shared his fate, so the adherents of Pharaoh, lord of Egypt, when he was overthrown by Amasis, should share his fate.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 29:5</A></FONT></span></p>wilderness--captivity beyond thy kingdom. The expression is used perhaps to imply retribution in kind. As Egypt pursued after Israel, saying, "The wilderness hath shut them in" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003">Exo 14:3</A>), so she herself shall be brought into a wilderness state. 
<p>
<p>open fields--literally "face of the field." 
<p>
<p>not be brought together--As the crocodile is not, when caught, restored to the river, so no remnant of thy routed army shall be brought together, and rallied, after its defeat in the wilderness. Pharaoh led an army against Cyrene in Africa, in support of Aricranes, who had been stripped of his kingdom by the Cyrenians. The army perished and Egypt rebelled against him [JUNIUS]. But the reference is mainly to the defeat by Nebuchadnezzar. 
<p>
<p>beasts . . . fowls--hostile and savage men.
<p>

Israel--alluding to the reeds on the banks of the Nile, which broke if one leaned upon them (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#004">Eze 29:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006">Isa 36:6</A>). All Israel's dependence on Egypt proved hurtful instead of beneficial (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001">Isa 30:1-5</A>).
<p>

<p>
<p>rend . . . shoulder--by the splinters on which the shoulder or arm would fall, on the support failing the hand. 
<p>
<p>madest . . . loins . . . at a stand--that is, made them to be disabled. MAURER somewhat similarly (referring to a kindred Arabic form), "Thou hast stricken both their loins." FAIRBAIRN, not so well, "Thou lettest all their loins stand," that is, by themselves, bereft of the support which they looked for from thee.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#008">Ezekiel 29:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 29:8</A></FONT></span></p>a sword--Nebuchadnezzar's army (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019">Eze 29:19</A>). Also Amasis and the Egyptian revolters who after Pharaoh-hophra's discomfiture in Cyrene dethroned and strangled him, having defeated him in a battle fought at Memphis [JUNIUS].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#009">Ezekiel 29:9</A></p>

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#010">Ezekiel 29:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">eze 29:10</A></FONT></span></p>from the tower of Syene--GROTIUS translates, "from Migdol (a fortress near Pelusium on the north of Suez) to Syene (in the farthest south)"; that is, from one end of Egypt to the other. So "from Migdol to Syene," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#006">Eze 30:6</A>, Margin. However, English Version rightly refers Syene to Seveneh, that is, Sebennytus, in the eastern delta of the Nile, the capital of the Lower Egyptian kings. The Sebennyte Pharaohs, with the help of the Canaanites, who, as shepherds or merchants, ranged the desert of Suez, extended their borders beyond the narrow province east of the delta, to which they had been confined by the Pharaohs of Upper Egypt. The defeated party, in derision, named the Sebennyte or Lower Egyptians foreigners and shepherd-kings (a shepherd being an abomination in Egypt, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#034">Gen 46:34</A>). They were really a native dynasty. Thus, in English Version, "Ethiopia" in the extreme south is rightly contrasted with Sebennytus or Syene in the north.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 29:11</A></FONT></span></p>forty years--answering to the forty years in which the Israelites, their former bondsmen, wandered in "the wilderness" (compare Note, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005">Eze 29:5</A>). JEROME remarks the number forty is one often connected with affliction and judgment. The rains of the flood in forty days brought destruction on the world. Moses, Elias, and the Saviour fasted forty days. The interval between Egypt's overthrow by Nebuchadnezzar and the deliverance by Cyrus, was about forty years. The ideal forty years' wilderness state of social and political degradation, rather than a literal non-passing of man or beast for that term, is mainly intended (so <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006">Eze 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002">Isa 19:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011">Isa 19:11</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">eze 29:12</A></FONT></span></p>As Israel passed through a term of wilderness discipline (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035">Eze 20:35</A>, &amp;c.), which was in its essential features to be repeated again, so it was to be with Egypt [FAIRBAIRN]. Some Egyptians were to be carried to Babylon, also many "scattered" in Arabia and Ethiopia through fear; but mainly the "scattering" was to be the dissipation of their power, even though the people still remained in their own land.

The oldest part of Egypt as to civilization and art. The Thebaid was anciently called "Egypt" [ARISTOTLE]. Therefore it is called the "land of the Egyptians' birth" (Margin, for "habitation"). 
<p>

<p>
<p>which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them--rather, "while they (the Israelites) look to (or, turn after) them" [HENDERSON]. Israel's looking to Egypt, rather than to God, causes their iniquity (unfaithfulness to the covenant) to be remembered by God.

Not that he actually failed in the siege (JEROME expressly states, from Assyrian histories, that Nebuchadnezzar succeeded); but, so much of the Tyrian resources had been exhausted, or transported to her colonies in ships, that little was left to compensate Nebuchadnezzar for his thirteen year's siege.

<p>Two distinct messages: (1) At <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#001">Eze 30:1-9</A>, a repetition of Eze. 29:1-16, with fuller details of lifelike distinctness. The date is probably not long after that mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017">Eze 29:17</A>, on the eve of Nebuchadnezzar's march against Egypt after subjugating Tyre. (2) A vision relating directly to Pharaoh and the overthrow of his kingdom; communicated at an earlier date, the seventh of the first month of the eleventh year. Not a year after the date in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#001">Eze 29:1</A>, and three months before the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.
