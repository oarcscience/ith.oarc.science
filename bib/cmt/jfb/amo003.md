Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Amos Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md)

[Amos 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 3:1</span></span>

GOD'S EXTRAORDINARY LOVE, BEING REPAID BY ISRAEL WITH INGRATITUDE, OF
NECESSITY CALLS FOR JUDGMENTS, WHICH THE PROPHETS ANNOUNCE, NOT AT
RANDOM, BUT BY GOD'S COMMISSION, WHICH THEY CANNOT BUT FULFIL. THE
OPPRESSION PREVALENT IN ISRAEL WILL BRING DOWN RUIN ON ALL SAVE A SMALL
REMNANT. ([Amo 3:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001).md)

children of Israel--not merely the ten tribes, but "the whole family
brought up from Egypt"; all the descendants of Jacob, including Judah
and Benjamin. Compare [Jer 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#003.md), and
[Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003.md), on "family" for the nation
However, as the prophecy following refers to the ten tribes, they must
be chiefly, if not solely, meant: they were the majority of the nation;
and so Amos concedes what they so often boasted, that they were the
elect people of God \[CALVIN\], but implies that this only heightens
their sins.

[Amos 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 3:2</span></span>

You only have I known--that is, acknowledged as My people, and treated
with peculiar favor ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020).md). Compare the use of "know," [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md); [Psa
144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003.md); [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md).

therefore I will punish--the greater the privileges, the heavier the
punishment for the abuse of them; for to the other offenses there is
added, in this case, ingratitude. When God's people do not glorify Him,
He glorifies Himself by punishing them.

[Amos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 3:3</span></span>

Here follow several questions of a parable-like kind, to awaken
conviction in the people.

Can two walk together, except they be agreed?--Can God's prophets be so
unanimous in prophesying against you, if God's Spirit were not joined
with them, or if their prophecies were false? The Israelites were "at
ease," not believing that God was with the prophets in their
denunciations of coming ruin to the nation ([Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003.md); compare [Kg1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018.md), [Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md), [Kg1
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md); [Jer
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002).md). This accords with [Amo
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md). So "I will be with thy mouth"
([Exo 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#012.md); [Jer
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md); [Mat
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020).md). If the prophets and God were
not agreed, the former could not predict the future as they do. In [Amo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012.md) He had said, the Israelites
forbade the prophets prophesying; therefore, in [Amo
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#003.md), [Amo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008.md), He asserts the agreement between
the prophets and God who spake by them against Israel \[ROSENMULLER\].
Rather, "I once walked with you" ([Lev
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012).md) as a Father and Husband ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014).md); but now your way and Mine are
utterly diverse; there can therefore be no fellowship between us such as
there was ([Amo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002).md); I will walk with
you only to "punish you"; as a "lion" walks with his "prey" ([Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004).md), as a bird-catcher with a bird
\[TARNOVIUS\]. The prophets, and all servants of God, can have no
fellowship with the ungodly ([Psa
119:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#063.md); [Co2
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016.md); [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011.md); [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004).md).

[Amos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 3:4</span></span>

The same idea as in [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md). Where
a corrupt nation is, there God's instruments of punishment are sure also
to be. The lion roars loudly only when he has prey in sight.

Will a young lion cry out . . . if he--the "lion," not the "young lion."

have taken nothing?--The young lion just weaned lies silent, until the
old lion brings the prey near; then the scent rouses him. So, the
prophet would not speak against Israel, if God did not reveal to him
Israel's sins as requiring punishment.

[Amos 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 3:5</span></span>

When a bird trying to fly upwards is made to fall upon the earth snare,
it is a plain proof that the snare is there; so, Israel, now that thou
art falling, infer thence, that it is in the snare of the divine
judgment that thou art entangled \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].

shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing--The
bird-catcher does not remove his snare off the ground till he has caught
some prey; so God will not withdraw the Assyrians, &c., the instruments
of punishment, until they have had the success against you which God
gives them. The foe corresponds to the "snare," suddenly springing from
the ground and enclosing the bird on the latter touching it; the Hebrew
is literally, "Shall the snare spring from the earth?" Israel entangled
in judgments answers to the bird "taken."

[Amos 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 3:6</span></span>

When the sound of alarm is trumpeted by the watchman in the city, the
people are sure to run to and fro in alarm (Hebrew, literally). Yet
Israel is not alarmed, though God threatens judgments.

shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?--This is
the explanation of the preceding similes: God is the Author of all the
calamities which come upon you, and which are foretold by His prophets.
The evil of sin is from ourselves; the evil of trouble is from God,
whoever be the instruments.

[Amos 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 3:7</span></span>

his secret--namely, His purpose hidden from all, until it is revealed to
His prophets (compare [Gen 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017).md). In
a wider sense, God's will is revealed to all who love God, which it is
not to the world ([Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md); [Joh
17:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025).md).

unto his servants--who being servants cannot but obey their Lord in
setting forth His purpose (namely, that of judgment against Israel)
([Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md); [Eze
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011).md). Therefore the fault which the
ungodly find with them is groundless ([Kg1
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017).md). It aggravates Israel's sin,
that God is not about to inflict judgment, without having fully warned
the people, if haply they might repent.

[Amos 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 3:8</span></span>

As when "the lion roars" (compare [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md); [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004).md), none can help but "fear," so
when Jehovah communicates His awful message, the prophet cannot but
prophesy. Find not fault with me for prophesying; I must obey God. In a
wider sense true of all believers ([Act
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md); [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029).md).

[Amos 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 3:9</span></span>

Publish in . . . palaces--as being places of greatest resort (compare
[Mat 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027).md); and also as it is the sin
of princes that he arraigns, he calls on princes (the occupants of the
"palaces") to be the witnesses.

Ashdod--put for all Philistia. Convene the Philistine and the Egyptian
magnates, from whom I have on various occasions rescued Israel. (The
opposite formula to "Tell it not in Gath," namely, lest the heathen
should glory over Israel). Even these idolaters, in looking on your
enormities, will condemn you; how much more will the holy God?

upon the mountains of Samaria--on the hills surrounding and commanding
the view of Samaria, the metropolis of the ten tribes, which was on a
lower hill ([Amo 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001.md); [Kg1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024).md). The mountains are to be the
tribunal on which the Philistines and Egyptians are to sit aloft to have
a view of your crimes, so as to testify to the justice of your
punishment ([Amo 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013).md).

tumults--caused by the violence of the princes of Israel in
"oppressions" of the poor ([Job 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009.md);
[Ecc 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#001).md).

[Amos 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 3:10</span></span>

know not to do--Their moral corruption blinds their power of discernment
so that they cannot do right ([Jer
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022).md). Not simple intellectual
ignorance; the defect lay in the heart and will.

store up violence and robbery--that is, treasures obtained by "violence
and robbery" ([Pro 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#002).md).

[Amos 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 3:11</span></span>

Translate, "An adversary (the abruptness produces a startling effect)!
and that too, from every side of the land." So in the fulfilment, [Kg2
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md) : "The king of Assyria
(Shalmaneser) came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria,
and besieged it three years."

bring down thy strength from thee--that is, bring thee down from thy
strength (the strength on which thou didst boast thyself): all thy
resources ([Pro 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#015).md).

palaces shall be spoiled--a just retribution in kind ([Amo
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#010).md). The palaces in which spoils of
robbery were stored up, "shall be spoiled."

[Amos 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 3:12</span></span>

shepherd--a pastoral image, appropriately used by Amos, a shepherd
himself.

piece of . . . ear--brought by the shepherd to the owner of the sheep,
so as not to have to pay for the loss ([Gen
31:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#039.md); [Exo
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#013).md). So if aught of Israel escapes,
it shall be a miracle of God's goodness. It shall be but a scanty
remnant. There is a kind of goat in the East the ears of which are a
foot long, and proportionally broad. Perhaps the reference is to this.
Compare on the image [Sa1 17:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md);
[Ti2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md).

that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed--that is, that live
luxuriously in Samaria (compare [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001.md), [Amo
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004).md). "A bed" means here the Oriental
divan, a raised part of the room covered with cushions.

in Damascus in a couch--Jeroboam II had lately restored Damascus to
Israel ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025.md), [Kg2
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#028).md). So the Israelites are
represented as not merely in "the corner of a bed," as in Samaria, but
"in a (whole) couch," at Damascus, living in luxurious ease. Of these,
now so luxurious, soon but a remnant shall be left by the foe. The
destruction of Damascus and that of Samaria shall be conjoined; as here
their luxurious lives, and subsequently under Pekah and Rezin their
inroads on Judah, were combined ([Isa
7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md); [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md), [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md); [Isa
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#003).md). The parallelism of "Samaria" to
"Damascus," and the Septuagint favor English Version rather than
GESENIUS: "on a damask couch." The Hebrew pointing, though generally
expressing damask, may express the city "Damascus"; and many manuscripts
point it so. Compare for Israel's overthrow, [Kg2
17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#005.md); [Kg2
18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009.md).

[Amos 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 3:13</span></span>

testify in the house, &c.--that is, against the house of Jacob. God
calls on the same persons as in [Amo
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#009.md), namely, the heathen Philistines
and the Egyptians to witness with their own eyes Samaria's corruptions
above described, so that none may be able to deny the justice of
Samaria's punishment \[MAURER\].

God of hosts--having all the powers of heaven and earth at His command,
and therefore One calculated to strike terror into the hearts of the
guilty whom He threatens.

[Amos 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 3:14</span></span>

That--rather, "since," or "for." This verse is not, as English Version
translates, the thing which the witnesses cited are to "testify" ([Amo
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#013).md), but the reason why God calls on
the heathen to witness Samaria's guilt; namely, in order to justify the
punishment which He declares He will inflict.

I will also visit . . . Beth-el--the golden calves which were the source
of all "the transgressions of Israel" ([Kg1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032.md); [Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md); [Kg2
23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#015).md), though Israel thought that
by them their transgressions were atoned for and God's favor secured.

horns of the altar--which used to be sprinkled with the blood of
victims. They were horn-like projecting points at the corners of ancient
altars. The singular, "altar," refers to the great altar erected by
Jeroboam to the calves. The "altars," plural, refer to the lesser ones
made in imitation of the great one ([Ch2
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#005.md), compare with [Kg1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002.md); [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001).md).

[Amos 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 3:15</span></span>

winter . . . summer house-- ([Jdg
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020.md); [Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022).md). Winter houses of the great
were in sheltered positions facing the south to get all possible
sunshine, summer houses in forests and on hills, facing the east and
north.

houses of ivory--having their walls, doors, and ceilings inlaid with
ivory. So Ahab's house ([Kg1 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#039.md);
[Psa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008).md).
