(Eze. 20:1-49)
<p>
<p>seventh year, &amp;c.--namely, from the carrying away of Jeconiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#002">Eze 1:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001">Eze 8:1</A>). This computation was calculated to make them cherish the more ardently the hope of the restoration promised them in seventy years; for, when prospects are hopeless, years are not computed [CALVIN]. 
<p>
<p>elders . . . came to inquire--The object of their inquiry, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#001">Eze 14:1</A>, is not stated; probably it was to ascertain the cause of the national calamities and the time of their termination, as their false prophets assured them of a speedy restoration.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003">Ezekiel 20:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">eze 20:3</A></FONT></span></p>The chapter falls into two great parts: Eze. 20:1-32, the recital of the people's rebellions during five distinct periods: in Egypt, the wilderness, on the borders of Canaan when a new generation arose, in Canaan, and in the time of the prophet. 
<p>
<p>I will not be inquired of by you--because their moral state precluded them from capability of knowing the will of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018">Psa 66:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009">Pro 28:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017">Joh 7:17</A>).

<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004">Ezekiel 20:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">eze 20:4</A></FONT></span></p>Wilt thou judge? . . . judge--The emphatical repetition expresses, "Wilt thou not judge? yes, judge them. There is a loud call for immediate judgment." The Hebrew interrogative here is a command, not a prohibition [MAURER]. Instead of spending time in teaching them, tell them of the abomination of their fathers, of which their own are the complement and counterpart, and which call for judgment.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#005">Ezekiel 20:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">eze 20:5</A></FONT></span></p>The thrice lifting up of God's hand (the sign of His oath, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#005">Rev 10:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#008">Exo 6:8</A>, Margin; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#030">Num 14:30</A>; to which passages the form of words here alludes) implies the solemn earnestness of God's purpose of grace to them. 
<p>
<p>made myself known unto them--proving Myself faithful and true by the actual fulfilment of My promises (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031">Exo 4:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003">Exo 6:3</A>); revealing Myself as "Jehovah," that is, not that the name was unknown before, but that then first the force of that name was manifested in the promises of God then being realized in performances.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#006">Ezekiel 20:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">eze 20:6</A></FONT></span></p>espied for them--as though God had spied out all other lands, and chose Canaan as the best of all lands (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007">Deu 8:7-8</A>). See <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#009">Dan 8:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#016">Dan 11:16</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041">Dan 11:41</A>, "the glorious land"; see Margin, "land of delight," or, ornament"; "the pleasant land," or "land of desire," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014">Zac 7:14</A>, Margin. 
<p>
<p>glory of all lands--that is, Canaan was "the beauty of all lands"; the most lovely and delightful land; "milk and honey" are not the antecedents to "which."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007">Ezekiel 20:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">eze 20:7</A></FONT></span></p>Moses gives no formal statement of idolatries practised by Israel in Egypt. But it is implied in their readiness to worship the golden calf (resembling the Egyptian ox, Apis) (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004">Exo 32:4</A>), which makes it likely they had worshipped such idols in Egypt. Also, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#007">Lev 17:7</A>, "They shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils (literally, seirim, 'he-goats,' the symbol of the false god, Pan), after whom they have gone awhoring." The call of God by Moses was as much to them to separate from idols and follow Jehovah, as it was to Pharaoh to let them go forth. <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006">Exo 6:6-7</A> and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014">Jos 24:14</A>, expressly mention their idolatry "in Egypt." Hence the need of their being removed out of the contagion of Egyptian idolatries by the exodus. 
<p>
<p>every man--so universal was the evil. 
<p>
<p>of his eyes--It was not fear of their Egyptian masters, but their own lust of the eye that drew them to idols (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009">Eze 6:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006">Eze 18:6</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">eze 20:8</A></FONT></span></p>then I said, I will . . . But, &amp;c.--that is, (God speaking in condescension to human modes of conception) their spiritual degradation deserved I should destroy them, "but I wrought (namely, the deliverance 'out of . . . Egypt') for My name's sake"; not for their merits (a rebuke to their national pride). God's "name" means the sum-total of His perfections. To manifest these, His gratuitous mercy abounding above their sins, yet without wrong to His justice, and so to set forth His glory, was and is the ultimate end of His dealings (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014">Eze 20:14</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022">Eze 20:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023">Sa2 7:23</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012">Isa 63:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017">Rom 9:17</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#011">Ezekiel 20:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">eze 20:11</A></FONT></span></p>which if a man do, he shall . . . five in them--not "by them," as though they could justify a man, seeing that man cannot render the faultless obedience required (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Lev 18:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012">Gal 3:12</A>). "By them" is the expression indeed in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005">Rom 10:5</A>; but there the design is to show that, if man could obey all God's laws, he would be justified "by them" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021">Gal 3:21</A>); but he cannot; he therefore needs to have justification by "the Lord our righteousness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006">Jer 23:6</A>); then, having thus received life, he "lives," that is, maintains, enjoys, and exercises this life only in so far as he walks "in" the laws of God. So <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015">Deu 30:15-16</A>. The Israelites, as a nation, had life already freely given to them by God's covenant of promise; the laws of God were designed to be the means of the outward expression of their spiritual life. As the natural life has its healthy manifestation in the full exercise of its powers, so their spiritual being as a nation was to be developed in vigor, or else decay, according as they did, or did not, walk in God's laws.

The Sabbath is specified as a sample of the whole law, to show that the law is not merely precepts, but privileges, of which the Sabbath is one of the highest. Not that the Sabbath was first instituted at Sinai, as if it were an exclusively Jewish ordinance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002">Gen 2:2-3</A>), but it was then more formally enacted, when, owing to the apostasy of the world from the original revelation, one people was called out (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#015">Deu 5:15</A>) to be the covenant-people of God. 
<p>
<p>sanctify them--The observance of the Sabbath contemplated by God was not a mere outward rest, but a spiritual dedication of the day to the glory of God and the good of man. Otherwise it would not be, as it is made, the pledge of universal sanctification (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#013">Exo 31:13-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013">Isa 58:13-14</A>). Virtually it is said, all sanctity will flourish or decay, according as this ordinance is observed in its full spirituality or not.

<p>

The "kindness of Israel's youth and love of her espousals in the wilderness" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002">Jer 2:2-3</A>) were only comparative (the corruption in later times being more general), and confined to the minority; as a whole, Israel at no time fully served God. The "children" it was that fell into the fearful apostasy on the plains of Moab at the close of the wilderness sojourn (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001">Num 25:1-2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027">Deu 31:27</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">eze 20:25</A></FONT></span></p>I gave them . . . statutes . . . not good--Since they would not follow My statutes that were good, "I gave them" their own (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#018">Eze 20:18</A>) and their fathers' "which were not good"; statutes spiritually corrupting, and, finally, as the consequence, destroying them. Righteous retribution (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012">Psa 81:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011">Hos 8:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024">Rom 1:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011">Th2 2:11</A>). <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039">Eze 20:39</A> proves this view to be correct (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017">Isa 63:17</A>). Thus on the plains of Moab (Num. 25:1-18), in chastisement for the secret unfaithfulness to God in their hearts, He permitted Baal's worshippers to tempt them to idolatry (the ready success of the tempters, moreover, proving the inward unsoundness of the tempted); and this again ended necessarily in punitive judgments.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">eze 20:26</A></FONT></span></p>I polluted them--not directly; "but I judicially gave them up to pollute themselves." A just retribution for their "polluting My sabbaths" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#024">Eze 20:24</A>). This <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026">Eze 20:26</A> is explanatory of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025">Eze 20:25</A>. Their own sin I made their punishment. 
<p>
<p>caused to pass through the fire--FAIRBAIRN translates, "In their presenting (literally, 'the causing to pass over') all their first-born," namely, to the Lord; referring to the command (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#012">Exo 13:12</A>, Margin, where the very same expression is used). The lustration of children by passing through the fire was a later abomination (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031">Eze 20:31</A>). The evil here spoken of was the admixture of heathenish practices with Jehovah's worship, which made Him regard all as "polluted." Here, "to the Lord" is omitted purposely, to imply, "They kept up the outward service indeed, but I did not own it as done unto Me, since it was mingled with such pollutions." But English Version is supported by the similar phraseology in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031">Eze 20:31</A>, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#031">Eze 20:31</A>. They made all their children pass through the fire; but he names the first-born, in aggravation of their guilt; that is, "I had willed that the first-born should be redeemed as being Mine, but they imposed on themselves the cruel rites of offering them to Molech" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010">Deu 18:10</A>).

For My altar is not so called. What excellence do ye see in it, that ye go there, rather than to My temple, the only lawful place of sacrificing? The very name, "high place," convicts you of sinning, not from ignorance but perverse rebellion. 
<p>
<p>is called . . . unto this day--whereas this name ought to have been long since laid aside, along with the custom of sacrificing on high places which it represents, being borrowed from the heathen, who so called their places of sacrifice (the Greeks, for instance, called them by a cognate term, Bomoi), whereas I call mine Mizbeaach, "altar." The very name implies the place is not that sanctioned by Me, and therefore your sacrifices even to ME there (much more those you offer to idols) are only a "provocation" to Me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#028">Eze 20:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#001">Deu 12:1-5</A>).

The reason, however, for the omission of "the fire" in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#026">Eze 20:26</A> is, perhaps, that there it is implied the children only "passed through the fire" for purification, whereas here they are actually burnt to death before the idol; and therefore "the fire" is specified in the latter, not in the former case (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027">Kg2 3:27</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">eze 20:32</A></FONT></span></p>We will be as the heathen--and so escape the odium to which we are exposed, of having a peculiar God and law of our own. "We shall live on better terms with them by having a similar worship. Besides, we get from God nothing but threats and calamities, whereas the heathen, Chaldeans, &amp;c., get riches and power from their idols." How literally God's words here ("that . . . shall not be at all") are fulfilled in the modern Jews! Though the Jews seemed so likely (had Ezekiel spoken as an uninspired man) to have blended with the rest of mankind and laid aside their distinctive peculiarities, as was their wish at that time, yet they have remained for eighteen centuries dispersed among all nations and without a home, but still distinct: a standing witness for the truth of the prophecy given so long ago.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">eze 20:33</A></FONT></span></p>Here begins the second division of the prophecy. Lest the covenant people should abandon their distinctive hopes and amalgamate with the surrounding heathen, He tells them that, as the wilderness journey from Egypt was made subservient to discipline and also to the taking from among them the rebellious, so a severe discipline (such as the Jews are now for long actually undergoing) should be administered to them during the next exodus for the same purpose (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#038">Eze 20:38</A>), and so to prepare them for the restored possession of their land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014">Hos 2:14-15</A>). This was only partially fulfilled before, and at the return from Babylon: its full and final accomplishment is future. 
<p>
<p>with a mighty hand, . . . will I rule over you--I will assert My right over you in spite of your resistance (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#032">Eze 20:32</A>), as a master would in the case of his slave, and I will not let you be wrested from Me, because of My regard to My covenant.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_034">eze 20:34</A></FONT></span></p>The Jews in exile might think themselves set free from the "rule" of God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#033">Eze 20:33</A>); therefore, He intimates, He will reassert His right over them by chastening judgments, and these, with an ultimate view, not to destroy, but to restore them. 
<p>
<p>people--rather, "peoples."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035">Ezekiel 20:35</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_035">eze 20:35</A></FONT></span></p>wilderness of the people--rather, "peoples," the various peoples among whom they were to be scattered, and about whom God saith (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034">Eze 20:34</A>), "I will bring you out." In contrast to the literal "wilderness of Egypt" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#036">Eze 20:36</A>), "the wilderness of the peoples" is their spiritual wilderness period of trial, discipline, and purification while exiled among the nations. As the state when they are "brought into the wilderness of the peoples" and that when they were among the peoples "from" which God was to "bring them out" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034">Eze 20:34</A>) are distinguished, the wilderness state probably answers partially to the transition period of discipline from the first decree for their restoration by Cyrus to the time of their complete settlement in their land, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. But the full and final fulfilment is future; the wilderness state will comprise not only the transition period of their restoration, but the beginning of their occupancy of Palestine, a time in which they shall endure the sorest of all their chastisements, to "purge out the rebels" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#038">Eze 20:38</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan 12:1</A>); and then the remnant (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008">Zac 13:8-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2-3</A>) shall "all serve God in the land" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040">Eze 20:40</A>). Thus the wilderness period does not denote locality, but their state intervening between their rejection and future restoration. 
<p>
<p>plead--bring the matter in debate between us to an issue. Image is from a plaintiff in a law court meeting the defendant "face to face." Appropriate, as God in His dealings acts not arbitrarily, but in most righteous justice (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009">Jer 2:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002">Mic 6:2</A>).

Though God saved them out of Egypt, He afterwards destroyed in the wilderness them that believed not (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005">Jde 1:5</A>); so, though He brought the exiles out of Babylon, yet their wilderness state of chastening discipline continued even after they were again in Canaan.

<p>purge out--or, "separate." Hebrew, barothi, forming a designed alliteration with "berith," the covenant; not a promise of grace, but a threat against those Jews who thought they could in exile escape the observation and "rule" of God. 
<p>
<p>land of Israel--Though brought out of the country of their sojourn or exile (Babylon formerly, and the various lands of their exile hereafter) into the literal land of Palestine, even it shall be to them an exile state, "they shall not enter into the land of Israel," that is, the spiritual state of restored favor of God to His covenant people, ,which shall only be given to the remnant to be saved (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008">Zac 13:8-9</A>).
