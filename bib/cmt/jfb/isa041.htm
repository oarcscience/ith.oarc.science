(Isa. 41:1-29)
<p>
<p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013">Zac 2:13</A>). God is about to argue the case; therefore let the nations listen in reverential silence. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016">Gen 28:16-17</A>, as to the spirit in which we ought to behave before God. 
<p>
<p>before me--rather (turning), "towards me" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>islands--including all regions beyond sea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022">Jer 25:22</A>), maritime regions, not merely isles in the strict sense. 
<p>
<p>renew . . . strength--Let them gather their strength for the argument; let them adduce their strongest arguments (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018">Isa 1:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032">Job 9:32</A>). "Judgment" means here, to decide the point at issue between us.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002">Isaiah 41:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">isa 41:2</A></FONT></span></p>Who--else but God? The fact that God "raiseth up" Cyrus and qualifies him for becoming the conqueror of the nations and deliverer of God's people, is a strong argument why they should trust in Him. The future is here prophetically represented as present or past. 
<p>
<p>the righteous man--Cyrus; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001">Isa 45:1-4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013">Isa 45:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011">Isa 46:11</A>, "from the East," prove. Called "righteous," not so much on account of his own equity [HERODOTUS, 3.89], as because he fulfilled God's righteous will in restoring the Jews from their unjust captivity. Raised him up in righteousness. The Septuagint takes the Hebrew as a noun "righteousness." MAURER translates, "Who raised up him whom salvation (national and temporal, the gift of God's 'righteousness' to the good, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017">Isa 32:17</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008">Isa 45:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005">Isa 51:5</A>) meets at his foot" (that is, wherever he goes). Cyrus is said to come from the East, because Persia is east of Babylon; but in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025">Isa 41:25</A>, from the north, in reference to Media. At the same time the full sense of righteousness, or righteous, and of the whole passage, is realized only in Messiah, Cyrus' antitype (Cyrus knew not God, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004">Isa 45:4</A>). He goes forth as the Universal Conqueror of the "nations," in righteousness making war (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008">Psa 2:8-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011">Rev 19:11-15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002">Rev 6:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026">Rev 2:26-27</A>). "The idols He shall utterly abolish" (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023">Isa 7:23</A>, with <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018">Isa 2:18</A>). Righteousness was always raised up from the East. Paradise was east of Eden. The cherubim were at the east of the garden. Abraham was called from the East. Judea, the birthplace of Messiah, was in the East. 
<p>
<p>called . . . to . . . foot--called him to attend His (God's) steps, that is, follow His guidance. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002">Ezr 1:2</A>, Cyrus acknowledges Jehovah as the Giver of his victories. He subdued the nations from the Euxine to the Red Sea, and even Egypt (says XENOPHON). 
<p>
<p>dust-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013">Isa 17:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005">Isa 29:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042">Psa 18:42</A>). Persia, Cyrus' country, was famed for the use of the "bow" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006">Isa 22:6</A>). "Before him" means "gave them into his power" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012">Jos 10:12</A>). MAURER translates, "Gave his (the enemy's) sword to be dust, and his (the enemy's) bow to be as stubble" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026">Job 41:26</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#029">Job 41:29</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">isa 41:3</A></FONT></span></p>Cyrus had not visited the regions of the Euphrates and westward until he visited them for conquest. So the gospel conquests penetrated regions where the name of God was unknown before.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004">Isaiah 41:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">isa 41:4</A></FONT></span></p>Who--else but God? 
<p>
<p>calling . . . generations from . . . beginning--The origin and position of all nations are from God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008">Deu 32:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026">Act 17:26</A>); what is true of Cyrus and his conquests is true of all the movements of history from the first; all are from God. 
<p>
<p>with the last--that is, the last (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006">Isa 44:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012">Isa 48:12</A>).

<p>
<p>drew near, and came--together, for mutual defense.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#006">Isaiah 41:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">isa 41:6</A></FONT></span></p>Be of good courage--Be not alarmed because of Cyrus, but make new images to secure the favor of the gods against him.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007">Isaiah 41:7</A></p>

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008">Isaiah 41:8</A></p>

<p>
<p>servant--so termed as being chosen by God to worship Him themselves, and to lead other peoples to do the same (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004">Isa 45:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>Jacob . . . chosen-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004">Psa 135:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>my friend--literally, "loving me."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">isa 41:9</A></FONT></span></p>Abraham, the father of the Jews, taken from the remote Ur of the Chaldees.

<p>
<p>from the chief men--literally, "the elbows"; so the joints; hence the root which joins the tree to the earth; figuratively, those of ancient and noble stock. But the parallel clause "ends of the earth" favors GESENIUS, who translates, "the extremities of the earth"; so JEROME.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010">Isaiah 41:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">isa 41:10</A></FONT></span></p>be not dismayed--literally, anxiously to look at one another in dismay.

<p>right hand of my righteousness--that is, My right hand prepared in accordance with My righteousness (faithfulness to My promises) to uphold thee.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">isa 41:11</A></FONT></span></p>ashamed--put to the shame of defeat (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017">Isa 54:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</A>).

<p>
<p>thing of naught--shall utterly perish.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">isa 41:14</A></FONT></span></p>worm--in a state of contempt and affliction, whom all loathe and tread on, the very expression which Messiah, on the cross, applies to Himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006">Psa 22:6</A>), so completely are the Lord and His people identified and assimilated. God's people are as 'worms' in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, or of the serpent's seed." [HENRY]. 
<p>
<p>men--The parallelism requires the word "men" here to have associated with it the idea of fewness or feebleness. LOWTH translates, "Ye mortals of Israel." The Septuagint, "altogether diminutive." MAURER supports English Version, which the Hebrew text best accord with. 
<p>
<p>the Lord--in general. 
<p>
<p>and thy redeemer--in particular; a still stronger reason why He should "help" them.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015">Isaiah 41:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">isa 41:15</A></FONT></span></p>God will make Israel to destroy their enemies as the Eastern corn-drag (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027">Isa 28:27-28</A>) bruises out the grain with its teeth, and gives the chaff to the winds to scatter. 
<p>
<p>teeth--serrated, so as to cut up the straw for fodder and separate the grain from the chaff. 
<p>
<p>mountains . . . hills--kingdoms more or less powerful that were hostile to Israel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#014">Isa 2:14</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">isa 41:17</A></FONT></span></p>poor and needy--primarily, the exiles in Babylon. 
<p>
<p>water--figuratively, refreshment, prosperity after their affliction. The language is so constructed as only very partially to apply to the local and temporary event of the restoration from Babylon; but fully to be realized in the waters of life and of the Spirit, under the Gospel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025">Isa 30:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003">Isa 44:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">Joh 7:37-39</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014">Joh 4:14</A>). God wrought no miracles that we read of, in any wilderness, during the return from Babylon. 
<p>
<p>faileth--rather, "is rigid" or parched [HORSLEY].

"High places . . . valleys" spiritually express that in all circumstances, whether elevated or depressed, God's people will have refreshment for their souls, however little to be expected it might seem.

<p>
<p>shittah--rather, the "acacia," or Egyptian thorn, from which the gum Arabic is obtained [LOWTH]. 
<p>
<p>oil tree--the olive. 
<p>
<p>fir tree--rather, the "cypress": grateful by its shade. 
<p>
<p>pine--GESENIUS translates, "the holm." 
<p>
<p>box tree--not the shrub used for bordering flower beds, but [GESENIUS] a kind of cedar, remarkable for the smallness of its cones, and the upward direction of its branches.
<p>

<p>former things . . . the latter end of them--show what former predictions the idols have given, that we may compare the event ("latter end") with them; or give new prophecies ("declare things to come") (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009">Isa 42:9</A>), [MAURER]. BARNES explains it more reconditely, "Let them foretell the entire series of events, showing, in their order, the things which shall first occur, as well as those which shall finally happen"; the false prophets tried to predict isolated events, having no mutual dependency; not a long series of events mutually and orderly connected, and stretching far into futurity. They did not even try to do this. None but God can do it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010">Isa 46:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007">Isa 44:7-8</A>). "Or . . . things to come" will, in this view, mean, Let them, if they cannot predict the series, even predict plainly any detached events.

<p>that we may be dismayed, and behold it together--MAURER translates, "That we (Jehovah and the idols) may look one another in the face (that is, encounter one another, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008">Kg2 14:8</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011">Kg2 14:11</A>), and see" our respective powers by a trial. HORSLEY translates, "Then the moment we behold, we shall be dismayed." "We" thus, and in English Version, refers to Jehovah and His worshippers.

<p>He is righteous--rather, "It is true"; it was a true prophecy, as the event shows. "He is righteous," in English Version, must be interpreted, The fulfilment of the idol's words proves that he is faithful.

The clause, "Behold . . . them" (the wished-for event is now present) is inserted in the middle of the sentence as a detached exclamation, by an elegant transposition, the language being framed abruptly, as one would speak in putting vividly as it were, before the eyes of others, some joyous event which he had just learned [LUDOVICUS DE DIEU] (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009">Isa 40:9</A>). None of the idols had foretold these events. Jehovah was the "first" to do so (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004">Isa 41:4</A>).

<p>God's description of His character (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001">Isa 42:1-4</A>). God addresses Him directly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005">Isa 42:5-7</A>). Address to the people to attend to the subject (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008">Isa 42:8-9</A>). Call to all, and especially the exile Jews to rejoice in the coming deliverance (Isa. 42:10-25).
