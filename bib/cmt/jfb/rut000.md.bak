RUTH is properly a supplement to the preceding book, to which, in fact,
it was appended in the ancient Jewish canon. Although it relates an
episode belonging to the time of the Judges, its precise date is
unknown. It appears certain, however, that it could not have been
written prior to the time of Samuel (see [Rut
4:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#017).md), who is generally supposed to
have been its author; and this opinion, in addition to other reasons on
which it rests, is confirmed by [Rut
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#007.md), where it is evident that the
history was not compiled till long after the transactions recorded. The
inspiration and canonical authority of the book is attested by the fact
of Ruth's name being inserted by Matthew in the Saviour's genealogy
\[[Mat 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005.md)\].
