### [Matthew Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 15:1</span></span>

DISCOURSE ON CEREMONIAL POLLUTION. ( = [Mar
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md), [Mar
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#023)). (Mat. 15:1-20.md)

Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem--or
"from Jerusalem." Mark ([Mar 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001).md) says
they "came from" it: a deputation probably sent from the capital
expressly to watch Him. As He had not come to them at the last Passover,
which they had reckoned on, they now come to Him. "And," says Mark ([Mar
7:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002).md), "when they saw some of His
disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen
hands"--hands not ceremonially cleansed by washing--"they found fault.
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
oft"--literally, "in" or "with the fist"; that is, probably washing the
one hand by the use of the other--though some understand it, with our
version, in the sense of "diligently," "sedulously"--"eat not, holding
the tradition of the elders"; acting religiously according to the custom
handed down to them. "And when they come from the market" ([Mar
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#004).md) --"And after market": after any
common business, or attending a court of justice, where the Jews, as
WEBSTER and WILKINSON remark, after their subjection to the Romans, were
especially exposed to intercourse and contact with heathens--"except
they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have
received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots, brazen vessels and
tables"--rather, "couches," such as were used at meals, which probably
were merely sprinkled for ceremonial purposes. "Then the Pharisees and
scribes asked Him,"

saying--as follows:

[Matthew 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 15:2</span></span>

Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they
wash not their hands when they eat bread.

[Matthew 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 15:3</span></span>

But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
commandment of God by your tradition?--The charge is retorted with
startling power: "The tradition they transgress is but man's, and is
itself the occasion of heavy transgression, undermining the authority of
God's law."

[Matthew 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 15:4</span></span>

For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother-- ([Deu
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016).md).

and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death-- ([Exo
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#017).md).

[Matthew 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 15:5</span></span>

But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a
gift--or simply, "A gift!" In Mark ([Mar
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011).md), it is, "Corban!" that is, "An
oblation!" meaning, any unbloody offering or gift dedicated to sacred
uses.

by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

[Matthew 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 15:6</span></span>

And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free--that is, It
is true, father--mother--that by giving to thee this, which I now
present, thou mightest be profited by me; but I have gifted it to pious
uses, and therefore, at whatever cost to thee, I am not now at liberty
to alienate any portion of it. "And," it is added in Mark ([Mar
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#012).md), "ye suffer him no more to do
aught for his father or his mother." To dedicate property to God is
indeed lawful and laudable, but not at the expense of filial duty.

Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect--cancelled or
nullified it "by your tradition."

[Matthew 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 15:7</span></span>

Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying-- ([Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013).md).

[Matthew 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 15:8</span></span>

This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, &c.--By putting the
commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements, their whole
worship was rendered vain--a principle of deep moment in the service of
God. "For," it is added in [Mar 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008.md),
"laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as
the washing of pots and cups; and many other such like things ye do."
The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here
pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of "the
commandment of God"; and when our Lord says, "Many other such like
things ye do," it is implied that He had but given a specimen of the
hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping
disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the
ecclesiastics of that day.

[Matthew 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 15:10</span></span>

And he called the multitude, and said unto them--The foregoing dialogue,
though in the people's hearing, was between Jesus and the pharisaic
cavillers, whose object was to disparage Him with the people. But Jesus,
having put them down, turns to the multitude, who at this time were
prepared to drink in everything He said, and with admirable plainness,
strength, and brevity, lays down the great principle of real pollution,
by which a world of bondage and uneasiness of conscience would be
dissipated in a moment, and the sense of sin be reserved for deviations
from the holy and eternal law of God.

Hear and understand:

[Matthew 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 15:11</span></span>

Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man--This is expressed even
more emphatically in Mark ([Mar
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#015).md), and it is there added, "If
any man have ears to hear, let him hear." As in [Mat
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#009.md), this so oft-repeated saying
seems designed to call attention to the fundamental and universal
character of the truth it refers to.

[Matthew 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 15:12</span></span>

Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the
Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?--They had given
vent to their irritation, and perhaps threats, not to our Lord Himself,
from whom they seem to have slunk away, but to some of the disciples,
who report it to their Master.

[Matthew 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 15:13</span></span>

But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not
planted, shall be rooted up--They are offended, are they? Heed it not:
their corrupt teaching is already doomed: the garden of the Lord upon
earth, too long cumbered with their presence, shall yet be purged of
them and their accursed system: yea, and whatsoever is not of the
planting of My heavenly Father, the great Husbandman ([Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001).md), shall share the same fate.

[Matthew 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 15:14</span></span>

Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch--Striking expression of
the ruinous effects of erroneous teaching!

[Matthew 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 15:15</span></span>

Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
parable--"when He was entered into the house from the people," says Mark
([Mar 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#017).md).

[Matthew 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 15:16</span></span>

And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?--Slowness of
spiritual apprehension in His genuine disciples grieves the Saviour:
from others He expects no better ([Mat
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#011).md).

[Matthew 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mat 15:17</span></span>

Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth,
&c.--Familiar though these sayings have now become, what freedom from
bondage to outward things do they proclaim, on the one hand; and on the
other, how searching is the truth which they express--that nothing which
enters from without can really defile us; and that only the evil that is
in the heart, that is allowed to stir there, to rise up in thought and
affection, and to flow forth in voluntary action, really defiles a man!

[Matthew 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 15:19</span></span>

For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts--"evil reasonings"; referring
here more immediately to those corrupt reasonings which had stealthily
introduced and gradually reared up that hideous fabric of tradition
which at length practically nullified the unchangeable principles of the
moral law. But the statement is far broader than this; namely that the
first shape which the evil that is in the heart takes, when it begins
actively to stir, is that of "considerations" or "reasonings" on certain
suggested actions.

murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
blasphemies--detractions, whether directed against God or man; here the
reference seems to be to the latter. Mark ([Mar
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#022).md) adds, "covetousnesses"--or
desires after more; "wickednesses"--here meaning, perhaps, malignities
of various forms; "deceit, lasciviousness"--meaning, excess or enormity
of any kind, though by later writers restricted to lewdness; "an evil
eye"--meaning, all looks or glances of envy, jealousy, or ill will
towards a neighbor; "pride, foolishness"--in the Old Testament sense of
"folly"; that is, criminal senselessness, the folly of the heart. How
appalling is this black catalogue!

[Matthew 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 15:20</span></span>

These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands
defileth not a man--Thus does our Lord sum up this whole searching
discourse.

[Matthew 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 15:23</span></span>

THE WOMAN OF CANAAN AND HER DAUGHTER. ([Mat
15:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).md)

But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him,
saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us--(Also see on [Mar
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026)..md)

[Matthew 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 15:24</span></span>

But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel--(Also see on [Mar
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026)..md)

[Matthew 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 15:25</span></span>

Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me--(Also see on
[Mar 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026)..md)
