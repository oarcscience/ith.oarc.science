### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 10:2</span></span>

DAVID'S MESSENGERS, SENT TO COMFORT HANUN, ARE DISGRACEFULLY TREATED.
([Sa2 10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#001).md)

Then said David, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as
his father showed kindness unto me--It is probable that this was the
Nahash against whom Saul waged war at Jabesh-gilead ([Sa1
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#011).md). David, on leaving Gath, where
his life was exposed to danger, found an asylum with the king of Moab;
and as Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was his nearest neighbor, it may
be that during the feud between Saul and David, he, through enmity to
the former, was kind and hospitable to David.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 10:3</span></span>

the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun--Their suspicion
was not warranted either by any overt act or by any cherished design of
David: it must have originated in their knowledge of the denunciations
of God's law against them ([Deu
23:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003).md), and of David's policy in
steadfastly adhering to it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 10:4</span></span>

Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their
beards--From the long flowing dress of the Hebrews and other Orientals,
the curtailment of their garments must have given them an aspect of
gross indelicacy and ludicrousness. Besides, a knowledge of the
extraordinary respect and value which has always been attached, and the
gross insult that is implied in any indignity offered, to the beard in
the East, will account for the shame which the deputies felt, and the
determined spirit of revenge which burst out in all Israel on learning
the outrage. Two instances are related in the modern history of Persia,
of similar insults by kings of haughty and imperious temper, involving
the nation in war; and we need not, therefore, be surprised that David
vowed revenge for this wanton and public outrage.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#005.md)

Tarry at Jericho--or in the neighborhood, after crossing the fords of
the Jordan.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md)

THE AMMONITES OVERCOME. ([Sa2 10:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006).md)

when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David--To chastise
those insolent and inhospitable Ammonites, who had violated the common
law of nations, David sent a large army under the command of Joab, while
they, informed of the impending attack, made energetic preparations to
repel it by engaging the services of an immense number of Syrian
mercenaries.

Beth-rehob--the capital of the low-lying region between Lebanon and
Anti-Lebanon.

Zoba--(see on [Sa2 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).md).

of king Maacah--His territories lay on the other side of Jordan, near
Gilead ([Deu 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014).md).

Ish-tob--that is, "the men of Tob"--the place of Jephthah's marauding
adventures (see also [Ch1 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md); [Psa
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001), title.md). As the Israelite
soldiers poured into the Ammonite territory, that people met them at the
frontier town of Medeba ([Ch1 19:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007).md),
the native troops covering the city, while the Syrian mercenaries lay at
some distance encamped in the fields. In making the attack, Joab divided
his forces into two separate detachments--the one of which, under the
command of his brother, Abishai, was to concentrate its attack upon the
city, while he himself marched against the overwhelming host of
mercenary auxiliaries. It was a just and necessary war that had been
forced on Israel, and they could hope for the blessing of God upon their
arms. With great judgment the battle opened against the mercenaries, who
could not stand against the furious onset of Joab, and not feeling the
cause their own, consulted their safety by flight. The Ammonites, who
had placed their chief dependence upon a foreign aid, then retreated to
entrench themselves within the walls of the town.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 10:14</span></span>

So Joab returned and came to Jerusalem--Probably the season was too far
advanced for entering on a siege.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 10:16</span></span>

THE SYRIANS DEFEATED. ([Sa2 10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015).md)

Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the
river--This prince had enjoyed a breathing time after his defeat ([Sa2
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#003).md). But alarmed at the increasing
power and greatness of David, as well as being an ally of the Ammonites,
he levied a vast army not only in Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade
the Hebrew kingdom. Shobach, his general, in pursuance of this design,
had marched his troops as far as Kelam, a border town of eastern
Manasseh, when David, crossing the Jordan by forced marches, suddenly
surprised, defeated, and dispersed them. As a result of this great and
decisive victory, all the petty kingdoms of Syria submitted and became
his tributaries (see on [Ch1 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001).md).
