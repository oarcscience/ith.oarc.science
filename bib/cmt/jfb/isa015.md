### [Isaiah Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 15:1</span></span>

THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CHAPTERS FORM ONE PROPHECY ON MOAB. ([Isa
15:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md)

Because--rather, "Surely"; literally, "(I affirm) that" \[MAURER\].

night--the time best suited for a hostile incursion ([Isa
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004.md); [Jer
39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004).md).

Ar--meaning in Hebrew, "the city"; the metropolis of Moab, on the south
of the river Arnon.

Kir--literally, "a citadel"; not far from Ar, towards the south.

He--Moab personified.

Bajith--rather, "to the temple" \[MAURER\]; answering to the "sanctuary"
([Isa 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012).md), in a similar context.

to Dibon--Rather, as Dibon was in a plain north of the Arnon, "Dibon (is
gone up) to the high places," the usual places of sacrifice in the East.
Same town as Dimon ([Isa 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009).md).

to weep--at the sudden calamity.

over Nebo--rather "in Nebo"; not "on account of" Nebo (compare [Isa
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003).md) \[MAURER\]. The town Nebo was
adjacent to the mountain, not far from the northern shore of the Dead
Sea. There it was that Chemosh, the idol of Moab, was worshipped
(compare [Deu 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001).md).

Medeba--south of Heshbon, on a hill east of Jordan.

baldness . . . beard cut off--The Orientals regarded the beard with
peculiar veneration. To cut one's beard off is the greatest mark of
sorrow and mortification (compare [Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037).md).

[Isaiah 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 15:3</span></span>

tops of . . . houses--flat; places of resort for prayer, &c., in the
East ([Act 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009).md).

weeping abundantly--"melting away in tears." HORSLEY prefers "descending
to weep." Thus there is a "parallelism by alternate construction"
\[LOWTH\], or chiasmus; "howl" refers to "tops of houses." "Descending
to weep" to "streets" or squares, whither they descend from the
housetops.

[Isaiah 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 15:4</span></span>

Heshbon--an Amorite city, twenty miles east of Jordan; taken by Moab
after the carrying away of Israel (compare Jer. 48:1-47).

Elealeh--near Heshbon, in Reuben.

Jahaz--east of Jordan, in Reuben. Near it Moses defeated Sihon.

therefore--because of the sudden overthrow of their cities. Even the
armed men, instead of fighting in defense of their land, shall join in
the general cry.

life, &c.--rather, "his soul is grieved" ([Sa1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008).md) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 15:5</span></span>

My--The prophet himself is moved with pity for Moab. Ministers, in
denouncing the wrath of God against sinners, should do it with tender
sorrow, not with exultation.

fugitives--fleeing from Moab, wander as far as to Zoar, on the extreme
boundary south of the Dead Sea. HORSLEY translates, "her nobility," or
"rulers" ([Hos 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018).md).

heifer, &c.--that is, raising their voices "like a heifer" (compare [Jer
48:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#034.md), [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036).md). The expression "three years
old," implies one at its full vigor ([Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009).md), as yet not brought under the
yoke; as Moab heretofore unsubdued, but now about to be broken. So [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md); [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md). MAURER translates, "Eglath" (in
English Version, "a heifer") Shelishijah (that is, the third, to
distinguish it from two others of the same name).

by the mounting up--up the ascent.

Luhith--a mountain in Moab.

Horonaim--a town of Moab not far from Zoar ([Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005).md). It means "the two poles," being
near caves.

cry of destruction--a cry appropriate to the destruction which visits
their country.

[Isaiah 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 15:6</span></span>

For--the cause of their flight southwards ([Kg2
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#019.md), [Kg2
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#025).md). "For" the northern regions and
even the city Nimrim (the very name of which means "limpid waters," in
Gilead near Jordan) are without water or herbage.

[Isaiah 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 15:7</span></span>

Therefore--because of the devastation of the land.

abundance--literally, "that which is over and above" the necessaries of
life.

brook of . . . willows--The fugitives flee from Nimrim, where the waters
have failed, to places better watered. Margin has "valley of Arabians";
that is, to the valley on the boundary between them and
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a; now Wady-el Arabah. "Arabia" means a "desert."

[Isaiah 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 15:8</span></span>

Eglaim-- ([Eze 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010).md), En-eglaim. Not
the Agalum of EUSEBIUS, eight miles from Areopolis towards the south;
the context requires a town on the very borders of Moab or beyond them.

Beer-elim--literally, "the well of the Princes"--(so [Num
21:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#016).md). Beyond the east borders of
Moab.

[Isaiah 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 15:9</span></span>

Dimon--same as Dibon ([Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md). Its
waters are the Arnon.

full of blood--The slain of Moab shall be so many.

bring more--fresh calamities, namely, the "lions" afterwards mentioned
([Kg2 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025.md); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003).md). VITRINGA understands
Nebuchadnezzar as meant by "the lion"; but it is plural, "lions." The
"more," or in Hebrew, "additions," he explains of the addition made to
the waters of Dimon by the streams of blood of the slain.
