### [Acts Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001)

[Acts 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 24:1</span></span>

PAUL, ACCUSED BY A PROFESSIONAL PLEADER BEFORE FELIX, MAKES HIS DEFENSE,
AND IS REMANDED FOR A FURTHER HEARING. AT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW FELIX
TREMBLES UNDER PAUL'S PREACHING, BUT KEEPS HIM PRISONER FOR TWO YEARS,
WHEN HE WAS SUCCEEDED BY FESTUS. (Acts 24:1-27)

after five days--or, on the fifth day from their departure from
Jerusalem.

Ananias . . . with the elders--a deputation of the Sanhedrim.

a certain orator--one of those Roman advocates who trained themselves
for the higher practice of the metropolis by practicing in the
provinces, where the Latin language, employed in the courts, was but
imperfectly understood and Roman forms were not familiar.

informed . . . against Paul--"laid information," that is, put in the
charges.

[Acts 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 24:2</span></span>

Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, &c.--In this fulsome
flattery there was a semblance of truth: nothing more. Felix acted with
a degree of vigor and success in suppressing lawless violence
\[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 20.8.4; confirmed by TACITUS, Annals, 12.54\].

by thy providence--a phrase applied to the administration of the
emperors.

[Acts 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 24:5</span></span>

a pestilent fellow--a plague, or pest.

and a mover of sedition among all the Jews--by exciting disturbances
among them.

throughout the world--(See on [Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001)). This was the first charge; and
true only in the sense explained on [Act
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020).

a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes--the second charge; and true
enough.

[Acts 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 24:6</span></span>

hath gone about--attempted.

to profane the temple--the third charge; and entirely false.

we . . . would have judged according to our law.

[Acts 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 24:7</span></span>

But . . . Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him out of
our hands--a wilful falsehood and calumnious charge against a public
officer. He had commanded the Sanhedrim to meet for no other purpose
than to "judge him according to their law"; and only when, instead of
doing so, they fell to disputing among themselves, and the prisoner was
in danger of being "pulled in pieces of them" ([Act
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010)) --or as his own letter says
"killed of them" ([Act 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#027)) --did he
rescue him, as was his duty, "by force" out of their hands.

[Acts 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 24:8</span></span>

Commanding his accusers to come unto thee--Here they insinuate that,
instead of troubling Felix with the case, he ought to have left it to be
dealt with by the Jewish tribunal; in which case his life would soon
have been taken.

by examining whom--Lysias, as would seem ([Act
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022)).

thyself mayest, &c.--referring all, as if with confidence, to Felix.

[Acts 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 24:9</span></span>

the Jews assented, &c.--See on [Act
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#015).

[Acts 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 24:10</span></span>

thou hast been many years a judge to this nation--He had been in this
province for six or seven years, and in Galilee for a longer period.
Paul uses no flattery, but simply expresses his satisfaction at having
to plead before one whose long official experience of Jewish matters
would enable him the better to understand and appreciate what he had to
say.

[Acts 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 24:11</span></span>

thou mayest understand--canst easily learn.

that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem--namely,
1. The day of his arrival in Jerusalem ([Act
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015)); 2. The interview with James
([Act 21:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018)); 3. The assumption of
the vow ([Act 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026)); 4, 5, 6.
Continuance of the vow, interrupted by the arrest ([Act
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027), &c.); 7. Arrest of Paul ([Act
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027)); 8. Paul before the Sanhedrim
([Act 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030); [Act
23:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001)); 9. Conspiracy of the Jews
and defeat of it ([Act 23:12-24](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#012)), and
despatch of Paul from Jerusalem on the evening of the same day ([Act
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#023), [Act
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031)); 10, 11, 12, 13. The remaining
period referred to ([Act 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001))
\[MEYER\]. This short period is mentioned to show how unlikely it was
that he should have had time to do what was charged against him.

for to worship--a very different purpose from that imputed to him.

[Acts 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 24:12</span></span>

they neither found me . . . Neither can they prove the things,
&c.--After specifying several particulars, he challenges proof of any
one of the charges brought against him. So much for the charge of
sedition.

[Acts 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 24:14</span></span>

But this I confess to thee--in which Felix would see no crime.

that after the way they call heresy--literally, and better, "a sect."

so worship I the God of my fathers--the ancestral God. Two arguments are
contained here: (1) Our nation is divided into what they call sects--the
sect of the Pharisees, and that of the Sadducees--all the difference
between them and me is, that I belong to neither of these, but to
another sect, or religious section of the nation, which from its Head
they call Nazarenes: for this reason, and this alone, am I hated. (2)
The Roman law allows every nation to worship its own deities; I claim
protection under that law, worshipping the God of my ancestors, even as
they, only of a different sect of the common religion.

believing all, &c.--Here, disowning all opinions at variance with the
Old Testament Scriptures, he challenges for the Gospel which he preached
the authority of the God of their fathers. So much for the charge of
heresy.

[Acts 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 24:15</span></span>

And have hope . . . as they themselves . . . allow, that there shall be
a resurrection, &c.--This appeal to the faith of his accusers shows that
they were chiefly of the Pharisees, and that the favor of that party, to
which he owed in some measure his safety at the recent council ([Act
23:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006)), had been quite momentary.

[Acts 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 24:16</span></span>

And herein--On this account, accordingly; that is, looking forward to
that awful day (compare [Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010)).

I exercise myself--The "I" here is emphatic; "Whatever they do, this is
my study."

to have always a conscience void of offence, &c.--See [Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012); [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017), &c.; that is, "These are the
great principles of my life and conduct--how different from turbulence
and sectarianism!"

[Acts 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 24:17</span></span>

Now after many--several

years absence from Jerusalem--I came to bring alms to my of Macedonia
and Greece, which he had taken such pains to gather. This only allusion
in the Acts to what is dwelt upon so frequently in his own Epistles
([Rom 15:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025); [Co1
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001); [Co2
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)), throws a beautiful light on
the truth of this History. (See PALEY'S HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;).

and offerings--connected with his Jewish vow: see [Act
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018).

[Acts 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 24:18</span></span>

found me purified in the temple--not polluting it, therefore, by my own
presence, and neither gathering a crowd nor raising a stir: If then
these Asiatic Jews have any charge to bring against me in justification
of their arrest of me, why are they not here to substantiate it?

[Acts 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 24:20</span></span>

Or else let these . . . here say--"Or, passing from all that preceded my
trial, let those of the Sanhedrim here present say if I was guilty of
aught there." No doubt his hasty speech to the high priest might occur
to them, but the provocation to it on his own part was more than they
would be willing to recall.

[Acts 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 24:21</span></span>

Except . . . this one voice . . . Touching the resurrection, &c.--This
would recall to the Pharisees present their own inconsistency, in
befriending him then and now accusing him.

[Acts 24:22](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 24:22</span></span>

having more perfect knowledge of that--"the"

way--(See on [Act 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023); and [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014)).

When Lysias . . . shall come . . . I will how, &c.--Felix might have
dismissed the case as a tissue of unsupported charges. But if from his
interest in the matter he really wished to have the presence of Lysias
and others involved, a brief delay was not unworthy of him as a judge.
Certainly, so far as recorded, neither Lysias nor any other parties
appeared again in the case. [Act
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#023), however, seems to show that at
that time his prepossessions in favor of Paul were strong.

[Acts 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 24:24</span></span>

Felix . . . with his wife Drusilla . . . a Jewess--This beautiful but
infamous woman was the third daughter of Herod Agrippa I, who was eaten
of worms (see on [Act 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001)), and a
sister of Agrippa II, before whom Paul pleaded, [Act
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001), &c. She was "given in marriage
to Azizus, king of the Emesenes, who had consented to be circumcised for
the sake of the alliance. But this marriage was soon dissolved, after
this manner: When Festus was procurator of Judea, he saw her, and being
captivated with her beauty, persuaded her to desert her husband,
transgress the laws of her country, and marry himself" \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 20.7.1,2\]. Such was this "wife" of Felix.

he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in
Christ--Perceiving from what he had heard on the trial that the new sect
which was creating such a stir was represented by its own advocates as
but a particular development of the Jewish faith, he probably wished to
gratify the curiosity of his Jewish wife, as well as his own, by a more
particular account of it from this distinguished champion. And no doubt
Paul would so far humor this desire as to present to them the great
leading features of the Gospel. But from [Act
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025) it is evident that his discourse
took an entirely practical turn, suited to the life which his two
auditors were notoriously leading.

[Acts 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 24:25</span></span>

And as he reasoned of righteousness--with reference to the public
character of Felix.

temperance--with reference to his immoral life.

and judgment to come--when he would be called to an awful account for
both.

Felix trembled--and no wonder. For, on the testimony of TACITUS, the
Roman Annalist \[Annals, 9; 12.54\], he ruled with a mixture of cruelty,
lust, and servility, and relying on the influence of his brother Pallas
at court, he thought himself at liberty to commit every sort of crime
with impunity. How noble the fidelity and courage which dared to treat
of such topics in such a presence, and what withering power must have
been in those appeals which made even a Felix to tremble!

Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season I will
call for thee--Alas for Felix! This was his golden opportunity,
but--like multitudes still--he missed it. Convenient seasons in
abundance he found to call for Paul, but never again to "hear him
concerning the faith in Christ," and writhe under the terrors of the
wrath to come. Even in those moments of terror he had no thought of
submission to the Cross or a change of life. The Word discerned the
thoughts and intents of his heart, but that heart even then clung to its
idols; even as Herod, who "did many things and heard John gladly," but
in his best moments was enslaved to his lusts. How many Felixes have
appeared from age to age!

[Acts 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 24:26</span></span>

He hoped . . . that money should have been given him . . . wherefore he
sent for him the oftener, and communed with him--Bribery in a judge was
punishable by the Roman law, but the spirit of a slave (to use the words
of TACITUS) was in all his acts, and his communing with Paul"--as if he
cared for either him or his message--simply added hypocrisy to meanness.
The position in life of Paul's Christian visitors might beget the hope
of extracting something from them for the release of their champion; but
the apostle would rather lie in prison than stoop to this!

[Acts 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 24:27</span></span>

after two years--What a trial to this burning missionary of Christ, to
suffer such a tedious period of inaction! How mysterious it would seem!
But this repose would be medicine to his spirit; he would not, and could
not, be entirely inactive, so long as he was able by pen and message to
communicate with the churches; and he would doubtless learn the salutary
truth that even he was not essential to his Master's cause. That Luke
wrote his Gospel during this period, under the apostle's
superintendence, is the not unlikely conjecture of able critics.

Porcius Festus--Little is known of him. He died a few years after this
\[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 20.8.9-9.1\].

came into Felix' room--He was recalled, on accusations against him by
the Jews of CÃ&brvbr;sarea, and only acquitted through the intercession
of his brother at court \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 20.8,10\].

Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure--"to earn the thanks of the
Jews," which he did not.

left Paul bound-- ([Act 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029)) --which
does not seem to have been till then.
