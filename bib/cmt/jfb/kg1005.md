[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001)

HIRAM SENDS TO CONGRATULATE SOLOMON. ([Kg1
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001))

Hiram . . . sent his servants unto Solomon--the grandson of David's
contemporary \[KITTO\]; or the same Hiram \[WINER and others\]. The
friendly relations which the king of Tyre had cultivated with David are
here seen renewed with his son and successor, by a message of condolence
as well as of congratulation on his accession to the throne of Israel.
The alliance between the two nations had been mutually beneficial by the
encouragement of useful traffic. Israel, being agricultural, furnished
corn and oil, while the Tyrians, who were a commercial people, gave in
exchange their PhÅ“nician manufactures, as well as the produce of
foreign lands. A special treaty was now entered into in furtherance of
that undertaking which was the great work of Solomon's splendid and
peaceful reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006)

command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon--Nowhere else
could Solomon have procured materials for the woodwork of his
contemplated building. The forests of Lebanon, adjoining the seas in
Solomon's time, belonged to the PhÅ“nicians, and the timber being a
lucrative branch of their exports, immense numbers of workmen were
constantly employed in the felling of trees as well as the
transportation and preparation of the wood. Hiram stipulated to furnish
Solomon with as large a quantity of cedars and cypresses as he might
require and it was a great additional obligation that he engaged to
render the important service of having it brought down, probably by the
Dog river, to the seaside, and conveyed along the coast in floats; that
is, the logs being bound together, to the harbor of Joppa ([Ch2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#016)), whence they could easily find
the means of transport to Jerusalem.

my servants shall be with thy servants--The operations were to be on so
extensive a scale that the Tyrians alone would be insufficient. A
division of labor was necessary, and while the former would do the work
that required skilful artisans, Solomon engaged to supply the laborers.

FURNISHES TIMBER TO BUILD THE TEMPLE. ([Kg1
5:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007))

Blessed be the Lord--This language is no decisive evidence that Hiram
was a worshipper of the true God, as he might use it only on the
polytheistic principle of acknowledging Jehovah as the God of the
Hebrews (see on [Ch2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 5:8</span></span>

Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things . . . and I
will do--The contract was drawn out formally in a written document ([Ch2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011)), which, according to JOSEPHUS,
was preserved both in the Jewish and Tyrian records.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#010)

fir trees--rather, the cypress.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 5:11</span></span>

food to his household--This was an annual supply for the palace,
different from that mentioned in [Ch2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010), which was for the workmen in the
forests.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013)

SOLOMON'S WORKMEN AND LABORERS. ([Kg1
5:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013))

Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel--The renewed notice of Solomon's
divine gift of wisdom ([Kg1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#012)) is
evidently introduced to prepare for this record of the strong but
prudent measures he took towards the accomplishment of his work. So
great a stretch of arbitrary power as is implied in this compulsory levy
would have raised great discontent, if not opposition, had not his wise
arrangement of letting the laborers remain at home two months out of
three, added to the sacredness of the work, reconciled the people to
this forced labor. The carrying of burdens and the irksome work of
excavating the quarries was assigned to the remnant of the Canaanites
([Kg1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#020); [Ch2
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007)) and war prisoners made by
David--amounting to 153,600. The employment of persons of that condition
in Eastern countries for carrying on any public work, would make this
part of the arrangements the less thought of.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017)

brought great stones--The stone of Lebanon is "hard, calcareous, whitish
and sonorous, like free stone" \[SHAW\]. The same white and beautiful
stone can be obtained in every part of Syria and Palestine.

hewed stones--or neatly polished, as the Hebrew word signifies ([Exo
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025)). Both Jewish and Tyrian
builders were employed in hewing these great stones.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 5:18</span></span>

and the stone squarers--The Margin, which renders it "the Giblites"
([Jos 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005)), has long been considered
a preferable translation. This marginal translation also must yield to
another which has lately been proposed, by a slight change in the Hebrew
text, and which would be rendered thus: "Solomon's builders, and Hiram's
builders, did hew them and bevel them" \[THENIUS\]. These great bevelled
or grooved stones, measuring some twenty, others thirty feet in length,
and from five to six feet in breadth, are still seen in the
substructures about the ancient site of the temple; and, in the judgment
of the most competent observers, were those originally employed "to lay
the foundation of the house."
