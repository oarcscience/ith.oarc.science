The AUTHENTICITY of this Epistle is attested by IRENÃ†US \[Against
Heresies, 5.6.1\], quoting [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023);
CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA \[The Instructor, 1.88\], quoting [Th1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007); TERTULLIAN \[On the Resurrection
of the Flesh, 24\], quoting [Th1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001);

Celsus, 3\].

The OBJECT OF THE EPISTLE.--Thessalonica was at this time capital of the
Roman second district of Macedonia \[LIVY, Histories, 45.29\]. It lay on
the bay of Therme, and has always been, and still is, under its modern
name Saloniki, a place of considerable commerce. After his imprisonment
and scourging at Philippi, Paul ([Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002)) passed on to Thessalonica; and in
company with Silas ([Act 17:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001)) and
Timotheus ([Act 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003); [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014), compare with [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001); [Th1
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001); [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001)) founded the Church there. The
Jews, as a body, rejected the Gospel when preached for three successive
sabbaths ([Act 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002)); but some few
"believed and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout (that is,
proselytes to Judaism) Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women
not a few." The believers received the word joyfully, notwithstanding
trials and persecutions ([Th1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006);
[Th1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013)) from their own countrymen
and from the Jews ([Th1 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014)). His
stay at Thessalonica was doubtless not limited to the three weeks in
which were the three sabbaths specified in [Act
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002); for his laboring there with his
hands for his support ([Th1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008)), his receiving supplies there
more than once from Philippi ([Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016)), his making many converts from
the Gentiles ([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009); and as two
oldest manuscripts read, [Act 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004),
"of the devout and of the Greeks a great multitude," [Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004)), and his appointing
ministers--all imply a longer residence. Probably as at Pisidian Antioch
([Act 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)), at Corinth ([Act
18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006)), and at Ephesus ([Act
19:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008)), having preached the Gospel to
the Jews, when they rejected it, he turned to the Gentiles. He probably
thenceforth held the Christian meetings in the house of Jason ([Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)), perhaps "the kinsman" of Paul
mentioned in [Rom 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021). His great
subject of teaching to them seems to have been the coming and kingdom of
Christ, as we may infer from [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010); [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012), [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019); [Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013); [Th1
4:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013); [Th1
5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001), [Th1
5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); and that they should walk
worthy of it ([Th1 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012); [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001)). And it is an undesigned
coincidence between the two Epistles and [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005), [Act
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#009), that the very charge which the
assailants of Jason's house brought against him and other brethren was,
"These do contrary to the decrees of CÃ&brvbr;sar, saying that there is
another king, one Jesus." As in the case of the Lord Jesus Himself ([Joh
18:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033); [Joh
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012); compare [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)), they perverted the doctrine of
the coming kingdom of Christ into a ground for the charge of treason
against CÃ&brvbr;sar. The result was, Paul and Silas were obliged to
flee under the cover of night to Berea; Timothy had probably preceded
him ([Act 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010), [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014)). But the Church had been
planted, and ministers appointed; nay, more, they virtually became
missionaries themselves for which they possessed facilities in the
extensive commerce of their city, and both by word and example were
extending the Gospel in Macedonia, Achaia, and elsewhere ([Th1
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#007)). From Berea, also. Paul, after
having planted a Scripture-loving Church, was obliged to flee by the
Thessalonian Jews who followed him thither. Timothy (who seems to have
come to Berea separately from Paul and Silas, compare [Act
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010), with [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014)) and Silas remained there still,
when Paul proceeded by sea to Athens. While there he more than once
longed to visit the Thessalonians again, and see personally their
spiritual state, and "perfect that which was lacking in their faith"
([Th1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010)); but (probably using the
Thessalonian Jews as his instruments, [Joh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027)) "Satan hindered" him ([Th1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018); compare [Act
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013)). He therefore sent Timotheus,
who seems to have followed him to Athens from Berea ([Act
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)), immediately on his arrival to
Thessalonica ([Th1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)); glad as he
would have been of Timothy's help in the midst of the cavils of Athenian
opponents, he felt he must forego that help for the sake of the
Thessalonian Church. Silas does not seem to have come to Paul at Athens
at all, though Paul had desired him and Timothy to "come to him with all
speed" ([Act 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)); but seems with
Timothy (who from Thessalonica called for him at Berea) to have joined
Paul at Corinth first; compare [Act
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001), [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005), "When Silas and Timothy were
come from Macedonia." The Epistle makes no mention of Silas at Athens,
as it does of Timothy ([Th1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)).

Timothy's account of the Thessalonian Church was highly favorable. They
abounded in faith and charity and reciprocated his desire to see them
([Th1 3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)). Still, as nothing human
on earth is perfect, there were some defects. Some had too exclusively
dwelt on the doctrine of Christ's coming kingdom, so as to neglect the
sober-minded discharge of present duties ([Th1
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011)). Some who had lost relatives
by death, needed comfort and instruction in their doubts as to whether
they who died before Christ's coming would have a share with those found
alive in His kingdom then to be revealed. Moreover, also, there had been
committed among them sins against chastity and sobriety ([Th1
5:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005)), as also against charity ([Th1
4:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#003); [Th1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013), [Th1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015)). There were, too, symptoms in
some of want of respectful love and subordination to their ministers;
others treated slightingly the manifestations of the Spirit in those
possessing His gifts ([Th1 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)). To
give spiritual admonition on these subjects, and at the same time
commend what deserved commendation, and to testify his love to them, was
the object of the Epistle.

The PLACE OF WRITING IT was doubtless Corinth, where Timothy and Silas
rejoined him ([Act 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)) soon after he
arrived there (compare [Th1 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)) in
the autumn of A.D. 52.

The TIME OF WRITING was evidently immediately after having received from
Timothy the tidings of their state ([Th1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)) in the winter of A.D. 52, or
early in 53. For it was written not long after the conversion of the
Thessalonians ([Th1 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008)), while Paul
could speak of himself as only taken from them for a short season ([Th1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)). Thus this Epistle was first in
date of all Paul's extant Epistles. The Epistle is written in the joint
names of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, the three founders of the
Thessalonian Church. The plural first person "we," is used everywhere,
except in [Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018); [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005); [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027). "We" is the true reading, [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013). The English Version "I," in [Th1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#009) [Th1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001), [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023), is not supported by the original
\[EDMUNDS\].

The STYLE is calm and equable, in accordance with the subject matter,
which deals only with Christian duties in general, taking for granted
the great doctrinal truths which were not as yet disputed. There was no
deadly error as yet to call forth his more vehement bursts of feeling
and impassioned argument. The earlier Epistles, as we should expect, are
moral and practical. It was not until Judaistic and legalizing errors
arose at a later period that he wrote those Epistles (for example,
Romans and Galatians) which unfold the cardinal doctrines of grace and
justification by faith. Still, later the Epistles from his Roman prison
confirm the same truths. And last of all, the Pastoral Epistles are
suited to the more developed ecclesiastical constitution of the Church,
and give directions as to bishops and deacons, and correct abuses and
errors of later growth.

The prevalence of the Gentile element in this Church is shown by the
fact that these two Epistles are among the very few of Paul's writings
in which no quotation occurs from the Old Testament.
