### [Jeremiah Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 42:2</span></span>

THE JEWS AND JOHANAN INQUIRE OF GOD, THROUGH JEREMIAH, AS TO GOING TO
EGYPT, PROMISING OBEDIENCE TO HIS WILL. THEIR SAFETY ON CONDITION OF
STAYING IN JUDEA, AND THEIR DESTRUCTION IN THE EVENT OF GOING TO EGYPT,
ARE FORETOLD. THEM HYPOCRISY IN ASKING FOR COUNSEL WHICH THEY MEANT NOT
TO FOLLOW, IF CONTRARY TO THEIR OWN DETERMINATION, IS REPROVED. (Jer.
42:1-22)

Jeremiah--He probably was one of the number carried off from Mizpah, and
dwelt with Johanan ([Jer 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#016).md). Hence
the expression is, "came near" ([Jer
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#001).md), not "sent."

Let . . . supplication be accepted--literally, "fall" (see on [Jer
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md); [Jer
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020).md).

pray for us-- ([Gen 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md); [Isa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#004.md); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016).md).

thy God-- ([Jer 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005).md). The Jews use
this form to express their belief in the peculiar relation in which
Jeremiah stood to God as His accredited prophet. Jeremiah in his reply
reminds them that God is their God ("your God") as well as his as being
the covenant people ([Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004).md). They
in turn acknowledge this in [Jer 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006.md),
"the Lord our God."

few of many--as had been foretold ([Lev
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 42:3</span></span>

They consulted God, like many, not so much to know what was right, as
wishing Him to authorize what they had already determined on, whether
agreeable to His will or not. So Ahab in consulting Micaiah ([Kg1
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#013).md). Compare Jeremiah's answer
([Jer 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004).md) with Micaiah's ([Kg1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 42:4</span></span>

I have heard--that is, I accede to your request.

your God--Being His by adoption, ye are not your own, and are bound to
whatever He wills ([Exo 19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Co1
6:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md).

answer you--that is, through me.

keep nothing back-- ([Sa1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#018.md); [Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 42:5</span></span>

Lord be a true . . . witness-- ([Gen
31:50](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#050.md); [Psa
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 42:6</span></span>

evil--not moral evil, which God cannot command ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md), but what may be disagreeable
and hard to us. Piety obeys God, without questioning, at all costs. See
the instance defective in this, that it obeyed only so far as was
agreeable to itself ([Sa1 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003.md), [Sa1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009.md), [Sa1
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#013.md), [Sa1
15:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 42:7</span></span>

ten days--Jeremiah did not speak of himself, but waited God's time and
revelation, showing the reality of his inspiration. Man left to himself
would have given an immediate response to the people, who were impatient
of delay. The delay was designed to test the sincerity of their
professed willingness to obey, and that they should have full time to
deliberate ([Deu 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#002).md). True obedience
bows to God's time, as well as His way and will.

[Jeremiah 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 42:10</span></span>

If ye . . . abide--namely, under the Babylonian authority, to which God
hath appointed that all should be subject ([Dan
2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037).md). To resist was to resist God.

build . . . plant--metaphor for, I will firmly establish you ([Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006).md).

I repent . . . of the evil-- ([Jer
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#008.md); [Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036).md). I am satisfied with the
punishment I have inflicted on you, if only you add not a new offense
\[GROTIUS\]. God is said to "repent," when He alters His outward ways of
dealing.

[Jeremiah 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 42:12</span></span>

show mercies--rather, I will excite (in him) feelings of mercy towards
you \[CALVIN\].

cause you to return--permit you to return to the peaceable enjoyment of
the possessions from which you are wishing to withdraw through fear of
the Chaldeans. By departing in disobedience they should incur the very
evils they wished thereby to escape; and by staying they should gain the
blessings which they feared to lose by doing so.

[Jeremiah 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 42:13</span></span>

if ye say, &c.--avowed rebellion against God, who had often ([Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016).md), as now, forbidden their going
to Egypt, lest they should be entangled in its idolatry.

[Jeremiah 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 42:14</span></span>

where we shall see no war--Here they betray their impiety in not
believing God's promise ([Jer
42:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010).md), as if He were a liar ([Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 42:15</span></span>

wholly set your faces--firmly resolve ([Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051).md) in spite of all warnings ([Jer
44:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 42:16</span></span>

sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you--The very evils we think to
escape by sin, we bring on ourselves thereby. What our hearts are most
set on often proves fatal to us. Those who think to escape troubles by
changing their place will find them wherever they go ([Eze
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#008).md). The "sword" here is that of
Nebuchadnezzar, who fulfilled the prediction in his expedition to Africa
(according to MEGASTHENES, a heathen writer),300 B.C.

[Jeremiah 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 42:17</span></span>

all the men--excepting the "small number" mentioned ([Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md), [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028).md); namely, those who were forced
into Egypt against their will, Jeremiah, Baruch, &c., and those who took
Jeremiah's advice and fled from Egypt before the arrival of the
Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 42:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 42:18</span></span>

As mine anger, &c.--As ye have already, to your sorrow, found Me true to
My word, so shall ye again ([Jer 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md);
[Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016).md).

shall see this place no more--Ye shall not return to Judea, as those
shall who have been removed to Babylon.

[Jeremiah 42:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 42:19</span></span>

I have admonished--literally, "testified," that is, solemnly admonished,
having yourselves as My witnesses; so that if ye perish, ye yourselves
will have to confess that it was through your own fault, not through
ignorance, ye perished.

[Jeremiah 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 42:20</span></span>

dissembled in your hearts--rather, "ye have used deceit against your
(own) souls." It is not God, but yourselves, whom ye deceive, to your
own ruin, by your own dissimulation ([Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md) \[CALVIN\]. But the words
following accord best with English Version, ye have dissembled in your
hearts (see on [Jer 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#003).md) towards me,
when ye sent me to consult God for you.

[Jeremiah 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 42:21</span></span>

declared it--namely, the divine will.

I . . . but ye--antithesis. I have done my part; but ye do not yours. It
is no fault of mine that ye act not rightly.

[Jeremiah 42:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 42:22</span></span>

sojourn--for a time, until they could return to their country. They
expected, therefore, to be restored, in spite of God's prediction to the
contrary.
