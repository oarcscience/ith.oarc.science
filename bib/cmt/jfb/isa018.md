### [Isaiah Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001)

[Isaiah 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 18:1</span></span>

([Isa 18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001))

Woe--The heading in English Version, "God will destroy the Ethiopians,"
is a mistake arising from the wrong rendering "Woe," whereas the Hebrew
does not express a threat, but is an appeal calling attention ([Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001); [Zac
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006)): "Ho." He is not speaking against
but to the Ethiopians, calling on them to hear his prophetical
announcement as to the destruction of their enemies.

shadowing with wings--rather, "land of the winged bark"; that is, "barks
with wing-like sails, answering to vessels of bulrushes" in [Isa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002); the word "rivers," in the
parallelism, also favors it; so the Septuagint and Chaldee \[EWALD\].
"Land of the clanging sound of wings," that is, armies, as in [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008); the rendering "bark," or "ship,"
is rather dubious \[MAURER\]. The armies referred to are those of
Tirhakah, advancing to meet the Assyrians ([Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)). In English Version, "shadowing"
means protecting--stretching out its wings to defend a feeble people,
namely, the Hebrews \[VITRINGA\]. The Hebrew for "wings" is the same as
for the idol Cneph, which was represented in temple sculptures with
wings ([Psa 91:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#004)).

beyond--Meroe, the island between the "rivers" Nile and Astaboras is
meant, famed for its commerce, and perhaps the seat of the Ethiopian
government, hence addressed here as representing the whole empire:
remains of temples are still found, and the name of "Tirhakah" in the
inscriptions. This island region was probably the chief part of Queen
Candace's kingdom ([Act 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)). For
"beyond" others translate less literally "which borderest on."

Ethiopia--literally, "Cush." HORSLEY is probably right that the ultimate
and fullest reference of the prophecy is to the restoration of the Jews
in the Holy Land through the instrumentality of some distant people
skilled in navigation ([Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002); [Isa
60:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009); [Psa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#015); [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Zep
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010)). PhÅ“nician voyagers coasting
along would speak of all Western remote lands as "beyond" the Nile's
mouths. "Cush," too, has a wide sense, being applied not only to
Ethiopia, but Arabia-Deserta and Felix, and along the Persian Gulf, as
far as the Tigris ([Gen 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 18:2</span></span>

ambassadors--messengers sent to Jerusalem at the time that negotiations
passed between Tirhakah and Hezekiah against the expected attack of
Sennacherib ([Isa 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)).

by . . . sea--on the Nile ([Isa 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005)):
as what follows proves.

vessels of bulrushes--light canoes, formed of papyrus, daubed over with
pitch: so the "ark" in which Moses was exposed ([Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003)).

Go--Isaiah tells them to take back the tidings of what God is about to
do ([Isa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004)) against the common
enemy of both Judah and Ethiopia.

scattered and peeled--rather, "strong and energetic" \[MAURER\]. The
Hebrew for "strong" is literally, "drawn out" (Margin; [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010); [Ecc
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003)). "Energetic," literally, "sharp"
([Hab 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008), Margin; the verb means to
"sharpen" a sword, [Eze 21:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015));
also "polished." As HERODOTUS (3:20, 114) characterizes the Ethiopians
as "the tallest and fairest of men," G. V. SMITH translates, "tall and
comely"; literally, "extended" ([Isa
45:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#014), "men of stature") and polished
(the Ethiopians had "smooth, glossy skins"). In English Version the
reference is to the Jews, scattered outcasts, and loaded with indignity
(literally, "having their hair torn off," HORSLEY).

terrible--the Ethiopians famed for warlike prowess \[ROSENMULLER\]. The
Jews who, because of God's plague, made others to fear the like ([Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037)). Rather, "awfully remarkable"
\[HORSLEY\]. God puts the "terror" of His people into the surrounding
nations at the first ([Exo 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027); [Jos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#009)); so it shall be again in the
latter days ([Zac 12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002)).

from . . . beginning hitherto--so English Version rightly. But GESENIUS,
"to the terrible nation (of upper Egypt) and further beyond" (to the
Ethiopians, properly so called).

meted out--Hebrew, "of line." The measuring-line was used in destroying
buildings ([Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011); [Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008)). Hence, actively, it means here
"a people meting out,--an all-destroying people"; which suits the
context better than "meted," passively \[MAURER\]. HORSLEY,
understanding it of the Jews, translates it, "Expecting, expecting (in a
continual attitude of expectation of Messiah) and trampled under foot";
a graphic picture of them. Most translate, of strength, strength (from a
root, to brace the sinews), that is, a most powerful people.

trodden down--true of the Jews. But MAURER translates it actively, a
people "treading under foot" all its enemies, that is, victorious ([Isa
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025)), namely, the Ethiopians.

spoiled--"cut up." The Nile is formed by the junction of many streams in
Abyssinia, the Atbara, the Astapus or Blue river (between which two
rivers Meroe, the "Ethiopia" here meant, lies), and the Astaboras or
White river; these streams wash down the soil along their banks in the
"land" of Upper Egypt and deposit it on that of Lower Egypt. G. V. SMITH
translates it, "Divide." HORSLEY takes it figuratively of the conquering
armies which have often "spoiled" Judea.

[Isaiah 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 18:3</span></span>

see ye . . . hear ye--rather, "ye shall see . . . shall hear." Call to
the whole earth to be witnesses of what Jehovah ("He") is about to do.
He will "lift up an ensign," calling the Assyrian motley hosts together
([Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026)) on "the mountains" round
Jerusalem, to their own destruction. This (the eighteenth chapter)
declares the coming overthrow of those armies whose presence is
announced in [Isa 17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#012). The same
motive, which led Hezekiah to seek aid from Egypt, led him to accept
gladly the Ethiopian Tirhakah's aid ([Isa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006); [Isa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#009)). Ethiopia, Egypt, and Judea were
probably leagued together against the common enemy, 713 B.C. See notes
on the twenty-second chapter, where a difference of tone (as referring
to a different period) as to Ethiopia is observable. HORSLEY takes the
"ensign" to be the cross, and the "trumpet" the Gospel trumpet, which
shall be sounded more loudly in the last days.

[Isaiah 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 18:4</span></span>

take . . . rest . . . consider--I will calmly look on and not interpose,
while all seems to promise success to the enemy; when figuratively, "the
sun's heat" and "the night dews" ripen their "harvest"; but "before" it
reaches its maturity I will destroy it ([Isa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005); [Ecc
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)).

like a clear heat--rather, "at the time of the clear (serene) heat"
\[MAURER\].

upon herbs--answering to "harvest" in the parallel clause. MAURER
translates, "in the sunlight" ([Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026); [Job
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#021); [Hab
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#004)).

like . . . dew--rather, "at the time of the dew cloud." God's "silence"
is mistaken by the ungodly for consent; His delay in taking vengeance
for forgetfulness ([Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)); so it
shall be before the vengeance which in the last day shall usher in the
restoration of the Jews ([Isa 34:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001);
[Isa 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011), end of the verse, [Pe2
3:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 18:5</span></span>

For--rather, "But."

perfect--perfected. When the enemy's plans are on the verge of
completion.

sour grape . . . flower--rather, "when the flower shall become the
ripening grape" \[MAURER\].

sprigs--the shoots with the grapes on them. God will not only disconcert
their present plans, but prevent them forming any future ones. HORSLEY
takes the "harvest" and vintage here as referring to purifying judgments
which cause the excision of the ungodly from the earth, and the placing
of the faithful in a state of peace on the earth: not the last judgment
([Joh 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002); [Rev
14:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 18:6</span></span>

birds . . . beasts--transition from the image "sprigs," "branches," to
the thing meant: the Assyrian soldiers and leaders shall be the prey of
birds and beasts, the whole year through, "winter" and "summer," so
numerous shall be their carcasses. HORSLEY translates the Hebrew which
is singular: "upon it," not "upon them"; the "it" refers to God's
"dwelling-place" ([Isa 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#004)) in the
Holy Land, which Antichrist ("the bird of prey" with the "beasts," his
rebel hosts) is to possess himself of, and where he is to perish.

[Isaiah 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 18:7</span></span>

present . . . people scattered and peeled--For the right rendering, see
on [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002). The repetition of
epithets enhances the honor paid to Jehovah by so mighty a nation. The
Ethiopians, wonder-struck at such an interposition of Jehovah in behalf
of His people, shall send gifts to Jerusalem in His honor ([Isa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001); [Psa
68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031); [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010)). Thus translate: "a present . .
. from a people." Or translate, as English Version; "the present" will
mean "the people" of Ethiopia converted to God ([Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016)). HORSLEY takes the people
converted to Jehovah, as the Jews in the latter days.

place of the name--where Jehovah peculiarly manifests His glory; [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010) and [Act
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027) show how worshippers came up to
Jerusalem from Egypt" and "Ethiopia." Frumentius, an Egyptian, in the
fourth century, converted Abyssinia to Christianity; and a Christian
church, under an abuna or bishop, still flourishes there. The full
accomplishment is probably still future.

The nineteenth and twentieth chapters are connected, but with an
interval between. Egypt had been held by an Ethiopian dynasty, Sabacho,
Sevechus, or Sabacho II, and Tirhakah, for forty or fifty years.
Sevechus (called So, the ally of Hoshea, [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004)), retired from Lower Egypt on
account of the resistance of the priests; and perhaps also, as the
Assyrians threatened Lower Egypt. On his withdrawal, Sethos, one of the
priestly caste, became supreme, having Tanis ("Zoan") or else Memphis as
his capital, 718 B.C.; while the Ethiopians retained Upper Egypt, with
Thebes as its capital, under Tirhakah. A third native dynasty was at
Sais, in the west of Lower Egypt; to this at a later period belonged
Psammetichus, the first who admitted Greeks into Egypt and its armies;
he was one of the dodecarchy, a number of petty kings between whom Egypt
was divided, and by aid of foreign auxiliaries overcame the rest, 670
B.C. To the divisions at this last time, GESENIUS refers [Isa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002); and Psammetichus, [Isa
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004), "a cruel lord." The dissensions
of the ruling castes are certainly referred to. But the time referred to
is much earlier than that of Psammetichus. In [Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001), the invasion of Egypt is
represented as caused by "the Lord"; and in [Isa
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017), "Judah" is spoken of as "a
terror to Egypt," which it could hardly have been by itself. Probably,
therefore, the Assyrian invasion of Egypt under Sargon, when Judah was
the ally of Assyria, and Hezekiah had not yet refused tribute as he did
in the beginning of Sennacherib's reign, is meant. That Assyria was in
Isaiah's mind appears from the way in which it is joined with Israel and
Egypt in the worship of Jehovah ([Isa
19:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024)). Thus the dissensions
referred to ([Isa 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002)) allude to the
time of the withdrawal of the Ethiopians from Lower Egypt, probably not
without a struggle, especially with the priestly caste; also to the time
when Sethos usurped the throne and entered on the contest with the
military caste, by the aid of the town populations: when the Saitic
dynasty was another cause of division. Sargon's reign was between
722-715 B.C. answering to 718 B.C., when Sethos usurped his throne \[G.
V. SMITH\].
