### [Psalms Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)

[Psalms 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 8:1</span></span>

Upon \[or according to the\] Gittith, probably means that the musical
performance was directed to be according to a tune of that name; which,
derived from Gath, a "wine-press," denotes a tune (used in connection
with gathering the vintage) of a joyous character. All the Psalms to
which this term is prefixed \[[Psa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001); [Psa
81:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#001); [Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)\] are of such a character. The
Psalmist gives vent to his admiration of God's manifested perfections,
by celebrating His condescending and beneficent providence to man as
evinced by the position of the race, as originally created and assigned
a dominion over the works of His hands. ([Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001))

thy name--perfections ([Psa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011); [Psa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#017)).

who hast set--literally, "which set Thou Thy glory," &c., or "which
glory of Thine set Thou," &c., that is, make it more conspicuous as if
earth were too small a theater for its display. A similar exposition
suits the usual rendering.

[Psalms 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 8:2</span></span>

So manifest are God's perfections, that by very weak instruments He
conclusively sets forth His praise. Infants are not only wonderful
illustrations of God's power and skill, in their physical constitution,
instincts, and early developed intelligence, but also in their
spontaneous admiration of God's works, by which they put to shame--

still--or, silence men who rail and cavil against God. A special
illustration of the passage is afforded in [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016), when our Saviour stilled the
cavillers by quoting these words; for the glories with which God
invested His incarnate Son, even in His humiliation, constitute a most
wonderful display of the perfections of His wisdom, love, and power. In
view of the scope of [Psa 8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004) (see
below), this quotation by our Saviour may be regarded as an exposition
of the prophetical character of the words.

sucklings--among the Hebrews were probably of an age to speak (compare
[Sa1 1:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#022); [Mar
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#027)).

ordained--founded, or prepared, and perfected, which occurs in [Mat
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#016); taken from the Septuagint, has
the same meaning.

strength--In the quotation in the New Testament, praise occurs as the
consequence or effect put for the cause (compare [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014)).

avenger--as in [Psa 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#016); one
desirous of revenge, disposed to be quarrelsome, and so apt to cavil
against God's government.

[Psalms 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 8:3</span></span>

The allusion to the magnificence of the visible heavens is introduced
for the purpose of illustrating God's condescension, who, though the
mighty Creator of these glorious worlds of light, makes man the object
of regard and recipient of favor.

[Psalms 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 8:4</span></span>

man--literally, "frail man," an allusion to his essential infirmity.

son of man--only varies the form of speech.

visitest--in favor ([Psa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#010)). This
favor is now more fully illustrated.

[Psalms 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 8:5</span></span>

God has placed man next in dignity to angels, and but a little lower,
and has crowned him with the empire of the world.

glory and honour--are the attributes of royal dignity ([Psa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005); [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003)). The position assigned man is
that described ([Gen 1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026)) as
belonging to Adam, in his original condition, the terms employed in
detailing the subjects of man's dominion corresponding with those there
used. In a modified sense, in his present fallen state, man is still
invested with some remains of this original dominion. It is very
evident, however, by the apostle's inspired expositions ([Heb
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006); [Co1
15:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027)) that the language here
employed finds its fulfilment only in the final exaltation of Christ's
human nature. There is no limit to the "all things" mentioned, God only
excepted, who "puts all things under." Man, in the person and glorious
destiny of Jesus of Nazareth, the second Adam, the head and
representative of the race, will not only be restored to his original
position, but exalted far beyond it. "The last enemy, death," through
fear of which, man, in his present estate, is "all his lifetime in
bondage" \[[Heb 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)\], "shall be
destroyed" \[[Co1 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026)\]. Then all
things will have been put under his feet, "principalities and powers
being made subject to him" \[[Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022)\]. This view, so far from being
alien from the scope of the passage, is more consistent than any other;
for man as a race cannot well be conceived to have a higher honor put
upon him than to be thus exalted in the person and destiny of Jesus of
Nazareth. And at the same time, by no other of His glorious
manifestations has God more illustriously declared those attributes
which distinguish His name than in the scheme of redemption, of which
this economy forms such an important and essential feature. In the
generic import of the language, as describing man's present relation to
the works of God's hands, it may be regarded as typical, thus allowing
not only the usual application, but also this higher sense which the
inspired writers of the New Testament have assigned it.

[Psalms 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 8:9</span></span>

Appropriately, the writer closes this brief but pregnant and sublime
song of praise with the terms of admiration with which it was opened.
