### [Psalms Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 2:1</span></span>

The number and authorship of this Psalm are stated ([Act
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md); [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033).md). Though the warlike events of
David's reign may have suggested its imagery, the scenes depicted and
the subjects presented can only find a fulfilment in the history and
character of Jesus Christ, to which, as above cited and in [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), the New Testament writers most
distinctly testify. In a most animated and highly poetical style, the
writer, in "four stanzas of three verses each," sets forth the
inveterate and furious, though futile, hostility of men to God and His
anointed, God's determination to carry out His purpose, that purpose as
stated more fully by His Son, the establishment of the Mediatorial
kingdom, and the imminent danger of all who resist, as well as the
blessing of all who welcome this mighty and triumphant king. ([Psa
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md)

Why do the heathen, &c.--Beholding, in prophetic vision, the peoples and
nations, as if in a tumultuous assembly, raging with a fury like the
raging of the sea, designing to resist God's government, the writer
breaks forth into an exclamation in which are mingled surprise at their
folly, and indignation at their rebellion.

heathen--nations generally, not as opposed to Jews.

the people--or, literally, "peoples," or races of men.

[Psalms 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 2:2</span></span>

The kings and rulers lead on their subjects.

set themselves--take a stand.

take counsel--literally, "sit together," denoting their deliberation.

anointed--Hebrew, "Messiah"; Greek, "Christ" ([Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041).md). Anointing, as an emblem of the
gifts of the Holy Spirit, was conferred on prophets ([Isa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md); priests ([Exo
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#030).md); and kings ([Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001.md); [Sa1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md); [Kg1
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#039).md). Hence this title well suited
Him who holds all these offices, and was generally used by the Jews
before His coming, to denote Him ([Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026).md). While the prophet has in view
men's opposition generally, he here depicts it in its culminating aspect
as seen in the events of Christ's great trial. Pilate and Herod, and the
rulers of the Jews ([Mat 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md); Luke
23:1-25), with the furious mob, are vividly portrayed.

[Psalms 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 2:3</span></span>

The rebellious purposes of men are more distinctly announced by this
representation of their avowal in words, as well as actions.

bands . . . and . . . cords--denote the restraints of government.

[Psalms 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 2:4</span></span>

By a figure whose boldness is only allowable to an inspired writer,
God's conduct and language in view of this opposition are now related.

He that sitteth in the heavens--enthroned in quiet dignities (compare
[Psa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010.md); [Isa
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022).md).

shall laugh--in supreme contempt; their vain rage excites His derision.
He is still the Lord, literally, "Sovereign," though they rebel.

[Psalms 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 2:5</span></span>

Then shall he speak--His righteous indignation as well as contempt is
roused. For God to speak is for Him to act, for what He resolves He will
do ([Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009).md).

vex them--agitate or terrify them ([Psa
83:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#015).md).

[Psalms 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 2:6</span></span>

The purpose here declared, in its execution, involves their overthrow.

Yet--literally, "and," in an adversative sense.

I have set--anointed, or firmly placed, with allusion in the Hebrew to
"casting an image in a mould." The sense is not materially varied in
either case.

my king--appointed by Me and for Me ([Num
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018).md).

upon my holy hill of Zion--Zion, selected by David as the abode of the
ark and the seat of God's visible residence ([Kg1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md); as also David, the head of the
Church and nation, and type of Christ, was called holy, and the Church
itself came to be thus named ([Psa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#011.md); [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018.md); [Psa
99:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#002.md); [Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007), &c..md).

[Psalms 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 2:7</span></span>

The king thus constituted declares the fundamental law of His kingdom,
in the avowal of His Sonship, a relation involving His universal
dominion.

this day have I begotten thee--as [Sa2
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md), "he shall be My son," is a
solemn recognition of this relation. The interpretation of this passage
to describe the inauguration of Christ as Mediatorial King, by no means
impugns the Eternal Sonship of His divine nature. In [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md), Paul's quotation does not imply
an application of this passage to the resurrection; for "raised up" in
[Act 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032.md) is used as in [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md); [Act
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022.md), &c., to denote bringing Him into
being as a man; and not that of resurrection, which it has only when, as
in [Act 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md), allusion is made to His
death ([Rom 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004).md). That passage says He
was declared as to His divine nature to be the Son of God, by the
resurrection, and only teaches that that event manifested a truth
already existing. A similar recognition of His Sonship is introduced in
[Heb 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), by these ends, and by others
in [Mat 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 2:8</span></span>

The hopes of the rebels are thus overthrown, and not only so; the
kingdom they opposed is destined to be coextensive with the earth.

heathen--or, "nations" ([Psa 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001).md).

and the uttermost parts of the earth-- ([Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027).md); denotes universality.

[Psalms 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 2:9</span></span>

His enemies shall be subject to His terrible power ([Job
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#009.md); [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md), as His people to His grace ([Psa
110:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002).md).

rod of iron--denotes severity ([Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).md).

a potter's vessel--when shivered cannot be mended, which will describe
utter destruction.

[Psalms 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 2:10</span></span>

kings . . . judges--For rulers generally ([Psa
148:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011).md), who have been leaders in
rebellion, should be examples of penitent submission, and with fear for
His terrible judgments, mingled with trust in His mercy, acknowledge--

[Psalms 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 2:12</span></span>

Kiss the Son--the authority of the Son.

perish from the way--that is, suddenly and hopelessly.

kindled but a little--or, "in a little time."

put their trust in him--or take refuge in Him ([Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011).md). Men still cherish opposition to
Christ in their hearts and evince it in their lives. Their ruin, without
such trust, is inevitable ([Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md), while their happiness in His
favor is equally sure.
