### [Amos Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001)

[Amos 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 2:1</span></span>

CHARGES AGAINST MOAB, JUDAH, AND LASTLY ISRAEL, THE CHIEF SUBJECT OF
AMOS' PROPHECIES. (Amos 2:1-16)

burned . . . bones of . . . king of Edom into lime--When Jehoram of
Israel, Jehoshaphat of Judah, and the king of Edom, combined against
Mesha king of Moab, the latter failing in battle to break through to the
king of Edom, took the oldest son of the latter and offered him as a
burnt offering on the wall ([Kg2 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#027))
\[MICHAELIS\]. Thus, "king of Edom" is taken as the heir to the throne
of Edom. But "his son" is rather the king of Moab's own son, whom the
father offered to Molech \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 9.3\]. Thus the
reference here in Amos is not to that fact, but to the revenge which
probably the king of Moab took on the king of Edom, when the forces of
Israel and Judah had retired after their successful campaign against
Moab, leaving Edom without allies. The Hebrew tradition is that Moab in
revenge tore from their grave and burned the bones of the king of Edom,
the ally of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat, who was already buried. Probably
the "burning of the bones" means, "he burned the king of Edom alive,
reducing his very bones to lime" \[MAURER\].

[Amos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 2:2</span></span>

Kirioth--the chief city of Moab, called also Kir-Moab ([Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001)). The form is plural here, as
including both the acropolis and town itself (see [Jer
48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024), [Jer
48:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#041), Margin).

die with tumult--that is, amid the tumult of battle ([Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014)).

[Amos 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 2:3</span></span>

the judge--the chief magistrate, the supreme source of justice. "King"
not being used, it seems likely a change of government had before this
time substituted for kings, supreme judges.

[Amos 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 2:4</span></span>

From foreign kingdoms he passes to Judah and Israel, lest it should be
said, he was strenuous in denouncing sins abroad, but connived at those
of his own nation. Judah's guilt differs from that of all the others, in
that it was directly against God, not merely against man. Also because
Judah's sin was wilful and wittingly against light and knowledge.

law--the Mosaic code in general.

commandments--or statutes, the ceremonies and civil laws.

their lies--their lying idols ([Psa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#004); [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019)), from which they drew false
hopes. The order is to be observed. The Jews first cast off the divine
law, then fall into lying errors; God thus visiting them with a
righteous retribution ([Rom 1:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025),
[Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028); [Th2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011)). The pretext of a good
intention is hereby refuted: the "lies" that mislead them are "their
(own) lies" \[CALVIN\].

after . . . which their fathers . . . walked--We are not to follow the
fathers in error, but must follow the word of God alone. It was an
aggravation of the Jews' sin that it was not confined to preceding
generations; the sins of the sons rivalled those of their fathers ([Mat
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051)) \[CALVIN\].

[Amos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 2:5</span></span>

a fire--Nebuchadnezzar.

[Amos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 2:6</span></span>

Israel--the ten tribes, the main subject of Amos' prophecies.

sold the righteous--Israel's judges for a bribe are induced to condemn
in judgment him who has a righteous cause; in violation of [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019).

the poor for a pair of shoes--literally, "sandals" of wood, secured on
the foot by leather straps; less valuable than shoes. Compare the same
phrase, for "the most paltry bribe," [Amo
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#006); [Eze
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019); [Joe
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003). They were not driven by poverty
to such a sin; beginning with suffering themselves to be tempted by a
large bribe, they at last are so reckless of all shame as to prostitute
justice for the merest trifle. Amos convicts them of injustice,
incestuous unchastity, and oppression first, as these were so notorious
that they could not deny them, before he proceeds to reprove their
contempt of God, which they would have denied on the ground that they
worshipped God in the form of the calves.

[Amos 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 2:7</span></span>

pant after . . . dust of . . . earth on . . . head of . . . poor--that
is, eagerly thirst for this object, by their oppression to prostrate the
poor so as to cast the dust on their heads in mourning on the earth
(compare [Sa2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#002); [Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012); [Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030)).

turn aside . . . way of . . . meek--pervert their cause ([Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012); [Job
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004) \[GROTIUS\]; [Isa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#002)).

a man and his father--a crime "not so much as named among the Gentiles"
([Co1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001)). When God's people sin in
the face of light, they often fall lower than even those who know not
God.

go in unto the same maid--from [Amo
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008) it seems likely "the damsel" meant
is one of the prostitutes attached to the idol Astarte's temple:
prostitution being part of her filthy worship.

to profane my . . . name--Israel in such abominations, as it were,
designedly seeks to insult God.

[Amos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 2:8</span></span>

lay themselves . . . upon clothes laid to pledge--the outer garment,
which [Exo 22:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025) ordered to be
restored to the poor man before sunset, as being his only covering. It
aggravated the crime that they lay on these clothes in an idol temple.

by every altar--They partook in a recumbent posture of their idolatrous
feasts; the ancients being in the habit of reclining at full length in
eating, the upper part of the body resting on the left elbow, not
sitting as we do.

drink . . . wine of the condemned--that is, wine bought with the money
of those whom they unjustly fined.

[Amos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 2:9</span></span>

Yet--My former benefits to you heighten your ingratitude.

the Amorite--the most powerful of all the Canaanite nations, and
therefore put for them all ([Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016); [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022); [Deu
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#020); [Jos
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#007)).

height . . . like . . . cedars-- ([Num
13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#032)).

destroyed his fruit . . . above . . . roots . . . beneath--that is,
destroyed him utterly ([Job 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016);
[Eze 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)).

[Amos 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 2:10</span></span>

brought you up from . . . Egypt--"brought up" is the phrase, as Egypt
was low and flat, and Canaan hilly.

to possess the land of the Amorite--The Amorites strictly occupied both
sides of the Jordan and the mountains afterward possessed by Judah; but
they here, as in [Amo 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009), stand for
all the Canaanites. God kept Israel forty years in the wilderness, which
tended to discipline them in His statutes, so as to be the better fitted
for entering on the possession of Canaan.

[Amos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 2:11</span></span>

Additional obligations under which Israel lay to God; the prophets and
Nazarites, appointed by Him, to furnish religious instruction and
examples of holy self-restraint.

of your young men--It was a specimen of Israel's highly favored state,
that, of the class most addicted to pleasures, God chose those who by a
solemn vow bound themselves to abstinence from all produce of the vine,
and from all ceremonial and moral defilement. The Nazarite was not to
shave ([Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002), &c.). God left
nothing undone to secure the purity of their worship and their
faithfulness to it ([Lam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007)). The
same comes from a Hebrew root, nazar, "to set apart." Samson, Samuel,
and John the Baptist were Nazarites.

Is it not even thus--Will any of you dare to deny it is so?

[Amos 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 2:12</span></span>

Ye so despised these My favors, as to tempt the Nazarite to break his
vow; and forbade the prophets prophesying ([Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010)). So Amaziah forbade Amos ([Amo
7:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#012)).

[Amos 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 2:13</span></span>

I am pressed under you--so CALVIN (Compare [Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014)). The Margin translates actively,
"I will depress your place," that is, "I will make it narrow," a
metaphor for afflicting a people; the opposite of enlarging, that is,
relieving ([Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001); [Pro
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012)). MAURER translates, "I will
press you down" (not as Margin, "your place"; so the Hebrew, [Job
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012); or [Amo
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007) in Hebrew text). Amos, as a
shepherd, appropriately draws his similes from rustic scenes.

[Amos 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 2:14</span></span>

flight shall perish from . . . swift--Even the swift shall not be able
to escape.

strong shall not strengthen his force--that is, shall not be able to use
his strength.

himself--literally, "his life."

[Amos 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 2:16</span></span>

flee . . . naked--If any escape, it must be with the loss of
accoutrements, and all that would impede rapid flight. They must be
content with saving their life alone.
