### [Jeremiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 21:1</span></span>

ZEDEKIAH CONSULTS JEREMIAH WHAT IS TO BE THE EVENT OF THE WAR: GOD'S
ANSWER. ([Jer 21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001).md)

Zedekiah--a prince having some reverence for sacred things, for which
reason he sends an honorable embassy to Jeremiah; but not having moral
courage to obey his better impulses.

Pashur--son of Melchiah, of the fifth order of priests, distinct from
Pashur, son of Immer ([Jer 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001).md), of
the sixteenth order ([Ch1 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#009.md), [Ch1
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#014).md).

Zephaniah--of the twenty-fourth order. They are designated, not by their
father, but by their family ([Ch1
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 21:2</span></span>

Nebuchadrezzar--the more usual way of spelling the name in Jeremiah than
Nebuchadnezzar. From Persiac roots, meaning either "Nebo, the chief of
the gods," or, "Nebo, the god of fire." He was son of Nabopolassar, who
committed the command of the army against Egypt, at Carchemish, and
against Judea, to the Brown prince.

according to all his wondrous works--Zedekiah hopes for God's special
interposition, such as was vouchsafed to Hezekiah against Sennacherib
([Kg2 19:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md).

he--Nebuchadnezzar.

go up from us--rise up from the siege which he sat down to lay ([Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md), [Jer
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md), Margin; [Num
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#024.md), [Num
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#027.md); [Kg1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#019), Margin.md).

[Jeremiah 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 21:4</span></span>

God of Israel--Those "wondrous works" ([Jer
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#002).md) do not belong to you; God is
faithful; it is you who forfeit the privileges of the covenant by
unfaithfulness. "God will always remain the God of Israel, though He
destroy thee and thy people" \[CALVIN\].

turn back the weapons--I will turn them to a very different use from
what you intend them. With them you now fight against the Chaldees
"without the walls" (the Jewish defenders being as yet able to sally
forth more freely, and defend the fountains outside the walls in the
valley under Mount Zion; see [Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md); [Jer
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006).md); but soon ye shall be driven
back within the city \[MAURER\], and "in the midst" of it, I will cause
all your arms to be gathered in one place ("I will assemble them,"
namely, your arms) by the Chaldean conquerors \[GROTIUS\], who shall
slay you with those very arms \[MENOCHIUS\].

[Jeremiah 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 21:5</span></span>

The Jews shall have not merely the Chaldees, but Jehovah Himself in
wrath at their provocations, fighting against them. Every word enhances
the formidable character of God's opposition, "I myself . . .
outstretched hand . . . strong arm (no longer as in [Exo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#006.md), and in the case of Sennacherib,
in your behalf, but) in anger . . . fury . . . great wrath."

[Jeremiah 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 21:7</span></span>

the people, and such--rather, explanatory, "the people," namely, "such
as are left."

seek their life--content with nothing short of their death; not content
with plundering and enslaving them.

smite with . . . sword--This was the fate of Zedekiah's sons and many of
the Jewish nobles. Zedekiah himself, though not put to a violent death,
died of grief. Compare as to the accurate fulfilment, [Jer
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004.md); [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md); [Kg2
25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#006.md).

[Jeremiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 21:8</span></span>

"Life," if ye surrender; "death," if ye persist in opposing the Chaldees
(compare [Deu 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019).md). The
individuality of Jeremiah's mission from God is shown in that he urges
to unconditional surrender; whereas all former prophets had urged the
people to oppose their invaders ([Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md); [Isa
37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033.md), [Isa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#035).md).

[Jeremiah 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 21:9</span></span>

([Jer 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#002.md), [Jer
38:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017).md).

falleth to--deserts to.

life . . . a prey--proverbial, to make one's escape with life, like a
valuable spoil or prey that one carries off; the narrowness of the
escape, and the joy felt at it, are included in the idea ([Jer
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 21:10</span></span>

set . . . face against--determined to punish (See on [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 21:12</span></span>

house of David--the royal family and all in office about the king. He
calls them so, because it was the greater disgrace that they had so
degenerated from the piety of their forefather, David; and to repress
their glorying in their descent from him, as if they were therefore
inviolable; but God will not spare them as apostates.

in the morning--alluding to the time of dispensing justice ([Job
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017.md); [Psa
101:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#008).md); but the sense is mainly
proverbial, for "with promptness" ([Psa
90:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#014.md); [Psa
143:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#008).md). MAURER translates, "every
morning."

lest my fury . . . like fire--Already it was kindled, and the decree of
God gone forth against the city ([Jer
21:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#004).md), but the king and his house
may yet be preserved by repentance and reformation. God urges to
righteousness, not as if they can thereby escape punishment wholly, but
as the condition of a mitigation of it.

[Jeremiah 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 21:13</span></span>

inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain--Jerusalem personified;
situated for the most part on hills, with valleys at the bottom of them,
as the valley of Hinnom, &c.; and beyond the valleys and mountains
again, a position most fortified by nature, whence the inhabitants
fancied themselves beyond the reach of enemies; but since God is
"against" them, their position will avail nothing for them. The "valley"
between Mount Zion and Moriah is called TyropÅ“on. ROBINSON takes, "rock
of the plain" as Mount Zion, on which is a level tract of some extent.
It is appropriately here referred to, being the site of the royal
residence of the "house of David," addressed ([Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 21:14</span></span>

fruit of your doings-- ([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md);
[Isa 3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md).

forest thereof--namely of your city, taken from [Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013.md). "Forest" refers to the dense
mass of houses built of cedar, &c., brought from Lebanon ([Jer
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#007.md); [Jer
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md); [Kg2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009).md).

Belonging to an earlier period than the twenty-first chapter, namely,
the reigns of Shallum or Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, and Jeconiah ([Jer
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#010.md), [Jer
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013.md), [Jer
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#020).md). Jeremiah often groups his
prophecies, not by chronological order, but by similarity of subjects;
thus [Jer 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md) corresponds to [Jer
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012.md). GROTIUS thinks that Jeremiah
here repeats to Zedekiah what he had announced to that king's
predecessors formerly (namely, his brother and brother's son), of a
similar bearing, and which had since come to pass; a warning to
Zedekiah. Probably, in arranging his prophecies they were grouped for
the first time in the present order, designed by the Holy Spirit to set
forth the series of kings of Judah, all four alike, failing in
"righteousness," followed at last by the "King," a righteous Branch
raised unto David, in the house of Judah, "the Lord our righteousness"
([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md). The unrighteousness of
Zedekiah suggested the review of his predecessors' failure in the same
respects, and consequent punishment, which ought to have warned him, but
did not.
