### [Hosea Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 8:1</span></span>

PROPHECY OF THE IRRUPTION OF THE ASSYRIANS, IN PUNISHMENT FOR ISRAEL'S
APOSTASY, IDOLATRY, AND SETTING UP OF KINGS WITHOUT GOD'S SANCTION.
([Hos 8:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md)

In [Hos 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md), Judah is said to
multiply fenced cities; and in [Hos
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md), Israel, to its great hurt, is
said to have gone up to Assyria for help. This answers best to the reign
of Menahem. For it was then that Uzziah of Judah, his contemporary,
built fenced cities ([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md), [Ch2
26:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009).md). Then also Israel turned to
Assyria and had to pay for their sinful folly a thousand talents of
silver ([Kg2 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md) \[MAURER\].

Set the trumpet, &c.--to give warning of the approach of the enemy: "To
thy palate (that is, 'mouth,' [Job
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#030), Margin.md) the trumpet"; the
abruptness of expression indicates the suddenness of the attack. So [Hos
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md).

as . . . eagle--the Assyrian ([Deu
28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049.md); [Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md).

against . . . house of . . . Lord--not the temple, but Israel viewed as
the family of God ([Hos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); [Num
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md); [Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md); [Heb
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002.md); [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017).md).

[Hosea 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 8:2</span></span>

My God, we know thee--the singular, "My," is used distributively, each
one so addressing God. They, in their hour of need, plead their
knowledge of God as the covenant-people, while in their acts they
acknowledge Him not (compare [Mat
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md); [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md); also [Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md); [Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004).md). The Hebrew joins "Israel," not
as English Version, with "shall cry," but "We, Israel, know thee"; God
denies the claim thus urged on the ground of their descent from Israel.

[Hosea 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 8:3</span></span>

Israel--God repeats the name in opposition to their use of it ([Hos
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#002).md).

the thing that is good--JEROME translates, "God" who is good and doing
good ([Psa 119:68](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#068).md). He is the chief
object rejected, but with Him also all that is good.

the enemy shall pursue him--in just retribution from God.

[Hosea 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 8:4</span></span>

kings . . . not by me--not with My sanction ([Kg1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#031.md); [Kg1
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020).md). Israel set up Jeroboam and his
successors, whereas God had appointed the house of David as the rightful
kings of the whole nation.

I knew it not--I approved it not ([Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006).md).

of . . . gold . . . idols-- ([Hos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md);
[Hos 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002).md).

that they may be cut off--that is, though warned of the consequences of
idolatry, as it were with open eyes they rushed on their own
destruction. So [Jer 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md), [Jer
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md); [Jer
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008.md).

[Hosea 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 8:5</span></span>

hath cast thee off--As the ellipsis of thee is unusual, MAURER
translates, "thy calf is abominable." But the antithesis to [Hos
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#003.md) establishes English Version,
"Israel hath cast off the thing that is good"; therefore, in just
retribution, "thy calf hath cast thee off," that is, is made by God the
cause of thy being cast off ([Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md). Jeroboam, during his sojourn
in Egypt, saw Apis worshipped at Memphis, and Mnevis at Heliopolis, in
the form of an ox; this, and the temple cherubim, suggested the idea of
the calves set up at Dan and Beth-el.

how long . . . ere they attain to innocency?--How long will they be
incapable of bearing innocency? \[MAURER\].

[Hosea 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 8:6</span></span>

from Israel was it--that is, the calf originated with them, not from Me.
"It also," as well as their "kings set up" by them, "but not by Me"
([Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md).

[Hosea 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 8:7</span></span>

sown . . . reap-- ([Pro 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md); [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md). "Sow . . . wind," that is, to
make the vain show of worship, while faith and obedience are wanting
\[CALVIN\]. Rather, to offer senseless supplications to the calves for
good harvests (compare [Hos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008).md); the
result being that God will make them "reap no stalk," that is, "standing
corn." Also, the phraseology proverbially means that all their
undertakings shall be profitless ([Pro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#029.md); [Ecc
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#016).md).

the bud--or, "growth."

strangers--foreigners ([Hos 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009).md).

[Hosea 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 8:8</span></span>

vessel wherein is no pleasure-- ([Psa
41:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#012.md); [Jer
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#028.md); [Jer
48:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#038).md).

[Hosea 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 8:9</span></span>

gone . . . to Assyria--referring to Menahem's application for Pul's aid
in establishing him on the throne (compare [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011).md). Menahem's name is read in the
inscriptions in the southwest palace of Nimrod, as a tributary to the
Assyrian king in his eighth year. The dynasty of Pul, or Phalluka, was
supplanted at Nineveh by that of Tiglath-pileser, about 768 (or 760)
B.C. Semiramis seems to have been Pul's wife, and to have withdrawn to
Babylon in 768; and her son, Nabonassar, succeeding after a period of
confusion, originated "the era of Nabonassar," 747 B.C. \[G. V. SMITH\].
Usually foreigners coming to Israel's land were said to "go up"; here it
is the reverse, to intimate Israel's sunken state, and Assyria's
superiority.

wild ass--a figure of Israel's headstrong perversity in following her
own bent ([Jer 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024).md).

alone by himself--characteristic of Israel in all ages: "lo, the people
shall dwell alone" ([Num 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md); compare
[Job 39:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005).md).

hired lovers--reversing the ordinary way, namely, that lovers should
hire her ([Eze 16:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033).md).

[Hosea 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 8:10</span></span>

will I gather them--namely, the nations (Assyria, &c.) against Israel,
instead of their assisting her as she had wished ([Eze
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037).md).

a little--rather, "in a little" \[HENDERSON\]. English Version gives
good sense: They shall sorrow "a little" at the imposition of the
tribute; God suspended yet the great judgment, namely, their deportation
by Assyria.

the burden of the king of princes--the tribute imposed on Israel (under
Menahem) by the Assyrian king Pul, ([Kg2
15:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md), who had many "princes"
under his sway ([Isa 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#008).md).

[Hosea 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 8:11</span></span>

God in righteous retribution gives them up to their own way; the sin
becomes its own punishment ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md).

many altars--in opposition to God's law ([Deu
12:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md), [Deu
12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013).md).

to sin . . . to sin--Their altars which were "sin" (whatever religious
intentions they might plead) should be treated as such, and be the
source of their punishment ([Kg1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030.md); [Kg1
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#034).md).

[Hosea 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 8:12</span></span>

great things of . . . law-- ([Deu 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md),
[Deu 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md); [Psa
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md); [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018.md), [Psa
119:72](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#072.md); [Psa
147:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019).md). MAURER not so well
translates, "the many things of My law."

my law--as opposed to their inventions. This reference of Hosea to the
Pentateuch alone is against the theory that some earlier written
prophecies have not come down to us.

strange thing--as if a thing with which they had nothing to do.

[Hosea 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 8:13</span></span>

sacrifices of mine offerings--that is, which they offer to Me.

eat it--Their own carnal gratification is the object which they seek,
not My honor.

now--that is, "speedily."

shall return to Egypt-- ([Hos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md),
[Hos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md); [Hos
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011).md). The same threat as in [Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md). They fled thither to escape
from the Assyrians (compare as to Judah, Jer. 42:1-44:30), when these
latter had overthrown their nation. But see on [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md).

[Hosea 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 8:14</span></span>

forgotten . . . Maker-- ([Deu 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018).md).

temples--to idols.

Judah . . . fenced cities--Judah, though less idolatrous than Israel,
betrayed lack of faith in Jehovah by trusting more to its fenced cities
than to Him; instead of making peace with God, Judah multiplied human
defenses ([Isa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008.md); [Jer
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#017.md); [Mic
5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010).md).

I will send . . . fire upon . . . cities--Sennacherib burned all Judah's
fenced cities except Jerusalem ([Kg2
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013).md).

palaces thereof--namely, of the land. Compare as to Jerusalem, [Jer
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027.md).
