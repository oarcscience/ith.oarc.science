### [Proverbs Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 17:1</span></span>

(Pro. 17:1-28)

sacrifices--or, "feasts" made with part of them (compare [Pro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#014.md); [Lev
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#003.md); [Lev
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031).md).

with--literally, "of."

strife--its product, or attendant.

[Proverbs 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 17:2</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#035).md).

causeth shame-- ([Pro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#005).md).

shall . . . inheritance--that is, share a brother's part (compare [Num
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#004.md), [Num
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#007).md).

[Proverbs 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 17:3</span></span>

God only knows, as He tries ([Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006.md); [Psa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#010).md) the heart.

[Proverbs 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 17:4</span></span>

Wicked doers and speakers alike delight in calumny.

[Proverbs 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 17:5</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031).md).

glad at calamities--rejoicing in others' evil. Such are rightly punished
by God, who knows their hearts.

[Proverbs 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 17:6</span></span>

Prolonged posterity is a blessing, its cutting off a curse ([Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md); [Psa
109:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#013).md), hence children may glory
in virtuous ancestry.

[Proverbs 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 17:7</span></span>

Excellent speech--(Compare Margin). Such language as ill suits a fool,
as lying (ought to suit) a prince ([Pro
16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#012).md).

[Proverbs 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 17:8</span></span>

One so corrupt as to take a bribe evinces his high estimate of it by
subjection to its influence ([Pro
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#016.md); [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006).md).

[Proverbs 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 17:9</span></span>

seeketh love--(Compare Margin). The contrast is between the peace-maker
and tale-bearer.

[Proverbs 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 17:10</span></span>

Reproof more affects the wise than severe scourging, fools.

[Proverbs 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 17:11</span></span>

Such meet just retribution ([Kg1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#025).md).

a cruel messenger--one to inflict it.

[Proverbs 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 17:12</span></span>

They are less rational in anger than wild beasts.

[Proverbs 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 17:13</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#004.md); [Psa
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#012).md).

evil--injury to another ([Pro 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#021).md).

[Proverbs 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 17:14</span></span>

letteth . . . water--as a breach in a dam.

before . . . meddled with--before strife has become sharp, or, by an
explanation better suiting the figure, before it rolls on, or increases.

[Proverbs 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 17:15</span></span>

abomination . . . Lord--as reversing His method of acting ([Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md); [Pro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#002).md).

[Proverbs 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 17:16</span></span>

Though wealth cannot buy wisdom for those who do not love it, yet wisdom
procures wealth ([Pro 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md); [Pro
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#024).md).

[Proverbs 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 17:17</span></span>

To the second of these parallel clauses, there is an accession of
meaning, that is, that a brother's love is specially seen in adversity.

[Proverbs 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 17:18</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md); [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015).md).

in the presence, &c.--that is, he either fails to consult his friend, or
to follow his advice.

[Proverbs 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 17:19</span></span>

strife--contention is, and leads to, sin.

he that exalteth his gate--gratifies a vain love of costly building.

seeketh--or, "findeth," as if he sought (compare "loveth death," [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036).md).

[Proverbs 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 17:20</span></span>

The second clause advances on the first. The ill-natured fail of good,
and the cavilling and fault-finding incur evil.

[Proverbs 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 17:21</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#024).md). Different words
are rendered by "fool," both denoting stupidity and impiety.

[Proverbs 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 17:22</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#030.md); [Pro
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#013).md). The effect of the mind on the
body is well known.

medicine--or, "body," which better corresponds with "bone."

drieth--as if the marrow were exhausted.

[Proverbs 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 17:23</span></span>

a gift . . . bosom--Money and other valuables were borne in a fold of
the garment, called the bosom.

to pervert--that is, by bribery.

[Proverbs 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 17:24</span></span>

Wisdom . . . him--ever an object of regard, while a fool's affections
are unsettled.

[Proverbs 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 17:25</span></span>

a grief--or cross, vexation (compare [Pro
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#021.md); [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001).md).

[Proverbs 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 17:26</span></span>

Also--that is, Equally to be avoided are other sins: punishing good
subjects, or resisting good rulers.

[Proverbs 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 17:27</span></span>

Prudence of speech is commended as is an excellent or calm spirit, not
excited to vain conversation.
