### [Psalms Chapter 68](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 68:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 68:1</span></span>

This is a Psalm-song (see on [Psa
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001), title.md), perhaps suggested by
David's victories, which secured his throne and gave rest to the nation.
In general terms, the judgment of God on the wicked, and the equity and
goodness of His government to the pious, are celebrated. The sentiment
is illustrated by examples of God's dealings, cited from the Jewish
history and related in highly poetical terms. Hence the writer intimates
an expectation of equal and even greater triumphs and summons all
nations to unite in praises of the God of Israel. The Psalm is evidently
typical of the relation which God, in the person of His Son, sustains to
the Church (compare [Psa 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018).md). (Psa.
68:1-35)

Compare [Num 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md); [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004.md); [Psa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md), on the figures here used.

before him--as in [Psa 68:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#002.md), from His
presence, as dreaded; but in [Psa
68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003.md), in His presence, as under His
protection ([Psa 61:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 68:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 68:3</span></span>

the righteous--all truly pious, whether of Israel or not.

[Psalms 68:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 68:4</span></span>

extol him . . . heavens--literally, "cast up for Him who rideth in the
deserts," or "wilderness" (compare [Psa
68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007).md), alluding to the poetical
representation of His leading His people in the wilderness as a
conqueror, before whom a way is to be prepared, or "cast up" (compare
[Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md).

by his name JAH--or, "Jehovah," of which it is a contraction ([Exo
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#003.md); [Isa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002)) (Hebrew.md).

name--or, "perfections" ([Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md);
[Psa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001).md), which--

[Psalms 68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 68:5</span></span>

are illustrated by the protection to the helpless, vindication of the
innocent, and punishment of rebels, ascribed to Him.

[Psalms 68:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 68:6</span></span>

setteth the solitary in families--literally, "settleth the lonely" (as
wanderers) "at home." Though a general truth, there is perhaps allusion
to the wandering and settlement of the Israelites.

rebellious dwell in a dry land--removed from all the comforts of home.

[Psalms 68:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 68:7</span></span>

(Compare [Exo 19:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016).md).

thou wentest--in the pillar of fire.

thou didst march--literally, "in Thy tread," Thy majestic movement.

[Psalms 68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 68:8</span></span>

even Sinai itself--literally, "that Sinai," as in [Jdg
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#005.md).

[Psalms 68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 68:9</span></span>

a plentiful rain--a rain of gifts, as manna and quails.

[Psalms 68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 68:10</span></span>

Thy congregation--literally, "troop," as in [Sa2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#011.md), [Sa2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#013.md) --the military aspect of the
people being prominent, according to the figures of the context.

therein--that is, in the land of promise.

the poor--Thy humble people ([Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009.md); compare [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 68:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 68:11</span></span>

gave the word--that is, of triumph.

company--or, choir of females, celebrating victory ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 68:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 68:12</span></span>

Kings of armies--that is, with their armies.

she that . . . at home--Mostly women so remained, and the ease of
victory appears in that such, without danger, quietly enjoyed the
spoils.

[Psalms 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 68:13</span></span>

Some translate this, "When ye shall lie between the borders, ye shall,"
&c., comparing the peaceful rest in the borders or limits of the
promised land to the proverbial beauty of a gentle dove. Others
understand by the word rendered "pots," the smoked sides of caves, in
which the Israelites took refuge from enemies in the times of the
judges; or, taking the whole figuratively, the rows of stones on which
cooking vessels were hung; and thus that a contrast is drawn between
their former low and afflicted state and their succeeding prosperity. In
either case, a state of quiet and peace is described by a beautiful
figure.

[Psalms 68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 68:14</span></span>

Their enemies dispersed, the contrast of their prosperity with their
former distress is represented by that of the snow with the dark and
somber shades of Salmon.

[Psalms 68:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 68:15</span></span>

Mountains are often symbols of nations ([Psa
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md); [Psa
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#006).md). That of Bashan, northeast of
Palestine, denotes a heathen nation, which is described as a "hill of
God," or a great hill. Such are represented as envious of the hill
(Zion) on which God resides;

[Psalms 68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 68:17</span></span>

and, to the assertion of God's purpose to make it His dwelling, is added
evidence of His protecting care. He is described as in the midst of His
heavenly armies--

thousands of angels--literally, "thousands of repetitions," or,
"thousands of thousands"--that is, of chariots. The word "angels" was
perhaps introduced in our version, from [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md), and [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). They are, of course, implied as
conductors of the chariots.

as . . . Sinai, in the holy place--that is, He has appeared in Zion as
once in Sinai.

[Psalms 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 68:18</span></span>

From the scene of conquest He ascends to His throne, leading--

captivity captive--or, "many captives captive" ([Jdg
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#012).md).

received gifts for men--accepting their homage, even when forced, as
that of rebels.

that the Lord God might dwell--or literally, "to dwell, O Lord God"
(compare [Psa 68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016).md) --that is, to
make this hill, His people or Church, His dwelling. This Psalm typifies
the conquests of the Church under her divine leader, Christ. He, indeed,
"who was with the Church in the wilderness" ([Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md) is the Lord, described in this
ideal ascension. Hence Paul ([Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008).md)
applies this language to describe His real ascension, when, having
conquered sin, death, and hell, the Lord of glory triumphantly entered
heaven, attended by throngs of adoring angels, to sit on the throne and
wield the scepter of an eternal dominion. The phrase "received gifts for
(or literally, among) men" is by Paul, "gave gifts to men." Both
describe the acts of a conqueror, who receives and distributes spoils.
The Psalmist uses "receiving" as evincing the success, Paul "gave" as
the act, of the conqueror, who, having subdued his enemies, proceeds to
reward his friends. The special application of the passage by Paul was
in proof of Christ's exaltation. What the Old Testament represents of
His descending and ascending corresponds with His history. He who
descended is the same who has ascended. As then ascension was an element
of His triumph, so is it now; and He, who, in His humiliation, must be
recognized as our vicarious sacrifice and the High Priest of our
profession, must also be adored as Head of His Church and author of all
her spiritual benefits.

[Psalms 68:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 68:19</span></span>

God daily and fully supplies us. The issues or escapes from death are
under His control, who is the God that saves us, and destroys His and
our enemies.

[Psalms 68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 68:21</span></span>

wound the head--or, "violently destroy" ([Num
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#008.md); [Psa
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006).md).

goeth on still in . . . trespasses--perseveringly impenitent.

[Psalms 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 68:22</span></span>

Former examples of God's deliverance are generalized: as He has done, so
He will do.

from Bashan--the farthest region; and--

depths of the sea--the severest afflictions. Out of all, God will bring
them. The figures of [Psa 68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023.md) denote
the completeness of the conquest, not implying any savage cruelty
(compare [Kg2 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#036.md); [Isa
63:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); [Jer
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 68:24</span></span>

The triumphal procession, after the deliverance, is depicted.

They have seen--impersonally, "There have been seen."

the goings of my God--as leading the procession; the ark, the symbol of
His presence, being in front. The various bands of music ([Psa
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025).md) follow, and all who are--

[Psalms 68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 68:26</span></span>

from--or literally, "of"

the fountain of Israel--that is, lineal descendants of Jacob, are
invited to unite in the doxology. Then by one of the nearest tribes, one
of the most eminent, and two of the most remote, are represented the
whole nation of Israel, passing forward (Num. 7:1-89).

[Psalms 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 68:28</span></span>

Thanks for the past, and confident prayer for the future victories of
Zion are mingled in a song of praise.

[Psalms 68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 68:29</span></span>

thy temple--literally, "over"

Jerusalem--His palace or residence ([Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md) symbolized His protecting
presence among His people, and hence is the object of homage on the part
of others.

[Psalms 68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 68:30</span></span>

The strongest nations are represented by the strongest beasts (compare
Margin).

[Psalms 68:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 68:31</span></span>

Princes--or, literally, "fat ones," the most eminent from the most
wealthy, and the most distant nation, represent the universal
subjection.

stretch out her hands--or, "make to run her hands," denoting haste.

[Psalms 68:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 68:32</span></span>

To Him who is presented as riding in triumph through His ancient heavens
and proclaiming His presence--to Him who, in nature, and still more in
the wonders of His spiritual government, out of His holy place ([Psa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003).md), is terrible, who rules His
Church, and, by His Church, rules the world in righteousness--let all
nations and kingdoms give honor and power and dominion evermore.
