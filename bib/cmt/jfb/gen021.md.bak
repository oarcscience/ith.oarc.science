### [Genesis Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 21:1</span></span>

BIRTH OF ISAAC. ([Gen 21:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001).md)

the Lord visited Sarah--The language of the historian seems designedly
chosen to magnify the power of God as well as His faithfulness to His
promise. It was God's grace that brought about that event, as well as
the raising of spiritual children to Abraham, of which the birth of this
son was typical \[CALVIN\].

[Genesis 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 21:3</span></span>

Abraham called the name of his son . . . Isaac . . . and
circumcised--God was acknowledged in the name which, by divine command,
was given for a memorial (compare [Gen
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#019).md), and also in the dedication of
the child by administering the seal of the covenant (compare [Gen
17:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010).md).

[Genesis 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 21:8</span></span>

the child grew, and was weaned--children are suckled longer in the East
than in the Occident--boys usually for two or three years.

Abraham made a great feast, &c.--In Eastern countries this is always a
season of domestic festivity, and the newly weaned child is formally
brought, in presence of the assembled relatives and friends, to partake
of some simple viands. Isaac, attired in the symbolic robe, the badge of
birthright, was then admitted heir of the tribe \[ROSENMULLER\].

[Genesis 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 21:9</span></span>

Sarah saw the son of Hagar . . . mocking--Ishmael was aware of the great
change in his prospects, and under the impulse of irritated or resentful
feelings, in which he was probably joined by his mother, treated the
young heir with derision and probably some violence ([Gal
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md).

[Genesis 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 21:10</span></span>

Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman--Nothing but
the expulsion of both could now preserve harmony in the household.
Abraham's perplexity was relieved by an announcement of the divine will,
which in everything, however painful to flesh and blood, all who fear
God and are walking in His ways will, like him, promptly obey. This
story, as the apostle tells us, in "an allegory" \[[Gal
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md)\], and the "persecution" by the
son of the Egyptian was the commencement of the four hundred years'
affliction of Abraham's seed by the Egyptians.

[Genesis 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 21:12</span></span>

in all that Sarah hath said--it is called the Scripture ([Gal
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030).md).

[Genesis 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 21:13</span></span>

also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation--Thus Providence
overruled a family brawl to give rise to two great and extraordinary
peoples.

[Genesis 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 21:14</span></span>

EXPULSION OF ISHMAEL. ([Gen 21:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#014).md)

Abraham rose up early, &c.--early, that the wanderers might reach an
asylum before noon. Bread includes all sorts of victuals--bottle, a
leathern vessel, formed of the entire skin of a lamb or kid sewed up,
with the legs for handles, usually carried over the shoulder. Ishmael
was a lad of seventeen years, and it is quite customary for Arab chiefs
to send out their sons at such an age to do for themselves: often with
nothing but a few days' provisions in a bag.

wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba--in the southern border of
Palestine, but out of the common direction, a wide extending desert,
where they lost their way.

[Genesis 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 21:15</span></span>

the water was spent, &c.--Ishmael sank exhausted from fatigue and
thirst--his mother laid his head under one of the bushes to smell the
damp while she herself, unable to witness his distress, sat down at a
little distance in hopeless sorrow.

[Genesis 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 21:19</span></span>

God opened her eyes--Had she forgotten the promise ([Gen
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#011).md)? Whether she looked to God or
not, He regarded her and directed her to a fountain close beside her,
but probably hid amid brushwood, by the waters of which her almost
expiring son was revived.

[Genesis 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 21:20</span></span>

God was with the lad, &c.--Paran (that is, Arabia), where his posterity
has ever dwelt (compare [Gen 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md);
also [Isa 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019.md); [Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025).md).

his mother took him a wife--On a father's death, the mother looks out
for a wife for her son, however young; and as Ishmael was now virtually
deprived of his father, his mother set about forming a marriage
connection for him, it would seem, among her relatives.

[Genesis 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 21:22</span></span>

COVENANT. ([Gen 21:22-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#022).md)

Abimelech and Phichol--Here a proof of the promise ([Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md) being fulfilled, in a native
prince wishing to form a solemn league with Abraham. The proposal was
reasonable, and agreed to \[[Gen
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#024.md)\].

[Genesis 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gen 21:25</span></span>

And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well--Wells were of great
importance to a pastoral chief and on the successful operation of
sinking a new one, the owner was solemnly informed in person. If,
however, they were allowed to get out of repair, the restorer acquired a
right to them. In unoccupied lands the possession of wells gave a right
of property in the land, and dread of this had caused the offense for
which Abraham reproved Abimelech. Some describe four, others five, wells
in Beer-sheba.

[Genesis 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 21:33</span></span>

Abraham planted a grove--Hebrew, "of tamarisks," in which sacrificial
worship was offered, as in a roofless temple.

[Genesis 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 21:34</span></span>

Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land--a picture of pastoral and an
emblem of Christian life.
