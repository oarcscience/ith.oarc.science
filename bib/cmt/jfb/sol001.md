### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 1:1</span></span>

(CANTICLE I)--THE BRIDE SEARCHING FOR AND FINDING THE KING. (Son.
1:2-2:7)

The song of songs--The most excellent of all songs, Hebrew idiom ([Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037); [Deu
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014)). A foretaste on earth of the
"new song" to be sung in glory ([Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003); [Rev
15:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002)).

Solomon's--"King of Israel," or "Jerusalem," is not added, as in the
opening of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, not because Solomon had not yet
ascended the throne \[MOODY STUART\], but because his personality is hid
under that of Christ, the true Solomon (equivalent to Prince of Peace).
The earthly Solomon is not introduced, which would break the consistency
of the allegory. Though the bride bears the chief part, the Song
throughout is not hers, but that of her "Solomon." He animates her. He
and she, the Head and the members, form but one Christ \[ADELAIDE
NEWTON\]. Aaron prefigured Him as priest; Moses, as prophet; David, as a
suffering king; Solomon, as the triumphant prince of peace. The camp in
the wilderness represents the Church in the world; the peaceful reign of
Solomon, after all enemies had been subdued, represents the Church in
heaven, of which joy the Song gives a foretaste.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 1:2</span></span>

him--abruptly. She names him not, as is natural to one whose heart is
full of some much desired friend: so Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre
([Joh 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#015)), as if everyone must know
whom she means, the one chief object of her desire ([Psa
73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025); [Mat
13:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044); [Phi
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007)).

kiss--the token of peace from the Prince of Peace ([Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020)); "our Peace" ([Psa
85:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010); [Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)).

of his mouth--marking the tenderest affection. For a king to permit his
hands, or even garment, to be kissed, was counted a great honor; but
that he should himself kiss another with his mouth is the greatest
honor. God had in times past spoken by the mouth of His prophets, who
had declared the Church's betrothal; the bride now longs for contact
with the mouth of the Bridegroom Himself ([Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012); [Luk
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#022); [Heb
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)). True of the Church before the
first advent, longing for "the hope of Israel," "the desire of all
nations"; also the awakened soul longing for the kiss of reconciliation;
and further, the kiss that is the token of the marriage contract ([Hos
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019)), and of friendship ([Sa1
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#041); [Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)).

thy love--Hebrew, "loves," namely, tokens of love, loving blandishments.

wine--which makes glad "the heavy heart" of one ready to perish, so that
he "remembers his misery no more" ([Pro
31:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006)). So, in a "better" sense,
Christ's love ([Hab 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#017)). He gives
the same praise to the bride's love, with the emphatic addition, "How
much" ([Sol 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010)). Wine was created by
His first miracle ([Joh 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#001)), and
was the pledge given of His love at the last supper. The spiritual wine
is His blood and His spirit, the "new" and better wine of the kingdom
([Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029)), which we can never drink
to "excess," as the other ([Eph 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018);
compare [Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005); [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 1:3</span></span>

Rather, "As regards the savor of thy ointments, it is good" \[MAURER\].
In [Sol 4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010), the Bridegroom
reciprocates the praise of the bride in the same terms.

thy name--Christ's character and office as the "Anointed" ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)), as "the savor of ointments" are
the graces that surround His person ([Psa
45:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)). [Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001), in its fullest sense, applies to
Him. The holy anointing oil of the high priest, which it was death for
anyone else to make (so [Act 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012)),
implies the exclusive preciousness of Messiah's name ([Exo
30:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023), [Exo
30:31-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031)). So Mary brake the box of
precious ointment over Him, appropriately ([Mar
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#005)), the broken box typifying His
body, which, when broken, diffused all grace: compounded of various
spices, &c. ([Col 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)); of sweet odor ([Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)).

poured-- ([Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012); [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)).

therefore--because of the manifestation of God's character in Christ
([Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), [Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)). So the penitent woman ([Luk
7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037), [Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)).

virgins--the pure in heart ([Co2 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002);
[Rev 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004)). The same Hebrew is
translated, "thy hidden ones" ([Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003)). The "ointment" of the Spirit
"poured forth" produces the "love of Christ" ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 1:4</span></span>

\(1\) The cry of ancient Israel for Messiah, for example, Simeon, Anna,
&c. (2) The cry of an awakened soul for the drawing of the Spirit, after
it has got a glimpse of Christ's loveliness and its own helplessness.

Draw me--The Father draws ([Joh 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044)).
The Son draws ([Jer 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003); [Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)). "Draw" here, and "Tell" ([Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007)), reverently qualify the word
"kiss" ([Sol 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#002)).

me, we--No believer desires to go to heaven alone. We are converted as
individuals; we follow Christ as joined in a communion of saints ([Joh
1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041), [Joh
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045)). Individuality and community
meet in the bride.

run--Her earnestness kindles as she prays ([Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031); [Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032), [Psa
119:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060)).

after thee--not before ([Joh 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004)).

king . . . brought me into-- ([Psa
45:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#014); [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016)). He is the anointed Priest
([Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003)); King ([Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004)).

chambers--Her prayer is answered even beyond her desires. Not only is
she permitted to run after Him, but is brought into the inmost pavilion,
where Eastern kings admitted none but the most intimate friends ([Est
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011); [Est
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/est005.htm#002); [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005)). The erection of the temple of
Solomon was the first bringing of the bride into permanent, instead of
migratory, chambers of the King. Christ's body on earth was the next
([Joh 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021)), whereby believers are
brought within the veil ([Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006);
[Heb 10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019)). Entrance into the
closet for prayer is the first step. The earnest of the future bringing
into heaven ([Joh 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003)). His chambers
are the bride's also ([Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)).
There are various chambers, plural ([Joh
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#002)).

be glad and rejoice--inward and outward rejoicing.

in thee-- ([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001), [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004)). Not in our spiritual frames
([Psa 30:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006)).

remember--rather, "commemorate with praises" ([Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007)). The mere remembrance of
spiritual joys is better than the present enjoyment of carnal ones ([Psa
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006)).

upright--rather, "uprightly," "sincerely" ([Psa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001); [Rom
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009)); so Nathanael ([Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047)); Peter ([Joh
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#017)); or "deservedly" \[MAURER\].

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 1:5</span></span>

black--namely, "as the tents of Kedar," equivalent to blackness ([Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005)). She draws the image from the
black goatskins with which the Scenite Arabs ("Kedar" was in
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a) cover their tents (contrasted with the splendid
state tent in which the King was awaiting His bride according to Eastern
custom); typifying the darkness of man's natural state. To feel this,
and yet also feel one's self in Jesus Christ "comely as the curtains of
Solomon," marks the believer ([Rom
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018), &c.; [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)); [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015), "I am chief"; so she says not
merely, "I was," but "I am"; still black in herself, but comely through
His comeliness put upon her ([Eze
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014)).

curtains--first, the hangings and veil in the temple of Solomon ([Eze
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010)); then, also, the "fine linen
which is the righteousness of saints" ([Rev
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008)), the white wedding garment
provided by Jesus Christ ([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010);
[Mat 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#011); [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028); [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010); [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)). Historically, the dark tents of
Kedar represent the Gentile Church ([Isa
60:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003), &c.). As the vineyard at the
close is transferred from the Jews, who had not kept their own, to the
Gentiles, so the Gentiles are introduced at the commencement of the
Song; for they were among the earliest enquirers after Jesus Christ
([Mat 2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)): the wise men from the
East (Arabia, or Kedar).

daughters of Jerusalem--professors, not the bride, or "the virgins," yet
not enemies; invited to gospel blessings ([Sol
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010)); so near to Jesus Christ as
not to be unlikely to find Him ([Sol
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008)); desirous to seek Him with her
([Sol 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001); compare [Sol
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013); [Sol
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001), [Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005), [Sol
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008)). In [Sol
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008), the bride's Beloved becomes
their Beloved; not, however, of all of them ([Sol
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004); compare [Luk
23:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#027)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 1:6</span></span>

She feels as if her blackness was so great as to be gazed at by all.

mother's children-- ([Mat 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036)). She
is to forget "her own people and her father's house," that is, the
worldly connections of her unregenerate state ([Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010)); they had maltreated her ([Luk
15:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015)). Children of the same
mother, but not the same father \[MAURER\], ([Joh
8:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#041)). They made her a common
keeper of vineyards, whereby the sun looked upon, that is, burnt her;
thus she did "not keep her own" vineyard, that is, fair beauty. So the
world, and the soul ([Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026); [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025)). The believer has to watch
against the same danger ([Co1 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027)).
So he will be able, instead of the self-reproach here, to say as in [Sol
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#012).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 1:7</span></span>

my soul loveth--more intense than "the virgins" and "the upright love
thee" ([Sol 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003); [Mat
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037)). To carry out the design of the
allegory, the royal encampment is here represented as moving from place
to place, in search of green pastures, under the Shepherd King ([Psa
23:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001)). The bride, having first
enjoyed communion with him in the pavilion, is willing to follow Him
into labors and dangers; arising from all absorbing love ([Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)); this distinguishes her from
the formalist ([Joh 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004)).

feedest--tendest thy flock ([Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011); [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020); [Pe1
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004); [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017)). No single type expresses all
the office of Jesus Christ; hence arises the variety of diverse images
used to portray the manifold aspects of Him: these would be quite
incongruous, if the Song referred to the earthly Solomon. Her
intercourse with Him is peculiar. She hears His voice, and addresses
none but Himself. Yet it is through a veil; she sees Him not ([Job
23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008)). If we would be fed, we must
follow the Shepherd through the whole breadth of His Word, and not stay
on one spot alone.

makest . . . to rest--distinct from "feedest"; periods of rest are
vouchsafed after labor ([Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006); [Isa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010); [Eze
34:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013)). Communion in private must
go along with public following of Him.

turneth aside--rather one veiled, that is, as a harlot, not His true
bride ([Gen 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#015)), \[GESENIUS\]; or
as a mourner ([Sa2 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)), \[WEISS\];
or as one unknown \[MAURER\]. All imply estrangement from the
Bridegroom. She feels estranged even among Christ's true servants,
answering to "thy companions" ([Luk
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#028)), so long as she has not Himself
present. The opposite spirit to [Co1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 1:8</span></span>

If--she ought to have known ([Joh
14:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008)). The confession of her
ignorance and blackness ([Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005))
leads Him to call her "fairest" ([Mat
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020)). Her jealousy of letting even
"His companions" take the place of Himself ([Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007)) led her too far. He directs her
to follow them, as they follow Him ([Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001); [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010), [Heb
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#012)); to use ordinances and the
ministry; where they are, He is ([Jer
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016); [Mat
18:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025)). Indulging in isolation is not
the way to find Him. It was thus, literally, that Zipporah found her
bridegroom ([Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016)). The bride
unhesitatingly asks the watchmen afterwards ([Sol
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#003)).

kids-- ([Joh 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015)). Christ is to be
found in active ministrations, as well as in prayer ([Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025)).

shepherds' tents--ministers in the sanctuary ([Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 1:9</span></span>

horses in Pharaoh's chariots--celebrated for beauty, swiftness, and
ardor, at the Red Sea ([Exo 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015)).
These qualities, which seem to belong to the ungodly, really belong to
the saints \[MOODY STUART\]. The allusion may be to the horses brought
at a high price by Solomon out of Egypt ([Ch2
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#016)). So the bride is redeemed out
of spiritual Egypt by the true Solomon, at an infinite price ([Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001); [Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018)). But the deliverance from
Pharaoh at the Red Sea accords with the allusion to the tabernacle ([Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005); [Sol
3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006)); it rightly is put at the
beginning of the Church's call. The ardor and beauty of the bride are
the point of comparison; ([Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004))
"run"; ([Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)) "comely." Also, like
Pharaoh's horses, she forms a great company ([Rev
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007), [Rev
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014)). As Jesus Christ is both
Shepherd and Conqueror, so believers are not only His sheep, but also,
as a Church militant now, His chariots and horses ([Sol
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#004)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 1:10</span></span>

rows of jewels-- ([Eze 16:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011)).
OLERIUS says, Persian ladies wear two or three rows of pearls round the
head, beginning on the forehead and descending down to the cheeks and
under the chin, so that their faces seem to be set in pearls ([Eze
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#011)). The comparison of the horses
([Sol 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009)) implies the vital energy of
the bride; this verse, her superadded graces ([Pro
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#009); [Pro
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#009); [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009); [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)).

We--the Trinity implied by the Holy Ghost, whether it was so by the
writer of the Song or not ([Gen 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026);
[Pro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030); [Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004)). "The Jews acknowledged God as
king, and Messiah as king, in interpreting the Song, but did not know
that these two are one" \[LEIGHTON\].

make--not merely give ([Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)).

borders of gold, with studs of silver--that is, "spots of silver"--Jesus
Christ delights to give more "to him that hath" ([Mat
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029)). He crowns His own work in us
([Isa 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#012)). The "borders" here are
equivalent to "rows" ([Sol 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#010)); but
here, the King seems to give the finish to her attire, by adding a crown
(borders, or circles) of gold studded with silver spots, as in [Est
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#017). Both the royal and nuptial
crown, or chaplet. The Hebrew for "spouse" ([Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008)) is a crowned one ([Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)). The crown is given at once upon
conversion, in title, but in sensible possession afterwards ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)).

While--It is the presence of the Sun of Righteousness that draws out the
believer's odors of grace. It was the sight of Him at table that caused
the two women to bring forth their ointments for Him ([Luk
7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037); [Joh
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#003); [Co2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015)). Historically fulfilled ([Mat
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#011)); spiritually ([Rev
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#020)); and in church worship ([Mat
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020)); and at the Lord's Supper
especially, for here public communion with Him at table amidst His
friends is spoken of, as [Sol 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004)
refers to private communion ([Co1
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#016), [Co1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)); typically ([Exo
24:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009)); the future perfect
fulfilment ([Luk 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030); [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009)). The allegory supposes the King
to have stopped in His movements and to be seated with His friends on
the divan. What grace that a table should be prepared for us, while
still militant ([Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005))!

my spikenard--not boasting, but owning the Lord's grace to and in her.
The spikenard is a lowly herb, the emblem of humility. She rejoices that
He is well pleased with her graces, His own work ([Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 1:13</span></span>

bundle of myrrh--abundant preciousness (Greek), ([Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)). Even a little myrrh was costly;
much more a bundle ([Col 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).
BURROWES takes it of a scent-box filled with liquid myrrh; the liquid
obtained by incision gave the tree its chief value.

he--rather, "it"; it is the myrrh that lies in the bosom, as the cluster
of camphire is in the vineyards ([Sol
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014)).

all night--an undivided heart ([Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017); contrast [Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014); [Eze
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015), [Eze
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#030)). Yet on account of the
everlasting covenant, God restores the adulteress ([Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060), [Eze
16:62](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#062); [Hos
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002), &c.). The night is the whole
present dispensation till the everlasting day dawns ([Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)). Also, literally, "night" ([Psa
119:147-148](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147)), the night of affliction
([Psa 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 1:14</span></span>

cluster--Jesus Christ is one, yet manifold in His graces.

camphire--or, "cypress." The "hennah" is meant, whose odorous flowers
grow in clusters, of a color white and yellow softly blended; its bark
is dark, the foliage light green. Women deck their persons with them.
The loveliness of Jesus Christ.

vineyards--appropriate in respect to Him who is "the vine." The
spikenard was for the banquet ([Sol
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#012)); the myrrh was in her bosom
continually ([Sol 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013)); the camphire
is in the midst of natural beauties, which, though lovely, are eclipsed
by the one cluster, Jesus Christ, pre-eminent above them all.

En-gedi--in South Palestine, near the Dead Sea ([Jos
15:62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062); [Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010)), famed for aromatic shrubs.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sol 1:15</span></span>

fair--He discerns beauty in her, who had said, "I am black" ([Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)), because of the everlasting
covenant ([Psa 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Eph
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)).

doves' eyes--large and beautiful in the doves of Syria. The prominent
features of her beauty ([Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016)),
gentleness, innocence, and constant love, emblem of the Holy Ghost, who
changes us to His own likeness ([Gen
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#010); [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016)). The opposite kind of eyes ([Psa
101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005); [Mat
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015); [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 1:16</span></span>

Reply of the Bride. She presumes to call Him beloved, because He called
her so first. Thou callest me "fair"; if I am so, it is not in myself;
it is all from Thee ([Psa 90:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#017)); but
Thou art fair in Thyself ([Psa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002)).

pleasant-- ([Pro 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017)) towards Thy
friends ([Sa2 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#026)).

bed . . . green--the couch of green grass on which the King and His
bride sit to "rest at noon." Thus her prayer in [Sol
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#007) is here granted; a green oasis in
the desert, always found near waters in the East ([Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002); [Isa
41:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017)). The scene is a kiosk, or
summer house. Historically, the literal resting of the Babe of
Beth-lehem and his parents on the green grass provided for cattle ([Luk
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007), [Luk
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#012)). In this verse there is an
incidental allusion, in [Sol 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#015), to
the offering ([Luk 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024)). So the
"cedar and fir" ceiling refers to the temple ([Kg1
5:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#006); [Kg1
6:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#015)); type of the heavenly temple
([Rev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 1:17</span></span>

our house--see on [Sol 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#016); but
primarily, the kiosk ([Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)),
"His rest." Cedar is pleasing to the eye and smell, hard, and never
eaten by worms.

fir--rather, "cypress," which is hard, durable, and fragrant, of a
reddish hue \[GESENIUS, WEISS, and MAURER\]. Contrasted with the
shifting "tents" ([Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005)), His house
is "our house" ([Psa 92:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013); [Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019); [Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006)). Perfect oneness of Him and the
bride ([Joh 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#020); [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)). There is the shelter of a
princely roof from the sun ([Psa
121:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#006)), without the confinement of
walls, and amidst rural beauties. The carved ceiling represents the
wondrous excellencies of His divine nature.
