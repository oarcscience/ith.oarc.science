### [Malachi Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)

[Malachi](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">mal 0:0</span></span>

MALACHI forms the transition link between the two dispensations, the Old
and the New, "the skirt and boundary of Christianity" \[TERTULLIAN\], to
which perhaps is due the abrupt earnestness which characterizes his
prophecies. His very name is somewhat uncertain. Malachi is the name of
an office, rather than a person, "My messenger," and as such is found in
[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md). The Septuagint favors this
view in [Mal 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md); translate, not "by
Malachi," but "by the hand of His messenger" (compare [Hag
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#013).md). Malachi is the last inspired
messenger of the Old Testament, announcing the advent of the Great
Messenger of the New Testament. The Chaldee paraphrase identifies him
with Ezra wrongly, as Ezra is never called a prophet but a scribe, and
Malachi never a scribe but a prophet. Still it hence appears that
Malachi was by some old authorities not regarded as a proper name. The
analogy of the headings of other prophets, however, favors the common
view that Malachi is a proper name. As Haggai and Zechariah, the
contemporary prophets, supported Joshua and Zerubbabel in the building
of the temple, so he at a subsequent period supported the priest Ezra
and the governor Nehemiah. Like that ruler, he presupposes the temple to
have been already built ([Mal 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#010.md);
[Mal 3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md). Both alike censure the
abuses still unreformed ([Neh 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#005.md),
Neh. 13:15-30, the profane and mercenary character of the priests, the
people's marriages contracted with foreigners, the non-payment of the
tithes, and want of sympathy towards the poor on the part of the rich
([Neh 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#007).md) implies that Nehemiah was
supported by prophets in his work of reformation. The date thus will be
about 420 B.C., or later. Both the periods after the captivity (that of
Haggai and Zechariah, and that of Malachi) were marked by royal,
priestly, and prophetic men at the head of God's people. The former
period was that of the building of the temple; the latter, that of the
restoration of the people and rebuilding of the city. It is
characteristic of the people of God that the first period after the
restoration was exclusively devoted to the rebuilding of the temple; the
political restoration came secondarily. Only a colony of fifty thousand
settled with Joshua and Zerubbabel in Palestine ([Ezr
2:64](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#064).md). Even these became intermingled
with the heathen around during the sixty years passed over by Ezra in
silence ([Ezr 9:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006.md); [Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003).md). Hence a second restoration was
needed which should mould the national life into a Jewish form,
re-establishing the holy law and the holy city--a work effected by Ezra
and Nehemiah, with the aid of Malachi, in a period of about half a
century, ending with the deaths of Malachi and Nehemiah in the last ten
years of the fifth century B.C.; that is, the "seven weeks" ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md) put in the beginning of the
"seventy" by themselves, to mark the fundamental difference between
them, the last period of Old Testament revelation, and the period which
followed without any revelation (the sixty-two weeks), preceding the
final week standing out in unrivalled dignity by itself as the time of
Messiah's appearing. The seventy weeks thus begin with the seventh year
of Artaxerxes who allowed Ezra to go to Jerusalem, 457 B.C., in
accordance with the commandment which then went forth from God. Ezra the
priest performed the inner work of purifying the nation from heathenish
elements and reintroducing the law; while Nehemiah did the outer work of
rebuilding the city and restoring the national polity \[AUBERLEN\].
VITRINGA makes the date of Malachi's prophecies to be about the second
return of Nehemiah from Persia, not later than 424 B.C., the date of
Artaxerxes' death ([Neh 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#006).md). About
this time Socrates was teaching the only approach to a pure morality
which corrupt Athens ever knew. MOORE distinguishes six portions: (1)
Charge against Israel for insensibility to God's love, which so
distinguished Israel above Edom ([Mal
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001)). (2.md) The priests are reproved
for neglect and profanation (Mal. 1:6-2:9). (3) Mixed marriages, and the
wrongs done to Jewish wives, are reproved ([Mal
2:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010)). (4.md) Coming of Messiah and
His forerunners (Mal. 2:17-3:6). (5) Reproof for tithes withheld ([Mal
3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007)). (6.md) Contrast between the
godly and the ungodly at the present time, and in the future judgment;
exhortation, therefore, to return to the law (Mal. 3:13-4:6).

The style is animated, but less grand, and the rhythm less marked, than
in some of the older prophets.

The canonicity of the book is established by the references to it in the
New Testament ([Mat 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010.md); [Mat
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#012.md); [Mar
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#002.md); [Mar
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#011.md); [Luk
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md); [Rom
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013).md).
