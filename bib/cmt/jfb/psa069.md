### [Psalms Chapter 69](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 69:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 69:1</span></span>

Upon Shoshannim--(See on [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md),
title). Mingling the language of prayer and complaint, the sufferer,
whose condition is here set forth, pleads for God's help as one
suffering in His cause, implores the divine retribution on his malicious
enemies, and, viewing his deliverance as sure, promises praise by
himself, and others, to whom God will extend like blessings. This Psalm
is referred to seven times in the New Testament as prophetical of Christ
and the gospel times. Although the character in which the Psalmist
appears to some in [Psa 69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005.md) is that
of a sinner, yet his condition as a sufferer innocent of alleged crimes
sustains the typical character of the composition, and it may be
therefore regarded throughout, as the twenty-second, as typically
expressive of the feelings of our Saviour in the flesh. (Psa. 69:1-36)

(Compare [Psa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002).md).

come in unto my soul--literally, "come even to my soul," endanger my
life by drowning ([Jon 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 69:3</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006).md).

mine eyes fail--in watching ([Psa
119:82](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#082).md).

[Psalms 69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 69:4</span></span>

hate me, &c.--(Compare [Joh 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025).md). On
the number and power of his enemies (compare [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012).md).

then I restored . . . away--that is, he suffered wrongfully under the
imputation of robbery.

[Psalms 69:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 69:5</span></span>

This may be regarded as an appeal, vindicating his innocence, as if he
had said, "If sinful, thou knowest," &c. Though David's condition as a
sufferer may typify Christ's, without requiring that a parallel be found
in character.

[Psalms 69:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 69:6</span></span>

for my sake--literally, "in me," in my confusion and shame.

[Psalms 69:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 69:7</span></span>

This plea contemplates his relation to God as a sufferer in His cause.
Reproach, domestic estrangement ([Mar
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021.md); [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005).md), exhaustion in God's service
([Joh 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017).md), revilings and taunts of
base men were the sufferings.

[Psalms 69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 69:10</span></span>

wept (and chastened) my soul--literally, "wept away my soul," a strongly
figurative description of deep grief.

[Psalms 69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 69:12</span></span>

sit in the gate--public place ([Pro
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#031).md).

[Psalms 69:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 69:13</span></span>

With increasing reliance on God, he prays for help, describing his
distress in the figures of [Psa
69:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md).

[Psalms 69:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 69:16</span></span>

These earnest terms are often used, and the address to God, as
indifferent or averse, is found in [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md); [Psa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md); [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009.md), &c.

[Psalms 69:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 69:19</span></span>

Calling God to witness his distress, he presents its aggravation
produced by the want of sympathizing friends (compare [Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md); [Mar
14:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#050).md).

[Psalms 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 69:21</span></span>

Instead of such, his enemies increase his pain by giving him most
distasteful food and drink. The Psalmist may have thus described by
figure what Christ found in reality (compare [Joh
19:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#029).md).

[Psalms 69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 69:22</span></span>

With unimportant verbal changes, this language is used by Paul to
describe the rejection of the Jews who refused to receive the Saviour
([Rom 11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009).md). The purport of the
figures used is that blessings shall become curses, the "table" of joy
(as one of food) a "snare," their

welfare--literally, "peaceful condition," or security, a "trap."
Darkened eyes and failing strength complete the picture of the ruin
falling on them under the invoked retribution.

[Psalms 69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 69:23</span></span>

continually to shake--literally, "to swerve" or bend in weakness.

[Psalms 69:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 69:24</span></span>

An utter desolation awaits them. They will not only be driven from their
homes, but their homes--or, literally, "palaces," indicative of
wealth--shall be desolate (compare [Mat
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038).md).

[Psalms 69:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 69:26</span></span>

Though smitten of God ([Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md), men
were not less guilty in persecuting the sufferer ([Act
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023).md).

talk to the grief--in respect to, about it, implying derision and
taunts.

wounded--or, literally, "mortally wounded."

[Psalms 69:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 69:27</span></span>

iniquity--or, "punishment of iniquity" ([Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012).md).

come . . . righteousness--partake of its benefits.

[Psalms 69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 69:28</span></span>

book of the living--or "life," with the next clause, a figurative mode
of representing those saved, as having their names in a register
(compare [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Isa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 69:29</span></span>

poor and sorrowful--the afflicted pious, often denoted by such terms
(compare [Psa 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005).md).

set me . . . high--out of danger.

[Psalms 69:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 69:30</span></span>

Spiritual are better than mere material offerings ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md); [Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008).md); hence a promise of the former,
and rather contemptuous terms are used of the latter.

[Psalms 69:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 69:32</span></span>

Others shall rejoice. "Humble" and poor, as in [Psa
69:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md).

your heart, &c.--address to such (compare [Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026).md).

[Psalms 69:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 69:33</span></span>

prisoners--peculiarly liable to be despised.

[Psalms 69:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 69:34</span></span>

The call on the universe for praise is well sustained by the prediction
of the perpetual and extended blessings which shall come upon the
covenant-people of God. Though, as usual, the imagery is taken from
terms used of Palestine, the whole tenor of the context indicates that
the spiritual privileges and blessings of the Church are meant.
