### [Revelation Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 2:1</span></span>

EPISTLES TO EPHESUS, SMYRNA, PERGAMOS, THYATIRA. (Rev. 2:1-29)

Ephesus--famed for the temple of Diana, one of the seven wonders of the
world. For three years Paul labored there. He subsequently ordained
Timothy superintending overseer or bishop there: probably his charge was
but of a temporary nature. John, towards the close of his life, took it
as the center from which he superintended the province.

holdeth--Greek, "holdeth fast," as in [Rev
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025.md); [Rev
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#011.md); compare [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md). The title of Christ here as
"holding fast the seven stars (from [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md) : only that, for having is
substituted holding fast in His grasp), and walking in the midst of the
seven candlesticks," accords with the beginning of His address to the
seven churches representing the universal Church. Walking expresses His
unwearied activity in the Church, guarding her from internal and
external evils, as the high priest moved to and fro in the sanctuary.

[Revelation 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 2:2</span></span>

I know thy works--expressing His omniscience. Not merely "thy
professions, desires, good resolutions" ([Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013), end.md).

thy labour--Two oldest manuscripts omit "thy"; one supports it. The
Greek means "labor unto weariness."

patience--persevering endurance.

bear--evil men are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as
intolerable. We are to "bear (the same Greek, [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002).md) one another's burdens" in the
case of weak brethren; but not to bear false brethren.

tried--by experiment; not the Greek for "test," as [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md). The apostolical churches had the
miraculous gift of discerning spirits. Compare [Act
20:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md), wherein Paul presciently
warned the Ephesian elders of the coming false teachers, as also in
writing to Timothy at Ephesus. TERTULLIAN \[On Baptism, 17\], and JEROME
\[On Illustrious Men, in Lucca 7\], record of John, that when a writing,
professing to be a canonical history of the acts of Paul, had been
composed by a presbyter of Ephesus, John convicted the author and
condemned the work. So on one occasion he would not remain under the
same roof with Cerinthus the heretic.

say they are apostles--probably Judaizers. IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the
Ephesians, 6\], says subsequently, "Onesimus praises exceedingly your
good discipline that no heresy dwells among you"; and \[Epistle to the
Ephesians, 9\], "Ye did not permit those having evil doctrine to sow
their seed among you, but closed your ears."

[Revelation 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 2:3</span></span>

borne . . . patience--The oldest manuscripts transpose these words. Then
translate as Greek, "persevering endurance . . . borne." "Thou hast
borne" My reproach, but "thou canst not bear the evil" ([Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002).md). A beautiful antithesis.

and . . . hast laboured, and hast not fainted--The two oldest
manuscripts and oldest versions read, "and . . . hast not labored,"
omitting "and hast fainted." The difficulty which transcribers by
English Version reading tried to obviate, was the seeming contradiction,
"I know thy labor . . . and thou hast not labored." But what is meant
is, "Thou hast not been wearied out with labor."

[Revelation 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 2:4</span></span>

somewhat . . . because--Translate, "I have against thee (this) that,"
&c. It is not a mere somewhat"; it is everything. How characteristic of
our gracious Lord, that He puts foremost all He can find to approve, and
only after this notes the shortcomings!

left thy first love--to Christ. Compare [Ti1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md), "cast off their first faith."
See the Ephesians' first love, [Eph
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md). This epistle was written under
Domitian, when thirty years had elapsed since Paul had written his
Epistle to them. Their warmth of love had given place to a lifeless
orthodoxy. Compare Paul's view of faith so called without love, [Co1
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002.md).

[Revelation 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 2:5</span></span>

whence--from what a height.

do the first works--the works which flowed from thy first love. Not
merely "feel thy first feelings," but do works flowing from the same
principle as formerly, "faith which worketh by love."

I will come--Greek, "I am coming" in special judgment on thee.

quickly--omitted in two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate and Coptic versions:
supported by one oldest manuscript.

remove thy candlestick out of his place--I will take away the Church
from Ephesus and remove it elsewhere. "It is removal of the candlestick,
not extinction of the candle, which is threatened here; judgment for
some, but that very judgment the occasion of mercy for others. So it has
been. The seat of the Church has been changed, but the Church itself
survives. What the East has lost, the West has gained. One who lately
visited Ephesus found only three Christians there, and these so ignorant
as scarcely to have heard the names of St. Paul or St. John" \[TRENCH\].

[Revelation 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 2:6</span></span>

But--How graciously, after necessary censure, He returns to praise for
our consolation, and as an example to us, that we would show, when we
reprove, we have more pleasure in praising than in fault-finding.

hatest the deeds--We should hate men's evil deeds, not hate the men
themselves.

Nicolaitanes--IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 1.26.3\] and TERTULLIAN
\[Prescription against Heretics, 46\] make these followers of Nicolas,
one of the seven (honorably mentioned, [Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md), [Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005).md). They (CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 2.20 3.4\] and EPIPHANIUS \[Heresies, 25\]) evidently
confound the latter Gnostic Nicolaitanes, or followers of one Nicolaos,
with those of Revelation. MICHAELIS' view is probable: Nicolaos
(conqueror of the people) is the Greek version of Balaam, from Hebrew
"Belang Am," "Destroyer of the people." Revelation abounds in such
duplicate Hebrew and Greek names: as Apollyon, Abaddon: Devil, Satan:
Yea (Greek, "Nai"), Amen. The name, like other names, Egypt, Babylon,
Sodom, is symbolic. Compare [Rev
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md), which shows the true sense of
Nicolaitanes; they are not a sect, but professing Christians who, like
Balaam of old. tried to introduce into the Church a false freedom, that
is, licentiousness; this was a reaction in the opposite direction from
Judaism, the first danger to the Church combated in the council of
Jerusalem, and by Paul in the Epistle to Galatians. These symbolical
Nicolaitanes, or followers of Balaam, abused Paul's doctrine of the
grace of God into a plea for lasciviousness ([Pe2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md), [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md), [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md) who both describe the same sort
of seducers as followers of Balaam). The difficulty that they should
appropriate a name branded with infamy in Scripture is met by TRENCH:
The Antinomian Gnostics were so opposed to John as a Judaizing apostle
that they would assume as a name of chiefest honor one which John
branded with dishonor.

[Revelation 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 2:7</span></span>

He that hath an ear--This clause precedes the promise in the first three
addresses, succeeds it in the last four. Thus the promises are enclosed
on both sides with the precept urging the deepest attention as to the
most momentous truths. Every man "hath an ear" naturally, but he alone
will be able to hear spiritually to whom God has given "the hearing
ear"; whose "ear God hath wakened" and "opened." Compare "Faith, the
ears of the soul" \[CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA\].

the Spirit saith--What Christ saith, the Spirit saith; so one are the
Second and Third Persons.

unto the churches--not merely to the particular, but to the universal
Church.

overcometh--In John's Gospel ([Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033).md) and First Epistle ([Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); [Jo1
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md) an object follows, namely, "the
world," "the wicked one." Here, where the final issue is spoken of, the
conqueror is named absolutely. Paul uses a similar image ([Co1
9:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md); but not the same as John's
phrase, except [Rom 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021).md).

will I give--as the Judge. The tree of life in Paradise, lost by the
fall, is restored by the Redeemer. Allusions to it occur in [Pro
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018.md); [Pro
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#030.md); [Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012.md); [Pro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#004.md), and prophetically, [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md); [Eze
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md); compare [Joh
6:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md). It is interesting to note how
closely these introductory addresses are linked to the body of
Revelation. Thus, the tree of life here, with [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md); deliverance from the second
death ([Rev 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011).md), with [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md); [Rev
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md); the new name ([Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).md), with [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md); power over the nations, with
[Rev 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md); the morning star ([Rev
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028).md), with [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md); the white raiment ([Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005).md), with [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md); [Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015.md); the name in the book of life
([Rev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005).md), with [Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md); [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015.md); the new Jerusalem and its
citizenship ([Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md), with [Rev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010.md).

give . . . tree of life--The thing promised corresponds to the kind of
faithfulness manifested. They who refrain from Nicolaitane indulgences
([Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006).md) and idol-meats ([Rev
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md), shall eat of meat infinitely
superior, namely, the fruit of the tree of life, and the hidden manna
([Rev 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).md).

in the midst of the paradise--The oldest manuscripts omit "the midst
of." In [Gen 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#009.md) these words are
appropriate, for there were other trees in the garden, but not in the
midst of it. Here the tree of life is simply in the paradise, for no
other tree is mentioned in it; in [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md) the tree of life is "in the midst
of the street of Jerusalem"; from this the clause was inserted here.
Paradise (a Persian, or else Semitic word), originally used of any
garden of delight; then specially of Eden; then the temporary abode of
separate souls in bliss; then "the Paradise of God," the third heaven,
the immediate presence of God.

of God-- ([Eze 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013).md). One oldest
manuscript, with Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic, and CYPRIAN, read, "MY
God," as in [Rev 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md). So Christ calls
God, "My God and your God" ([Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md); compare [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017).md). God is our God, in virtue of
being peculiarly Christ's God. The main bliss of Paradise is that it is
the Paradise of God; God Himself dwelling there ([Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

[Revelation 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 2:8</span></span>

Smyrna--in Ionia, a little to the north of Ephesus. POLYCARP, martyred
in A.D. 168, eighty-six years after his conversion, was bishop, and
probably "the angel of the Church in Smyrna" meant here. The allusions
to persecutions and faithfulness unto death accord with this view.
IGNATIUS \[The Martyrdom of Ignatius 3\], on his way to martyrdom in
Rome, wrote to POLYCARP, then (A.D. 108) bishop of Smyrna; if his
bishopric commenced ten or twelve years earlier, the dates will
harmonize. TERTULLIAN \[The Prescription against Heretics, 32\], and
IRENÃ†US, who had talked with POLYCARP in youth, tell us POLYCARP was
consecrated bishop of Smyrna by St. John.

the first . . . the last . . . was dead . . . is alive--The attributes
of Christ most calculated to comfort the Church of Smyrna under its
persecutions; resumed from [Rev
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md). As death was to Him but the
gate to life eternal, so it is to be to them ([Rev
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010).md).

[Revelation 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 2:9</span></span>

thy works, and--omitted in two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, and Coptic.
Supported by one oldest manuscript.

tribulation--owing to persecution.

poverty--owing to "the spoiling of their goods."

but thou art rich--in grace. Contrast Laodicea, rich in the world's eyes
and her own, poor before God. "There are both poor rich-men, and rich
poor-men in God's sight" \[TRENCH\].

blasphemy of them--blasphemous calumny of thee on the part of (or
arising from) them.

say they are Jews, and are not--Jews by national descent, but not
spiritually of "the true circumcision." The Jews blaspheme Christ as
"the hanged one." As elsewhere, so at Smyrna they bitterly opposed
Christianity; and at POLYCARP'S martyrdom they joined the heathens in
clamoring for his being cast to the lions; and when there was an
obstacle to this, for his being burnt alive; and with their own hands
they carried logs for the pile.

synagogue of Satan--Only once is the term "synagogue" in the New
Testament used of the Christian assembly, and that by the apostle who
longest maintained the union of the Church and Jewish Synagogue. As the
Jews more and more opposed Christianity, and it more and more rooted
itself in the Gentile world, the term "synagogue" was left altogether to
the former, and Christians appropriated exclusively the honorable term
"Church"; contrast an earlier time when the Jewish theocracy is called
"the Church in the wilderness." Compare [Num
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#003.md); [Num
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#004.md), "congregation of the Lord." Even
in [Jam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md) it is "your (not the
Lord's) assembly." The Jews, who might have been "the Church of God,"
had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of
Satan. So "the throne of Satan" ([Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013).md) represents the heathens'
opposition to Christianity; "the depths of Satan" ([Rev
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024).md), the opposition of heretics.

[Revelation 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 2:10</span></span>

Fear none, &c.--the oldest manuscripts read, "Fear not those things,"
&c. "The Captain of our salvation never keeps back what those who
faithfully witness for Him may have to bear for His name's sake; never
entices recruits by the promise they shall find all things easy and
pleasant there" \[TRENCH\].

devil--"the accuser." He acted, through Jewish accusers against Christ
and His people. The conflict of the latter was not with mere flesh and
blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world.

tried--with temptation by "the devil." The same event is often both a
temptation from the devil, and a trial from God--God sifting and
winnowing the man to separate his chaff from his wheat, the devil
sifting him in the hope that nothing but chaff will be found in him
\[TRENCH\].

ten days--not the ten persecutions from Nero to Diocletian. LYRA
explains ten years on the year-day principle. The shortness of the
duration of the persecution is evidently made the ground of consolation.
The time of trial shall be short, the duration of your joy shall be for
ever. Compare the use of "ten days" for a short time, [Gen
24:55](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#055.md); [Num
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#019.md). Ten is the number of the world
powers hostile to the Church; compare the ten horns of the beast, [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md).

unto death--so as even to endure death for My sake.

crown of life-- [Jam 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md), "crown of righteousness"; [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md), "crown of glory." The crown is
the garland, the mark of a conqueror, or of one rejoicing, or at a
feast; but diadem is the mark of a KING.

[Revelation 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 2:11</span></span>

shall not be hurt--Greek, "shall not by any means (or possibly) be
hurt."

the second death--"the lake of fire." "The death in life of the lost, as
contrasted with the life in death of the saved" \[TRENCH\]. The phrase
"the second death" is peculiar to the Apocalypse. What matter about the
first death, which sooner or later must pass over us, if we escape the
second death? "It seems that they who die that death shall be hurt by
it; whereas, if it were annihilation, and so a conclusion of their
torments, it would be no way hurtful, but highly beneficial to them. But
the living torments are the second death" \[BISHOP PEARSON\]. "The life
of the damned is death" \[AUGUSTINE\]. Smyrna (meaning myrrh) yielded
its sweet perfume in being bruised even to death. Myrrh was used in
embalming dead bodies ([Joh 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#039).md);
was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil ([Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023).md); a perfume of the heavenly
Bridegroom ([Psa 45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008).md), and of the
bride ([Sol 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#006).md). "Affliction, like
it, is bitter for the time being, but salutary; preserving the elect
from corruption, and seasoning them for immortality, and gives scope for
the exercise of the fragrantly breathing Christian virtues"
\[VITRINGA\]. POLYCARP'S noble words to his heathen judges who wished
him to recant, are well known: "Fourscore and six years have I served
the Lord, and He never wronged me, how then can I blaspheme my King and
Saviour?" Smyrna's faithfulness is rewarded by its candlestick not
having been removed out of its place ([Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005).md); Christianity has never wholly
left it; whence the Turks call it, "Infidel Smyrna."

[Revelation 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 2:12</span></span>

TRENCH prefers writing Pergamus, or rather, Pergamum, on the river
Caicus. It was capital of Attalus the Second's kingdom, which was
bequeathed by him to the Romans, 133 B.C. Famous for its library,
founded by Eumenes (197-159), and destroyed by Caliph Omar. Parchment,
that is, Pergamena charta, was here discovered for book purposes. Also
famous for the magnificent temple of Ã†sculapius, the healing god
\[TACITUS, Annals, 3.63\].

he which hath the sharp sword with two edges--appropriate to His address
having a twofold bearing, a searching power so as to convict and convert
some ([Rev 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md), [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).md), and to convict and condemn to
punishment others ([Rev 2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014.md),
especially [Rev 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016.md); compare also see
on [Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016).md).

[Revelation 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 2:13</span></span>

I know thy works--Two oldest manuscripts omit this clause; one oldest
manuscript retains it.

Satan's seat--rather as the Greek is translated all through Revelation,
"throne." Satan, in impious mimicry of God's heavenly throne, sets up
his earthly throne ([Rev 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002).md).
Ã†sculapius was worshipped there under the serpent form; and Satan, the
old serpent, as the instigator (compare [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010).md) of fanatical devotees of
Ã†sculapius, and, through them, of the supreme magistracy at Pergamos,
persecuted one of the Lord's people (Antipas) even to death. Thus, this
address is an anticipatory preface to Rev. 12:1-17; Note: "throne . . .
the dragon, Satan . . . war with her seed," [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md), [Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md), [Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md).

even in those days--Two oldest manuscripts omit "even"; two retain it.

wherein--Two oldest manuscripts omit this (then translate, "in the days
of Antipas, My faithful witness," or "martyr"); two retain it. Two
oldest manuscripts read, "My witness, MY faithful one"; two read as
English Version. Antipas is another form for Antipater. SIMEON
METAPHRASTES has a palpably legendary story, unknown to the early
Fathers, that Antipas, in Domitian's reign, was shut up in a red-hot
brazen bull, and ended his life in thanksgivings and prayers.
HENGSTENBERG makes the name, like other apocalyptic names, symbolical,
meaning one standing out "against all" for Christ's sake.

hold the doctrine of Balaam--"the teaching of Balaam," namely, that
which he "taught Balak." Compare "the counsel of Balaam," [Num
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md). "Balak" is dative in the Greek,
whence BENGEL translates, "taught (the Moabites) for (that is, to
please) Balak." But though in Numbers it is not expressly said he taught
Balak, yet there is nothing said inconsistent with his having done so;
and JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities,4. 6. 6\], says he did so. The dative case is
a Hebraism for the accusative case.

children--Greek, "sons of Israel."

stumbling-block--literally, that part of a trap on which the bait was
laid, and which, when touched, caused the trap to close on its prey;
then any entanglement to the foot \[TRENCH\].

eat things sacrificed unto idols--the act common to the Israelites of
old, and the Nicolaitanes in John's day; he does not add what was
peculiar to the Israelites, namely, that they sacrificed to idols. The
temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the Gentile
converts. For not to do so involved almost a withdrawal from partaking
of any social meal with the heathen around. For idol-meats, after a part
had been offered in sacrifice, were nearly sure to be on the heathen
entertainer's table; so much so, that the Greek "to kill" (thuein) meant
originally "to sacrifice." Hence arose the decree of the council of
Jerusalem forbidding to eat such meats; subsequently some at Corinth ate
unscrupulously and knowingly of such meats, on the ground that the idol
is nothing; others needlessly tortured themselves with scruples, lest
unknowingly they should eat of them when they got meat from the market
or in a heathen friend's house. Paul handles the question in [Co1
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md); [Co1
10:25-33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025.md).

fornication--often connected with idolatry.

[Revelation 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 2:15</span></span>

thou--emphatic: "So THOU also hast," As Balak and the Moabites of old
had Balaam and his followers literally, so hast thou also them that hold
the same Balaamite or Nicolaitane doctrine spiritually or symbolically.
Literal eating of idol-meats and fornication in Pergamos were
accompanied by spiritual idolatry and fornication. So TRENCH explains.
But I prefer taking it, "THOU also," as well as Ephesus ("in like
manner" as Ephesus; see below the oldest reading), hast . . .
Nicolaitanes, with this important difference, Ephesus, as a Church,
hates them and casts them out, but thou "hast them," namely, in the
Church.

doctrine--teaching (see on [Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006).md):
namely, to tempt God's people to idolatry.

which thing I hate--It is sin not to hate what God hates. The Ephesian
Church ([Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006).md) had this point of
superiority to Pergamos. But the three oldest manuscripts, and Vulgate
and Syriac, read instead of "which I hate," "IN LIKE MANNER."

[Revelation 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 2:16</span></span>

The three oldest manuscripts read, "Repent, therefore." Not only the
Nicolaitanes, but the whole Church of Pergamos is called on to repent of
not having hated the Nicolaitane teaching and practice. Contrast Paul,
[Act 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026.md).

I will come--I am coming.

fight against them--Greek, "war with them"; with the Nicolaitanes
primarily; but including also chastisement of the whole Church at
Pergamos: compare "unto THEE."

with the sword of my mouth--resumed from [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md), but with an allusion to the
drawn sword with which the angel of the Lord confronted Balaam on his
way to curse Israel: an earnest of the sword by which he and the seduced
Israelites fell at last. The spiritual Balaamites of John's day are to
be smitten with the Lord's spiritual sword, the word or "rod of His
mouth."

[Revelation 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 2:17</span></span>

to eat--omitted in the three oldest manuscripts.

the hidden manna--the heavenly food of Israel, in contrast to the
idol-meats ([Rev 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md). A pot of manna
was laid up in the holy place "before the testimony." The allusion is
here to this: probably also to the Lord's discourse ([Joh
6:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031).md). Translate, "the manna which
is hidden." As the manna hidden in the sanctuary was by divine power
preserved from corruption, so Christ in His incorruptible body has
passed into the heavens, and is hidden there until the time of His
appearing. Christ Himself is the manna "hidden" from the world, but
revealed to the believer, so that he has already a foretaste of His
preciousness. Compare as to Christ's own hidden food on earth, [Joh
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#032.md), [Joh
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034.md), and [Job
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012.md). The full manifestation shall be
at His coming. Believers are now hidden, even as their meat is hidden.
As the manna in the sanctuary, unlike the other manna, was
incorruptible, so the spiritual feast offered to all who reject the
world's dainties for Christ is everlasting: an incorruptible body and
life for ever in Christ at the resurrection.

white stone . . . new name . . . no man knoweth saving he--TRENCH'S
explanation seems best. White is the color and livery of heaven. "New"
implies something altogether renewed and heavenly. The white stone is a
glistening diamond, the Urim borne by the high priest within the
choschen or breastplate of judgment, with the twelve tribes' names on
the twelve precious stones, next the heart. The word Urim means "light,"
answering to the color white. None but the high priest knew the name
written upon it, probably the incommunicable name of God, "Jehovah." The
high priest consulted it in some divinely appointed way to get direction
from God when needful. The "new name" is Christ's (compare [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md), "I will write upon him My new
name"): some new revelation of Himself which shall hereafter be imparted
to His people, and which they alone are capable of receiving. The
connection with the "hidden manna" will thus be clear, as none save the
high priest had access to the "manna hidden" in the sanctuary.
Believers, as spiritual priests unto God, shall enjoy the heavenly
antitypes to the hidden manna and the Urim stone. What they had
peculiarly to contend against at Pergamos was the temptation to
idol-meats, and fornication, put in their way by Balaamites. As Phinehas
was rewarded with "an everlasting priesthood" for his zeal against these
very sins to which the Old Testament Balaam seduced Israel; so the
heavenly high priesthood is the reward promised here to those zealous
against the New Testament Balaamites tempting Christ's people to the
same sins.

receiveth it--namely, "the stone"; not "the new name"; see above. The
"name that no man knew but Christ Himself," He shall hereafter reveal to
His people.

[Revelation 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 2:18</span></span>

Thyatira--in Lydia, south of Pergamos. Lydia, the purple-seller of this
city, having been converted at Philippi, a Macedonian city (with which
Thyatira, as being a Macedonian colony, had naturally much intercourse),
was probably the instrument of first carrying the Gospel to her native
town. John follows the geographical order here, for Thyatira lay a
little to the left of the road from Pergamos to Sardis \[STRABO, 13:4\].

Son of God . . . eyes like . . . fire . . . feet . . . like fine
brass--or "glowing brass" (see on [Rev
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md), whence this description is
resumed). Again His attributes accord with His address. The title "Son
of God," is from [Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md), [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), which is referred to in [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md). The attribute, "eyes like a
flame," &c., answers to [Rev 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md), "I
am He which searcheth the reins and hearts." The attribute, "feet like .
. . brass," answers to [Rev 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md), "as
the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers," He treading
them to pieces with His strong feet.

[Revelation 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 2:19</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts transpose the English Version order, and read,
"faith and service." The four are subordinate to "thy works"; thus, "I
know thy works, even the love and the faith (these two forming one pair,
as 'faith works by love,' [Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006).md),
and the service (ministration to the suffering members of the Church,
and to all in spiritual or temporal need), and the endurance of (that
is, shown by) thee (this pronoun belongs to all four)." As love is
inward, so service is its outward manifestation. Similarly, faith and
persevering endurance, or "patient continuance (the same Greek as here,
[Rom 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007).md) in well-doing," are
connected.

and thy works; and the last--Omit the second "and," with the three
oldest manuscripts and the ancient versions; translate, "And (I know)
thy works which are last (to be) more in number than the first";
realizing [Th1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md); the converse of
[Mat 12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045.md); [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md). Instead of retrograding from
"the first works" and "first love," as Ephesus, Thyatira's last works
exceeded her first ([Rev 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004).md).

[Revelation 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 2:20</span></span>

a few things--omitted in the three oldest manuscripts. Translate then,
"I have against thee that," &c.

sufferest--The three oldest manuscripts read, "lettest alone."

that woman--Two oldest manuscripts read, "THY wife"; two omit it.
Vulgate and most ancient versions read as English Version. The
symbolical Jezebel was to the Church of Thyatira what Jezebel, Ahab's
"wife," was to him. Some self-styled prophetess (or as the feminine in
Hebrew is often used collectively to express a multitude, a set of false
prophets), as closely attached to the Church of Thyatira as a wife is to
a husband, and as powerfully influencing for evil that Church as Jezebel
did Ahab. As Balaam, in Israel's early history, so Jezebel, daughter of
Eth-baal, king of Sidon ([Kg1 16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031.md),
formerly priest of Astarte, and murderer of his predecessor on the
throne, JOSEPHUS \[Against Apion, 1.18\]), was the great seducer to
idolatry in Israel's later history. Like her father, she was swift to
shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name
expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak Ahab
and Israel beyond the calf-worship (which was a worship of the true God
under the cherub-ox form, that is, a violation of the second
commandment) to that of Baal (a violation of the first commandment
also). She seems to have been herself a priestess and prophetess of
Baal. Compare [Kg2 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022.md), [Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md), "whoredoms of . . . Jezebel and
her witchcrafts" (impurity was part of the worship of the PhÅ“nician
Astarte, or Venus). Her spiritual counterpart at Thyatira lured God's
"servants" by pretended utterances of inspiration to the same
libertinism, fornication, and eating of idol-meats, as the Balaamites
and Nicolaitanes ([Rev 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006.md), [Rev
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md). By a false spiritualism
these seducers led their victims into the grossest carnality, as though
things done in the flesh were outside the true man, and were, therefore,
indifferent. "The deeper the Church penetrated into heathenism, the more
she herself became heathenish; this prepares us for the expressions
'harlot' and 'Babylon,' applied to her afterwards" \[AUBERLEN\].

to teach and to seduce--The three oldest manuscripts read, "and she
teaches and seduces," or "deceives." "Thyatira was just the reverse of
Ephesus. There, much zeal for orthodoxy, but little love; here, activity
of faith and love, but insufficient zeal for godly discipline and
doctrine, a patience of error even where there was not a participation
in it" \[TRENCH\].

[Revelation 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 2:21</span></span>

space--Greek, "time."

of her fornication . . . she repented not--The three oldest manuscripts
read, "and she willeth not to repent of (literally, 'out of,' that is,
so as to come out of) her fornication." Here there is a transition from
literal to spiritual fornication, as appears from [Rev
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md). The idea arose from Jehovah's
covenant relation to the Old Testament Church being regarded as a
marriage, any transgression against which was, therefore, harlotry,
fornication, or adultery.

[Revelation 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 2:22</span></span>

Behold--calling attention to her awful doom to come.

I will--Greek present, "I cast her."

a bed--The place of her sin shall be the place of her punishment. The
bed of her sin shall be her bed of sickness and anguish. Perhaps a
pestilence was about to be sent. Or the bed of the grave, and of the
hell beyond, where the worm dieth not.

them that commit adultery with her--spiritually; including both the
eating of idol-meats and fornication. "With her," in the Greek, implies
participation with her in her adulteries, namely, by suffering her ([Rev
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#020).md), or letting her alone, and so
virtually encouraging her. Her punishment is distinct from theirs; she
is to be cast into a bed, and her children to be killed; while those who
make themselves partakers of her sin by tolerating her, are to be cast
into great tribulation.

except they repent--Greek aorist, "repent" at once; shall have repented
by the time limited in My purpose.

their deeds--Two of the oldest manuscripts and most ancient versions
read "her." Thus, God's true servants, who by connivance, are incurring
the guilt of her deeds, are distinguished from her. One oldest
manuscript, ANDREAS, and CYPRIAN, support "their."

[Revelation 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 2:23</span></span>

her children-- ([Isa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003.md); [Eze
23:45](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#045.md), [Eze
23:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#047).md). Her proper adherents; not
those who suffer her, but those who are begotten of her. A distinct
class from the last in [Rev 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022.md)
(compare Note, see on [Rev 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022).md),
whose sin was less direct, being that only of connivance.

kill . . . with death--Compare the disaster that overtook the literal
Jezebel's votaries of Baal, and Ahab's sons, [Kg1
18:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#040.md); [Kg2
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#006.md), [Kg2
10:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#024.md). Kill with death is a
Hebraism for slay with most sure and awful death; so "dying thou shalt
die" ([Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017).md). Not "die the common
death of men" ([Num 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#029).md).

all the churches shall know--implying that these addresses are designed
for the catholic Church of all ages and places. So palpably shall God's
hand be seen in the judgment on Thyatira, that the whole Church shall
recognize it as God's doing.

I am he--the "I" is strongly emphatical: "that it is I am He who," &c.

searcheth . . . hearts--God's peculiar attribute is given to Christ. The
"reins" are the seat of the desires; the "heart," that of the thoughts.
The Greek for "searcheth" expresses an accurate following up of all
tracks and windings.

unto every one of you--literally, "unto you, to each."

according to your works--to be judged not according to the mere act as
it appears to man, but with reference to the motive, faith and love
being the only motives which God recognizes as sound.

[Revelation 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 2:24</span></span>

you . . . and . . . the rest--The three oldest manuscripts omit "and";
translate then, "Unto you, the rest."

as many as have not--not only do not hold, but are free from contact
with.

and which--The oldest manuscripts omit "and"; translate, "whosoever."

the depths--These false prophets boasted peculiarly of their knowledge
of mysteries and the deep things of God; pretensions subsequently
expressed by their arrogant title, Gnostics ("full of knowledge"). The
Spirit here declares their so-called "depths," (namely, of knowledge of
divine things) to be really "depths of Satan"; just as in [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md), He says, instead of "the
synagogue of God," "the synagogue of Satan." HENGSTENBERG thinks the
teachers themselves professed to fathom the depths of Satan, giving
loose rein to fleshly lusts, without being hurt thereby. They who thus
think to fight Satan with his own weapons always find him more than a
match for them. The words, "as they speak," that is, "as they call
them," coming after not only "depths," but "depths of Satan," seem to
favor this latter view; otherwise I should prefer the former, in which
case, "as they speak," or "call them," must refer to "depths" only, not
also "depths of Satan." The original sin of Adam was a desire to know
EVIL as well as good, so in HENGSTENBERG'S view, those who professed to
know "the depths of Satan." It is the prerogative of God alone to know
evil fully, without being hurt or defiled by it.

I will put--Two oldest manuscripts have "I put," or "cast." One oldest
manuscript reads as English Version.

none other burden--save abstinence from, and protestation against, these
abominations; no "depths" beyond your reach, such as they teach, no new
doctrine, but the old faith and rule of practice once for all delivered
to the saints. Exaggerating and perfecting Paul's doctrine of grace
without the law as the source of justification and sanctification, these
false prophets rejected the law as a rule of life, as though it were an
intolerable "burden." But it is a "light" burden. In [Act
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md), the very term "burden," as
here, is used of abstinence from fornication and idol-meats; to this the
Lord here refers.

[Revelation 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rev 2:25</span></span>

that which ye have already-- ([Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003), end.md).

hold fast--do not let go from your grasp, however false teachers may
wish to wrest it from you.

till I come--when your conflict with evil will be at an end. The Greek
implies uncertainty as to when He shall come.

[Revelation 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rev 2:26</span></span>

And--implying the close connection of the promise to the conqueror that
follows, with the preceding exhortation, [Rev
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#025.md).

and keepeth--Greek, "and he that keepeth." Compare the same word in the
passage already alluded to by the Lord, [Act
15:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md), end.

my works--in contrast to "her (English Version, 'their') works" ([Rev
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#022).md). The works which I command and
which are the fruit of My Spirit.

unto the end-- ([Mat 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013).md). The image
is perhaps from the race, wherein it is not enough to enter the lists,
but the runner must persevere to the end.

give power--Greek, "authority."

over the nations--at Christ's coming the saints shall possess the
kingdom "under the whole heaven"; therefore over this earth; compare
[Luk 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#017.md), "have thou authority \[the
same word as here\] over ten cities."

[Revelation 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rev 2:27</span></span>

From [Psa 2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md).

rule--literally, "rule as a shepherd." In [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md) it is, "Thou shalt break them with
a rod of iron." The Septuagint, pointing the Hebrew word differently,
read as Revelation here. The English Version of [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md) is doubtless right, as the
parallel word, "dash in pieces," proves. But the Spirit in this case
sanctions the additional thought as true, that the Lord shall mingle
mercy to some, with judgment on others; beginning by destroying His
Antichristian foes, He shall reign in love over the rest. "Christ shall
rule them with a scepter of iron, to make them capable of being ruled
with a scepter of gold; severity first, that grace may come after"
(TRENCH, who thinks we ought to translate "SCEPTER" for "rod," as in
[Heb 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008).md). "Shepherd" is used in [Jer
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md), of hostile rulers; so also in
[Zac 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#016.md). As severity here is the
primary thought, "rule as a shepherd" seems to me to be used thus: He
who would have shepherded them with a pastoral rod, shall, because of
their hardened unbelief, shepherd them with a rod of iron.

shall they be broken--So one oldest manuscript, Vulgate, Syriac, and
Coptic Versions read. But two oldest manuscripts, read, "as the vessels
of a potter are broken to shivers." A potter's vessel dashed to pieces,
because of its failing to answer the design of the maker, is the image
to depict God's sovereign power to give reprobates to destruction, not
by caprice, but in the exercise of His righteous judgment. The saints
shall be in Christ's victorious "armies" when He shall inflict the last
decisive blow, and afterwards shall reign with Him. Having by faith
"overcome the world," they shall also rule the world.

even as I--"as I also have received of (from) My Father," namely, in
[Psa 2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md). Jesus had refused to
receive the kingdom without the cross at Satan's hands; He would receive
it from none but the Father, who had appointed the cross as the path to
the crown. As the Father has given the authority to Me over the heathen
and uttermost parts of the earth, so I impart a share of it to My
victorious disciple.

[Revelation 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rev 2:28</span></span>

the morning star--that is, I will give unto him Myself, who am "the
morning star" ([Rev 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016).md); so that
reflecting My perfect brightness, he shall shine like Me, the morning
star, and share My kingly glory (of which a star is the symbol, [Num
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#017.md); [Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002).md). Compare [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md), "I will give him . . . the
hidden manna," that is, Myself, who am that manna ([Joh
6:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#031).md).
