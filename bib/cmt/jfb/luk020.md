Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#001)

[Luke 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 20:2</span></span>

THE AUTHORITY OF JESUS QUESTIONED, AND HIS REPLY--PARABLE OF THE WICKED
HUSBANDMEN. (Luke 20:1-19)

these things--particularly the clearing of the temple.

[Luke 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 20:4</span></span>

baptism of John--his whole ministry and mission, of which baptism was
the seal.

[Luke 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 20:5</span></span>

Why then believed ye him not?--that is, in his testimony to Jesus, the
sum of his whole witness.

[Luke 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 20:7</span></span>

could not tell--crooked, cringing hypocrites! No wonder Jesus gave you
no answer ([Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)). But what dignity
and composure does our Lord display as He turns their question upon
themselves!

[Luke 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 20:9</span></span>

vineyard--(See on [Luk 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006)). In [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033) additional points are given,
taken literally from [Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002), to fix
down the application and sustain it by Old Testament authority.

husbandmen--the ordinary spiritual guides of the people, under whose
care and culture the fruits of righteousness might be yielded.

went, &c.--leaving it to the laws of the spiritual husbandry during the
whole length of the Jewish economy. (See on [Mar
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026).)

[Luke 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 20:10</span></span>

beat, &c.-- ([Mat 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035)); that is, the
prophets, extraordinary messengers raised up from time to time. (See on
[Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).)

[Luke 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 20:13</span></span>

my beloved son--Mark ([Mar 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#006)) still
more affectingly, "Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved"; our
Lord thus severing Himself from all merely human messengers, and
claiming Sonship in its loftiest sense. (Compare [Heb
3:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003).)

it may be--"surely"; implying the almost unimaginable guilt of not doing
so.

[Luke 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 20:14</span></span>

reasoned among themselves--(Compare [Gen
37:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#018); [Joh
11:47-53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047)).

the heir--sublime expression of the great truth, that God's inheritance
was destined for, and in due time to come into the possession of, His
Son in our nature ([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)).

inheritance . . . ours--and so from mere servants we may become lords;
the deep aim of the depraved heart, and literally "the root of all
evil."

[Luke 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 20:15</span></span>

cast him out of the vineyard--(Compare [Heb
13:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011); [Kg1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013); [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017)).

[Luke 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 20:16</span></span>

He shall come, &c.--This answer was given by the Pharisees themselves
([Mat 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041)), thus pronouncing their
own righteous doom. Matthew alone ([Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043)) gives the naked application,
that "the kingdom of God should be taken from them, and given to a
nation bringing forth the fruits thereof"--the great evangelical
community of the faithful, chiefly Gentiles.

God forbid--His whole meaning now bursting upon them.

[Luke 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 20:17</span></span>

written--(in [Psa 118:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022). See on
[Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038)). The Kingdom of God is
here a Temple, in the erection of which a certain stone, rejected as
unsuitable by the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the
House, made the keystone of the whole. On that Stone the builders were
now "falling" and being "broken" ([Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015)), "sustaining great spiritual
hurt; but soon that Stone should fall upon them and grind them to
powder" ([Dan 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034); [Zac
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003)) --in their corporate capacity in
the tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, but personally, as unbelievers,
in a more awful sense still.

[Luke 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 20:19</span></span>

the same hour--hardly able to restrain their rage.

[Luke 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 20:20</span></span>

ENTANGLING QUESTIONS ABOUT TRIBUTE AND THE RESURRECTION--THE REPLIES.
(Luke 20:20-40)

sent forth--after consulting ([Mat
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#015)) on the best plan.

spies--"of the Pharisees and Herodians" ([Mar
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013)). See [Mar
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006).

[Luke 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 20:21</span></span>

we know, &c.--hoping by flattery to throw Him off His guard.

[Luke 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 20:22</span></span>

tribute--(See on [Mat 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024)).

[Luke 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 20:25</span></span>

things which be CÃ&brvbr;sar's--Putting it in this general form, it was
impossible for sedition itself to dispute it, and yet it dissolved the
snare.

and unto God--How much there is in this profound but to them startling
addition to the maxim, and how incomparable is the whole for fulness,
brevity, clearness, weight!

[Luke 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 20:27</span></span>

no resurrection--"nor angel nor spirit" ([Act
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008)); the materialists of the day.

[Luke 20:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 20:34</span></span>

said unto them--In [Mat 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029), the
reply begins with this important statement:--"Ye do err, not knowing the
Scriptures," regarding the future state, "nor the power of God," before
which a thousand such difficulties vanish (also [Mar
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024)).

[Luke 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 20:36</span></span>

neither . . . die any more--Marriage is ordained to perpetuate the human
family; but as there will be no breaches by death in the future state,
this ordinance will cease.

equal--or "like."

unto the angels--that is, in the immortality of their nature.

children of God--not in respect of character but nature; "being the
children of the resurrection" to an undecaying existence ([Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021), [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)). And thus the children of their
Father's immortality ([Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)).

[Luke 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 20:37</span></span>

even Moses--whom they had just quoted to entangle Him.

[Luke 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 20:38</span></span>

not . . . of the dead, . . . for all, &c.--To God, no human being is
dead, or ever will be; but all sustain an abiding conscious relation to
Him. But the "all" here meant "those who shall be accounted worthy to
obtain that world." These sustain a gracious covenant relation to God,
which cannot be dissolved. In this sense our Lord affirms that for Moses
to call the Lord the "God" of His patriarchal servants if at that moment
they had no existence, would be unworthy of Him. He "would be ashamed to
be called their God, if He had not prepared for them a city" ([Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016)). How precious are these
glimpses of the resurrection state!

[Luke 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 20:39</span></span>

scribes . . . well said--enjoying His victory over the Sadducees.

they durst not--neither party, both for the time utterly foiled.

[Luke 20:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 20:41</span></span>

CHRIST BAFFLES THE PHARISEES BY A QUESTION ABOUT DAVID AND MESSIAH, AND
DENOUNCES THE SCRIBES. ([Luk 20:41-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#041))

said, &c.--"What think ye of Christ \[the promised and expected
Messiah\]? Whose son is He \[to be\]? They say unto Him, The son of
David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit \[by the Holy
Ghost, [Mar 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#036)\] call Him Lord?"
([Mat 22:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042)). The difficulty can
only be solved by the higher and lower--the divine and human natures of
our Lord ([Mat 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023)). Mark the
testimony here given to the inspiration of the Old Testament (compare
[Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044)).

[Luke 20:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 20:46</span></span>

Beware, &c.--(See on [Mat 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005); and
[Luk 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007)).

[Luke 20:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 20:47</span></span>

devour, &c.--taking advantage of their helpless condition and confiding
character, to obtain possession of their property, while by their "long
prayers" they made them believe they were raised far above "filthy
lucre." So much "the greater damnation" awaits them. What a lifelike
description of the Romish clergy, the true successors of "the scribes!"
