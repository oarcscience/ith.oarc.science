### [Exodus Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001)

[Exodus 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 20:1</span></span>

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. (Exo. 20:1-26)

And God spake all these words--The Divine Being Himself was the speaker
([Deu 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#012), [Deu
5:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#032)), in tones so loud as to be
heard--so distinct as to be intelligible by the whole multitude standing
in the valleys below, amid the most appalling phenomena of agitated
nature. Had He been simply addressing rational and intelligent
creatures, He would have spoken with the still small voice of persuasion
and love. But He was speaking to those who were at the same time fallen
and sinful creatures, and a corresponding change was required in the
manner of God's procedure, in order to give a suitable impression of the
character and sanctions of the law revealed from heaven ([Rom
11:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)).

[Exodus 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 20:2</span></span>

I am the Lord thy God--This is a preface to the ten commandments--the
latter clause being specially applicable to the case of the Israelites,
while the former brings it home to all mankind; showing that the
reasonableness of the law is founded in their eternal relation as
creatures to their Creator, and their mutual relations to each other.

[Exodus 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 20:3</span></span>

Thou shalt have no other gods before me--in My presence, beside, or
except Me.

[Exodus 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 20:4</span></span>

Thou shalt not make . . . any graven image . . . thou shalt not bow down
thyself to them--that is, "make in order to bow." Under the auspices of
Moses himself, figures of cherubim, brazen serpents, oxen, and many
other things in the earth beneath, were made and never condemned. The
mere making was no sin--it was the making with the intent to give
idolatrous worship.

[Exodus 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 20:8</span></span>

Remember the sabbath day--implying it was already known, and recognized
as a season of sacred rest. The first four commandments \[[Exo
20:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003)\] comprise our duties to
God--the other six \[[Exo 20:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012)\]
our duties to our fellow men; and as interpreted by Christ, they reach
to the government of the heart as well as the lip ([Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017)). "If a man do them he shall live
in them" \[[Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005); [Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029)\]. But, ah! what an if for frail
and fallen man. Whoever rests his hope upon the law stands debtor to it
all; and in this view every one would be without hope were not "the LORD
OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" \[[Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006); [Jer
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016)\] ([Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)).

[Exodus 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 20:18</span></span>

all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings--They were eye and
ear witnesses of the awful emblems of the Deity's descent. But they
perceived not the Deity Himself.

[Exodus 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 20:19</span></span>

let not God speak with us, lest we die, &c.--The phenomena of thunder
and lightning had been one of the plagues so fatal to Egypt, and as they
heard God speaking to them now, they were apprehensive of instant death
also. Even Moses himself, the mediator of the old covenant, did
"exceedingly quake and fear" ([Heb
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#021)). But doubtless God spake what
gave him relief--restored him to a frame of mind fit for the
ministrations committed to him; and hence immediately after he was
enabled to relieve and comfort them with the relief and comfort which he
himself had received from God ([Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004)).

[Exodus 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 20:22</span></span>

the Lord said unto Moses--It appears from [Deu
4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014), that this injunction was a
conclusion drawn from the scene on Sinai--that as no similitude of God
was displayed then, they should not attempt to make any visible figure
or form of Him.

[Exodus 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 20:24</span></span>

An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me--a regulation applicable to
special or temporary occasions.

[Exodus 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">exo 20:25</span></span>

thou shalt not build it of hewn stone, &c.--that is, carved with figures
and ornaments that might lead to superstition.

[Exodus 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 20:26</span></span>

by steps--a precaution taken for the sake of decency, in consequence of
the loose, wide, flowing garments of the priests.
