### [Genesis Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 12:1</span></span>

CALL TO ABRAM. (Gen. 12:1-20)

Now the Lord had said unto Abram--It pleased God, who has often been
found of them who sought Him not, to reveal Himself to Abraham perhaps
by a miracle; and the conversion of Abraham is one of the most
remarkable in Bible history.

Get thee out of thy country--His being brought to the knowledge and
worship of the true God had probably been a considerable time before.
This call included two promises: the first, showing the land of his
future posterity; and the second, that in his posterity all the earth
was to be blessed ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002).md). Abraham
obeyed, and it is frequently mentioned in the New Testament as a
striking instance of his faith ([Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008).md).

[Genesis 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 12:5</span></span>

into the land of Canaan . . . they came--with his wife and an orphan
nephew. Abram reached his destination in safety, and thus the first
promise was made good.

[Genesis 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 12:6</span></span>

the place of Sichem--or Shechem, a pastoral valley then unoccupied
(compare [Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018).md).

plain of Moreh--rather, the "terebinth tree" of Moreh, very common in
Palestine, remarkable for its wide-spreading branches and its dark green
foliage. It is probable that in Moreh there was a grove of these trees,
whose inviting shade led Abram to choose it for an encampment.

[Genesis 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 12:7</span></span>

Unto thy seed will I give this land--God was dealing with Abram not in
his private and personal capacity merely, but with a view to high and
important interests in future ages. That land his posterity was for
centuries to inhabit as a peculiar people; the seeds of divine knowledge
were to be sown there for the benefit of all mankind; and considered in
its geographical situation, it was chosen in divine wisdom as the
fittest of all lands to serve as the cradle of a divine revelation
designed for the whole world.

and there builded he an altar unto the Lord--By this solemn act of
devotion Abram made an open profession of his religion, established the
worship of the true God, and declared his faith in the promise.

[Genesis 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 12:10</span></span>

there was a famine . . . and Abram went down into Egypt--He did not go
back to the place of his nativity, as regretting his pilgrimage and
despising the promised land ([Heb
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#015).md), but withdrew for a while into
a neighboring country.

[Genesis 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 12:11</span></span>

Sarai's complexion, coming from a mountainous country, would be fresh
and fair compared with the faces of Egyptian women which were sallow.
The counsel of Abram to her was true in words, but it was a deception,
intended to give an impression that she was no more than his sister. His
conduct was culpable and inconsistent with his character as a servant of
God: it showed a reliance on worldly policy more than a trust in the
promise; and he not only sinned himself, but tempted Sarai to sin also.

[Genesis 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 12:14</span></span>

when Abram was come into Egypt--It appears from the monuments of that
country that at the time of Abram's visit a monarchy had existed for
several centuries. The seat of government was in the Delta, the most
northern part of the country, the very quarter in which Abram must have
arrived. They were a race of shepherd-kings, in close alliance with the
people of Canaan.

[Genesis 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 12:15</span></span>

the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house--Eastern kings have for ages
claimed the privilege of taking to their harem an unmarried woman whom
they like. The father or brother may deplore the removal as a calamity,
but the royal right is never resisted nor questioned.

[Genesis 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 12:16</span></span>

he entreated Abram well for her sake--The presents are just what one
pastoral chief would give to another.

[Genesis 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 12:18</span></span>

Here is a most humiliating rebuke, and Abram deserved it. Had not God
interfered, he might have been tempted to stay in Egypt and forget the
promise ([Psa 105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013.md), [Psa
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015).md). Often still does God rebuke
His people and remind them through enemies that this world is not their
rest.
