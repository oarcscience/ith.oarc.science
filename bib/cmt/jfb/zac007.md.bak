### [Zechariah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 7:1</span></span>

II\. DIDACTIC PART, SEVENTH AND EIGHTH CHAPTERS. OBEDIENCE, RATHER THAN
FASTING, ENJOINED: ITS REWARD. ([Zac
7:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001).md)

fourth year of . . . Darius--two years after the previous prophecies
([Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001), &c..md).

Chisleu--meaning "torpidity," the state in which nature is in November,
answering to this month.

[Zechariah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 7:2</span></span>

they . . . sent unto . . . house of God--The Jews of the country sent to
the house of God or congregation at Jerusalem. The altar was long since
reared ([Ezr 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr003.htm#003).md), though the temple
was not completed till two years afterwards ([Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015).md). The priests' duty was to give
decision on points of the law ([Deu
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009.md); [Mat
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004).md). Beth-el is here used instead of
Beth-Jehovah, because the religious authorities, rather than the house
itself (designated "Beth-Jehovah" in [Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003).md), are intended. The old Beth-el
had long ceased to be the seat of idol-worship, so that the name had
lost its opprobrious meaning. "The house of the Lord" is used for the
congregation of worshippers headed by their priests ([Zac
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#007.md); [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001).md). MAURER makes the "house of God"
nominative to "sent." HENDERSON makes "Beth-el" so.

Sherezer--an Assyrian name meaning, "Prefect of the treasury."

Regemmelech--meaning, "The king's official." These names perhaps
intimate the semi-heathen character of the inquirers, which may also be
implied in the name "Beth-el" (Hebrew for "house of God"), so notorious
once for its calf-worship. They sent to Jehovah's house as their
forefathers sent to old Beth-el, not in the spirit of true obedience.

pray before the Lord--literally, "to entreat the face of," that is, to
offer sacrifices, the accompaniment of prayers, to conciliate His favor
([Sa1 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012).md).

[Zechariah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 7:3</span></span>

Should I weep in the fifth month--"I" represents here the people of God
(compare [Zac 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021).md). This rather
favors MAURER'S view, taking "the house of God," the congregation, as
nominative to "sent." Their hypocrisy appeared because they showed more
concern about a ceremony of human institution (not improper in itself)
than about moral obedience. If, too, they had trusted God's promise as
to the restoration of Church and State, the fast would have now given
place to joy, for which there was more cause than for grief
\[PEMBELLUS\].

to the prophets--Haggai and Zechariah especially. The tenth day of the
fifth month was kept a fast, being the anniversary of the destruction of
Jerusalem ([Jer 52:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012).md). They ask,
Should the fast be continued, now that the temple and city are being
restored?

separating myself--sanctifying myself by separation, not only from food,
but from all defilements (compare [Joe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016).md) as was usual in a solemn fast.

[Zechariah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 7:5</span></span>

Speak unto all--The question had been asked in the name of the people in
general by Sherezer and Regemmelech. The self-imposed fast they were
tired of, not having observed it in the spirit of true religion.

seventh month--This fast was in memory of the murder of Gedaliah and
those with him at Mizpah, issuing in the dispersion of the Jews ([Kg2
25:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025.md); [Jer
41:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001).md).

did ye . . . fast unto me?--No; it was to gratify yourselves in
hypocritical will-worship. If it had been "unto Me," ye would have
"separated yourselves" not only from food, but from your sins ([Isa
58:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003).md). They falsely made the fast an
end intrinsically meritorious in itself, not a means towards God's glory
in their sanctification. The true principle of piety, reference to God,
was wanting: hence the emphatic repetition of "unto Me." Before settling
questions as to the outward forms of piety (however proper, as in this
case), the great question was as to piety itself; that being once
settled, all their outward observances become sanctified, being "unto
the Lord" ([Rom 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006).md).

[Zechariah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 7:6</span></span>

did not ye eat for yourselves?--literally, "Is it not ye who eat?" that
is, it is not unto Me and My glory. It tends no more to My glory, your
feasting than your fasting.

[Zechariah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 7:7</span></span>

Should ye not hear the words--rather, "Should ye not do the words," as
their question naturally was as to what they should do ([Zac
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003).md); "hearing" is not mentioned till
[Zac 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md). The sense is, It is not
fasts that Jehovah requires of you, but that ye should keep His precepts
given to you at the time when Jerusalem was in its integrity. Had ye
done so then, ye would have had no occasion to institute fasts to
commemorate its destruction, for it would never have been destroyed
([Zac 7:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009).md) \[MAURER\]. Or, as the
Margin, "Are not these the words" of the older prophets ([Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003.md); [Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012).md) which threatened a curse for
disobedience, which the event has so awfully confirmed. If ye follow
them in sin, ye must follow them in suffering. English Version is good
sense: Ye inquire anxiously about the fasts, whereas ye ought to be
anxious about hearing the lesson taught by the former prophets and
verified in the nation's punishment; penitence and obedience are
required rather than fasts.

the plain--southwest of Jerusalem. They then inhabited securely the
region most unguarded.

[Zechariah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 7:9</span></span>

speaketh--implying that these precepts addressed to their ancestors were
the requirements of Jehovah not merely then, but now. We must not only
not hurt, but we must help our fellow men. God is pleased with such
loving obedience, rather than with empty ceremonies.

[Zechariah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 7:10</span></span>

imagine evil--that is, devise evil. The Septuagint takes it, Harbor not
the desire of revenge ([Lev 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).md).
"Devise evil against one another" is simpler ([Psa
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#004.md); [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).md).

[Zechariah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 7:11</span></span>

pulled away the shoulder--literally, "presented a refractory shoulder";
an image from beasts refusing to bear the yoke ([Neh
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029), Margin.md).

stopped . . . ears-- ([Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); [Jer
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#026.md); [Act
7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057).md).

[Zechariah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 7:12</span></span>

hearts . . . adamant-- ([Eze 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009.md); [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019).md).

Lord . . . sent in Spirit by . . . prophets--that is, sent by the former
prophets inspired with His Spirit.

therefore . . . great wrath-- ([Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016).md). As they pushed from them the
yoke of obedience, God laid on them the yoke of oppression. As they made
their heart hard as adamant, God brake their hard hearts with judgments.
Hard hearts must expect hard treatment. The harder the stone, the harder
the blow of the hammer to break it.

[Zechariah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 7:13</span></span>

he cried--by His prophets.

they cried--in their calamities.

I . . . not hear--retribution in kind ([Pro
1:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md); [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md); [Mic
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#004).md).

[Zechariah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 7:14</span></span>

whirlwind--of wrath ([Nah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003).md).

nations whom they knew not--foreign and barbarous.

desolate after them--after their expulsion and exile. It was ordered
remarkably by God's providence, that no occupants took possession of it,
but that during the Jews' absence it was reserved for them against their
return after seventy years.

they laid . . . desolate--The Jews did so by their sins. The blame of
their destruction lay with themselves, rather than with the Babylonians
([Ch2 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md).

pleasant land--Canaan. Literally, "the land of desire" ([Jer
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#019).md).
