### [Psalms Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001)

[Psalms 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 27:1</span></span>

With a general strain of confidence, hope, and joy, especially in God's
worship, in the midst of dangers, the Psalmist introduces prayer for
divine help and guidance. ([Psa
27:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001))

light--is a common figure for comfort.

strength--or, "stronghold"--affording security against all violence. The
interrogations give greater vividness to the negation implied.

[Psalms 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 27:2</span></span>

eat . . . my flesh-- ([Job 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022); [Psa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004)). The allusion to wild beasts
illustrates their rapacity.

they stumbled--"they" is emphatic; not I, but they were destroyed.

[Psalms 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 27:3</span></span>

In the greatest dangers.

in this--that is, then, in such extremity.

[Psalms 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 27:4</span></span>

The secret of his confidence is his delight in communion with God ([Psa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011); [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006)), beholding the harmony of His
perfections, and seeking His favor in His temple or palace; a term
applicable to the tabernacle (compare [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007)). There he is safe ([Psa
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#021); [Psa
61:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#005)). The figure is changed in the
last clause, but the sentiment is the same.

[Psalms 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 27:6</span></span>

head be lifted up--I shall be placed beyond the reach of my enemies.
Hence he avows his purpose of rendering joyful thank offerings.

[Psalms 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 27:7</span></span>

Still pressing need extorts prayer for help.

cry with my voice--denotes earnestness. Other things equal, Christians
in earnest pray audibly, even in secret.

[Psalms 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 27:8</span></span>

The meaning is clear, though the construction in a literal translation
is obscure. The English Version supplies the implied clause. To seek
God's face is to seek His favor ([Psa
105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004)).

[Psalms 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 27:9</span></span>

Hide not, &c.-- ([Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006); [Psa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)). Against rejection he pleads
former mercy and love.

[Psalms 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 27:10</span></span>

In the extremity of earthly destitution ([Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011); [Psa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011)), God provides (compare [Mat
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035)).

[Psalms 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 27:11</span></span>

thy way--of providence.

a plain path-- ([Psa 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012)).

enemies--literally, "watchers for my fall" ([Psa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#008)).

[Psalms 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 27:12</span></span>

will--literally, "soul," "desire" ([Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025)).

enemies--literally, "oppressors." Falsehood aids cruelty against him.

breathe out--as being filled with it ([Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)).

[Psalms 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 27:13</span></span>

The strong emotion is indicated by the incomplete sentence, for which
the English Version supplies a proper clause; or, omitting that, and
rendering, "yet I believed," &c., the contrast of his faith and his
danger is expressed.

to see--is to experience ([Psa 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)).

[Psalms 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 27:14</span></span>

Wait, &c.--in confident expectation. The last clause is, literally, "and
wait," &c., as if expecting new measures of help.
