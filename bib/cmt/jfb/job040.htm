<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015">Job 40:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 40:15</A></FONT></span></p>God shows that if Job cannot bring under control the lower animals (of which he selects the two most striking, behemoth on land, leviathan in the water), much less is he capable of governing the world. 
<p>
<p>behemoth--The description in part agrees with the hippopotamus, in part with the elephant, but exactly in all details with neither. It is rather a poetical personification of the great Pachydermata, or Herbivora (so "he eateth grass"), the idea of the hippopotamus being predominant. In <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017">Job 40:17</A>, "the tail like a cedar," hardly applies to the latter (so also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020">Job 40:20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023">Job 40:23</A>, "Jordan," a river which elephants alone could reach, but see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023">Job 40:23</A>). On the other hand, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021">Job 40:21-22</A> are characteristic of the amphibious river horse. So leviathan (the twisting animal), <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1</A>, is a generalized term for cetacea, pythons, saurians of the neighboring seas and rivers, including the crocodile, which is the most prominent, and is often associated with the river horse by old writers. "Behemoth" seems to be the Egyptian Pehemout, "water-ox," Hebraized, so-called as being like an ox, whence the Italian bombarino. 
<p>
<p>with thee--as I made thyself. Yet how great the difference! The manifold wisdom and power of God! 
<p>
<p>he eateth grass--marvellous in an animal living so much in the water; also strange, that such a monster should not be carnivorous.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#016">Job 40:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 40:16</A></FONT></span></p>navel--rather, "muscles" of his belly; the weakest point of the elephant, therefore it is not meant.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017">Job 40:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 40:17</A></FONT></span></p>like a cedar--As the tempest bends the cedar, so it can move its smooth thick tail [UMBREIT]. But the cedar implies straightness and length, such as do not apply to the river horse's short tail, but perhaps to an extinct species of animal (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015">Job 40:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>stones--rather, "thighs." 
<p>
<p>wrapped--firmly twisted together, like a thick rope.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#018">Job 40:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">job 40:18</A></FONT></span></p>strong--rather, "tubes" of copper [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019">Job 40:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">job 40:19</A></FONT></span></p>Chief of the works of God; so "ways" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014">Job 26:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022">Pro 8:22</A>). 
<p>
<p>can make his sword to approach--rather, "has furnished him with his sword" (harpe), namely, the sickle-like teeth with which he cuts down grain. English Version, however, is literally right.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020">Job 40:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">job 40:20</A></FONT></span></p>The mountain is not his usual haunt. BOCHART says it is sometimes found there (?). 
<p>
<p>beasts . . . play--a graphic trait: though armed with such teeth, he lets the beasts play near him unhurt, for his food is grass.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021">Job 40:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">job 40:21</A></FONT></span></p>lieth--He leads an inactive life. 
<p>
<p>shady trees--rather, "lotus bushes"; as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022">Job 40:22</A> requires.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#022">Job 40:22</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_022">job 40:22</A></FONT></span></p>shady trees--Translate: "lotus bushes."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#023">Job 40:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">job 40:23</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "(Though) a river be violent (overflow), he trembleth not"; (for though living on land, he can live in the water, too); he is secure, though a Jordan swell up to his mouth. "Jordan" is used for any great river (consonant with the "behemoth"), being a poetical generalization (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015">Job 40:15</A>). The author cannot have been a Hebrew as UMBREIT asserts, or he would not adduce the Jordan, where there were no river horses. He alludes to it as a name for any river, but not as one known to him, except by hearsay.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024">Job 40:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 40:24</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "Will any take him by open force" (literally, "before his eyes"), "or pierce his nose with cords?" No; he can only be taken by guile, and in a pitfall (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001">Job 41:1-2</A>).
