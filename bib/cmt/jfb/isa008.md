### [Isaiah Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 8:1</span></span>

(Isa. 8:1-9:7)

great--suitable, for letters large enough to be read by all.

roll--rather, tablet of wood, metal, or stone ([Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md); [Hab
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002).md); sometimes coated with wax, upon
which characters were traced with a pointed instrument, or iron stylus;
skins and papyrus were also used ([Isa
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007).md).

man's pen--that is, in ordinary characters which the humblest can read
(so [Hab 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002).md). Hebrew, enosh means a
"common man," is contrasted with the upper ranks ([Rev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017.md); [Rom
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005).md). Not in hieroglyphics. The object
was that, after the event, all might see that it had been predicted by
Isaiah.

concerning--the title and subject of the prophecy.

Maher-shalal-hash-baz--"They (that is, the Assyrians) hasten to the
spoil (namely, to spoil Syria and Samaria), they speed to the prey"
\[GESENIUS\]. Otherwise, "The spoil (that is, spoiler) hastens, the
rapine speeds forward" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 8:2</span></span>

I took--rather, "The Lord said to me, that I should take," &c.
\[MAURER\].

Uriah--an accomplice of Ahaz in idolatry, and therefore a witness not
likely to assist the prophet of God in getting up a prophecy after the
event ([Kg2 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). The witnesses were
in order that when the event should come, they might testify that the
tablet containing the prophecy had been inscribed with it at the time
that it professed.

Zechariah-- ([Ch2 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 8:3</span></span>

prophetess--perhaps the same as the "virgin" ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md), in the interim married as
Isaiah's second wife: this is in the primary and temporary sense.
Immanuel is even in this sense distinct from Maher-shalal-hash-baz. Thus
nineteen months at least intervene from the prophecy ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md), nine before the birth of
Immanuel, and ten from that time to the birth of Maher-shalal-hash-baz:
adding eleven or twelve months before the latter could cry, "Father"
([Isa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004).md), we have about three years
in all, agreeing with [Isa 7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md).

[Isaiah 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 8:4</span></span>

before, &c.--within a year.

[Isaiah 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 8:6</span></span>

waters of Shiloah . . . softly--Their source is on the southeast of Zion
and east of Jerusalem. It means "sent," the water being sent through an
aqueduct ([Joh 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007).md). Figurative for
the mild, though now weak, sway of the house of David; in the highest
sense Shiloah expresses the benignant sway of Jehovah in the theocracy,
administered through David. Contrast to the violent Euphrates, "the
river" that typifies Assyria ([Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md); [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015).md). "This people" refers both to
Israel, which preferred an alliance with Rezin of Syria to one with the
kings of Judah, and to Judah, a party in which seems to have favored the
pretentions of the son of Tabeal against David's line ([Isa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006).md); also to Judah's desire to seek
an Assyrian alliance is included in the censure (compare [Isa
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017).md). [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md) shows that both nations are
meant; both alike rejected the divine Shiloah. Not "My people," as
elsewhere, when God expresses favor, but "this people" ([Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 8:7</span></span>

therefore--for the reason given in [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md), the Assyrian flood, which is
first to overflood Syria and Samaria, shall rise high enough to reach
rebel Judah also ([Isa 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md).

the river--Euphrates swollen in spring by the melting of the snow of the
Armenian mountains (compare [Isa 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md);
[Isa 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020).md).

all his glory--Eastern kings travel with a gorgeous retinue.

channels--natural and artificial in the level region, Mesopotamia.

[Isaiah 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 8:8</span></span>

pass through--The flood shall not stop at Syria and Samaria, but shall
penetrate into Judea.

the neck--When the waters reach to the neck, a man is near drowning;
still the head is not said to be overflowed. Jerusalem, elevated on
hills, is the head. The danger shall be so imminent as to reach near it
at Sennacherib's invasion in Hezekiah's reign; but it shall be spared
([Isa 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028).md).

wings--the extreme bands of the Assyrian armies, fulfilled ([Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001.md); [Isa
37:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#025).md).

thy land, O Immanuel--Though temporarily applied to Isaiah's son, in the
full sense this is applicable only to Messiah, that Judea is His, was,
and still is, a pledge that, however sorely overwhelmed, it shall be
saved at last; the "head" is safe even now, waiting for the times of
restoration ([Act 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006).md); at the same
time these words imply that, notwithstanding the temporary deliverance
from Syria and Israel, implied in "Immanuel," the greatest calamities
are to follow to Judah.

[Isaiah 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 8:9</span></span>

Associate yourselves--rather, "Raise tumults," or, Rage, that is, Do
your worst \[MAURER\], referring perhaps to the attack of Rezin and
Pekah on Jerusalem.

and . . . be broken in pieces--rather, "yet ye shall be thrown into
consternation." Imperative in the Hebrew, according to the idiom whereby
the second of two imperatives implies the future, namely, the
consequence of the action contained in the first (so [Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md). The name "Immanuel" in [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md) (compare [Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010).md) suggests the thought of the
ultimate safety of Immanuel's land, both from its present two invaders,
and even from the Assyrians, notwithstanding the grievous flood,
wherewith the previous verses foretell they shall deluge it. The
succession of the house of David cannot be set aside in Judah, for
Immanuel Messiah is to be born in it as heir of David, of whom Isaiah's
son is but a type ([Isa 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md), [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

give ear . . . far countries--witness the discomfiture of Judah's
enemies. The prophecy probably looks on also to the final conspiracy of
Antichrist and his supporters against the Heir of David's throne in the
latter days and their utter overthrow \[HORSLEY\].

gird yourselves . . . gird yourselves--The repetition expresses
vehemently the certainty of their being thrown into consternation (not
as English Version, "broken in pieces").

[Isaiah 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 8:10</span></span>

the word--of command, for the assault of Jerusalem.

God is with us--"Immanuel" implies this ([Num
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009.md); [Psa
46:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 8:11</span></span>

with a strong hand--or else, "when He grasped me with His hand"
\[HORSLEY\]. MAURER, as English Version, "with the impetus of His hand,"
that is, the felt impulse of His inspiration in my mind ([Jer
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017.md); [Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#014.md), [Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022.md); [Eze
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001).md).

way of . . . people--their distrust of Jehovah, and the panic which led
them and Ahab to seek Assyrian aid.

[Isaiah 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 8:12</span></span>

The words of Jehovah.

confederacy--rather, a conspiracy; an appropriate term for the unnatural
combination of Israel with Syrian foreigners against Judea and the
theocracy, to which the former was bound by ties of blood and hereditary
religion \[MAURER\].

to all . . . say--rather, of all which this people calleth a conspiracy
\[G. V. SMITH\].

their fear--namely, object of fear: the hostile conspiracy.

be afraid--rather \[MAURER\], "nor make others to be afraid."

[Isaiah 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 8:13</span></span>

Sanctify--Honor His holy name by regarding Him as your only hope of
safety ([Isa 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023.md); [Num
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#012).md).

him . . . fear--"fear" lest you provoke His wrath by your fear of man
and distrust of Him.

[Isaiah 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 8:14</span></span>

sanctuary--inviolable asylum, like the altar of the temple ([Kg1
1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050.md); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028.md); [Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016.md); compare [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010).md); namely, to those who fear and
trust in Him.

but . . . offence--that is, a rock over which they should fall to their
hurt; namely those who would not believe.

both . . . houses--Israel and Judah. Here again the prophecy expands
beyond the temporary application in Ahaz' time. The very stone,
Immanuel, which would have been a sanctuary on belief, becomes a fatal
stumbling-block through unbelief. Jesus Christ refers to this in [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md). (Compare [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md), [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md), [Deu
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md), [Deu
32:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030.md), [Deu
32:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037.md); [Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md); [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008).md).

gin--trap, in which birds are unexpectedly caught ([Luk
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035.md); [Th1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002).md). So at the destruction of
Jerusalem under Titus.

[Isaiah 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 8:15</span></span>

stumble . . . taken--images from the means used in taking wild animals.

[Isaiah 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 8:16</span></span>

Bind up . . . seal--What Isaiah had before briefly noted by inscribing
Maher-shalal-hash-baz in a tablet, fixed up in some public place, he
afterwards wrote out more in detail in a parchment roll ([Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008).md); this he is now to seal up, not
merely in order that nothing may be added to, or taken from it, as being
complete, but to imply that it relates to distant events, and is
therefore to be a sealed and not understood testimony ([Isa
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md), except in part among God's
"disciples," that is, those who "sanctify the Lord" by obedient trust
([Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014).md). Subsequent revelations
would afterwards clear up what now was dark. So the Apocalypse explains
what in Daniel was left unexplained (compare [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md); [Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009).md). "The words are closed up and
sealed till the time of the end"; but [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md), "Seal not the sayings of the
prophecy . . . for the time is at hand" (compare [Rev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md), [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md), [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).md),

testimony--attested by Uriah and Zechariah ([Isa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#002).md).

law--the revelation just given, having the force of a law.

disciples--not as MAURER, Uriah and Zechariah (compare [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 8:17</span></span>

I--Whatever the rest of the nation may do, I will look to Jehovah alone.

that hideth . . . face--though He seems now to withdraw His countenance
from Judah (the then representative of "the house of Jacob"). Let us
wait and trust in, though we cannot see, Him ([Isa
50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010.md); [Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md); [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md), [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038).md).

[Isaiah 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 8:18</span></span>

I and the children--Isaiah means "salvation of Jehovah"; His children's
names, also ([Isa 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md), [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); [Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003).md), were "signs" suggestive of the
coming and final deliverance.

wonders--that is, symbols of the future ([Isa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md); [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008).md). "Behold I . . . me" is quoted in
[Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md) to prove the manhood of the
Messiah. This is the main and ultimate fulfilment of the prophecy; its
temporary meaning is applied to Ahaz' time. Isaiah typically, in [Isa
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md), personates Messiah, who is at
once "Father" and "Son," Isaiah and Immanuel, "Child" and "Mighty God,"
and is therefore called here a "wonder," as in [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), "Wonderful." Hence in [Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md), believers are called His
"children"; but in [Isa 8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011.md), His
"brethren." On "the Lord hath given me," see [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md), [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md); [Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md); [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md).

which dwelleth in . . . Zion--and will therefore protect Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 8:19</span></span>

Seek unto--Consult in your national difficulties.

them . . . familiar spirits--necromancers, spirit charmers. So Saul,
when he had forsaken God ([Sa1 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#007.md),
&c.), consulted the witch of En-dor in his difficulties. These follow in
the wake of idolatry, which prevailed under Ahaz ([Kg2
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md), [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). He copied the soothsaying as
he did the idolatrous "altar" of Damascus (compare [Lev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006.md), which forbids it, [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003).md).

wizards--men claiming supernatural knowledge; from the old English, "to
wit," that is, know.

peep--rather "chirp faintly," as young birds do; this sound was
generally ascribed to departed spirits; by ventriloquism the soothsayers
caused a low sound to proceed as from a grave, or dead person. Hence the
Septuagint renders the Hebrew for "necromancers" here "ventriloquists"
(compare [Isa 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004).md).

mutter--moan.

should not, &c.--The answer which Isaiah recommends to be given to those
advising to have recourse to necromancers.

for the living, &c.--"should one, for the safety of the living, seek
unto (consult) the dead?" \[GESENIUS\]. LOWTH renders it, "In place of
(consulting) the living, should one consult the dead?"

[Isaiah 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 8:20</span></span>

To the law, &c.--the revelation of God by His prophet ([Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016).md), to which he directs them to
refer those who would advise necromancy.

if they speak not . . . it is because--English Version understands
"they" as the necromancers. But the Hebrew rendered "because" is not
this but "who"; and "if not," ought rather to be "shall they not"; or,
truly they shall speak according to this word, who have no morning light
(so the Hebrew, that is, prosperity after the night of sorrows) dawning
on them \[MAURER and G. V. SMITH\]. They who are in the dark night of
trial, without a dawn of hope, shall surely say so, Do not seek, as we
did, to necromancy, but to the law," &c. The law perhaps includes here
the law of Moses, which was the "Magna Charta" on which prophetism
commented \[KITTO\].

[Isaiah 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 8:21</span></span>

More detailed description of the despair, which they shall fall into,
who sought necromancy instead of God; [Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md) implies that too late they shall
see how much better it would have been for them to have sought "to the
law," &c. ([Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031).md). But now they
are given over to despair. Therefore, while seeing the truth of God,
they only "curse their King and God"; foreshadowing the future, like
conduct of those belonging to the "kingdom of the beast," when they
shall be visited with divine plagues ([Rev
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#011.md); compare [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012).md).

through it--namely, the land.

hardly bestead--oppressed with anxiety.

hungry--a more grievous famine than the temporary one in Ahaz' time,
owing to Assyria; then there was some food, but none now ([Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md), [Isa
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md); [Lev
26:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md), [Lev
26:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md), [Lev
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#020).md).

their king . . . God--Jehovah, King of the Jews ([Psa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#002.md); [Psa
68:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#024).md).

look upward . . . unto the earth--Whether they look up to heaven, or
down towards the land of Judea, nothing but despair shall present
itself.

dimness of anguish--darkness of distress ([Pro
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027).md).

driven to darkness--rather, "thick darkness" ([Jer
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012).md). Driven onward, as by a
sweeping storm. The Jewish rejection of "their King and God," Messiah,
was followed by all these awful calamities.
