### [Job Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001.md)

[Job 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 36:1</span></span>

(Job 36:1-33)

Elihu maintains that afflictions are to the godly disciplinary, in order
to lead them to attain a higher moral worth, and that the reason for
their continuance is not, as the friends asserted, on account of the
sufferer's extraordinary guilt, but because the discipline has not yet
attained its object, namely, to lend him to humble himself penitently
before God ([Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003).md). This is Elihu's fourth speech.
He thus exceeds the ternary number of the others. Hence his formula of
politeness ([Job 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#002).md). Literally,
"Wait yet but a little for me." Bear with me a little farther. I have
yet (much, [Job 32:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#018).md). There are
Chaldeisms in this verse, agreeably to the view that the scene of the
book is near the Euphrates and the Chaldees.

[Job 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 36:3</span></span>

from afar--not trite commonplaces, but drawn from God's mighty works.

ascribe righteousness--whereas Job ascribed unrighteousness ([Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md), [Job
34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012).md). A man, in enquiring into God's
ways, should at the outset presume they are all just, be willing to find
them so, and expect that the result of investigation will prove them to
be so; such a one will never be disappointed \[BARNES\].

[Job 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 36:4</span></span>

I will not "speak wickedly for God," as the friends ([Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md), [Job
13:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007).md) --that is, vindicate God by
unsound arguments.

he that is perfect, &c.--Rather, as the parallelism requires, "a man of
integrity in sentiments is with thee" (is he with whom thou hast to do).
Elihu means himself, as opposed to the dishonest reasonings of the
friends ([Job 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#034).md).

[Job 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 36:5</span></span>

Rather, "strength of understanding" (heart) the force of the repetition
of "mighty"; as "mighty" as God is, none is too low to be "despised" by
Him; for His "might" lies especially in "His strength of understanding,"
whereby He searches out the most minute things, so as to give to each
his right. Elihu confirms his exhortation ([Job
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#014).md).

[Job 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 36:6</span></span>

right . . . poor--He espouses the cause of the afflicted.

[Job 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 36:7</span></span>

([Pe1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#012).md). God does not forsake the
godly, as Job implied, but "establishes," or makes them sit on the
throne as kings ([Sa1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md); [Psa
113:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007).md). True of believers in the
highest sense, already in part ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md); hereafter fully ([Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md); [Job
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005).md).

and they are--that they may be.

[Job 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 36:8</span></span>

If they be afflicted, it is no proof that they are hypocrites, as the
friends maintain, or that God disregards them, and is indifferent
whether men are good or bad, as Job asserts: God is thereby
"disciplining them," and "showing them their sins," and if they bow in a
right spirit under God's visiting hand, the greatest blessings ensue.

[Job 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 36:9</span></span>

work--transgression.

that . . . exceeded--"In that they behaved themselves mightily"
(literally, "great"); that is, presumptuously, or, at least,
self-confidently.

[Job 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 36:10</span></span>

([Job 33:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md), [Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md).

[Job 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 36:11</span></span>

serve--that is, worship; as in [Isa
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md). God is to be supplied (compare
[Isa 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019).md).

[Job 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 36:12</span></span>

([Job 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#018).md).

without knowledge--that is, on account of their foolishness ([Job
4:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020).md).

[Job 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 36:13</span></span>

Same sentiment as [Job 36:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011.md),
expanded.

hypocrites--or, the ungodly \[MAURER\]; but "hypocrites" is perhaps a
distinct class from the openly wicked ([Job
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#012).md).

heap up wrath--of God against themselves ([Rom
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005).md). UMBREIT translates, "nourish
their wrath against God," instead of "crying" unto Him. This suits well
the parallelism and the Hebrew. But the English Version gives a good
parallelism, "hypocrites" answering to "cry not" ([Job
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#008.md), [Job
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#010).md); "heap up wrath" against
themselves, to "He bindeth them" with fetters of affliction ([Job
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#008).md).

[Job 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 36:14</span></span>

Rather ([Deu 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017).md), Their life is
(ended) as that of (literally, "among") the unclean, prematurely and
dishonorably. So the second clause answers to the first. A warning that
Job make not common cause with the wicked ([Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036).md).

[Job 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 36:15</span></span>

poor--the afflicted pious.

openeth . . . ears-- ([Job 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010).md); so
as to be admonished in their straits ("oppression") to seek God
penitently, and so be "delivered" ([Job
33:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md), [Job
33:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023).md).

[Job 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 36:16</span></span>

Rather, "He will lead forth thee also out of the jaws of a strait" ([Psa
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md); [Psa
118:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#005).md).

broad place--expresses the liberty, and the well-supplied "table" the
abundance of the prosperous ([Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md); [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md).

[Job 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 36:17</span></span>

Rather, "But if thou art fulfilled (that is, entirely filled) with the
judgment of the wicked (that is, the guilt incurring judgment"
\[MAURER\]; or rather, as UMBREIT, referring to [Job
34:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md), [Job
34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md), the judgment pronounced on God
by the guilty in misfortunes), judgment (God's judgment on the wicked,
[Jer 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md), playing on the double
meaning of "judgment") and justice shall closely follow each other
\[UMBREIT\].

[Job 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 36:18</span></span>

([Num 16:45](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#045.md); [Psa
49:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md); [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026).md). Even the "ransom" by Jesus
Christ ([Job 33:24](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#024).md) will be of no
avail to wilful despisers ([Heb
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md).

with his stroke-- ([Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026).md).
UMBREIT translates, "Beware lest the wrath of God (thy severe calamity)
lead thee to scorn" ([Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md); [Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023).md). This accords better with the
verb in the parallel clause, which ought to be translated, "Let not the
great ransom (of money, which thou canst give) seduce thee (Margin, turn
thee aside, as if thou couldst deliver thyself from "wrath" by it). As
the "scorn" in the first clause answers to the "judgment of the wicked"
([Job 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017)), so "ransom" ("seduce".md)
to "will he esteem riches" ([Job
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019).md). Thus, [Job
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#018.md) is the transition between [Job
36:17](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017.md) and [Job
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019.md).

[Job 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 36:19</span></span>

forces of strength--that is, resources of wealth ([Psa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md); [Pro
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004).md).

[Job 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 36:20</span></span>

Desire--pant for. Job had wished for death ([Job
3:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003), &c..md).

night-- ([Joh 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004).md).

when--rather, "whereby."

cut off--literally, "ascend," as the corn cut and lifted upon the wagon
or stack ([Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026).md); so "cut off,"
"disappear."

in their place--literally, "under themselves"; so, without moving from
their place, on the spot, suddenly ([Job
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012).md) \[MAURER\]. UMBREIT'S
translation: "To ascend (which is really, as thou wilt find to thy cost,
to descend) to the people below" (literally, "under themselves"),
answers better to the parallelism and the Hebrew. Thou pantest for death
as desirable, but it is a "night" or region of darkness; thy fancied
ascent (amelioration) will prove a descent (deterioration) ([Job
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#022).md); therefore desire it not.

[Job 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 36:21</span></span>

regard--literally, "turn thyself to."

iniquity--namely, presumptuous speaking against God ([Job
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md), and above, see on [Job
36:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#017).md).

rather than--to bear "affliction" with pious patience. Men think it an
alleviation to complain against God, but this is adding sin to sorrow;
it is sin, not sorrow, which can really hurt us (contrast [Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025).md).

[Job 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 36:22</span></span>

God is not to be impiously arraigned, but to be praised for His might,
shown in His works.

exalteth--rather, doeth lofty things, shows His exalted power
\[UMBREIT\] ([Psa 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#013).md).

teacheth-- ([Psa 94:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012), &c..md). The
connection is, returning to [Job 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#005.md),
God's "might" is shown in His "wisdom"; He alone can teach; yet, because
He, as a sovereign, explains not all His dealings, forsooth Job must
presume to teach Him ([Isa 40:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md);
[Rom 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md); [Co1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016).md). So the transition to [Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023.md) is natural. UMBREIT with the
Septuagint translates, "Who is Lord," wrongly, as this meaning belongs
to later Hebrew.

[Job 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 36:23</span></span>

Job dared to prescribe to God what He should do ([Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md), [Job
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013).md).

[Job 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 36:24</span></span>

Instead of arraigning, let it be thy fixed principle to magnify God in
His works ([Psa 111:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#002.md); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003).md); these, which all may "see," may
convince us that what we do not see is altogether wise and good ([Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md).

behold--As "see" ([Job 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025).md), shows;
not, as MAURER, "sing," laud (see on [Job
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027).md).

[Job 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 36:25</span></span>

See--namely, with wondering admiration \[MAURER\].

man may behold--rather, "(yet) mortals (a different Hebrew word from
'man') behold it (only) from afar off," see but a small "part" ([Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014).md).

[Job 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 36:26</span></span>

([Job 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013).md). God's greatness in
heaven and earth: a reason why Job should bow under His afflicting hand.

know him not--only in part ([Job
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#025.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md).

his years-- ([Psa 90:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002.md); [Psa
102:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024.md), [Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027).md); applied to Jesus Christ ([Heb
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012).md).

[Job 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 36:27</span></span>

The marvellous formation of rain (so [Job
5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009).md).

maketh small--Rather, "He draweth (up) to Him, He attracts (from the
earth below) the drops of water; they (the drops of water) pour down
rain, (which is) His vapor." "Vapor" is in apposition with "rain,"
marking the way in which rain is formed; namely, from the vapor drawn up
by God into the air and then condensed into drops, which fall ([Psa
147:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#008).md). The suspension of such a mass
of water, and its descent not in a deluge, but in drops of vapory rain,
are the marvel. The selection of this particular illustration of God's
greatness forms a fit prelude to the storm in which God appears ([Job
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001).md).

[Job 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 36:28</span></span>

abundantly--literally, "upon many men."

[Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 36:29</span></span>

([Job 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#005).md). God's marvels in thunder
and lightnings.

spreadings, &c.--the canopy of thick clouds, which covers the heavens in
a storm ([Psa 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039).md).

the noise--"crashing"; namely, thunder.

of his tabernacle--God being poetically said to have His pavilion amid
dark clouds ([Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); [Isa
40:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022).md).

[Job 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 36:30</span></span>

light--lightning.

it--His tabernacle ([Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029).md). The
light, in an instant spread over the vast mass of dark clouds, forms a
striking picture.

spread--is repeated from [Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029.md) to
form an antithesis. "He spreads not only clouds, but light."

covereth the bottom--roots.

of the sea--namely, with the light. In the storm the depths of ocean are
laid bare; and the light "covers" them, at the same moment that it
"spreads" across the dark sky. So in [Psa
18:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md), the discovering of "the
channels of waters" follows the "lightnings." UMBREIT translates: "He
spreadeth His light upon Himself, and covereth Himself with the roots of
the sea" ([Psa 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md). God's garment
is woven of celestial light and of the watery depths, raised to the sky
to form His cloudy canopy. The phrase, "cover Himself with the roots of
the sea," is harsh; but the image is grand.

[Job 36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 36:31</span></span>

These (rain and lightnings) are marvellous and not to be understood
([Job 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#029).md), yet necessary. "For by
them He judgeth (chastiseth on the one hand), &c. (and on the other, by
them) He giveth meat" (food), &c. ([Job
37:13](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#013.md); [Job
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#023.md), [Job
38:27](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#027.md); [Act
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017).md).

[Job 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 36:32</span></span>

Rather, "He covereth (both) His hands with light (lightning, [Job
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003), Margin.md), and giveth it a command
against his adversary" (literally, the one "assailing" Him, [Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002.md); [Psa
139:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#020.md); [Job
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#019).md). Thus, as in [Job
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md), the twofold effects of His
waters are set forth, so here, of His light; in the one hand,
destructive lightning against the wicked; in the other, the genial light
for good to His friends, &c. ([Job
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033).md) \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 36:33](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 36:33</span></span>

noise--rather, He revealeth it (literally, "announceth concerning it")
to His friend (antithesis to adversary, [Job
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#032.md), so the Hebrew is translated,
[Job 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011).md); also to cattle and plants
(literally, "that which shooteth up"; [Gen
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#010.md); [Gen
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#022).md). As the genial effect of
"water" in the growth of food, is mentioned, [Job
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#031.md), so here that of "light" in
cherishing cattle and plants \[UMBREIT\]. If English Version, "noise" be
retained, translate, "His noise (thunder) announces concerning Him (His
coming in the tempest), the cattle (to announce) concerning Him when He
is in the act of rising up" (in the storm). Some animals give various
