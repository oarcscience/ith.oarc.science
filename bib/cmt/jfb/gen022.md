### [Genesis Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 22:1</span></span>

OFFERING ISAAC. (Gen. 22:1-19)

God did tempt Abraham--not incite to sin ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013).md), but try, prove--give occasion
for the development of his faith ([Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).md).

and he said, . . . Here I am--ready at a moment's warning for God's
service.

[Genesis 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 22:2</span></span>

Take now thy son, &c.--Every circumstance mentioned was calculated to
give a deeper stab to the parental bosom. To lose his only son, and by
an act of his own hand, too!--what a host of conflicting feelings must
the order have raised! But he heard and obeyed without a murmur ([Gal
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md); [Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026).md).

[Genesis 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 22:3</span></span>

Abraham rose . . . early, &c.--That there might be no appearance of
delay or reluctance on his part, he made every preparation for the
sacrifice before setting out--the materials, the knife, and the servants
to convey them. From Beer-sheba to Moriah, a journey of two days, he had
the painful secret pent up in his bosom. So distant a place must have
been chosen for some important reason. It is generally thought that this
was one the hills of Jerusalem, on which the Great Sacrifice was
afterwards offered.

[Genesis 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 22:4</span></span>

on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, &c.--Leaving the servants
at the foot \[[Gen 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005.md)\], the father
and son ascended the hill, the one bearing the knife, and the other the
wood for consuming the sacrifice \[[Gen
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#006.md)\]. But there was no victim; and
to the question so naturally put by Isaac \[[Gen
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#007.md)\], Abraham contented himself by
replying, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
offering." It has been supposed that the design of this extraordinary
transaction was to show him, by action instead of words, the way in
which all the families of the earth should be blessed; and that in his
answer to Isaac, he anticipated some substitution. It is more likely
that his words were spoken evasively to his son in ignorance of the
issue, yet in unbounded confidence that that son, though sacrificed,
would, in some miraculous way, be restored ([Heb
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#019).md).

[Genesis 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 22:9</span></span>

Abraham built an altar, &c.--Had not the patriarch been sustained by the
full consciousness of acting in obedience to God's will, the effort
would have been too great for human endurance; and had not Isaac, then
upwards of twenty years of age displayed equal faith in submitting, this
great trial could not have gone through.

[Genesis 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 22:11</span></span>

the angel . . . called, &c.--The sacrifice was virtually offered--the
intention, the purpose to do it, was shown in all sincerity and fulness.
The Omniscient witness likewise declared His acceptance in the highest
terms of approval; and the apostle speaks of it as actually made ([Heb
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017.md); [Jam
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021).md).

[Genesis 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 22:13</span></span>

Abraham lifted up his eyes . . . and behold . . . a ram, &c.--No method
was more admirably calculated to give the patriarch a distinct idea of
the purpose of grace than this scenic representation: and hence our
Lord's allusion to it ([Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056).md).
