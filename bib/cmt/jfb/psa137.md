### [Psalms Chapter 137](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 137:1</span></span>

This Psalm records the mourning of the captive Israelites, and a prayer
and prediction respecting the destruction of their enemies. ([Psa
137:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001).md)

rivers of Babylon--the name of the city used for the whole country.

remembered Zion--or, Jerusalem, as in [Psa
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md).

[Psalms 137:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 137:2</span></span>

upon the willows--which may have grown there then, if not now; as the
palm, which was once common, is now rare in Palestine.

[Psalms 137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 137:3</span></span>

Whether the request was in curiosity or derision, the answer intimates
that a compliance was incongruous with their mournful feelings ([Pro
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 137:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 137:5</span></span>

For joyful songs would imply forgetfulness of their desolated homes and
fallen Church. The solemn imprecations on the hand and tongue, if thus
forgetful, relate to the cunning or skill in playing, and the power of
singing.

[Psalms 137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 137:7</span></span>

Remember . . . the children of Edom--(Compare [Psa
132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001).md), that is, to punish.

the day of Jerusalem--its downfall ([Lam
4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md); [Oba
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 137:8</span></span>

daughter of Babylon--the people ([Psa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013).md). Their destruction had been
abundantly foretold ([Isa 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014.md); [Jer
51:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#023).md). For the terribleness of that
destruction, God's righteous judgment, and not the passions of the
chafed Israelites, was responsible.
