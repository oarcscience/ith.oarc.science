### [Hosea Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 9:1</span></span>

WARNING AGAINST ISRAEL'S JOY AT PARTIAL RELIEF FROM THEIR TROUBLES:
THEIR CROPS SHALL FAIL, AND THE PEOPLE LEAVE THE LORD'S LAND FOR EGYPT
AND ASSYRIA, WHERE THEY CANNOT, IF SO INCLINED, SERVE GOD ACCORDING TO
THE ANCIENT RITUAL: FOLLY OF THEIR FALSE PROPHETS. (Hos. 9:1-17)

Rejoice not . . . for joy--literally, "to exultation." Thy exultation at
the league with Pul, by which peace seems secured, is out of place:
since thy idolatry will bring ruin on thee.

as other people--the Assyrians for instance, who, unlike thee, are in
the height of prosperity.

loved a reward upon every corn floor--Thou hast desired, in reward for
thy homage to idols, abundance of corn on every threshing-floor ([Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md).

[Hosea 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 9:2</span></span>

([Hos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md), [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md).

fail--disappoint her expectation.

[Hosea 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 9:3</span></span>

return to Egypt--(See on [Hos 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013).md).
As in [Hos 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005.md) it is said, "He shall
not return into . . . Egypt." FAIRBAIRN thinks it is not the exact
country that is meant, but the bondage state with which, from past
experience, Egypt was identified in their minds. Assyria was to be a
second Egypt to them. [Deu 28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md),
though threatening a return to Egypt, speaks ([Deu
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036).md) of their being brought to a
nation which neither they nor their fathers had known, showing that it
is not the literal Egypt, but a second Egypt-like bondage that is
threatened.

eat unclean things in Assyria--reduced by necessity to eat meats
pronounced unclean by the Mosaic law ([Eze
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013).md). See [Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006.md).

[Hosea 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 9:4</span></span>

offer wine offerings--literally, "pour as a libation ([Exo
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#009.md); [Lev
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#013).md).

neither shall they be pleasing unto him--as being offered on a profane
soil.

sacrifices . . . as the bread of mourners--which was unclean ([Deu
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014.md); [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007.md); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017).md).

their bread for their soul--their offering for the expiation of their
soul \[CALVIN\], ([Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).md). Rather,
"their bread for their sustenance ('soul' being often used for the
animal life, [Gen 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#021), Margin.md) shall
not come into the Lord's house"; it shall only subserve their own uses,
not My worship.

[Hosea 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 9:5</span></span>

([Hos 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 9:6</span></span>

because of destruction--to escape from the devastation of their country.

Egypt shall gather them up--that is, into its sepulchres ([Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005).md). Instead of returning to
Palestine, they should die in Egypt.

Memphis--famed as a necropolis.

the pleasant places for their silver--that is, their desired treasuries
for their money. Or, "whatever precious thing they have of silver"
\[MAURER\].

nettles--the sign of desolation ([Isa
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 9:7</span></span>

visitation--vengeance: punishment ([Isa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003).md).

Israel shall know it--to her cost experimentally ([Isa
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009).md).

the prophet is a fool--The false prophet who foretold prosperity to the
nation shall be convicted of folly by the event.

the spiritual man--the man pretending to inspiration ([Lam
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014.md); [Eze
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md); [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004).md).

for the multitude of thine iniquity, &c.--Connect these words with, "the
days of visitation . . . are come"; "the prophet . . . is mad," being
parenthetical.

the great hatred--or, "the great provocation" \[HENDERSON\]; or, "(thy)
great apostasy" \[MAURER\]. English Version means Israel's "hatred" of
God's prophets and the law.

[Hosea 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 9:8</span></span>

The watchman . . . was with my God--The spiritual watchmen, the true
prophets, formerly consulted my God ([Jer
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#006.md); [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md); but their so-called prophet is a
snare, entrapping Israel into idolatry.

hatred--rather, "(a cause of) apostasy" (see [Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md) \[MAURER\].

house of his God--that is, the state of Ephraim, as in [Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md) \[MAURER\]. Or, "the house of his
(false) god," the calves \[CALVIN\]. Jehovah, "my God," seems contrasted
with "his God." CALVIN'S view is therefore preferable.

[Hosea 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 9:9</span></span>

as in the days of Gibeah--as in the day of the perpetration of the
atrocity of Gibeah, narrated in [Jdg
19:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#016.md), &c.

[Hosea 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 9:10</span></span>

As the traveller in a wilderness is delighted at finding grapes to
quench his thirst, or the early fig (esteemed a great delicacy in the
East, [Isa 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md); [Jer
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002.md); [Mic
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001).md); so it was My delight to choose
your fathers as My peculiar people in Egypt ([Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015).md).

at her first time--when the first-fruits of the tree become ripe.

went to Baal-peor-- ([Num 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003).md): the
Moabite idol, in whose worship young women prostituted themselves; the
very sin Israel latterly was guilty of.

separated themselves--consecrated themselves.

unto that shame--to that shameful or foul idol ([Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013).md).

their abominations were according as they loved--rather, as Vulgate,
"they became abominable like the object of their love" ([Deu
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026.md); [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008).md). English Version gives good
sense, "their abominable idols they followed after, according as their
lusts prompted them" ([Amo 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005.md),
Margin).

[Hosea 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 9:11</span></span>

their glory shall fly away--fit retribution to those who "separated
themselves unto that shame" ([Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010).md). Children were accounted the
glory of parents; sterility, a reproach. "Ephraim" means "fruitfulness"
([Gen 41:52](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#052).md); this its name shall
cease to be its characteristic.

from the birth . . . womb . . . conception--Ephraim's children shall
perish in a threefold gradation; (1) From the time of birth. (2) From
the time of pregnancy. (3) From the time of their first conception.

[Hosea 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 9:12</span></span>

Even though they should rear their children, yet will I bereave them
(the Ephraimites) of them ([Job
27:14](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#014).md).

woe . . . to them when I depart--Yet the ungodly in their madness desire
God to depart from them ([Job 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014.md);
[Job 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017.md); [Mat
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034).md). At last they know to their cost
how awful it is when God has departed ([Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017.md); [Sa1
28:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md); compare [Hos
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011.md); [Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021).md).

[Hosea 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 9:13</span></span>

Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus . . . in a pleasant place--that is, in looking
towards Tyrus (on whose borders Ephraim lay) I saw Ephraim beautiful in
situation like her (Eze. 26:1-28:26).

is planted--as a fruitful tree; image suggested by the meaning of
"Ephraim" ([Hos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md).

bring forth his children to the murderer-- ([Hos
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md); [Hos
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#016).md). With all his fruitfulness, his
children shall only be brought up to be slain.

[Hosea 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 9:14</span></span>

what wilt thou give?--As if overwhelmed by feeling, he deliberates with
God what is most desirable.

give . . . a miscarrying womb--Of two evils he chooses the least. So
great will be the calamity, that barrenness will be a blessing, though
usually counted a great misfortune ([Job
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md); [Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014.md); [Luk
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029).md).

[Hosea 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 9:15</span></span>

All their wickedness--that is, their chief guilt.

Gilgal--(see on [Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md). This was
the scene of their first contumacy in rejecting God and choosing a king
([Sa1 11:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#014.md); compare [Sa1
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007).md), and of their subsequent
idolatry.

there I hated them--not with the human passion, but holy hatred of their
sin, which required punishment to be inflicted on themselves (compare
[Mal 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003).md).

out of mine house--as in [Hos 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md) :
out of the land holy unto ME. Or, as "love" is mentioned immediately
after, the reference may be to the Hebrew mode of divorce, the husband
(God) putting the wife (Israel) out of the house.

princes . . . revolters--"Sarim . . . Sorerim" (Hebrew), a play on
similar sounds.

[Hosea 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 9:16</span></span>

The figures "root," "fruit," are suggested by the word "Ephraim," that
is, fruitful (see on [Hos 9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#011).md).
"Smitten," namely, with a blight ([Psa
102:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004).md).

[Hosea 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 9:17</span></span>

My God--"My," in contrast to "them," that is, the people, whose God
Jehovah no longer is. Also Hosea appeals to God as supporting his
authority against the whole people.

wanderers among . . . nations-- ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md); [Ch1
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#026).md).
