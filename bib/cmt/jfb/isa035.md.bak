### [Isaiah Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 35:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY IN THE THIRTY-FOURTH CHAPTER. ([Isa
35:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001).md)

solitary place--literally, "a dry place," without springs of water. A
moral wilderness is meant.

for them--namely, on account of the punishment inflicted according to
the preceding prophecy on the enemy; probably the blessings set forth in
this chapter are included in the causes for joy ([Isa
55:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#012).md).

rose--rather, "the meadow-saffron," an autumnal flower with bulbous
roots; so Syriac translation.

[Isaiah 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 35:2</span></span>

glory of Lebanon--its ornament, namely, its cedars ([Isa
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md).

excellency of Carmel--namely, its beauty.

Sharon--famed for its fertility.

see . . . glory of the Lord . . . excellency-- ([Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005.md), [Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009).md). While the wilderness which had
neither "glory" nor "excellency" shall have both "given to it," the Lord
shall have all the "glory" and "excellency" ascribed to Him, not to the
transformed wilderness ([Mat 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 35:3</span></span>

Strengthen . . . hands . . . confirm . . . knees--The Hebrew for
"strengthen" refers to the strength residing in the hand for grasping
and holding a thing manfully; "confirm," to the firmness with which one
keeps his ground, so as not to be dislodged by any other \[MAURER\].
Encourage the Jews, now desponding, by the assurance of the blessings
promised.

[Isaiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 35:4</span></span>

fearful--"hasty," Margin; that is, with a heart fluttered with
agitation.

with--the Hebrew is more forcible than the English Version: "God will
come, vengeance! even God, a recompense!" The sense is the same.

[Isaiah 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 35:5</span></span>

Language figuratively, descriptive of the joy felt at the deliverance
from Assyria and Babylon; literally, true of the antitypical times of
Messiah and His miracles (see Margin references, [Mat
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005.md); [Luk
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002.md); [Jo2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#005.md), [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008.md); [Act
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 35:6</span></span>

leap--literally, "fulfilled" ([Act
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#008.md); [Act
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#010).md).

sing--joyful thanksgiving.

in . . . wilderness . . . waters-- ([Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 35:7</span></span>

parched ground--rather, "the mirage (Hebrew, Sharab, 'the sun's heat')
shall become a (real) lake." The sun's rays refracted on the glowing
sands at midday give the appearance of a lake of water and often deceive
the thirsty traveller (compare [Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md).

dragons--rather, "jackals."

each--namely, jackal.

grass--rather, "a dwelling or receptacle (answering to the previous
habitation) for reeds," &c. (which only grow where there is water, [Job
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011).md). Where once there was no water,
water shall abound.

[Isaiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 35:8</span></span>

highway--such a causeway (raised way, from a Hebrew root, "to cast up")
as was used for the march of armies; valleys being filled up, hills and
other obstructions removed ([Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010.md); compare [Isa
40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003).md).

way of holiness--Hebraism for "the holy way." HORSLEY translates, "the
way of the Holy One;" but the words that follow, and [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md), show it is the way leading the
redeemed back to Jerusalem, both the literal and the heavenly ([Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md); [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017.md); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md); still Christ at His coming
again shall be the Leader on the way, for which reason it is called,
"The way of the Lord" ([Isa 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

it shall be for those: the wayfaring men--rather, "He (the Holy One)
shall be with them, walking in the way" \[HORSLEY\].

though fools--rather, "And (even) fools," that is, the simple shall not
go astray, namely, because "He shall be with them" ([Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); [Co1
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 35:9</span></span>

No lion--such as might be feared on the way through the wilderness which
abounded in wild beasts, back to Judea. Every danger shall be warded off
the returning people ([Isa 11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md);
[Eze 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018).md). Compare spiritually, [Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017.md).

[Isaiah 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 35:10</span></span>

Language: literally, applying to the return from Babylon; figuratively
and more fully to the completed redemption of both literal and spiritual
Israel.

joy upon . . . heads-- ([Psa 126:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#002).md).
Joy manifested in their countenances. Some fancy an allusion to the
custom of pouring oil "upon the head," or wearing chaplets in times of
public festivity ([Ecc 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008).md).

This and the thirty-seventh through thirty-ninth chapters form the
historical appendix closing the first division of Isaiah's prophecies,
and were added to make the parts of these referring to Assyria more
intelligible. So Jer. 52:1-34; compare 2Ki. 25:1-30. The section occurs
almost word for word ([Kg2 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md), [Kg2
18:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017); 2Ki. 19:1-37.md); [Kg2
18:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014.md), however, is additional
matter. Hezekiah's "writing" also is in Isaiah, not in Kings ([Isa
38:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009).md). We know from [Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032.md) that Isaiah wrote the acts of
Hezekiah. It is, therefore, probable, that his record here (Isa.
36:1-39:8) was incorporated into the Book of Kings by its compiler.
Sennacherib lived, according to Assyrian inscriptions, more than twenty
years after his invasion; but as Isaiah survived Hezekiah ([Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032).md), who lived upwards of fifteen
years after the invasion ([Isa 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005).md),
the record of Sennacherib's death ([Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038).md) is no objection to this section
having come from Isaiah; 2Ch. 32:1-33 is probably an abstract drawn from
Isaiah's account, as the chronicler himself implies ([Ch2
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#032).md). Pul was probably the last of
the old dynasty, and Sargon, a powerful satrap, who contrived to possess
himself of supreme power and found a new dynasty (see on [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md). No attempt was made by Judah to
throw off the Assyrian yoke during his vigorous reign. The accession of
his son Sennacherib was thought by Hezekiah the opportune time to refuse
the long-paid tribute; Egypt and Ethiopia, to secure an ally against
Assyria on their Asiatic frontier, promised help; Isaiah, while opposed
to submission to Assyria, advised reliance on Jehovah, and not on Egypt,
but his advice was disregarded, and so Sennacherib invaded Judea, 712
B.C. He was the builder of the largest of the excavated palaces, that of
Koyunjik. HINCKS has deciphered his name in the inscriptions. In the
third year of his reign, these state that he overran Syria, took Sidon
and other PhÅ“nician cities, and then passed to southwest Palestine,
where he defeated the Egyptians and Ethiopians (compare [Kg2
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#021.md); [Kg2
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#009).md). His subsequent retreat, after
his host was destroyed by God, is of course suppressed in the
inscriptions. But other particulars inscribed agree strikingly with the
Bible; the capture of the "defensed cities of Judah," the devastation of
the country and deportation of its inhabitants; the increased tribute
imposed on Hezekiah--thirty talents of gold--this exact number being
given in both; the silver is set down in the inscriptions at eight
hundred talents, in the Bible three hundred; the latter may have been
the actual amount carried off, the larger sum may include the silver
from the temple doors, pillars, &c. ([Kg2
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#016).md).
