### [Jeremiah Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 36:1</span></span>

BARUCH WRITES, AND READS PUBLICLY JEREMIAH'S PROPHECIES COLLECTED IN A
VOLUME. THE ROLL IS BURNT BY JEHOIAKIM, AND WRITTEN AGAIN BY BARUCH AT
JEREMIAH'S DICTATION. (Jer. 36:1-32)

fourth year--The command to write the roll was given in the fourth year,
but it was not read publicly till the fifth year. As Isaiah subjoined to
his predictions a history of events confirming his prophecies (Isa.
36:1-22; Isa. 37:1-38; Isa. 38:1-22; [Isa
39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001)), so Jeremiah also in the
thirty-seventh through forty-third chapters; but he prefaces his history
with the narrative of an incident that occurred some time ago, showing
that he, not only by word, but in writing, and that twice, had testified
all that he about to state as having subsequently come to pass
\[GROTIUS\]. At the end of Jehoiakim's third year, Nebuchadnezzar
enrolled an army against Jerusalem and took it in the end of the fifth
or beginning of the sixth year, carrying away captive Jehoiakim, Daniel,
&c. Jehoiakim returned the same year, and for three years was tributary:
then he withheld tribute. Nebuchadnezzar returned and took Jerusalem,
and carried off Jehoiakim, who died on the road. This harmonizes this
chapter with 2Ki. 24:1-20 and Dan. 1:1-21. See on [Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019).

[Jeremiah 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 36:2</span></span>

roll of a book--a book formed of prepared skins made into a roll.
Compare "volume of the book," that is, the Pentateuch ([Psa
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007)). It does not follow that his
prophecies were not before committed to writing; what is implied is,
they were now written together in one volume, so as to be read
continuously to the Jews in the temple.

against . . . nations-- ([Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015),
&c.).

from . . . days of Josiah-- ([Jer
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003)). From Josiah's thirteenth year
([Jer 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 36:3</span></span>

hear--consider seriously.

return . . . from . . . evil way-- ([Jon
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 36:4</span></span>

all . . . words of . . . Lord--God specially suggesting what might
otherwise have escaped his memory, and directing the choice of words, as
well as the substance ([Joh 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026);
[Joh 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 36:5</span></span>

I am shut up--not in prison, for there is no account of his imprisonment
under Jehoiakim, and [Jer 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019), [Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026) are inconsistent with it: but,
"I am prevented," namely, by some hindrance; or, through fear of the
king, to whose anger Baruch was less exposed, as not being the author of
the prophecy.

[Jeremiah 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 36:6</span></span>

go--on the following year ([Jer 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)).

fasting day--(See [Jer 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)). An
extraordinary fast, in the ninth month (whereas the fast on the great
day of atonement was on the tenth day of the seventh month, [Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029); [Lev
23:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027)), appointed to avert the
impending calamity, when it was feared Nebuchadnezzar, having in the
year before (that is, the fourth of Jehoiakim), smitten Pharaoh-necho at
Carchemish, would attack Judea, as the ally of Egypt ([Kg2
23:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034)). The fast was likely to be
an occasion on which Jeremiah would find the Jews more softened, as well
as a larger number of them met together.

[Jeremiah 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 36:7</span></span>

present . . . supplication--literally, "supplication shall fall";
alluding to the prostrate attitude of the supplicants ([Deu
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#025); [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039)), as petitioners fall at the
feet of a king in the East. So Hebrew, [Jer
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#026); [Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018), Margin.

[Jeremiah 36:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 36:9</span></span>

they proclaimed . . . to all the people . . . to all, &c.--rather, "all
the people . . . all the people proclaimed a fast" \[MICHAELIS\]. The
chiefs appointed the fast by the wish of the people. In either version
the ungodly king had no share in appointing the fast.

[Jeremiah 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 36:10</span></span>

chamber--Baruch read from the window or balcony of the chamber looking
into the court where the people were assembled. However, some of the
chambers were large enough to contain a considerable number ([Neh
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#005)).

Gemariah--distinct from the Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, in [Jer
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003).

Shaphan--the same person as in [Kg2
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).

scribe--secretary of state, or he who presided over the public records.

higher court--that of the priests, the court of the people being lower
([Ch2 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009)).

new gate-- ([Jer 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#010)). The east
gate.

[Jeremiah 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 36:12</span></span>

scribe's chamber--an apartment in the palace occupied by the secretary
of state.

princes--holding a counsel of state at the time.

Elnathan--who had already been an instrument of evil in Jehoiakim's hand
([Jer 26:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022)).

Hananiah--the false prophet ([Jer
28:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 36:14</span></span>

Jehudi--of a good family, as appears from his pedigree being given so
fully, but in a subordinate position.

come--Instead of requiring Baruch to come to them, they ought to have
gone to the temple, and there professed their penitence. But pride
forbade it \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 36:16</span></span>

afraid, both one and other--Hebrew, "fear-stricken," they turned to one
another (compare [Gen 42:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#028)). This
showed, on their part, hesitancy, and some degree of fear of God, but
not enough to make them willing to sacrifice the favor of an earthly
king. We will surely tell the king--not the language of threatening but
implying that the matter is of such moment that the king ought to be
made acquainted with it, so as to seek some remedy against the divine
anger.

[Jeremiah 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 36:17</span></span>

What they wished to know was, whether what Baruch had read to them was
written by him from memory after hearing Jeremiah repeating his
prophecies continuously, or accurately from the prophet's own dictation.

[Jeremiah 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 36:18</span></span>

his mouth--Baruch replies it was by the oral dictation of the prophet;
[Jer 36:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#002) accords with this view,
rather than with the notion that Jeremiah repeated his prophecies from
manuscripts.

ink--his specification of the "ink" implies: I added nothing save the
hand, pen, and ink.

[Jeremiah 36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 36:19</span></span>

Showing that they were not altogether without better feelings (compare
[Jer 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016), [Jer
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025)).

[Jeremiah 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 36:20</span></span>

chamber--There were chambers in the king's palace round the court or
great hall, as in the temple ([Jer
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#010)). The roll was "laid up" there
for safekeeping, with other public records.

[Jeremiah 36:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 36:21</span></span>

sent Jehudi--Note how unbelievers flee from God, and yet seek Him
through some kind of involuntary impulse \[CALVIN\]. Jehudi seems to
have been the king's ready tool for evil.

[Jeremiah 36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 36:22</span></span>

winter house-- ([Amo 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#015)).

ninth month--namely, of the religious year, that is, November or
December.

fire on . . . hearth--rather, the stove was burning before him. In the
East neither chimneys nor ovens are used, but, in cold weather, a brazen
vessel containing burning charcoal; when the wood has burned to embers,
a cover is placed over the pot to make it retain the heat.

[Jeremiah 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 36:23</span></span>

three or four leaves--not distinct leaves as in a book, but the
consecutive spaces on the long roll in the shape of doors (whence the
Hebrew name is derived), into which the writing is divided: as the books
of Moses in the synagogue in the present day are written in a long
parchment rolled round a stick, the writing divided into columns, like
pages.

pen-knife--the writer's knife with which the reed, used as a pen, was
mended. "He" refers to the king ([Jer
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022)). As often as Jehudi read three
or four columns, the king cut asunder the part of the roll read; and so
he treated the whole, until all the parts read consecutively were cut
and burnt; [Jer 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#024), "all these
words," implies that the whole volume was read through, not merely the
first three or four columns ([Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 36:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 36:24</span></span>

The king and his "servants" were more hardened than the "princes" and
councillors (see on [Jer 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#012); [Jer
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014); [Jer
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016)). Contrast the humble fear
exhibited by Josiah at the reading of the law ([Kg2
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 36:25</span></span>

(See on [Jer 36:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#016)). The
"nevertheless" aggravates the king's sin; though God would have drawn
him back through their intercession, he persisted: judicial blindness
and reprobation!

[Jeremiah 36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 36:26</span></span>

Hammelech--not as Margin, "of the king." Jehoiakim at this time (the
fifth year of his reign) had no grown-up son: Jeconiah, his successor,
was then a boy of eleven (compare [Kg2
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036), with [Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008)).

hid them-- ([Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020); [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003); [Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020)).

[Jeremiah 36:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 36:27</span></span>

roll, and . . . words--that is, the roll of words.

[Jeremiah 36:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 36:28</span></span>

all the former words--It is in vain that the ungodly resist the power of
Jehovah: not one of His words shall fall to the ground ([Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018); [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005); [Act
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039)).

[Jeremiah 36:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 36:29</span></span>

say to Jehoiakim--not in person, as Jeremiah was "hidden" ([Jer
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026)), but by the written word of
prophecy.

saying, Why--This is what the king had desired to be said to Jeremiah if
he should be found; kings often dislike the truth to be told them.

[Jeremiah 36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 36:30</span></span>

He shall have none to sit upon the throne--fulfilled ([Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008), &c.; 2Ki. 25:1-30). He had
successors, but not directly of his posterity, except his son Jeconiah,
whose three months' reign is counted as nothing. Zedekiah was not the
son, but the uncle of Jeconiah, and was raised to the throne in contempt
of him and his father Jehoiakim ([Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030)).

dead body . . . cast out-- ([Jer
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)).

day . . . heat . . . night . . . frost--There are often these variations
of temperature in the East between night and day ([Gen
31:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#040)).

[Jeremiah 36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 36:32</span></span>

added besides . . . many like words--Sinners gain nothing but additional
punishment by setting aside the word of Jehovah. The law was similarly
rewritten after the first tables had been broken owing to Israel's
idolatry ([Exo 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019), [Exo
34:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#001)).
