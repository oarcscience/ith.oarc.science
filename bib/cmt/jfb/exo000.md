[Exodus](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">exo 0:0</span></span>

EXODUS, a "going forth," derives its name from its being occupied
principally with a relation of the departure of the Israelites from
Egypt, and the incidents that immediately preceded as well as followed
that memorable migration. Its authorship by Moses is distinctly asserted
by himself ([Exo 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004)), as well as by
our Lord ([Mar 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026); [Luk
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037)). Besides, the thorough
knowledge it exhibits of the institutions and usages of the ancient
Egyptians and the minute geographical details of the journey to Sinai,
establish in the clearest manner the authenticity of this book.
