### [Judges Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

[Judges 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 12:1</span></span>

THE EPHRAIMITES QUARRELLING WITH JEPHTHAH. ([Jdg
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001).md)

the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together--Hebrew, "were
summoned."

and went northward--After crossing the Jordan, their route from Ephraim
was, strictly speaking, in a northeasterly direction, toward Mizpeh.

the men of Ephraim . . . said unto Jephthah, Wherefore . . . didst
\[thou\] not call us?--This is a fresh development of the jealous, rash,
and irritable temper of the Ephraimites. The ground of their offense now
was their desire of enjoying the credit of patriotism although they had
not shared in the glory of victory.

[Judges 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 12:2</span></span>

when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands--The
straightforward answer of Jephthah shows that their charge was false;
their complaint of not being treated as confederates and allies entirely
without foundation; and their boast of a ready contribution of their
services came with an ill grace from people who had purposely delayed
appearing till the crisis was past.

[Judges 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 12:3</span></span>

when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands--A common
form of speech in the East for undertaking a duty of imminent peril.
This Jephthah had done, having encountered and routed the Ammonites with
the aid of his Gileadite volunteers alone; and since the Lord had
enabled him to conquer without requiring assistance from any other
tribe, why should the Ephraimites take offense? They ought rather to
have been delighted and thankful that the war had terminated without
their incurring any labor and danger.

[Judges 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 12:4</span></span>

DISCERNED BY THE WORD SIBBOLETH, ARE SLAIN BY THE GILEADITES. ([Jdg
12:4-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#004).md)

the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are
fugitives of Ephraim--The remonstrances of Jephthah, though reasonable
and temperate, were not only ineffectual, but followed by insulting
sneers that the Gileadites were reckoned both by the western Manassites
and Ephraimites as outcasts--the scum and refuse of their common stock.
This was addressed to a peculiarly sensitive people. A feud immediately
ensued. The Gileadites, determined to chastise this public affront, gave
them battle; and having defeated the Ephraimites, they chased their
foul-mouthed but cowardly assailants out of the territory. Then rushing
to the fords of the Jordan, they intercepted and slew every fugitive.
The method adopted for discovering an Ephraimite was by the
pronunciation of a word naturally suggested by the place where they
stood. Shibboleth, means "a stream"; Sibboleth, "a burden." The Eastern
tribe had, it seems, a dialectical provincialism in the sound of
Shibboleth; and the Ephraimites could not bring their organs to
pronounce it.

[Judges 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 12:7</span></span>

Jephthah died--After a government of six years, this mighty man of valor
died; and however difficult it may be for us to understand some passages
in his history, he has been ranked by apostolic authority among the
worthies of the ancient church. He was followed by a succession of minor
judges, of whom the only memorials preserved relate to the number of
their families and their state \[[Jdg
12:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#008.md)\].
