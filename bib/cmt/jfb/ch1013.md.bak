[1 Chronicles 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 13:1</span></span>

DAVID FETCHES THE ARK FROM KIRJATH-JEARIM. ([Ch1
13:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001).md)

David consulted . . . And let us bring again the ark of our
God--Gratitude for the high and splendid dignity to which he had been
elevated would naturally, at this period, impart a fresh animation and
impulse to the habitually fervent piety of David; but, at the same time,
he was animated by other motives. He fully understood his position as
ruler under the theocracy, and, entering on his duties, he was resolved
to fulfil his mission as a constitutional king of Israel. Accordingly,
his first act as a sovereign related to the interests of religion. The
ark being then the grand instrument and ornament of it, he takes the
opportunity of the official representatives of the nation being with
him, to consult them about the propriety of establishing it in a more
public and accessible locality. The assembly at which he spoke of this
consisted of the Sheloshim, princes of thousands ([Sa2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001).md). During the reign of the late
king, the ark had been left in culpable neglect. Consequently the people
had, to a great extent, been careless about the ordinances of divine
worship, or had contented themselves with offering sacrifices at Gibeon,
without any thought of the ark, though it was the chief and most vital
part of the tabernacle. The duty and advantages of this religious
movement suggested by the king were apparent, and the proposal met with
universal approval.

[1 Chronicles 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 13:2</span></span>

If it seem good unto you, and . . . it be of the Lord--that is, I shall
conclude that this favorite measure of mine is agreeable to the mind of
God, if it receive your hearty concurrence.

let us send abroad to our brethren everywhere--He wished to make it
known throughout the country, in order that there might be a general
assembly of the nation, and that preparations might be made on a scale
and of a kind suitable to the inauguration of the august ceremonial.

with them also to the priests and Levites . . . in their cities and
suburbs--(See on [Num 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#002).md). The
original terms, "Let us send," imply immediate execution; and,
doubtless, the publication of the royal edict would have been followed
by the appointment of an early day for the contemplated solemnity, had
it not been retarded by a sudden invasion of the Philistines, who were
twice repulsed with great loss ([Sa2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#017).md), by the capture of Jerusalem,
and the transference of the seat of government to that city. Finding,
however, soon after, peace restored and his throne established, he
resumed his preparations for removing the ark to the metropolis.

[1 Chronicles 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005.md)

from Shihor of Egypt-- ([Jos 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004.md),
[Jos 15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047.md); [Num
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005.md); [Kg1

24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md); [Ch2
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#008).md); a small brook flowing into the
Mediterranean, near the modern El-arish, which forms the southern
boundary of Palestine.

Syria and the extreme limit of Palestine on the north.

[1 Chronicles 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 13:6</span></span>

David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah--(See on [Sa2
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001).md).

whose name is called on it--rather, "who is worshipped there" ([Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002).md).
