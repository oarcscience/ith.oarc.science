### [Joel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

[Joel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 1:1</span></span>

THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS; THE
PEOPLE ADMONISHED TO OFFER SOLEMN PRAYERS IN THE TEMPLE; FOR THIS
CALAMITY IS THE EARNEST OF A STILL HEAVIER ONE. (Joel 1:1-20)

Joel--meaning, "Jehovah is God."

son of Pethuel--to distinguish Joel the prophet from others of the name.
Persons of eminence also were noted by adding the father's name.

[Joel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 1:2</span></span>

A spirited introduction calling attention.

old men--the best judges in question concerning the past ([Deu
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#007.md); [Job
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#007).md).

Hath this been, &c.--that is, Hath any so grievous a calamity as this
ever been before? No such plague of locusts had been since the ones in
Egypt. [Exo 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#014.md) is not at variance
with this verse, which refers to Judea, in which Joel says there had
been no such devastation before.

[Joel 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joe 1:3</span></span>

Tell ye your children--in order that they may be admonished by the
severity of the punishment to fear God ([Psa
78:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#006.md); compare [Exo
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008.md); [Jos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#007).md).

[Joel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 1:4</span></span>

This verse states the subject on which he afterwards expands. Four
species or stages of locusts, rather than four different insects, are
meant (compare [Lev 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022).md). Literally,
(1) the gnawing locust; (2) the swarming locust; (3) the licking locust;
(4) the consuming locust; forming a climax to the most destructive kind.
The last is often three inches long, and the two antennÃ&brvbr;, each an
inch long. The two hinder of its six feet are larger than the rest,
adapting it for leaping. The first "kind" is that of the locust, having
just emerged from the egg in spring, and without wings. The second is
when at the end of spring, still in their first skin, the locusts put
forth little ones without legs or wings. The third, when after their
third casting of the old skin, they get small wings, which enable them
to leap the better, but not to fly. Being unable to go away till their
wings are matured, they devour all before them, grass, shrubs, and bark
of trees: translated "rough caterpillars" ([Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027).md). The fourth kind, the matured
winged locusts (see on [Nah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016).md). In
[Joe 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025.md) they are enumerated in the
reverse order, where the restoration of the devastations caused by them
is promised. The Hebrews make the first species refer to Assyria and
Babylon; the second species, to Medo-Persia; the third, to
Greco-Macedonia and Antiochus Epiphanes; the fourth, to the Romans.
Though the primary reference be to literal locusts, the Holy Spirit
doubtless had in view the successive empires which assailed Judea, each
worse than its predecessor, Rome being the climax.

[Joel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 1:5</span></span>

Awake--out of your ordinary state of drunken stupor, to realize the
cutting off from you of your favorite drink. Even the drunkards (from a
Hebrew root, "any strong drink") shall be forced to "howl," though
usually laughing in the midst of the greatest national calamities, so
palpably and universally shall the calamity affect all.

wine . . . new wine--"New" or "fresh wine," in Hebrew, is the
unfermented, and therefore unintoxicating, sweet juice extracted by
pressure from grapes or other fruit, as pomegranates ([Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).md). "Wine" is the produce of the
grape alone, and is intoxicating (see on [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010).md).

[Joel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 1:6</span></span>

nation--applied to the locusts, rather than "people" ([Pro
30:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025).md), to mark not only their
numbers, but also their savage hostility; and also to prepare the mind
of the hearer for the transition to the figurative locusts in the second
chapter, namely, the "nation" or Gentile foe coming against Judea
(compare [Joe 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002).md).

my land--that is, Jehovah's; which never would have been so devastated
were I not pleased to inflict punishment ([Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018.md); [Isa
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#025.md); [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md); [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005.md); [Eze
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016).md).

strong--as irresistibly sweeping away before its compact body the fruits
of man's industry.

without number--so [Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005.md); [Jdg
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md), "like grasshoppers (or
"locusts") for multitude" ([Jer 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#023.md);
[Nah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015).md).

teeth . . . lion--that is, the locusts are as destructive as a lion;
there is no vegetation that can resist their bite (compare [Rev
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#008).md). PLINY says "they gnaw even the
doors of houses."

[Joel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joe 1:7</span></span>

barked--BOCHART, with the Septuagint and Syriac, translates, from an
Arabic root, "hath broken," namely, the topmost shoots, which locusts
most feed on. CALVIN supports English Version.

my vine . . . my fig tree--being in "My land," that is, Jehovah's ([Joe
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006).md). As to the vine-abounding nature
of ancient Palestine, see [Num
13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023.md).

cast it away--down to the ground.

branches . . . white--both from the bark being stripped off ([Gen
30:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#037).md), and from the branches drying
up through the trunk, both bark and wood being eaten up below by the
locusts.

[Joel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 1:8</span></span>

Lament--O "my land" ([Joe 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#006.md); [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004).md).

virgin . . . for the husband--A virgin betrothed was regarded as married
([Deu 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md); [Mat
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#019).md). The Hebrew for "husband" is
"lord" or "possessor," the husband being considered the master of the
wife in the East.

of her youth--when the affections are strongest and when sorrow at
bereavement is consequently keenest. Suggesting the thought of what
Zion's grief ought to be for her separation from Jehovah, the betrothed
husband of her early days ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002.md);
[Eze 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008.md); [Hos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#007.md); compare [Pro
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md); [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004).md).

[Joel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 1:9</span></span>

The greatest sorrow to the mind of a religious Jew, and what ought to
impress the whole nation with a sense of God's displeasure, is the
cessation of the usual temple-worship.

meat offering--Hebrew, mincha; "meat" not in the English sense "flesh,"
but the unbloody offering made of flour, oil, and frankincense. As it
and the drink offering or libation poured out accompanied every
sacrificial flesh offering, the latter is included, though not
specified, as being also "cut off," owing to there being no food left
for man or beast.

priests . . . mourn--not for their own loss of sacrificial perquisites
([Num 18:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008).md), but because they can
no longer offer the appointed offerings to Jehovah, to whom they
minister.

[Joel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 1:10</span></span>

field . . . land--differing in that "field" means the open, unenclosed
country; "land," the rich red soil (from a root "to be red") fit for
cultivation. Thus, "a man of the field," in Hebrew, is a "hunter"; a
"man of the ground" or "land," an "agriculturist" ([Gen
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027).md). "Field" and "land" are here
personified.

new wine--from a Hebrew root implying that it takes possession of the
brain, so that a man is not master of himself. So the Arabic term is
from a root "to hold captive." It is already fermented, and so
intoxicating, unlike the sweet fresh wine, in [Joe
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#005.md), called also "new wine," though a
different Hebrew word. It and "the oil" stand for the vine and the olive
tree, from which the "wine" and "oil" are obtained ([Joe
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012).md).

dried up--not "ashamed," as Margin, as is proved by the parallelism to
"languisheth," that is, droopeth.

[Joel 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joe 1:11</span></span>

Be . . . ashamed--that is, Ye shall have the shame of disappointment on
account of the failure of "the wheat" and "barley . . . harvest."

howl . . . vine dressers--The semicolon should follow, as it is the
"husbandmen" who are to be "ashamed . . . for the wheat." The reason for
the "vine dressers" being called to "howl" does not come till [Joe
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012.md), "The vine is dried up."

[Joel 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joe 1:12</span></span>

pomegranate--a tree straight in the stem growing twenty feet high; the
fruit is of the size of an orange, with blood-red colored pulp.

palm tree--The dates of Palestine were famous. The palm is the symbol of
Judea on coins under the Roman emperor Vespasian. It often grows a
hundred feet high.

apple tree--The Hebrew is generic, including the orange, lemon, and pear
tree.

joy is withered away--such as is felt in the harvest and the vintage
seasons ([Psa 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007.md); [Isa
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md).

[Joel 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joe 1:13</span></span>

Gird yourselves--namely, with sackcloth; as in [Isa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011.md), the ellipsis is supplied
(compare [Jer 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008).md).

lament, ye priests--as it is your duty to set the example to others;
also as the guilt was greater, and a greater scandal was occasioned, by
your sin to the cause of God.

come--the Septuagint, "enter" the house of God (compare [Joe
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014).md).

lie all night in sackcloth--so Ahab ([Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027).md).

ministers of my God-- ([Co1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013).md).
Joel claims authority for his doctrine; it is in God's name and by His
mission I speak to you.

[Joel 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 1:14</span></span>

Sanctify . . . a fast--Appoint a solemn fast.

solemn assembly--literally, a "day of restraint" or cessation from work,
so that all might give themselves to supplication ([Joe
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md); [Sa1
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#005.md); [Ch2
20:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003).md).

elders--The contrast to "children" ([Joe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016).md) requires age to be intended,
though probably elders in office are included. Being the people's
leaders in guilt, they ought to be their leaders also in repentance.

[Joel 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 1:15</span></span>

day of the Lord-- ([Joe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001.md), [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011).md); that is, the day of His anger
([Isa 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009.md); [Oba
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#015.md); [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md), [Zep
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015).md). It will be a foretaste of the
coming day of the Lord as Judge of all men, whence it receives the same
name. Here the transition begins from the plague of locusts to the worse
calamities ([Joe 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md) from invading
armies about to come on Judea, of which the locusts were the prelude.

[Joel 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joe 1:16</span></span>

Compare [Joe 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#009.md), and latter part of
[Joe 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012.md).

joy--which prevailed at the annual feasts, as also in the ordinary
sacrificial offerings, of which the offerers ate before the Lord with
gladness and thanksgivings ([Deu
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md), [Deu
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#012.md); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011.md), [Deu
16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#014).md).

[Joel 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joe 1:17</span></span>

is rotten--"is dried up," "vanishes away," from an Arabic root
\[MAURER\]. "Seed," literally, "grains." The drought causes the seeds to
lose all their vitality and moisture.

garners--granaries; generally underground, and divided into separate
receptacles for the different kinds of grain.

[Joel 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 1:18</span></span>

cattle . . . perplexed--implying the restless gestures of the dumb
beasts in their inability to find food. There is a tacit contrast
between the sense of the brute creation and the insensibility of the
people.

yea, the . . . sheep--Even the sheep, which are content with less rich
pasturage, cannot find food.

are made desolate--literally, "suffer punishment." The innocent brute
shares the "punishment" of guilty man ([Exo
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029.md); [Jon
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#007.md); [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md).

[Joel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 1:19</span></span>

to thee will I cry--Joel here interposes, As this people is insensible
to shame or fear and will not hear, I will leave them and address myself
directly to Thee (compare [Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005.md);
[Jer 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009).md).

fire--that is, the parching heat.

pastures--"grassy places"; from a Hebrew root "to be pleasant." Such
places would be selected for "habitations" (Margin). But the English
Version rendering is better than Margin.

[Joel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 1:20</span></span>

beasts . . . cry . . . unto thee--that is, look up to heaven with heads
lifted up, as if their only expectation was from God ([Job
38:41](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#041.md); [Psa
104:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#021.md); [Psa
145:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#015.md); [Psa
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md); compare [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001).md). They tacitly reprove the
deadness of the Jews for not even now invoking God.
