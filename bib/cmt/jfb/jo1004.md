### [1 John Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)

[1 John 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 4:1</span></span>

TESTS OF FALSE PROPHETS. LOVE, THE TEST OF BIRTH FROM GOD, AND THE
NECESSARY FRUIT OF KNOWING HIS GREAT LOVE IN CHRIST TO US. (1Jo. 4:1-21)

Beloved--the affectionate address wherewith he calls their attention, as
to an important subject.

every spirit--which presents itself in the person of a prophet. The
Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error, speak by men's spirits as
their organs. There is but one Spirit of truth, and one spirit of
Antichrist.

try--by the tests ([Jo1 4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)). All
believers are to do so: not merely ecclesiastics. Even an angel's
message should be tested by the word of God: much more men's teachings,
however holy the teachers may seem.

because, &c.--the reason why we must "try," or test the spirits.

many false prophets--not "prophets" in the sense "foretellers," but
organs of the spirit that inspires them, teaching accordingly either
truth or error: "many Antichrists."

are gone out--as if from God.

into the world--said alike of good and bad prophets ([Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)). The world is easily seduced
([Jo1 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004)).

[1 John 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 4:2</span></span>

Hereby--"Herein."

know . . . the Spirit of God--whether he be, or not, in those teachers
professing to be moved by Him.

Every spirit--that is, Every teacher claiming inspiration by the HOLY
SPIRIT.

confesseth--The truth is taken for granted as established. Man is
required to confess it, that is, in his teaching to profess it openly.

Jesus Christ is come in the flesh--a twofold truth confessed, that Jesus
is the Christ, and that He is come (the Greek perfect tense implies not
a mere past historical fact, as the aorist would, but also the present
continuance of the fact and its blessed effects) in the flesh ("clothed
with flesh": not with a mere seeming humanity, as the DocetÃ&brvbr;
afterwards taught: He therefore was, previously, something far above
flesh). His flesh implies His death for us, for only by assuming flesh
could He die (for as God He could not), [Heb
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009), [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016); and His death implies His LOVE
for us ([Joh 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013)). To deny the
reality of His flesh is to deny His love, and so cast away the root
which produces all true love on the believer's part ([Jo1
4:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009), [Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)). Rome, by the doctrine of the
immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, denies Christ's proper
humanity.

[1 John 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 4:3</span></span>

confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh--IRENÃ†US \[3.8\],
LUCIFER, ORIGEN, on [Mat 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014), and
Vulgate read, "Every spirit which destroys (sets aside, or does away
with) Jesus (Christ)." CYPRIAN and POLYCARP support English Version
text. The oldest extant manuscripts, which are, however, centuries after
POLYCARP, read, "Every spirit that confesseth not (that is, refuses to
confess) Jesus" (in His person, and all His offices and divinity),
omitting "is come in the flesh."

ye have heard--from your Christian teachers.

already is it in the world--in the person of the false prophets ([Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)).

[1 John 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 4:4</span></span>

Ye--emphatical: YE who confess Jesus: in contrast to "them," the false
teachers.

overcome them-- ([Jo1 5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)); instead
of being "overcome and brought into (spiritual) bondage" by them ([Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)). [Joh
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#008), [Joh
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#005), "the sheep did not hear them":
"a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know
not the voice of strangers."

he that is in you--God, of whom ye are.

he that is in the word--the spirit of Antichrist, the devil, "the prince
of this world."

[1 John 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 4:5</span></span>

of the world--They derive their spirit and teaching from the world,
"unregenerate human nature, ruled over and possessed by Satan, the
prince of this world" \[ALFORD\].

speak they of the word--They draw the matter of their conversation from
the life, opinions, and feelings of the world.

the world heareth them-- ([Joh
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018)). The world loves its own.

[1 John 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 4:6</span></span>

We--true teachers of Christ: in contrast to them.

are of God--and therefore speak of God: in contrast to "speak they of
the world," [Jo1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005).

knoweth God--as his Father, being a child "of God" ([Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013)).

heareth us--Compare [Joh 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037), "Every
one that is of the truth, heareth My voice."

Hereby-- ([Jo1 4:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002)); by their
confessing, or not confessing, Jesus; by the kind of reception given
them respectively by those who know God, and by those who are of the
world and not of God.

spirit of truth--the Spirit which comes from God and teaches truth.

spirit of error--the spirit which comes from Satan and seduces into
error.

[1 John 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 4:7</span></span>

Resumption of the main theme ([Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029)). Love, the sum of righteousness,
is the test of our being born of God. Love flows from a sense of God's
love to us: compare [Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009) with [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016), which [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009) resumes; and [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013) with [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024), which similarly [Jo1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013) resumes. At the same time, [Jo1
4:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007) is connected with the
immediately preceding context, [Jo1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002) setting forth Christ's
incarnation, the great proof of God's love ([Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)).

Beloved--an address appropriate to his subject, "love."

love--All love is from God as its fountain: especially that embodiment
of love, God manifest in the flesh. The Father also is love ([Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008)). The Holy Ghost sheds love as its
first fruit abroad in the heart.

knoweth God--spiritually, experimentally, and habitually.

[1 John 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 4:8</span></span>

knoweth not--Greek aorist: not only knoweth not now, but never knew, has
not once for all known God.

God is love--There is no Greek article to love, but to God; therefore we
cannot translate, Love is God. God is fundamentally and essentially
LOVE: not merely is loving, for then John's argument would not stand;
for the conclusion from the premises then would be this, This man is not
loving: God is loving; therefore he knoweth not God IN SO FAR AS GOD IS
LOVING; still he might know Him in His other attributes. But when we
take love as God's essence, the argument is sound: This man doth not
love, and therefore knows not love: God is essentially love, therefore
he knows not God.

[1 John 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 4:9</span></span>

toward us--Greek, "in our case."

sent--Greek, "hath sent."

into the world--a proof against Socinians, that the Son existed before
He was "sent into the world." Otherwise, too, He could not have been our
life ([Jo1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)), our "propitiation"
([Jo1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)), or our "Saviour" ([Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014)). It is the grand proof of God's
love, His having sent "His only-begotten Son, that we might live through
Him," who is the Life, and who has redeemed our forfeited life; and it
is also the grand motive to our mutual love.

[1 John 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 4:10</span></span>

Herein is love--love in the abstract: love, in its highest ideal, is
herein. The love was all on God's side, none on ours.

not that we loved God--though so altogether worthy of love.

he loved us--though so altogether unworthy of love. The Greek aorist
expresses, Not that we did any act of love at any time to God, but that
He did the act of love to us in sending Christ.

[1 John 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 4:11</span></span>

God's love to us is the grand motive for our love to one another ([Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016)).

if--as we all admit as a fact.

we . . . also--as being born of God, and therefore resembling our Father
who is love. In proportion as we appreciate God's love to us, we love
Him and also the brethren, the children (by regeneration) of the same
God, the representatives of the unseen God.

[1 John 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 4:12</span></span>

God, whom no man hath seen at any time, hath appointed His children as
the visible recipients of our outward kindness which flows from love to
Himself, "whom not having seen, we love," compare Notes, [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011), [Jo1
4:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019). Thus [Jo1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#012) explains why, instead (in [Jo1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011)) of saying, "If God so loved us,
we ought also to love God," he said, "We ought also to love one
another."

If we love one another, God dwelleth in us--for God is love; and it must
have been from Him dwelling in us that we drew the real love we bear to
the brethren ([Jo1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008), [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)). John discusses this in [Jo1
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013).

his love--rather, "the love of Him," that is, "to Him" ([Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005)), evinced by our love to His
representatives, our brethren.

is perfected in us--John discusses this in [Jo1
4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017). Compare [Jo1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005), "is perfected," that is, attains
its proper maturity.

[1 John 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 4:13</span></span>

Hereby--"Herein." The token vouchsafed to us of God's dwelling (Greek,
"abide") in us, though we see Him not, is this, that He hath given us
"of His Spirit" ([Jo1 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024)). Where the
Spirit of God is, there God is. ONE Spirit dwells in the Church: each
believer receives a measure "of" that Spirit in the proportion God
thinks fit. Love is His first-fruit ([Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)). In Jesus alone the Spirit dwelt
without measure ([Joh 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)).

[1 John 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 4:14</span></span>

And we--primarily, we apostles, Christ's appointed eye-witnesses to
testify to the facts concerning Him. The internal evidence of the
indwelling Spirit ([Jo1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#013)) is
corroborated by the external evidence of the eye-witnesses to the fact
of the Father having "sent His Son to be the Saviour of the world."

seen--Greek, "contemplated," "attentively beheld" (see on [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)).

sent--Greek, "hath sent": not an entirely past fact (aorist), but one of
which the effects continue (perfect tense).

[1 John 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 4:15</span></span>

shall confess--once for all: so the Greek aorist means.

that Jesus is the Son of God--and therefore "the Saviour of the world"
([Jo1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014)).

[1 John 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 4:16</span></span>

And we--John and his readers (not as [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014), the apostles only).

known and believed--True faith, according to John, is a faith of
knowledge and experience: true knowledge is a knowledge of faith
\[LUECKE\].

to us--Greek, "in our case" (see on [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009)).

dwelleth--Greek, "abideth." Compare with this verse, [Jo1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#007).

[1 John 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 4:17</span></span>

(Compare [Jo1 3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019).)

our love--rather as the Greek, "LOVE (in the abstract, the principle of
love \[ALFORD\]) is made perfect (in its relations) with us." Love
dwelling in us advances to its consummation "with us" that is, as it is
concerned with us: so Greek. [Luk
1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058), "showed mercy upon (literally,
'with') her": [Jo2 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#002), the truth
"shall be with us for ever."

boldness--"confidence": the same Greek as [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021), to which this passage is
parallel. The opposite of "fear," [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018). Herein is our love perfected,
namely, in God dwelling in us, and our dwelling in God ([Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)), involving as its result "that
we can have confidence (or boldness) in the day of judgment" (so
terrible to all other men, [Act 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025);
[Rom 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016)).

because, &c.--The ground of our "confidence" is, "because even as He
(Christ) is, we also are in this world" (and He will not, in that day,
condemn those who are like Himself), that is, we are righteous as He is
righteous, especially in respect to that which is the sum of
righteousness, love ([Jo1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014)).
Christ IS righteous, and love itself, in heaven: so are we, His members,
who are still "in this world." Our oneness with Him even now in His
exalted position above ([Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006)), so
that all that belongs to Him of righteousness, &c., belongs to us also
by perfect imputation and progressive impartation, is the ground of our
love being perfected so that we can have confidence in the day of
judgment. We are in, not of, this world.

[1 John 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 4:18</span></span>

Fear has no place in love. Bold confidence ([Jo1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017)), based on love, cannot coexist
with fear. Love, which, when perfected, gives bold confidence, casts out
fear (compare [Heb 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)). The
design of Christ's propitiatory death was to deliver from this bondage
of fear.

but--"nay" \[ALFORD\].

fear hath torment--Greek, "punishment." Fear is always revolving in the
mind the punishment deserved \[ESTIUS\]. Fear, by anticipating
punishment (through consciousness of deserving it), has it even now,
that is, the foretaste of it. Perfect love is incompatible with such a
self-punishing fear. Godly fear of offending God is quite distinct from
slavish fear of consciously deserved punishment. The latter fear is
natural to us all until love casts it out. "Men's states vary: one is
without fear and love; another, with fear without love; another, with
fear and love; another, without fear with love" \[BENGEL\].

[1 John 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 4:19</span></span>

him--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Translate, We (emphatical: WE on
our part) love (in general: love alike Him, and the brethren, and our
fellow men), because He (emphatical: answering to "we"; because it was
He who) first loved us in sending His Son (Greek aorist of a definite
act at a point of time). He was the first to love us: this thought ought
to create in us love casting out fear ([Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)).

[1 John 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jo1 4:20</span></span>

loveth not . . . brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he
hath not seen--It is easier for us, influenced as we are here by sense,
to direct love towards one within the range of our senses than towards
One unseen, appreciable only by faith. "Nature is prior to grace; and we
by nature love things seen, before we love things unseen" \[ESTIUS\].
The eyes are our leaders in love. "Seeing is an incentive to love"
\[Å“CUMENIUS\]. If we do not love the brethren, the visible
representatives of God, how can we love God, the invisible One, whose
children they are? The true ideal of man, lost in Adam, is realized in
Christ, in whom God is revealed as He is, and man as he ought to be.
Thus, by faith in Christ, we learn to love both the true God, and the
true man, and so to love the brethren as bearing His image.

hath seen--and continually sees.

[1 John 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 4:21</span></span>

Besides the argument ([Jo1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020)) from
the common feeling of men, he here adds a stronger one from God's
express commandment ([Mat 22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039)). He
who loves, will do what the object of his love wishes.

he who loveth God--he who wishes to be regarded by God as loving Him.
