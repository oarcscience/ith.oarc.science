### [Jeremiah Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 37:1</span></span>

HISTORICAL SECTIONS, THIRTY-SEVENTH THROUGH FORTY-FOURTH CHAPTERS. THE
CHALDEANS RAISE THE SIEGE TO GO AND MEET PHARAOH-HOPHRA. ZEDEKIAH SENDS
TO JEREMIAH TO PRAY TO GOD IN BEHALF OF THE JEWS: IN VAIN, JEREMIAH
TRIES TO ESCAPE TO HIS NATIVE PLACE, BUT IS ARRESTED. ZEDEKIAH ABATES
THE RIGOR OF HIS IMPRISONMENT. (Jer. 37:1-21)

Coniah--curtailed from Jeconiah by way of reproach.

whom--referring to Zedekiah, not to Coniah ([Kg2
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 37:2</span></span>

Amazing stupidity, that they were not admonished by the punishment of
Jeconiah \[CALVIN\], ([Ch2 36:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#012.md), [Ch2
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014).md)!

[Jeremiah 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 37:3</span></span>

Zedekiah . . . sent--fearing lest, in the event of the Chaldeans
overcoming Pharaoh-hophra, they should return to besiege Jerusalem. See
on [Jer 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md); that chapter
chronologically comes in between the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth
chapter. The message of the king to Jeremiah here in the thirty-seventh
chapter is, however, somewhat earlier than that in the twenty-first
chapter; here it is while the issue between the Chaldeans and Pharaoh
was undecided; there it is when, after the repulse of Pharaoh, the
Chaldeans were again advancing against Jerusalem; hence, while Zephaniah
is named in both embassies, Jehucal accompanies him here, Pashur there.
But, as Pashur and Jehucal are both mentioned in [Jer
38:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md), as hearing Jeremiah's reply,
which is identical with that in [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md), it is probable the two messages
followed one another at a short interval; that in this [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md), and the answer, [Jer
37:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md), being the earlier of the two.

Zephaniah--an abettor of rebellion against God ([Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025).md), though less virulent than many
([Jer 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029).md), punished accordingly
([Jer 52:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 37:4</span></span>

Jeremiah . . . not put . . . into prison--He was no longer in the prison
court, as he had been ([Jer 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md); [Jer
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#001).md), which passages refer to the
beginning of the siege, not to the time when the Chaldeans renewed the
siege, after having withdrawn for a time to meet Pharaoh.

[Jeremiah 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 37:5</span></span>

After this temporary diversion, caused by Pharaoh in favor of Jerusalem,
the Egyptians returned no more to its help ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md). Judea had the misfortune to lie
between the two great contending powers, Babylon and Egypt, and so was
exposed to the alternate inroads of the one or the other. Josiah, taking
side with Assyria, fell in battle with Pharaoh-necho at Megiddo ([Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029).md). Zedekiah, seeking the Egyptian
alliance in violation of his oath, was now about to be taken by
Nebuchadnezzar ([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md); [Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md), [Eze
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 37:7</span></span>

shall return--without accomplishing any deliverance for you.

[Jeremiah 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 37:8</span></span>

([Jer 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 37:9</span></span>

yourselves--Hebrew, "souls."

[Jeremiah 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 37:10</span></span>

yet . . . they--Even a few wounded men would suffice for your
destruction.

[Jeremiah 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 37:11</span></span>

broken up--"gone up."

[Jeremiah 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 37:12</span></span>

Benjamin--to his own town, Anathoth.

to separate himself--Margin translates, "to slip away," from a Hebrew
root, "to be smooth," so, to slip away as a slippery thing that cannot
be held. But it is not likely the prophet of God would flee in a
dishonorable way; and "in the midst of the people" rather implies open
departure along with others, than clandestine slipping away by mixing
with the crowd of departing people. Rather, it means, to separate
himself, or to divide his place of residence, so as to live partly here,
partly there, without fixed habitation, going to and fro among the
people \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. MAURER translates, "to take his portion
thence," to realize the produce of his property in Anathoth
\[HENDERSON\], or to take possession of the land which he bought from
Hanameel \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 37:13</span></span>

ward--that is, the "guard," or "watch."

Hananiah--whose death Jeremiah predicted ([Jer
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016).md). The grandson in revenge takes
Jeremiah into custody on the charge of deserting ("thou fallest away,"
[Jer 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md); [Jer
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md); [Sa1
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003).md) to the enemy. His prophecies
gave color to the charge ([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md);
[Jer 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 37:15</span></span>

scribe--one of the court secretaries; often in the East part of the
private house of a public officer serves as a prison.

[Jeremiah 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 37:16</span></span>

dungeon . . . cabins--The prison consisted of a pit (the "dungeon") with
vaulted cells round the sides of it. The "cabins," from a root, "to bend
one's self."

[Jeremiah 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 37:17</span></span>

secretly--Zedekiah was ashamed to be seen by his courtiers consulting
Jeremiah ([Joh 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043.md); [Joh
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md); [Joh
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038).md).

thou shalt be delivered--Had Jeremiah consulted his earthly interests,
he would have answered very differently. Contrast [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md); [Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010.md); [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md).

[Jeremiah 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 37:18</span></span>

What--In what respect have I offended?

[Jeremiah 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 37:19</span></span>

Where are now your prophets--The event has showed them to be liars; and,
as surely as the king of Babylon has come already, notwithstanding their
prophecy, so surely shall he return.

[Jeremiah 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 37:20</span></span>

be accepted--rather, "Let my supplication be humbly presented" (see on
[Jer 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007).md), \[HENDERSON\].

lest I die there--in the subterranean dungeon ([Jer
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016).md), from want of proper sustenance
([Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021).md). The prophet naturally
shrank from death, which makes his spiritual firmness the more
remarkable; he was ready to die rather than swerve from his duty
\[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 37:21</span></span>

court of the prison-- ([Jer 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002.md); [Jer
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013.md), [Jer
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028).md).

bakers' street--Persons in the same business in cities in the East
commonly reside in the same street.

all the bread . . . spent--Jeremiah had bread supplied to him until he
was thrown into the dungeon of Malchiah, at which time the bread in the
city was spent. Compare this verse with [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md); that time must have been very
shortly before the capture of the city ([Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md). God saith of His children, "In
the days of famine they shall be satisfied" ([Psa
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019.md); [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016).md). Honest reproof ([Jer
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017).md), in the end often gains more
favor than flattery ([Pro 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#023).md).

All this was subsequent to his imprisonment in Jonathan's house, and his
release on his interview with Zedekiah. The latter occurred before the
return of the Chaldeans to the siege; the similar events in this chapter
occurred after it.
