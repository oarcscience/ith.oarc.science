### [Jeremiah Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 31:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY IN THE THIRTIETH CHAPTER. (Jer. 31:1-40)

At the same time--"In the latter days" ([Jer
30:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#024).md).

the God of--manifesting My grace to ([Gen
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md); [Mat
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

all . . . Israel--not the exiles of the south kingdom of Judah only, but
also the north kingdom of the ten tribes; and not merely Israel in
general, but "all the families of Israel." Never yet fulfilled ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 31:2</span></span>

Upon the grace manifested to Israel "in the wilderness" God grounds His
argument for renewing His favors to them now in their exile; because His
covenant is "everlasting" ([Jer 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003).md),
and changes not. The same argument occurs in [Hos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005.md), [Hos
13:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md); [Hos
14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004.md), [Hos
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008.md). Babylon is fitly compared to the
"wilderness," as in both alike Israel was as a stranger far from his
appointed "rest" or home, and Babylon is in [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md) called a "desert" (compare [Jer
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#012).md).

I went to cause him to rest--namely, in the pillar of cloud and fire,
the symbol of God's presence, which went before Israel to search a
resting-place ([Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033.md); [Isa
63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014).md) for the people, both a
temporary one at each halt in the wilderness, and a permanent one in
Canaan ([Exo 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); [Deu
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#020.md); [Jos
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#044.md); [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md); [Heb
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 31:3</span></span>

Israel gratefully acknowledges in reply God's past grace; but at the
same time tacitly implies by the expression "of old," that God does not
appear to her now. "God appeared to me of old, but now I am forsaken!"
God replies, Nay, I love thee with the same love now as of old. My love
was not a momentary impulse, but from "everlasting" in My counsels, and
to "everlasting" in its continuance; hence originated the covenant
whereby I gratuitously adopted thee ([Mal
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md); [Rom
11:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md). Margin translates, "from
afar," which does not answer so well as "of old," to "in the wilderness"
([Jer 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#002).md), which refers to the olden
times of Israel's history.

with loving kindness . . . drawn-- ([Hos
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004).md). Rather, "I have drawn out
continually My loving kindness toward thee." So [Psa
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#010.md), "Continue (Margin, 'Draw out at
length') Thy loving kindness." By virtue of My everlasting love I will
still extend My loving kindness to thee. So [Isa
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021.md), "O Israel, thou shalt not be
forgotten of Me."

[Jeremiah 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 31:4</span></span>

I will build . . . thou shalt be built--The combination of the active
and passive to express the same fact implies the infallible certainty of
its accomplishment. "Build," that is, establish in prosperity ([Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007).md).

adorned with . . . tabrets-- ([Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006).md). Or, "adorn thyself with thy
timbrels"; used by damsels on occasions of public rejoicings ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034).md). Israel had cast away all
instruments of joy in her exile ([Psa
137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004).md).

dances--holy joy, not carnal mirth.

[Jeremiah 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 31:5</span></span>

Samaria--the metropolis of the ten tribes; here equivalent to Israel.
The mountainous nature of their country suited the growth of the vine.

eat . . . as common--literally, "shall profane," that is, shall put to
common use. For the first three years after planting, the vine was "not
to be eaten of"; on the fourth year the fruit was to be "holy to praise
the Lord withal"; on the fifth year the fruit was to be eaten as common,
no longer restricted to holy use ([Lev
19:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md); compare [Deu
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#006.md); [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030), Margin.md). Thus the idea here is,
"The same persons who plant shall reap the fruits"; it shall no longer
be that one shall plant and another reap the fruit.

[Jeremiah 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 31:6</span></span>

The watchmen stationed on eminences (types of the preachers of the
gospel), shall summon the ten tribes to go up to the annual feasts at
Jerusalem ("Zion"), as they used to do before the revolt and the setting
up of the idol calves at Dan and Beer-sheba ([Eze
37:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021).md).

Mount Ephraim--not one single mountain, but the whole mountainous region
of the ten tribes.

our God--from whom we formerly revolted, but who is now our God. An
earnest of that good time to come is given in the partial success of the
gospel in its first preaching in Samaria (John 4:1-42; Acts 8:5-25).

[Jeremiah 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 31:7</span></span>

The people are urged with praises and prayers to supplicate for their
universal restoration. Jehovah is represented in the context ([Jer
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md), [Jer
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008).md), as promising immediately to
restore Israel. They therefore praise God for the restoration, being as
certain of it as if it were actually accomplished; and at the same time
pray for it, as prayer was a means to the desired end. Prayer does not
move God to grant our wishes, but when God has determined to grant our
wishes, He puts it into our hearts to pray for the thing desired.
Compare [Psa 102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), as to the
connection of Israel's restoration with the prayers of His people ([Isa
62:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001).md).

for Jacob--on account of Jacob; on account of his approaching
deliverance by Jehovah.

among--"for," that is, on account of, would more exactly suit the
parallelism to "for Jacob."

chief of the nations--Israel: as the parallelism to "Jacob" proves
(compare [Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Psa
135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004.md); [Amo
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md). God estimates the greatness of
nations not by man's standard of material resources, but by His electing
favor.

[Jeremiah 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 31:8</span></span>

north--Assyria, Media, &c. (see on [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md); [Jer
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008).md).

gather from . . . coasts of . . . earth-- ([Eze
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#034.md), [Eze
20:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#041.md); [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013).md).

blind . . . lame, &c.--Not even the most infirm and unfit persons for a
journey shall be left behind, so universal shall be the restoration.

a great company--or, they shall return "in a great company" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 31:9</span></span>

weeping--for their past sins which caused their exile ([Psa
126:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005).md). Although they come with
weeping, they shall return with joy ([Jer
50:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004).md).

supplications--(Compare [Jer 31:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md);
[Jer 3:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). Margin translates "favors," as
in [Jos 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#020.md); [Ezr
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#008.md); thus God's favors or compassions
are put in opposition to the people's weeping; their tears shall be
turned into joy. But English Version suits the parellelism best.

I will cause . . . to walk by . . . waters . . . straight way-- ([Isa
35:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md); [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019.md); [Isa
49:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010).md). God will give them waters
to satisfy their thirst as in the wilderness journey from Egypt. So
spiritually ([Mat 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md); [Joh
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md).

Ephraim--the ten tribes no longer severed from Judah, but forming one
people with it.

my first-born-- ([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001.md); [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004).md). So the elect Church ([Co2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 31:10</span></span>

The tidings of God's interposition in behalf of Israel will arrest the
attention of even the uttermost Gentile nations.

He that scattered will gather--He who scattered knows where to find
Israel; He who smote can also heal.

keep--not only will gather, but keep safely to the end ([Joh
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#001.md); [Joh
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 31:11</span></span>

can prevent the Lord from delivering Jacob ([Isa

([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Mic

to the goodness of . . . Lord--(See [Jer
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#014).md). Beneficence, that is, to the
Lord as the source of all good things ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md), to pray to Him and praise Him
for these blessings of which He is the Fountainhead.

watered garden-- ([Isa 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011).md). Not
merely for a time, but continually full of holy comfort.

not sorrow any more--referring to the Church triumphant, as well as to
literal Israel ([Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md); [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019.md); [Rev

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 31:15</span></span>

Ramah--In Benjamin, east of the great northern road, two hours' journey
from Jerusalem. Rachel, who all her life had pined for children ([Gen
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001).md), and who died with "sorrow" in
giving birth to Benjamin ([Gen
35:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#018.md), Margin; [Sa1
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#002).md), and was buried at Ramah, near
Beth-lehem, is represented as raising her head from the tomb, and as
breaking forth into "weeping" at seeing the whole land depopulated of
her sons, the Ephraimites. Ramah was the place where Nebuzara-dan
collected all the Jews in chains, previous to their removal to Babylon
([Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001).md). God therefore consoles
her with the promise of their restoration. [Mat
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#017.md) quotes this as fulfilled in
the massacre of the innocents under Herod. "A lesser and a greater
event, of different times, may answer to the single sense of one passage
of Scripture, until the prophecy is exhausted" \[BENGEL\]. Besides the
temporary reference to the exiles in Babylon, the Holy Spirit
foreshadowed ultimately Messiah's exile in Egypt, and the desolation
caused in the neighborhood of Rachel's tomb by Herod's massacre of the
children, whose mothers had "sons of sorrow" (Ben-oni), just as Rachel
had. The return of Messiah (the representative of Israel) from Egypt,
and the future restoration of Israel, both the literal and the spiritual
(including the innocents), at the Lord's second advent, are antitypical
of the restoration of Israel from Babylon, which is the ground of
consolation held out here by Jeremiah. The clause, "They were not," that
is, were dead ([Gen 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#013).md), does not
apply so strictly to the exiles in Babylon as it does to the history of
Messiah and His people--past, present, and future. So the words, "There
is hope in thine end," are to be fulfilled ultimately, when Rachel shall
meet her murdered children at the resurrection, at the same time that
literal Israel is to be restored. "They were not," in Hebrew, is
singular; each was not: each mother at the Beth-lehem massacre had but
one child to lament, as the limitation of age in Herod's order, "two
years and under," implies; this use of the singular distributively (the
mothers weeping severally, each for her own child), is a coincidence
between the prophecy of the Beth-lehem massacre and the event, the more
remarkable as not being obvious: the singular, too, is appropriate as to
Messiah in His Egyptian exile, who was to be a leading object of
Rachel's lamentation.

[Jeremiah 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 31:16</span></span>

thy work--thy parental weeping for thy children \[ROSENMULLER\]. Thine
affliction in the loss of thy children, murdered for Christ's sake,
shall not be fruitless to thee, as was the case in thy giving birth to
the "child of thy sorrow," Benjamin. Primarily, also, thy grief shall
not be perpetual: the exiles shall return, and the land be inhabited
again \[CALVIN\].

Ephraim--representing the ten tribes.

bemoaning himself--The spirit of penitent supplication shall at last be
poured on Israel as the necessary forerunner of their restoration ([Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md).

Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised--In the first clause the
chastisement itself is meant; in the second the beneficial effect of it
in teaching the penitent true wisdom.

bullock unaccustomed to . . . yoke--A similar image occurs in [Deu
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md). Compare "stiff-necked," [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md); [Exo
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#009.md), an image from refractory oxen.
Before my chastisement I needed the severe correction I received, as
much as an untamed bullock needs the goad. Compare [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md), where the same figure is used of
Saul while unconverted. Israel has had a longer chastisement than Judah,
not having been restored even at the Jews' return from Babylon.
Hereafter, at its restoration, it shall confess the sore discipline was
all needed to "accustom" it to God's "easy yoke" ([Mat
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).md).

turn thou me--by Thy converting Spirit ([Lam
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021).md). But why does Ephraim pray for
conversion, seeing that he is already converted? Because we are
converted by progressive steps, and need the same power of God to carry
forward, as to originate, our conversion ([Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md), [Joh
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065.md); compare with [Isa
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003.md); [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 31:19</span></span>

after that I was turned, I repented--Repentance in the full sense
follows, not precedes, our being turned to God by God ([Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). The Jews' "looking to Him whom
they pierced" shall result in their "mourning for Him." Repentance is
the tear that flows from the eye of faith turned to Jesus. He Himself
gives it: we give it not of ourselves, but must come to Him for it ([Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031).md).

through the corrections of His providence.

A token of indignant remorse, shame, and grief, because of his past sin.

bear . . . reproach of . . . youth--"because the calamities which I bore
were the just punishment of my scandalous wantonness against God in my
youth"; alluding to the idols set up at Dan and Beth-el immediately
after the ten tribes revolted from Judah. His sense of shame shows that
he no longer delights in his sin.

[Jeremiah 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 31:20</span></span>

Is Ephraim my dear son? &c.--The question implies that a negative answer
was to be expected. Who would have thought that one so undutiful to His
heavenly Father as Ephraim had been should still be regarded by God as a
"pleasant child?" Certainly he was not so in respect to his sin. But by
virtue of God's "everlasting love" ([Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003).md) on Ephraim's being "turned" to
God, he was immediately welcomed as God's "dear son." This verse sets
forth God's readiness to welcome the penitent ([Jer
31:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018).md), anticipating his return
with prevenient grace and love. Compare [Luk
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020.md) : "When he was yet a great way
off, his father saw him and had compassion," &c.

spake against--threatened him for his idolatry.

remember--with favor and concern, as in [Gen
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md); [Gen
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#022.md).

bowels . . . troubled for him-- ([Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036.md); [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md) --namely, with the yearnings of
compassionate love. The "bowels" include the region of the heart, the
seat of the affections.

[Jeremiah 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 31:21</span></span>

waymarks--pillars to mark the road for the returning exiles. Caravans
set up pillars, or pointed heaps of stones, to mark the way through the
desert against their return. So Israel is told by God to mark the way by
which they went in leaving their country for exile; for by the same way
they shall return.

2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md), [Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md), [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036).md). Why not return immediately to
me? MAURER translates, as in [Sol 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#006.md),
"How long wilt thou withdraw thyself?" Let thy past backslidings suffice
thee now that a new era approaches. What God finds fault with in them
is, that they looked hither and thither, leaning on contingencies,
instead of at once trusting the word of God, which promised their
restoration. To assure them of this, God promises to create a new thing
in their land, A woman shall compass a man. CALVIN explains this:
Israel, who is feeble as a woman, shall be superior to the warlike
Chaldeans; the captives shall reduce their captors to captivity.
HENGSTENBERG makes the "woman" the Jewish Church, and the "man" Jehovah,
her husband, whose love she will again seek ([Hos
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006).md). MAURER, A woman shall protect
([Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md), Margin; [Psa
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010).md) a man, that is, You need fear
no foes in returning, for all things shall be so peaceful that a woman
would be able to take man's part, and act as his protector. But the
Christian fathers (Augustine, &c.) almost unanimously interpreted it of
the Virgin Mary compassing Christ in her womb. This view is
favored:--(1) By the connection; it gives a reason why the exiles should
desire a return to their country, namely, because Christ was conceived
there. (2) The word "created" implies a divine power put forth in the
creation of a body in the Virgin's womb by the Holy Ghost for the second
Adam, such as was exerted in creating the first Adam ([Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)). (3.md) The phrase, "a new thing,"
something unprecedented; a man whose like had never existed before, at
once God and man; a mother out of the ordinary course of nature, at once
mother and virgin. An extraordinary mode of generation; one conceived by
the Holy Ghost without man. (4) The specification "in the land" (not
"earth," as English Version), namely, of Judah, where probably Christ
was conceived, in Hebron (compare [Luk
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#039.md), [Luk
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md), [Luk
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044.md), with [Jos
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#011).md) or else in Nazareth, "in the
territory" of Israel, to whom [Jer
31:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#005.md), [Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md), [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md), [Jer
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021.md) refer; His birth was at
Beth-lehem ([Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md); [Mat
2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#005).md). As the place of His nativity,
and of His being reared ([Mat 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023).md),
and of His preaching ([Hag 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#007.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md), are specified, so it is likely
the Holy Spirit designated the place of His being conceived. (5) The
Hebrew for "woman" implies an individual, as the Virgin Mary, rather
than a collection of persons. (6) The restoration of Israel is grounded
on God's covenant in Christ, to whom, therefore, allusion is naturally
made as the foundation of Israel's hope (compare [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md). The Virgin Mary's conception of
Messiah in the womb answers to the "Virgin of Israel" (therefore so
called, [Jer 31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021).md), that is, Israel
and her sons at their final restoration, receiving Jesus as Messiah
([Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)). (7.md) The reference to the
conception of the child Messiah accords with the mention of the massacre
of "children" referred to in [Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md) (compare [Mat
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#017)). (8.md) The Hebrew for "man" is
properly "mighty man," a term applied to God ([Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017).md); and to Christ ([Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md); compare [Psa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003.md); [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md) \[CALOVIUS\].

the days . . . new covenant with . . . Israel . . . Judah--The new
covenant is made with literal Israel and Judah, not with the spiritual
Israel, that is, believers, except secondarily, and as grafted on the
stock of Israel ([Rom 11:16-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016).md). For
the whole subject of the thirtieth and thirty-first chapters is the
restoration of the Hebrews ([Jer 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#004.md),
[Jer 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md), [Jer
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md), [Jer

31:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#027.md), [Jer
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036).md). With the "remnant according to
the election of grace" in Israel, the new covenant has already taken
effect. But with regard to the whole nation, its realization is reserved
for the last days, to which Paul refers this prophecy in an abridged
form ([Rom 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032.md)

Not . . . the covenant that I made with . . . fathers--the Old Testament
covenant, as contrasted with our gospel covenant ([Heb
8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md); [Heb
10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016.md), where this prophecy is
quoted to prove the abrogation of the law by the gospel), of which the
distinguishing features are its securing by an adequate atonement the
forgiveness of sins, and by the inworking of effectual grace ensuring
permanent obedience. An earnest of this is given partially in the
present eclectic or elect Church gathered out of Jews and Gentiles. But
the promise here to Israel in the last days is national and universal,
and effected by an extraordinary outpouring of the Spirit ([Jer
31:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); [Eze
11:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#017).md), independent of any merit on
their part ([Eze 36:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md); Eze.

and St. Paul ([Heb 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009).md) translate, "I
regarded them not"; and GESENIUS, &c., justify this rendering of the
Hebrew from the Arabic. The Hebrews regarded not God, so God regarded
them not.

their preservation as a distinct people amidst violent persecutions,
though scattered among all nations for eighteen centuries,
unamalgamated, whereas all other peoples under such circumstances have
become incorporated with the nations in which they have been dispersed,
is a perpetual standing miracle (compare [Jer
