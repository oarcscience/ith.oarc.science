### [Psalms Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 3:1</span></span>

For the historical occasion mentioned, compare 2Sa. 15:1-17:29. David,
in the midst of great distress, with filial confidence, implores God's
aid, and, anticipating relief, offers praise. ([Psa
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001).md)

Lord . . . increased--The extent of the rebellion ([Sa2
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#013).md) surprises and grieves him.

[Psalms 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 3:2</span></span>

say of my soul--that is, "of me" (compare [Psa
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#003).md). This use of "soul" is common;
perhaps it arose from regarding the soul as man's chief part.

no help . . . in God--rejected by Him. This is the bitterest reproach
for a pious man, and denotes a spirit of malignant triumph.

Selah--This word is of very obscure meaning. It probably denotes rest or
pause, both as to the music and singing, intimating something emphatic
in the sentiment (compare [Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 3:3</span></span>

But--literally, "and" ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md). He
repels the reproach by avowing his continued trust.

shield--a favorite and often-used figure for protection.

my glory--its source.

lifter up of mine head--one who raises me from despondency.

[Psalms 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 3:4</span></span>

cried . . . heard--Such has been my experience. The latter verb denotes
a gracious hearing or answering.

out of--or, "from."

his holy hill--Zion ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md). His
visible earthly residence.

[Psalms 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 3:5</span></span>

the Lord sustained me--literally, "will sustain me," as if his language
or thought when he laid down, and the reason of his composure.

[Psalms 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 3:6</span></span>

ten thousands of people--or, "myriads," any very great number (compare
[Sa2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#018).md).

[Psalms 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 3:7</span></span>

Arise, O Lord--God is figuratively represented as asleep to denote His
apparent indifference ([Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006).md). The
use of "cheekbone" and "teeth" represents his enemies as fierce, like
wild beasts ready to devour ([Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002).md), and smiting their cheekbone
([Kg1 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024).md) denotes violence and
insult.

thou hast broken--God took his part, utterly depriving the enemy of
power to injure.

[Psalms 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 3:8</span></span>

An ascription of praise to a delivering God, whose favor is an efficient
benefit.
