DEUTERONOMY, the second law, a title which plainly shows what is the
object of this book, namely, a recapitulation of the law. It was given
in the form of public addresses to the people; and as Moses spoke in the
prospect of his speedy removal, he enforced obedience to it by many
forcible appeals to the Israelites, concerning their long and varied
experience both of the mercies and the judgments of God. The minute
notices of the heathen people with whom they had come in contact, but
who afterward disappeared from the pages of history, as well as the
accounts of the fertility and products of Canaan, and the counsels
respecting the conquest of that country, fix the date of this book and
the time of its composition by the hand of Moses. The close, however,
must have been added by another; and, indeed, it is supposed by some to
have formed the original preface to the Book of Joshua.
