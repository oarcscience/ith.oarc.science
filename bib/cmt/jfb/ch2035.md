### [2 Chronicles Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 35:1</span></span>

JOSIAH KEEPS A SOLEMN PASSOVER. (2Ch. 35:1-19)

Moreover Josiah kept a passover--(See on [Kg2
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#021).md). The first nine verses give an
account of the preparations made for the celebration of the solemn feast
\[[Ch2 35:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#001.md)\]. The day appointed by
the law was kept on this occasion (compare [Ch2
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#002.md), [Ch2
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#013).md). The priests were ranged in
their courses and exhorted to be ready for their duties in the manner
that legal purity required (compare [Ch2
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#005).md). The Levites, the ministers or
instructors of the people in all matters pertaining to the divine
worship, were commanded ([Ch2 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#003).md) to
"put the holy ark in the house which Solomon did build." Their duty was
to transport the ark from place to place according to circumstances.
Some think that it had been ignominiously put away from the sanctuary by
order of some idolatrous king, probably Manasseh, who set a carved image
in the house of God ([Ch2 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#007).md), or
Amon; while others are of opinion that it had been temporarily removed
by Josiah himself into some adjoining chamber, during the repairs on the
temple. In replacing it, the Levites had evidently carried it upon their
shoulders, deeming that still to be the duty which the law imposed on
them. But Josiah reminded them of the change of circumstances. As the
service of God was now performed in a fixed and permanent temple, they
were not required to be bearers of the ark any longer; and, being
released from the service, they should address themselves with the
greater alacrity to the discharge of other functions.

[2 Chronicles 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 35:4</span></span>

prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your
courses--Each course or division was to be composed of those who
belonged to the same fathers' house.

according to the writing of David and . . . Solomon--Their injunctions
are recorded ([Ch2 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#014.md); 1Ch.
23:1-26:32).

[2 Chronicles 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 35:5</span></span>

stand in the holy place--in the court of the priests, the place where
the victims were killed. The people were admitted according to their
families in groups or companies of several households at a time. When
the first company entered the court (which consisted commonly of as many
as it could well hold), the gates were shut and the offering was made.
The Levites stood in rows from the slaughtering places to the altar, and
handed the blood and fat from one to another of the officiating priests
([Ch2 30:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#016).md).

[2 Chronicles 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 35:6</span></span>

So kill the passover, &c.--The design of the minute directions given
here was to facilitate the distribution of the paschal lambs. These were
to be eaten by the respective families according to their numbers ([Exo
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#003).md). But multitudes of the people,
especially those from Israel, having been reduced to poverty through the
Assyrian devastations, were to be provided with the means of
commemorating the passover. Therefore, the king enjoined the Levites
that when the paschal lambs were brought to them to be killed ([Ch2
35:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007).md) they should take care to have
everything put in so orderly a train, that the lambs, after due
presentation, might be easily delivered to the various families to be
roasted and eaten by themselves apart.

[2 Chronicles 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 35:7</span></span>

Josiah gave to the people . . . lambs and kids--These were in all
probability destined for the poor; a lamb or a kid might be used at
convenience ([Exo 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#005).md).

and . . . bullocks--which were offered after the lambs on each of the
successive days of the feast.

[2 Chronicles 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 35:8</span></span>

his princes--These gave to the priests and Levites; as those of
Hezekiah's princes ([Ch2 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#024).md). They
were ecclesiastical princes; namely, Hilkiah the high priest ([Ch2
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009).md). Zechariah, probably the second
priest of the Eleazar ([Kg2 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#018).md),
and Jehiel, of the Ithamar line. And as the Levitical tribes were not
yet sufficiently provided ([Ch2 35:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#009).md),
some of their eminent brethren who had been distinguished in Hezekiah's
time ([Ch2 31:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2031.htm#012).md), gave a large
additional contribution for the use of the Levites exclusively.

[2 Chronicles 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 35:10</span></span>

So the service was prepared, &c.--All the necessary preparations having
been completed, and the appointed time having arrived for the passover,
the solemnity was celebrated. One remarkable feature in the account is
the prominent part that was taken by the Levites in the preparation of
the sacrifices; namely, the killing and stripping of the skins, which
were properly the peculiar duties of the priests; but as those
functionaries were not able to overtake the extraordinary amount of work
and the Levites had been duly sanctified for the service, they were
enlisted for the time in this priestly employment. At the passover in
Hezekiah's time, the Levites officiated in the same departments of duty,
the reason assigned for that deviation from the established rule being
the unprepared state of many of the people ([Ch2
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#017).md). But on this occasion the whole
people had been duly sanctified, and therefore the exceptional
enlistment of the Levites' services must have been rendered unavoidably
necessary from the multitudes engaged in celebrating the passover.

[2 Chronicles 35:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 35:12</span></span>

they removed the burnt offerings--Some of the small cattle being
designed for burnt offerings were put apart by themselves, that they
might not be intermingled with the paschal lambs, which were carefully
selected according to certain rules, and intended to be sacramentally
eaten; and the manner in which those burnt offerings were presented
seems to have been the following: "All the subdivisions of the different
fathers' houses came one after another to the altar in solemn procession
to bring to the priests the portions which had been cut off, and the
priests laid these pieces upon the fire of the altar of burnt offering."

[2 Chronicles 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 35:13</span></span>

they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance--(See
[Exo 12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007).md). This mode of preparation
was prescribed by the law exclusively for the paschal lamb; the other
offerings and thank offerings were cooked in pots, kettles, and pans
([Sa1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#014).md).

divided them speedily among the people--The haste was either owing to
the multiplicity of the priests' business, or because the heat and
flavor of the viands would have been otherwise diminished. Hence it
appears that the meal consisted not of the paschal lambs alone, but of
the meat of the thank offerings--for part of the flesh fell to the
portion of the offerer, who, being in this instance, the king and the
princes, were by them made over to the people, who were recommended to
eat them the day they were offered, though not absolutely forbidden to
do so on the next ([Lev 7:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#015).md).

[2 Chronicles 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 35:14</span></span>

afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests--The
Levites rendered this aid to the priests solely because they were so
engrossed the entire day that they had no leisure to provide any
refreshments for themselves.

[2 Chronicles 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 35:15</span></span>

And the singers . . ., were in their place--While the priests and people
were so much engaged, the choir was not idle. They had to sing certain
Psalms, namely, the hundred thirteenth to the hundred eighteenth
inclusive, once, twice, and even a third time, during the continuance of
each company of offerers. As they could not leave their posts, for the
singing was resumed as every fresh company entered, the Levites prepared
for them also; for the various bands relieved each other in turn, and
while the general choir was doing duty, a portion of the tuneful
brethren, relieved for a time, partook of the viands that were brought
them.

[2 Chronicles 35:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 35:18</span></span>

there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of
Samuel--One feature by which this passover was distinguished was the
liberality of Josiah. But what distinguished it above all preceding
solemnities was, not the imposing grandeur of the ceremonies, nor the
immensity of the assembled concourse of worshippers; for these, with the
exception of a few from the kingdom of Israel, were confined to two
tribes; but it was the ardent devotion of the king and people, the
disregard of purely traditional customs, and the unusually strict
adherence, even in the smallest minutiÃ&brvbr;, to the forms of
observance prescribed in the book of the law, the discovery of an
original copy of which had produced so great a sensation. Instead of
"from the days of Samuel," the author of the Book of Kings says, "from
the days of the judges who judged Israel" \[[Kg2
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#022.md)\]. The meaning is the same in
both passages, for Samuel concluded the era of the judges.

all Judah and Israel that were present--The great majority of the people
of the northern kingdom were in exile, but some of the remaining
inhabitants performed the journey to Jerusalem on this occasion. 37,600
paschal lambs and kids were used, which \[[Ch2
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#007.md)\], at ten to a company, would
make 376,000 persons attending the feast.

[2 Chronicles 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 35:19</span></span>

In the eighteenth year of the reign Josiah was this passover kept--"It
is said ([Kg2 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).md) that Josiah sent
Shaphan to Hilkiah in the eighth month of that year." If this statement
rests upon an historical basis, all the events narrated here (at 2Ch.
34:8-35:19) must have happened in about the space of five months and a
half. We should then have a proof that the eighteenth year of Josiah's
reign was reckoned from the autumn (compare [Ch2
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#003).md). "The eighth month" of the
sacred year in the eighteenth year of his reign would be the second
month of his eighteenth year, and the first month of the new year would
be the seventh month \[BERTHEAU\].

[2 Chronicles 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 35:20</span></span>

HIS DEATH. ([Ch2 35:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020).md)

After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple--He most probably
calculated that the restoration of the divine worship, with the revival
of vital religion in the land, would lead, according to God's promise
and the uniform experience of the Hebrew people, to a period of settled
peace and increased prosperity. His hopes were disappointed. The bright
interval of tranquillity that followed his re-establishment of the true
religion was brief. But it must be observed that this interruption did
not proceed from any unfaithfulness in the divine promise, but from the
state into which the kingdom of Judah had brought itself by the national
apostasy, which was drawing down upon it the long threatened but long
deferred judgments of God.

Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by
Euphrates--Necho, son of Psammetichus, succeeded to the throne of Egypt
in the twentieth year of Josiah. He was a bold and enterprising king,
who entered with all his heart into the struggle which the two great
powers of Egypt and Assyria had long carried on for the political
ascendency. Each, jealous of the aggressive movements of its rival, was
desirous to maintain Palestine as a frontier barrier. After the
overthrow of Israel, the kingdom of Judah became in that respect doubly
important. Although the king and people had a strong bias for alliance
with Egypt, yet from the time of Manasseh it had become a vassal of
Assyria. Josiah, true to his political no less than his religious
engagements, thought himself bound to support the interests of his
Assyrian liege lord. Hence, when "Necho king of Egypt came up to fight
Carchemish, Josiah went out against him." Carchemish, on the eastern
side of the Euphrates, was the key of Assyria on the west, and in going
thither the king of Egypt would transport his troops by sea along the
coast of Palestine, northwards. Josiah, as a faithful vassal, resolved
to oppose Necho's march across the northern parts of that country. They
met in the "valley of Megiddo," that is, the valley or plain of
Esdraelon. The Egyptian king had come either by water or through the
plains of Philistia, keeping constantly along the coast, round the
northwest corner of Carmel, and so to the great plain of Megiddo. This
was not only his direct way to the Euphrates, but the only route fit for
his chariots, while thereby also he left Judah and Jerusalem quite to
his right. In this valley, however, the Egyptian army had necessarily to
strike across the country, and it was on that occasion that Josiah could
most conveniently intercept his passage. To avoid the difficulty of
passing the river Kishon, Necho kept to the south of it, and must,
therefore, have come past Megiddo. Josiah, in following with his
chariots and horsemen from Jerusalem, had to march northwards along the
highway through Samaria by Kefr-Kud (the ancient Caper-Cotia) to Megiddo
\[VAN DE VELDE\].

[2 Chronicles 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 35:21</span></span>

But he sent ambassadors . . . What have I to do with thee, thou king of
Judah?--Not wishing to spend time, or strength in vain, Necho informed
the king of Judah that he had no intention of molesting the Jews; that
his expedition was directed solely against his old Assyrian enemy; and
that he had undertaken it by an express commission from God.
Commentators are not agreed whether it was really a divine commission
given him through Jeremiah, or whether he merely used the name of God as
an authority that Josiah would not refuse to obey. As he could not know
the truth of Necho's declaration, Josiah did not sin in opposing him;
or, if he sinned at all, it was a sin of ignorance. The engagement took
place. Josiah was mortally wounded \[[Ch2
35:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#023.md)\].

[2 Chronicles 35:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 35:24</span></span>

took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot--the
carriage he had for ordinary use, and which would be more comfortable
for the royal sufferer than the war chariot. The death of this good king
was the subject of universal and lasting regret.

[2 Chronicles 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch2 35:25</span></span>

Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, &c.--The elegy of the prophet has not
reached us; but it seems to have been long preserved among his
countrymen and chanted on certain public occasions by the professional
singers, who probably got the dirges they sang from a collection of
funeral odes composed on the death of good and great men of the nation.
The spot in the valley of Megiddo where the battle was fought was near
the town of Hadad-rimmon; hence the lamentation for the death of Josiah
was called "the lamentation of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo,"
which was so great and so long continued, that the lamentation of Hadad
passed afterwards into a proverbial phrase to express any great and
extraordinary sorrow ([Zac 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011).md).
