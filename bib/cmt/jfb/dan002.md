### [Daniel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001)

[Daniel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 2:1</span></span>

NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DREAM: DANIEL'S INTERPRETATION OF IT, AND ADVANCEMENT.
(Dan. 2:1-49)

second year of . . . Nebuchadnezzar-- [Dan
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005) shows that "three years" had
elapsed since Nebuchadnezzar had taken Jerusalem. The solution of this
difficulty is: Nebuchadnezzar first ruled as subordinate to his father
Nabopolassar, to which time the first chapter refers ([Dan
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)); whereas "the second year" in the
second chapter is dated from his sole sovereignty. The very difficulty
is a proof of genuineness; all was clear to the writer and the original
readers from their knowledge of the circumstances, and so he adds no
explanation. A forger would not introduce difficulties; the author did
not then see any difficulty in the case. Nebuchadnezzar is called "king"
([Dan 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001)), by anticipation. Before he
left Judea, he became actual king by the death of his father, and the
Jews always called him "king," as commander of the invading army.

dreams--It is significant that not to Daniel, but to the then world
ruler, Nebuchadnezzar, the dream is vouchsafed. It was from the first of
its representatives who had conquered the theocracy, that the world
power was to learn its doom, as about to be in its turn subdued, and for
ever by the kingdom of God. As this vision opens, so that in the seventh
chapter developing the same truth more fully, closes the first part.
Nebuchadnezzar, as vicegerent of God ([Dan
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037); compare [Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009); [Eze
28:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#012); [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)), is honored with the revelation
in the form of a dream, the appropriate form to one outside the kingdom
of God. So in the cases of Abimelech, Pharaoh, &c. ([Gen
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003); [Gen
41:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001)), especially as the heathen
attached such importance to dreams. Still it is not he, but an
Israelite, who interprets it. Heathendom is passive, Israel active, in
divine things, so that the glory redounds to "the God of heaven."

[Daniel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 2:2</span></span>

Chaldeans--here, a certain order of priest-magicians, who wore a
peculiar dress, like that seen on the gods and deified men in the
Assyrian sculptures. Probably they belonged exclusively to the
Chaldeans, the original tribe of the Babylonian nation, just as the
Magians were properly Medes.

[Daniel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 2:3</span></span>

troubled to know the dream--He awoke in alarm, remembering that
something solemn had been presented to him in a dream, without being
able to recall the form in which it had clothed itself. His thoughts on
the unprecedented greatness to which his power had attained ([Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029)) made him anxious to know what
the issue of all this should be. God meets this wish in the way most
calculated to impress him.

[Daniel 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 2:4</span></span>

Here begins the Chaldee portion of Daniel, which continues to the end of
the seventh chapter. In it the course, character, and crisis of the
Gentile power are treated; whereas, in the other parts, which are in
Hebrew, the things treated apply more particularly to the Jews and
Jerusalem.

Syriac--the Aramean Chaldee, the vernacular tongue of the king and his
court; the prophet, by mentioning it here, hints at the reason of his
own adoption of it from this point.

live for ever--a formula in addressing kings, like our "Long live the
king!" Compare [Kg1 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#031).

[Daniel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 2:5</span></span>

The thing--that is, The dream, "is gone from me." GESENIUS translates,
"The decree is gone forth from me," irrevocable (compare [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023)); namely, that you shall be
executed, if you do not tell both the dream and the interpretation.
English Version is simpler, which supposes the king himself to have
forgotten the dream. Pretenders to supernatural knowledge often bring on
themselves their own punishment.

cut in pieces-- ([Sa1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033)).

houses . . . dunghill--rather, "a morass heap." The Babylonian houses
were built of sun-dried bricks; when demolished, the rain dissolves the
whole into a mass of mire, in the wet land, near the river \[STUART\].
As to the consistency of this cruel threat with Nebuchadnezzar's
character, see [Dan 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017), "basest of
men"; [Jer 39:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005); [Jer
52:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009).

[Daniel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 2:6</span></span>

rewards--literally, "presents poured out in lavish profusion."

[Daniel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 2:8</span></span>

gain . . . time--literally, "buy." Compare [Eph
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016); [Col
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005), where the sense is somewhat
different.

the thing is gone from me--(See on [Dan
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005)).

[Daniel 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 2:9</span></span>

one decree--There can be no second one reversing the first ([Est
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011)).

corrupt--deceitful.

till the time be changed--till a new state of things arrive, either by
my ceasing to trouble myself about the dream, or by a change of
government (which perhaps the agitation caused by the dream made
Nebuchadnezzar to forebode, and so to suspect the Chaldeans of
plotting).

tell . . . dream, and I shall know . . . ye can show . . .
interpretation--If ye cannot tell the past, a dream actually presented
to me, how can ye know, and show, the future events prefigured in it?

[Daniel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 2:10</span></span>

There is not a man . . . that can show--God makes the heathen out of
their own mouth, condemn their impotent pretensions to supernatural
knowledge, in order to bring out in brighter contrast His power to
reveal secrets to His servants, though but "men upon the earth" (compare
[Dan 2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022)).

therefore, &c.--that is, If such things could be done by men, other
absolute princes would have required them from their magicians; as they
have not, it is proof such things cannot be done and cannot be
reasonably asked from us.

[Daniel 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 2:11</span></span>

gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh--answering to "no man upon the
earth"; for there were, in their belief, "men in heaven," namely, men
deified; for example, Nimrod. The supreme gods are referred to here, who
alone, in the Chaldean view, could solve the difficulty, but who do not
communicate with men. The inferior gods, intermediate between men and
the supreme gods, are unable to solve it. Contrast with this heathen
idea of the utter severance of God from man, [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), "The Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us"; Daniel was in this case made His representative.

[Daniel 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 2:12</span></span>

Daniel and his companions do not seem to have been actually numbered
among the Magi or Chaldeans, and so were not summoned before the king.
Providence ordered it so that all mere human wisdom should be shown vain
before His divine power, through His servant, was put forth. [Dan
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024) shows that the decree for slaying
the wise men had not been actually executed when Daniel interposed.

[Daniel 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 2:14</span></span>

captain of the king's guard--commanding the executioners (Margin; and
[Gen 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036), Margin).

[Daniel 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 2:15</span></span>

Why is the decree so hasty--Why were not all of us consulted before the
decree for the execution of all was issued?

the thing--the agitation of the king as to his dream, and his abortive
consultation of the Chaldeans. It is plain from this that Daniel was
till now ignorant of the whole matter.

[Daniel 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 2:16</span></span>

Daniel went in--perhaps not in person, but by the mediation of some
courtier who had access to the king. His first direct interview seems to
have been [Dan 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#025) \[BARNES\].

time--The king granted "time" to Daniel, though he would not do so to
the Chaldeans because they betrayed their lying purpose by requiring him
to tell the dream, which Daniel did not. Providence doubtless influenced
his mind, already favorable ([Dan
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#019)), to show special favor to
Daniel.

[Daniel 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 2:17</span></span>

Here appears the reason why Daniel sought "time" ([Dan
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016)), namely he wished to engage his
friends to join him in prayer to God to reveal the dream to him.

[Daniel 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 2:18</span></span>

An illustration of the power of united prayer ([Mat
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#019)). The same instrumentality
rescued Peter from his peril ([Act
12:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005)).

[Daniel 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 2:19</span></span>

revealed . . . in . . . night vision-- ([Job
33:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#015)).

[Daniel 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 2:20</span></span>

answered--responded to God's goodness by praises.

name of God--God in His revelation of Himself by acts of love, "wisdom,
and might" ([Jer 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019)).

[Daniel 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 2:21</span></span>

changeth . . . times . . . seasons--"He herein gives a general
preparatory intimation, that the dream of Nebuchadnezzar is concerning
the changes and successions of kingdoms" \[JEROME\]. The "times" are the
phases and periods of duration of empires (compare [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025); [Ch1
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#032); [Ch1
29:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#030)); the "seasons" the fitting
times for their culmination, decline, and fall ([Ecc
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001); [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007); [Th1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)). The vicissitudes of states, with
their times and seasons, are not regulated by chance or fate, as the
heathen thought, but by God.

removed kings-- ([Job 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018); [Psa
75:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006); [Jer
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005); compare [Sa1
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#007)).

giveth wisdom-- ([Kg1 3:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#009); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005)).

[Daniel 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 2:22</span></span>

revealeth-- ([Job 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#022)). So
spiritually ([Eph 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017)).

knoweth what is in . . . darkness-- ([Psa
139:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#011); [Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013)).

light . . . him-- ([Jam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017); [Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)). Apocalypse (or "revelation")
signifies a divine, prophecy a human, activity. Compare [Co1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#006), where the two are distinguished.
The prophet is connected with the outer world, addressing to the
congregation the words with which the Spirit of God supplies him; he
speaks in the Spirit, but the apocalyptic seer is in the Spirit in his
whole person ([Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010); [Rev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002)). The form of the apocalyptic
revelation (the very term meaning that the veil that hides the invisible
world is taken off) is subjectively either the dream, or, higher, the
vision. The interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream was a preparatory
education to Daniel himself. By gradual steps, each revelation preparing
him for the succeeding one, God fitted him for disclosures becoming more
and more special. In the second and fourth chapters he is but an
interpreter of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams; then he has a dream himself, but
it is only a vision in a dream of the night ([Dan
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001)); then follows a vision in a
waking state ([Dan 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001)); lastly, in
the two final revelations ([Dan 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020);
[Dan 10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#004)) the ecstatic state is no
longer needed. The progression in the form answers to the progression in
the contents of his prophecy; at first general outlines, and these
afterwards filled up with minute chronological and historical details,
such as are not found in the Revelation of John, though, as became the
New Testament, the form of revelation is the highest, namely, clear
waking visions \[AUBERLEN\].

[Daniel 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 2:23</span></span>

thee . . . thee--He ascribes all the glory to God.

God of my fathers--Thou hast shown Thyself the same God of grace to me,
a captive exile, as Thou didst to Israel of old and this on account of
the covenant made with our "fathers" ([Luk
1:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#054); compare [Psa
106:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045)).

given me wisdom and might--Thou being the fountain of both; referring to
[Dan 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#020). Whatever wise ability I
have to stay the execution of the king's cruel decree, is Thy gift.

me . . . we . . . us--The revelation was given to Daniel, as "me"
implies; yet with just modesty he joins his friends with him; because it
was to their joint prayers, and not to his individually, that he owed
the revelation from God.

known . . . the king's matter--the very words in which the Chaldeans had
denied the possibility of any man on earth telling the dream ("not a man
upon the earth can show the king's matter," [Dan
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#010)). Impostors are compelled by the
God of truth to eat up their own words.

[Daniel 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 2:24</span></span>

Therefore--because of having received the divine communication.

bring me in before the king--implying that he had not previously been in
person before the king (see on [Dan
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016)).

[Daniel 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 2:25</span></span>

I have found a man--Like all courtiers, in announcing agreeable tidings,
he ascribes the merit of the discovery to himself \[JEROME\]. So far
from it being a discrepancy, that he says nothing of the previous
understanding between him and Daniel, or of Daniel's application to the
king ([Dan 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#015)), it is just what
we should expect. Arioch would not dare to tell an absolute despot that
he had stayed the execution of his sanguinary decree, on his own
responsibility; but would, in the first instance, secretly stay it until
Daniel had got, by application from the king, the time required, without
Arioch seeming to know of Daniel's application as the cause of the
respite; then, when Daniel had received the revelation, Arioch would in
trembling haste bring him in, as if then for the first time he had
"found" him. The very difficulty when cleared up is a proof of
genuineness, as it never would be introduced by a forger.

[Daniel 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 2:27</span></span>

cannot--Daniel, being learned in all the lore of the Chaldeans ([Dan
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004)), could authoritatively declare
the impossibility of mere man solving the king's difficulty.

soothsayers--from a root, "to cut off"; referring to their cutting the
heavens into divisions, and so guessing at men's destinies from the
place of the stars at one's birth.

[Daniel 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 2:28</span></span>

God--in contrast to "the wise men," &c. ([Dan
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#027)).

revealeth secrets-- ([Amo 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007); [Amo
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013)). Compare [Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045), Zaphnath-paaneah, "revealer of
secrets," the title given to Joseph.

the latter days--literally, "in the after days" ([Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029)); "hereafter" ([Gen
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001)): It refers to the whole future,
including the Messianic days, which is the final dispensation ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)).

visions of thy head--conceptions formed in the brain.

[Daniel 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 2:29</span></span>

God met with a revelation Nebuchadnezzar, who had been meditating on the
future destiny of his vast empire.

[Daniel 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 2:30</span></span>

not . . . for any wisdom that I have--not on account of any previous
wisdom which I may have manifested ([Dan
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017), [Dan
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#020)). The specially-favored servants
of God in all ages disclaim merit in themselves and ascribe all to the
grace and power of God ([Gen 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#016);
[Act 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012)). The "as for me,"
disclaiming extraordinary merit, contrasts elegantly with "as for thee,"
whereby Daniel courteously, but without flattery, implies, that God
honored Nebuchadnezzar, as His vicegerent over the world kingdoms, with
a revelation on the subject uppermost in his thoughts, the ultimate
destinies of those kingdoms.

for their sakes that shall make known, &c.--a Chaldee idiom for, "to the
intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king."

the thoughts of thy heart--thy subject of thought before falling asleep.
Or, perhaps the probation of Nebuchadnezzar's character through this
revelation may be the meaning intended (compare [Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031); [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035)).

[Daniel 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 2:31</span></span>

The world power in its totality appears as a colossal human form:
Babylon the head of gold, Medo-Persia the breast and two arms of silver,
GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia the belly and two thighs of brass, and Rome, with
its Germano-Slavonic offshoots, the legs of iron and feet of iron and
clay, the fourth still existing. Those kingdoms only are mentioned which
stand in some relation to the kingdom of God; of these none is left out;
the final establishment of that kingdom is the aim of His moral
government of the world. The colossus of metal stands on weak feet, of
clay. All man's glory is as ephemeral and worthless as chaff (compare
[Pe1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024)). But the kingdom of God,
small and unheeded as a "stone" on the ground is compact in its
homogeneous unity; whereas the world power, in its heterogeneous
constituents successively supplanting one another, contains the elements
of decay. The relation of the stone to the mountain is that of the
kingdom of the cross ([Mat 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023); [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)) to the kingdom of glory, the
latter beginning, and the former ending when the kingdom of God breaks
in pieces the kingdoms of the world ([Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)). Christ's contrast between the
two kingdoms refers to this passage.

a great image--literally, "one image that was great." Though the
kingdoms were different, it was essentially one and the same world power
under different phases, just as the image was one, though the parts were
of different metals.

[Daniel 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">dan 2:32</span></span>

On ancient coins states are often represented by human figures. The head
and higher parts signify the earlier times; the lower, the later times.
The metals become successively baser and baser, implying the growing
degeneracy from worse to worse. Hesiod, two hundred years before Daniel,
had compared the four ages to the four metals in the same order; the
idea is sanctioned here by Holy Writ. It was perhaps one of those
fragments of revelation among the heathen derived from the tradition as
to the fall of man. The metals lessen in specific gravity, as they
downwards; silver is not so heavy as gold, brass not so heavy as silver,
and iron not so heavy as brass, the weight thus being arranged in the
reverse of stability \[TREGELLES\]. Nebuchadnezzar derived his authority
from God, not from man, nor as responsible to man. But the Persian king
was so far dependent on others that he could not deliver Daniel from the
princes ([Dan 6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#014)); contrast [Dan
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#018), as to Nebuchadnezzar's power
from God, whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive"
(compare [Ezr 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#014); [Est
1:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#013)). GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia
betrays its deterioration in its divisions, not united as Babylon and
Persia. Iron is stronger than brass, but inferior in other respects; so
Rome hardy and strong to tread down the nations, but less kingly and
showing its chief deterioration in its last state. Each successive
kingdom incorporates its predecessor (compare [Dan
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#028)). Power that in Nebuchadnezzar's
hands was a God-derived ([Dan 2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037))
autocracy, in the Persian king's was a rule resting on his nobility of
person and birth, the nobles being his equals in rank, but not in
office; in Greece, an aristocracy not of birth, but individual
influence, in Rome, lowest of all, dependent entirely on popular choice,
the emperor being appointed by popular military election.

As the two arms of silver denote the kings of the Medes and Persians
\[JOSEPHUS\]; and the two thighs of brass the SeleucidÃ&brvbr; of Syria
and LagidÃ&brvbr; of Egypt, the two leading sections into which
GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia parted, so the two legs of iron signify the two
Roman consuls \[NEWTON\]. The clay, in [Dan
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041), "potter's clay," [Dan
2:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#043), "miry clay," means
"earthenware," hard but brittle (compare [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027), where the same image is used of
the same event); the feet are stable while bearing only direct pressure,
but easily "broken" to pieces by a blow ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)), the iron intermixed not
retarding, but hastening, such a result.

[Daniel 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)

stone--Messiah and His kingdom ([Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024); [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)). In its relations to Israel, it
is a "stone of stumbling" ([Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014);
[Act 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011); [Pe1
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)) on which both houses of Israel
are broken, not destroyed ([Mat
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032)). In its relation to the Church,
the same stone which destroys the image is the foundation of the Church
([Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)). In its relation to the
Gentile world power, the stone is its destroyer ([Dan
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044); compare [Zac
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003)). Christ saith ([Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044), referring to [Isa
8:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014)), "Whosoever shall fall on
this stone (that is, stumble, and be offended, at Him, as the Jews were,
from whom, therefore, He says, 'The kingdom shall be taken') shall be
broken; but (referring to [Dan
2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)) on whomsoever it shall fall
(referring to the world power which had been the instrument of breaking
the Jews), it will (not merely break, but) grind him to powder" ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)). The falling of the stone of
the feet of the image cannot refer to Christ at His first advent, for
the fourth kingdom was not then as yet divided--no toes were in
existence (see on [Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)).

cut out--namely, from "the mountain" ([Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)); namely, Mount Zion ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)), and antitypically, the heavenly
mount of the Father's glory, from whom Christ came.

without hands--explained in [Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044),
"The God of heaven shall set up a kingdom," as contrasted with the image
which was made with hands of man. Messiah not created by human agency,
but conceived by the Holy Ghost ([Mat
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020); [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035); compare [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006); [Mar
14:58](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#058); [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011), [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024)). So "not made with hands," that
is, heavenly, [Co2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001); spiritual,
[Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011). The world kingdoms were
reared by human ambition: but this is the "kingdom of heaven"; "not of
this world" ([Joh 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)). As the
fourth kingdom, or Rome, was represented in a twofold state, first
strong, with legs of iron, then weak, with toes part of iron, part of
clay; so this fifth kingdom, that of Christ, is seen conversely, first
insignificant as a "stone," then as a "mountain" filling the whole
earth. The ten toes are the ten lesser kingdoms into which the Roman
kingdom was finally to be divided; this tenfold division here hinted at
is not specified in detail till the seventh chapter. The fourth empire
originally was bounded in Europe pretty nearly by the line of the Rhine
and Danube; in Asia by the Euphrates. In Africa it possessed Egypt and
the north coasts; South Britain and Dacia were afterwards added but were
ultimately resigned. The ten kingdoms do not arise until a deterioration
(by mixing clay with the iron) has taken place; they are in existence
when Christ comes in glory, and then are broken in pieces. The ten have
been sought for in the invading hosts of the fifth and sixth century.
But though many provinces were then severed from Rome as independent
kingdoms, the dignity of emperor still continued, and the imperial power
was exercised over Rome itself for two centuries. So the tenfold
divisions cannot be looked for before A.D. 731. But the East is not to
be excluded, five toes being on each foot. Thus no point of time before
the overthrow of the empire at the taking of Constantinople by the Turks
(A.D. 1453) can be assigned for the division. It seems, therefore, that
the definite ten will be the ultimate development of the Roman empire
just before the rise of Antichrist, who shall overthrow three of the
kings, and, after three and a half years, he himself be overthrown by
Christ in person. Some of the ten kingdoms will, doubtless, be the same
as some past and present divisions of the old Roman empire, which
accounts for the continuity of the connection between the toes and legs,
a gap of centuries not being interposed, as is objected by opponents of
the futurist theory. The lists of the ten made by the latter differ from
one another; and they are set aside by the fact that they include
countries which were never Roman, and exclude one whole section of the
empire, namely, the East \[TREGELLES\].

upon his feet--the last state of the Roman empire. Not "upon his legs."
Compare "in the days of these kings" (see on [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)).

[Daniel 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">dan 2:35</span></span>

broken . . . together--excluding a contemporaneous existence of the
kingdom of the world and the kingdom of God (in its manifested, as
distinguished from its spiritual, phase). The latter is not gradually to
wear away the former, but to destroy it at once, and utterly ([Th2
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007); [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)). However, the Hebrew may be
translated, "in one discriminate mass."

chaff--image of the ungodly, as they shall be dealt with in the judgment
([Psa 1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004); [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012)).

summer threshing-floors--Grain was winnowed in the East on an elevated
space in the open air, by throwing the grain into the air with a shovel,
so that the wind might clear away the chaff.

no place . . . found for them-- ([Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011); compare [Psa
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010), [Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036); [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)).

became . . . mountain--cut out of the mountain ([Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)) originally, it ends in becoming
a mountain. So the kingdom of God, coming from heaven originally, ends
in heaven being established on earth ([Rev
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001)).

filled . . . earth-- ([Isa 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009); [Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)). It is to do so in connection
with Jerusalem as the mother Church ([Psa
80:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009); [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)).

[Daniel 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">dan 2:37</span></span>

Thou . . . art a king of kings--The committal of power in fullest
plenitude belongs to Nebuchadnezzar personally, as having made Babylon
the mighty empire it was. In twenty-three years after him the empire was
ended: with him its greatness is identified ([Dan
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030)), his successors having done
nothing notable. Not that he actually ruled every part of the globe, but
that God granted him illimitable dominion in whatever direction his
ambition led him, Egypt, Nineveh, Arabia, Syria, Tyre, and its
PhÅ“nician colonies ([Jer 27:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005)).
Compare as to Cyrus, [Ezr 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).

[Daniel 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">dan 2:38</span></span>

men . . . beasts . . . fowls--the dominion originally designed for man
([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028); [Gen
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019)), forfeited by sin;
temporarily delegated to Nebuchadnezzar and the world powers; but, as
they abuse the trust for self, instead of for God, to be taken from them
by the Son of man, who will exercise it for God, restoring in His person
to man the lost inheritance ([Psa
8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)).

Thou art . . . head of gold--alluding to the riches of Babylon, hence
called "the golden city" ([Isa 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004);
[Jer 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007); [Rev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#016)).

[Daniel 2:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">dan 2:39</span></span>

That Medo-Persia is the second kingdom appears from [Dan
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#028) and [Dan
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#020). Compare [Ch2
36:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#020); [Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002).

inferior--"The kings of Persia were the worst race of men that ever
governed an empire" \[PRIDEAUX\]. Politically (which is the main point
of view here) the power of the central government in which the nobles
shared with the king, being weakened by the growing independence of the
provinces, was inferior to that of Nebuchadnezzar, whose sole word was
law throughout his empire.

brass--The Greeks (the third empire, [Dan
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#021); [Dan
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020); [Dan
11:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002)) were celebrated for the brazen
armor of their warriors. JEROME fancifully thinks that the brass, as
being a clear-sounding metal, refers to the eloquence for which Greece
was famed. The "belly," in [Dan 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032),
may refer to the drunkenness of Alexander and the luxury of the
Ptolemies \[TIRINUS\].

over all the earth--Alexander commanded that he should be called "king
of all the world" \[JUSTIN, 12. sec. 16.9; ARRIAN, Campaigns of
Alexander, 7. sec. 15\]. The four successors (diadochi) who divided
Alexander's dominions at his death, of whom the SeleucidÃ&brvbr; in
Syria and the LagidÃ&brvbr; in Egypt were chief, held the same empire.

[Daniel 2:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">dan 2:40</span></span>

iron--This vision sets forth the character of the Roman power, rather
than its territorial extent \[TREGELLES\].

breaketh in pieces--So, in righteous retribution, itself will at last be
broken in pieces ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)) by the
kingdom of God ([Rev 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010)).

[Daniel 2:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">dan 2:41</span></span>

feet . . . toes . . . part . . . clay . . . iron--explained presently,
"the kingdom shall be partly strong, partly broken" (rather, "brittle,"
as earthenware); and [Dan 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#043), "they
shall mingle . . . with the seed of men," that is, there will be power
(in its deteriorated form, iron) mixed up with that which is wholly of
man, and therefore brittle; power in the hands of the people having no
internal stability, though something is left of the strength of the iron
\[TREGELLES\]. NEWTON, who understands the Roman empire to be parted
into the ten kingdoms already (whereas TREGELLES makes them future),
explains the "clay" mixture as the blending of barbarous nations with
Rome by intermarriages and alliances, in which there was no stable
amalgamation, though the ten kingdoms retained much of Rome's strength.
The "mingling with the seed of men" ([Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)) seems to refer to [Gen
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002), where the marriages of the seed
of godly Seth with the daughters of ungodly Cain are described in
similar words. The reference, therefore, seems to be to the blending of
the Christianized Roman empire with the pagan nations, a deterioration
being the result. Efforts have been often made to reunite the parts into
one great empire, as by Charlemagne and Napoleon, but in vain. Christ
alone shall effect that.

[Daniel 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">dan 2:44</span></span>

in the days of these kings--in the days of these kingdoms, that is, of
the last of the four. So Christianity was set up when Rome had become
mistress of Judea and the world ([Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001), &c.) \[NEWTON\]. Rather, "in the
days of these kings," answers to "upon his feet" ([Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034)); that is, the ten toes ([Dan
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#042)), or ten kings, the final state
of the Roman empire. For "these kings" cannot mean the four successional
monarchies, as they do not coexist as the holders of power; if the
fourth had been meant, the singular, not the plural, would be used. The
falling of the stone on the image must mean, destroying judgment on the
fourth Gentile power, not gradual evangelization of it by grace; and the
destroying judgment cannot be dealt by Christians, for they are taught
to submit to the powers that be, so that it must be dealt by Christ
Himself at His coming again. We live under the divisions of the Roman
empire which began fourteen hundred years ago, and which at the time of
His coming shall be definitely ten. All that had failed in the hand of
man shall then pass away, and that which is kept in His own hand shall
be introduced. Thus the second chapter is the alphabet of the subsequent
prophetic statements in Daniel \[TREGELLES\].

God of heaven . . . kingdom--hence the phrase, "the kingdom of heaven"
([Mat 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002)).

not . . . left to other people--as the Chaldees had been forced to leave
their kingdom to the Medo-Persians, and these to the Greeks, and these
to the Romans ([Mic 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007); [Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032)).

break . . . all-- ([Isa 60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)).

[Daniel 2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">dan 2:45</span></span>

without hands--(See on [Dan 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#035)).

[Daniel 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">dan 2:46</span></span>

fell upon . . . face, and worshipped Daniel--worshipping God in the
person of Daniel. Symbolical of the future prostration of the world
power before Messiah and His kingdom ([Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)). As other servants of God
refused such honors ([Act 10:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025);
[Act 14:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013); [Rev
22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008)) would not taste defiled food,
nor give up prayer to God at the cost of his life ([Dan
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007), [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010)), it seems likely that Daniel
rejected the proffered divine honors. The word "answered" ([Dan
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047)) implies that Daniel had objected
to these honors; and in compliance with his objection, "the king
answered, Of a truth, your God is a God of gods." Daniel had disclaimed
all personal merit in [Dan 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030),
giving God all the glory (compare [Dan
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045)).

commanded . . . sweet odours--divine honors ([Ezr
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010)). It is not said his command was
executed.

[Daniel 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">dan 2:47</span></span>

Lord of kings--The world power shall at last have to acknowledge this
([Rev 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014); [Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016)); even as Nebuchadnezzar, who
had been the God-appointed "king of kings" ([Dan
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037)), but who had abused the trust,
is constrained by God's servant to acknowledge that God is the true
"Lord of kings."

[Daniel 2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">dan 2:48</span></span>

One reason for Nebuchadnezzar having been vouchsafed such a dream is
here seen; namely, that Daniel might be promoted, and the captive people
of God be comforted: the independent state of the captives during the
exile and the alleviation of its hardships, were much due to Daniel.

[Daniel 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">dan 2:49</span></span>

Daniel requested--Contrast this honorable remembrance of his humble
friends in his elevation with the spirit of the children of the world in
the chief butler's case ([Gen 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023);
[Ecc 9:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015); [Amo
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)).

in the gate--the place of holding courts of justice and levees in the
East ([Est 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#019); [Job
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#007)). So "the Sublime Porte," or
"Gate," denotes the sultan's government, his counsels being formerly
held in the entrance of his palace. Daniel was a chief counsellor of the
king, and president over the governors of the different orders into
which the Magi were divided.

Between the vision of Nebuchadnezzar in the second chapter and that of
Daniel in the seventh, four narratives of Daniels and his friends'
personal history are introduced. As the second and seventh chapters go
together, so chapters the third and sixth chapters (the deliverance from
the lions' den), and the fourth and fifth chapters. Of these last two
pairs, the former shows God's nearness to save His saints when faithful
to Him, at the very time they seem to be crushed by the world power. The
second pair shows, in the case of the two kings of the first monarchy,
how God can suddenly humble the world power in the height of its
insolence. The latter advances from mere self-glorification, in the
fourth chapter, to open opposition to God in the fifth. Nebuchadnezzar
demands homage to be paid to his image ([Dan
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001)), and boasts of his power (Dan.
4:1-18). But Belshazzar goes further, blaspheming God by polluting His
holy vessels. There is a similar progression in the conduct of God's
people. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego refuse positive homage to the
image of the world power ([Dan 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012));
Daniel will not yield it even a negative homage, by omitting for a time
the worship of God ([Dan 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010)).
Jehovah's power manifested for the saints against the world in
individual histories (the third through sixth chapters) is exhibited in
the second and seventh chapters, in world-wide prophetical pictures; the
former heightening the effect of the latter. The miracles wrought in
behalf of Daniel and his friends were a manifestation of God's glory in
Daniel's person, as the representative of the theocracy before the
Babylonian king, who deemed himself almighty, at a time when God could
not manifest it in His people as a body. They tended also to secure, by
their impressive character, that respect for the covenant-people on the
part of the heathen powers which issued in Cyrus' decree, not only
restoring the Jews, but ascribing honor to the God of heaven, and
commanding the building of the temple ([Ezr
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)) \[AUBERLEN\].
