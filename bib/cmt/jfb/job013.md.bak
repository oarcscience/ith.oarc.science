Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Job Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

[Job 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 13:1</span></span>

JOB'S REPLY TO ZOPHAR CONTINUED. (Job 13:1-28)

all this--as to the dealings of Providence ([Job
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#003).md).

[Job 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 13:3</span></span>

Job wishes to plead his cause before God ([Job
9:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034).md), as he is more and more
convinced of the valueless character of his would-be "physicians" ([Job
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002).md).

[Job 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 13:4</span></span>

forgers of lies--literally, "artful twisters of vain speeches"
\[UMBREIT\].

[Job 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 13:5</span></span>

([Pro 17:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#028).md). The Arabs say, "The wise
are dumb; silence is wisdom."

[Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 13:7</span></span>

deceitfully--use fallacies to vindicate God in His dealings; as if the
end justified the means. Their "deceitfulness" for God, against Job, was
that they asserted he was a sinner, because he was a sufferer.

[Job 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 13:8</span></span>

accept his person--God's; that is, be partial for Him, as when a judge
favors one party in a trial, because of personal considerations.

contend for God--namely, with fallacies and prepossessions against Job
before judgment ([Jdg 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#031).md).
Partiality can never please the impartial God, nor the goodness of the
cause excuse the unfairness of the arguments.

[Job 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 13:9</span></span>

Will the issue to you be good, when He searches out you and your
arguments? Will you be regarded by Him as pure and disinterested?

mock-- ([Gal 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md). Rather, "Can you
deceive Him as one man?" &c.

[Job 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 13:10</span></span>

If ye do, though secretly, act partially. (See on [Job
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#008.md); [Psa
82:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001).md). God can successfully
vindicate His acts, and needs no fallacious argument of man.

[Job 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 13:11</span></span>

make you afraid?--namely, of employing sophisms in His name ([Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007.md), [Jer
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#010).md).

[Job 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 13:12</span></span>

remembrances--"proverbial maxims," so called because well remembered.

like unto ashes--or, "parables of ashes"; the image of lightness and
nothingness ([Isa 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020).md).

bodies--rather, "entrenchments"; those of clay, as opposed to those of
stone, are easy to be destroyed; so the proverbs, behind which they
entrench themselves, will not shelter them when God shall appear to
reprove them for their injustice to Job.

[Job 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 13:13</span></span>

Job would wish to be spared their speeches, so as to speak out all his
mind as to his wretchedness ([Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014).md), happen what will.

[Job 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 13:14</span></span>

A proverb for, "Why should I anxiously desire to save my life?"
\[EICHORN\]. The image in the first clause is that of a wild beast,
which in order to preserve his prey, carries it in his teeth. That in
the second refers to men who hold in the hand what they want to keep
secure.

[Job 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 13:15</span></span>

in him--So the margin or keri, reads. But the textual reading or chetib
is "not," which agrees best with the context, and other passages wherein
he says he has no hope ([Job 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#011.md);
[Job 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021.md); [Job
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#020.md); [Job
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#010).md). "Though He slay me, and I dare
no more hope, yet I will maintain," &c., that is, "I desire to vindicate
myself before Him," as not a hypocrite \[UMBREIT and NOYES\].

[Job 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 13:16</span></span>

He--rather, "This also already speaks in my behalf (literally, 'for my
saving acquittal') for an hypocrite would not wish to come before Him"
(as I do) \[UMBREIT\]. (See last clause of [Job
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#015).md).

[Job 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 13:17</span></span>

my declaration--namely, that I wish to be permitted to justify myself
immediately before God.

with your ears--that is, attentively.

[Job 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 13:18</span></span>

ordered--implying a constant preparation for defense in his confidence
of innocence.

[Job 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 13:19</span></span>

if, &c.--Rather, "Then would I hold my tongue and give up the ghost";
that is, if any one can contend with me and prove me false, I have no
more to say. "I will be silent and die." Like our "I would stake my life
on it" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 13:20</span></span>

Address to God.

not hide--stand forth boldly to maintain my cause.

[Job 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 13:21</span></span>

(See on [Job 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034.md) and see [Psa
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#010).md).

[Job 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 13:22</span></span>

call--a challenge to the defendant to answer to the charges.

answer--the defense begun.

speak--as plaintiff.

answer--to the plea of the plaintiff. Expressions from a trial.

[Job 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 13:23</span></span>

The catalogue of my sins ought to be great, to judge from the severity
with which God ever anew crushes one already bowed down. Would that He
would reckon them up! He then would see how much my calamities outnumber
them.

sin?--singular, "I am unconscious of a single particular sin, much less
many" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 13:24</span></span>

hidest . . . face--a figure from the gloomy impression caused by the
sudden clouding over of the sun.

enemy--God treated Job as an enemy who must be robbed of power by
ceaseless sufferings ([Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017.md), [Job
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021).md).

[Job 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 13:25</span></span>

([Lev 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md); [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004).md). Job compares himself to a leaf
already fallen, which the storm still chases hither and thither.

break--literally, "shake with (Thy) terrors." Jesus Christ does not
"break the bruised reed" ([Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003.md),
[Isa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md).

[Job 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 13:26</span></span>

writest--a judicial phrase, to note down the determined punishment. The
sentence of the condemned used to be written down ([Isa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#001.md); [Jer
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#030.md); [Psa
149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009).md) \[UMBREIT\].

bitter things--bitter punishments.

makest me to possess--or "inherit." In old age he receives possession of
the inheritance of sin thoughtlessly acquired in youth. "To inherit
sins" is to inherit the punishments inseparably connected with them in
Hebrew ideas ([Psa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007).md).

[Job 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 13:27</span></span>

stocks--in which the prisoner's feet were made fast until the time of
execution ([Jer 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002).md).

lookest narrowly--as an overseer would watch a prisoner.

print--Either the stocks, or his disease, marked his soles (Hebrew,
"roots") as the bastinado would. Better, thou drawest (or diggest)
\[GESENIUS\] a line (or trench) \[GESENIUS\] round my soles, beyond
which I must not move \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 13:28</span></span>

Job speaks of himself in the third person, thus forming the transition
to the general lot of man ([Job 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#001.md);
[Psa 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md); [Hos
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012).md).
