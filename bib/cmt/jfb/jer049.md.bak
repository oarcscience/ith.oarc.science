### [Jeremiah Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 49:1</span></span>

PREDICTIONS AS TO AMMON, IDUMEA, DAMASCUS, KEDAR, HAZOR, AND ELAM. (Jer.
49:1-39)

Hath Israel . . . no heir?--namely, to occupy the land of Gad, after it
itself has been carried away captive by Shalmaneser. Ammon, like Moab,
descended from Lot, lay north of Moab, from which it was separated by
the river Arnon, and east of Reuben and Gad ([Jos
13:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#024).md) on the same side of Jordan.
It seized on Gad when Israel was carried captive. Judah was by the right
of kindred the heir, not Ammon; but Ammon joined with Nebuchadnezzar
against Judah and Jerusalem ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md) and exulted over its fall ([Psa
83:4-7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#004.md); [Zep
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md). It had already, in the days of
Jeroboam, in Israel's affliction, tried to "enlarge its border" ([Kg2
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026.md); [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md), [Amo
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013).md).

their king-- ([Amo 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015).md); referring to
Melchom, their tutelary idol ([Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md); and so the Septuagint reads it
here as a proper name ([Kg1 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#005.md), [Kg1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033.md); [Kg2
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013).md). The Ammonite god is said to do
what they do, namely, occupy the Israelite land of Gad. To Jehovah, the
theocratic "King" of Israel, the land belonged of right; so that their
Molech or Melchom was a usurper-king.

his people--the people of Melchom, "their king." Compare "people of
Chemosh," [Jer 48:46](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#046.md).

[Jeremiah 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 49:2</span></span>

Rabbah--"the great," metropolis of Ammon ([Sa2
12:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026).md). Its destruction is foretold
also in [Eze 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#005.md); [Amo
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#014.md).

her daughters--the towns and villages, dependencies of the metropolis
([Jos 15:45](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#045).md).

shall . . . be heir--shall possess those who possessed him. The full
accomplishment of this is still future; partially fulfilled under the
Maccabees (1 Maccabees 5:6).

[Jeremiah 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 49:3</span></span>

Heshbon . . . Ai--Nebuchadnezzar, coming from the north, first attacked
Ammon, then its brother and neighbor, Moab. As Ai of Ammon had already
suffered destruction, Heshbon of Moab being near it might well fear the
same fate.

hedges--Their cities being destroyed, the outcasts have no place of
shelter save behind the "hedges" of vineyards and gardens; or else the
enclosures of their villages.

their king--Melchom, the idol, as the mention of "his priests" shows
(compare [Jer 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 49:4</span></span>

thy flowing valley--rather, "thy valley shall flow," namely with the
blood of the slain; in sad contrast to their "valleys" in which they had
heretofore "gloried," as flowing with milk and honey \[GROTIUS\]. Or
else, as Margin, "shall flow away."

backsliding--apostate from Jehovah, the God of their father Lot, to
Molech.

treasures--her resources for resisting the foe.

Who shall, &c.--Who can come . . . ([Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 49:5</span></span>

every man right forth--whithersoever chance may lead him ([Jer
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md); [Gen
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017).md); straight before him, onwards
at random ([Amo 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003).md).

none . . . gather up him, &c.--There shall be none to gather together
the wandering fugitives, so as to care for them and restore them to
their own homes.

[Jeremiah 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 49:6</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047).md). For the sake of
"righteous" Lot their progenitor. Partially fulfilled under Cyrus; in
gospel times more fully.

[Jeremiah 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 49:7</span></span>

Concerning Edom--a distinct prophecy, copied in part from Obadiah, but
with the freedom of one himself inspired and foretelling a later
calamity. Obadiah's was fulfilled probably in Sennacherib's time
(compare [Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md); [Amo
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md); Jeremiah's about the same time
as his preceding prophecies ([Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md); [Eze
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012).md).

wisdom--for which the Arabs and the people of Teman (a city of Edom) in
particular, were famed ([Gen 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015.md);
[Kg1 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md); see Job, everywhere; [Oba
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008).md).

vanished--literally "poured out," that is, exhausted (compare [Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003), Margin.md) \[MAURER\]. Or, as the
kindred Ethiopic word means, "worn out" \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].

[Jeremiah 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 49:8</span></span>

turn--namely, your backs in flight.

dwell deep--in deep defiles and caves \[GROTIUS\], which abound in
Idumea. Others refer it to the Arab custom of retiring into the depth of
the desert when avoiding an offended foe ([Jer
49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030).md).

Dedan--a tribe bordering on and made subject by Idumea; descended from
Jokshan, son of Abraham and Keturah ([Gen
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#001).md).

Esau--The naming of Edom's progenitor, reprobated by God, recalls the
remembrance of the old curse on him for his profanity, both his sin and
its punishment being perpetuated in his descendants ([Heb
12:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 49:9</span></span>

([Oba 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#005).md). Grape gatherers, yea even
thieves, leave something behind them; but the Chaldeans will sweep
Idumea clean of everything.

[Jeremiah 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 49:10</span></span>

Edom became politically extinct after the time of the Romans.

uncovered his secret places--where he hid himself ([Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008).md) and his treasures ([Isa
45:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003).md). I have caused that nothing
should be so hidden as that the conqueror should not find it.

brethren--Ammon.

neighbours--the Philistines.

[Jeremiah 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 49:11</span></span>

Thy fatherless and widows must rest their hope in God alone, as none of
the adult males shall be left alive, so desperate will be the affairs of
Edom. The verse also, besides this threat, implies a promise of mercy to
Esau in God's good time, as there was to Moab and Ammon ([Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006.md); [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047).md); the extinction of the adult
males is the prominent idea (compare [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 49:12</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md), [Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029).md).

they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup--the Jews to whom, by
virtue of the covenant relation, it did not belong to drink the cup. It
might have been expected that they would be spared. He regards not the
merits of the Jews, for they were as bad or worse than others: but the
grace and adoption of God; it is just and natural ("judgment") that God
should pardon His sons sooner than aliens \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 49:13</span></span>

Bozrah--(See on [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 49:14</span></span>

([Oba 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#001).md).

ambassador . . . unto the heathen--a messenger from God to stir up the
Chaldeans against Edom.

[Jeremiah 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 49:15</span></span>

David and Joab had already humbled Edom ([Sa2
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 49:16</span></span>

terribleness--the terror which thou didst inspire into others.

deceived thee--rendered thee proudly confident, as if none would dare to
assail thee.

dwellest in . . . rock--Petra, the chief of Idumea, was cut in the
rocks; its ruins are very remarkable. The whole south of Idumea abounds
in cave dwellings and rocks.

though . . . nest . . . eagle-- ([Job
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#027.md); [Oba
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003).md). The eagle builds its nest in
the highest craggy eyry.

[Jeremiah 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 49:17</span></span>

(Compare [Kg1 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 49:18</span></span>

([Jer 50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md); [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); [Amo
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#011).md).

no man shall abide there--that is, of the Idumeans. The Romans had a
garrison there.

[Jeremiah 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 49:19</span></span>

he--Nebuchadnezzar, or Nebuzara-dan; the name would at once suggest
itself to the minds of the hearers ([Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040.md); [Jer
46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018).md).

swelling--as a lion which the overflow of the Jordan forced out of his
lair on the banks, to ascend the neighboring heights \[CALVIN\]. See as
to the translation, "pride of the Jordan," see on [Jer
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005.md).

habitation of . . . strong--the fastnesses of Idumea (compare [Num
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021).md). MAURER translates, "An ever
verdant (literally, 'perennial') pasturage," that is, Idumea heretofore
having enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity; so in [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md) the image is retained, the
Idumeans being compared to "a flock," and their king to "a shepherd," in
this verse, and the enemy to "a lion" (compare [Jer
50:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017).md). English Version accords
more with the Hebrew.

suddenly--"in the twinkling of an eye," as the Hebrew implies.

. . . her--I will make Nebuzara-dan enter Idumea, and then, having in
the twinkling of an eye effected the conquest, go away speedily:
elsewhere. Instead of "but," translate, "for." GROTIUS translates, "run
upon her," or "to her," instead of "run away from her." MAURER
understands it, "I will make him (the Idumean) run away from her" (that
is, from his own land); the similar change of reference of the pronouns
([Jer 50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044).md) favors this.

who is a chosen man, &c.--God calls the choicest warriors to Him, to set
"over" the work of devastating Idumea. God will surely execute His
purpose, for He can call forth from all sides the agents He chooses.

who is like me?-- ([Exo 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011).md).

who will appoint me the time?--namely, for entering into a trial in
judgment with Me (see Margin). Image from law courts ([Job
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019).md).

shepherd--leader of the Idumeans; following up the previous image, "a
lion"; no Idumean shepherd shall withstand the lion sent by Jehovah
([Job 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#010).md), or save the Idumean
flock.

[Jeremiah 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 49:20</span></span>

least of the flock--the weakest and humblest of the Chaldean host.
Compare [Jer 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md), where the hostile
leaders and their hosts are called "shepherds and their flocks."

draw . . . out--"shall drag them away captive" \[GROTIUS\]; shall drag
them to and fro, as a lion ([Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).md) does feeble sheep \[MAURER\].

with them--that is, the habitation which they possess.

[Jeremiah 49:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 49:21</span></span>

was heard in--that is, shall be heard at.

Red Sea--a considerable distance from Idumea; though the district at the
Elantic bay of the Red Sea originally belonged to Idumea, and the sea
itself was called from Edom, that is, "red" ([Gen
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030), Margin.md). Others translate, "the
weedy sea" (Margin), and derive the name, "Red Sea," from its red weeds;
the former view is preferable.

[Jeremiah 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 49:22</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 48:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040).md).

Bozrah--(See on [Jer 48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 49:23</span></span>

Prophecy as to Damascus, &c. ([Isa
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#001.md); [Isa
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#009).md). The kingdom of Damascus was
destroyed by Assyria, but the city revived, and it is as to the latter
Jeremiah now prophesies. The fulfilment was probably about five years
after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 10.9,7\].

Hamath is confounded--at the tidings of the overthrow of the neighboring
Damascus.

on the sea--that is, at the sea; the dwellers there are alarmed. Other
manuscripts read, "like the sea." "There is anxiety (restless) as is the
sea: they cannot quiet it," that is, it cannot be quieted ([Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).md).

it--Whatever dwellers are there "cannot be quiet."

[Jeremiah 49:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 49:25</span></span>

city of praise--The prophet, in the person of a citizen of Damascus
deploring its calamity, calls it "the city of praise," that is,
celebrated with praises everywhere for its beauty ([Jer
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#009.md); [Jer
51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041).md). "How is it possible that such
a city has not been left whole--has not been spared by the foe?" Compare
left, [Luk 17:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#035.md). So Israel "left"
standing some of the Canaanite cities ([Jos
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013).md).

of my joy--that is, in which I delighted.

[Jeremiah 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 49:26</span></span>

Therefore--that is, Since Damascus is doomed to fall, therefore, &c.

[Jeremiah 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 49:27</span></span>

palaces of Ben-hadad--that palace from which so many evils and such
cruelty to Israel emanated; thus implying the cause of Damascus'
overthrow. Not the Ben-hadad of [Kg2
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003.md); [Amo
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#004.md); it was a common name of the
Syrian kings (compare [Kg1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018.md);
meaning "son of Hadad," the idol).

[Jeremiah 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 49:28</span></span>

Kedar--son of Ishmael ([Gen 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013).md).
The Kedarenes led a wandering predatory life in Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, as
the Bedouin Arabs ([Ch2 21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md); [Psa
120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005).md). Kedar means "blackness" ([Sol
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005).md).

Hazor--not the city in Palestine, but a district in
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a. "Kingdoms" refer to the several combinations of
clans, each under its own sheik.

men of the east--Kedar and Hazor were east of Judea ([Jdg
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#003.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 49:29</span></span>

tents--in which they dwelt, from which they are called Scenites, that
is, tent dwellers.

curtains--namely, with which the tents were covered ([Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md); [Jer
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#020.md); [Psa
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md).

they shall cry unto them, Fear, &c.--The foe, on crying, Fear . . .,
shall discomfit them (the Kedarenes) by their mere cry.

[Jeremiah 49:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 49:30</span></span>

(See on [Jer 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008).md). No conqueror would
venture to follow them into the desert.

[Jeremiah 49:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 49:31</span></span>

wealthy--rather, "tranquil" ([Ch1
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#040).md).

neither gates nor bars--The Arabs, lying out of the track of the
contending powers of Asia and Africa, took no measures of defense and
had neither walled cities nor gates ([Eze
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011).md). They thought their scanty
resources and wilderness position would tempt no foe.

alone--separated from other nations, without allies; and from one
another scattered asunder. So as to Israel's isolation ([Num
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md); [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 49:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 49:32</span></span>

camels--their chief possessions; not fields or vineyards.

in utmost . . . corners--who seemed least likely to be dispersed. Or
else, "having the hair shaven (or clipped) in angles" ([Jer
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#026.md); [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023).md) \[GROTIUS\].

calamity from all sides--which will force even those in "corners" to
"scatter" themselves.

[Jeremiah 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 49:33</span></span>

([Mal 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 49:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 49:34</span></span>

Elam--part of Susiana, west of Persia proper, but used to designate
Persia in general. Elam proper, or Elymais, nearer Judea than Persia, is
probably here meant; it had helped Nebuchadnezzar against Judea; hence
its punishment. It may have been idolatrous, whereas Persia proper was
mainly monotheistic.

[Jeremiah 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 49:35</span></span>

bow--Elam was famed for its bowmen ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md).

chief of their might--in opposition to "bow," that is, bowmen, who
constituted their main strength.

consumed--as a distinct nation (Dan. 8:2-27). Fulfilled under Alexander
and his successors.

I will show Myself King by My judgments there, as though My tribunal
were erected there. The throne of Cyrus, God's instrument, set up over
Media, of which Elam was a part, may be meant \[GROTIUS\]; or rather,
that of Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010).md).
Then the restoration of Elam ([Jer
49:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#039).md) will refer partly to that which
took place on the reduction of Babylon by Cyrus, prince of Persia and
Media.

latter days--The full restoration belongs to gospel times. Elamites were
among the first who heard and accepted it ([Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).md).

After the predictions of judgment to be inflicted on other nations by
Babylon, follows this one against Babylon itself, the longest prophecy,
consisting of one hundred verses. The date of utterance was the fourth
year of Zedekiah, when Seraiah, to whom it was committed, was sent to
Babylon ([Jer 51:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md). The
repetitions in it make it likely that it consists of prophecies uttered
at different times, now collected by Jeremiah to console the Jews in
exile and to vindicate God's ways by exhibiting the final doom of
Babylon, the enemy of the people of God, after her long prosperity. The
style, imagery, and dialogues prove its genuineness in opposition to
those who deny this. It shows his faithfulness; though under obligation
to the king of Babylon, he owed a higher one to God, who directed him to
prophesy against Babylon.
