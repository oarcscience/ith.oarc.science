CANONICITY AND AUTHORSHIP.--CLEMENT OF ROME, at the end of the first
century (A.D), copiously uses it, adopting its words just as he does
those of the other books of the New Testament; not indeed giving to
either the term "Scripture," which he reserves for the Old Testament
(the canon of the New Testament not yet having been formally
established), but certainly not ranking it below the other New Testament
acknowledged Epistles. As our Epistle claims authority on the part of
the writer, CLEMENT'S adoption of extracts from it is virtually
sanctioning its authority, and this in the apostolic age. JUSTIN MARTYR
quotes it as divinely authoritative, to establish the titles "apostle,"
as well as "angel," as applied to the Son of God. CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
refers it expressly to Paul, on the authority of PantÃ&brvbr;nus, chief
of the Catechetical school in Alexandria, in the middle of the second
century, saying, that as Jesus is termed in it the "apostle" sent to the
Hebrews, Paul, through humility, does not in it call himself apostle of
the Hebrews, being apostle to the Gentiles. CLEMENT also says that Paul,
as the Hebrews were prejudiced against him, prudently omitted to put
forward his name in the beginning; also, that it was originally written
in Hebrew for the Hebrews, and that Luke translated it into Greek for
the Greeks, whence the style is similar to that of Acts. He, however,
quotes frequently the words of the existing Greek Epistle as Paul's
words. ORIGEN similarly quotes it as Paul's Epistle. However, in his
Homilies, he regards the style as distinct from that of Paul, and as
"more Grecian," but the thoughts as the apostle's; adding that the
"ancients who have handed down the tradition of its Pauline authorship,
must have had good reason for doing so, though God alone knows the
certainty who was the actual writer" (that is, probably "transcriber" of
the apostle's thoughts). In the African Church, in the beginning of the
third century, TERTULLIAN ascribes it to Barnabas. IRENÃ†US, bishop of
Lyons, is mentioned in EUSEBIUS, as quoting from this Epistle, though
without expressly referring it to Paul. About the same period, Caius,
the presbyter, in the Church of Rome, mentions only thirteen Epistles of
Paul, whereas, if the Epistle to the Hebrews were included, there would
be fourteen. So the canon fragment of the end of the second century, or
beginning of the third, published by MURATORI, apparently omits
mentioning it. And so the Latin Church did not recognize it as Paul's
till a considerable time after the beginning of the third century. Thus,
also, NOVATIAN OF ROME, CYPRIAN OF CARTHAGE, and VICTORINUS, also of the
Latin Church. But in the fourth century, HILARY OF POITIERS (A.D. 368),
LUCIFER OF CAGLIARI (A.D. 371), AMBROSE OF MILAN (A.D. 397) and other
Latins, quote it as Paul's; and the fifth Council of Carthage (A.D. 419)
formally reckons it among his fourteen Epistles.

As to the similarity of its style to that of Luke's writings, this is
due to his having been so long the companion of Paul. CHRYSOSTOM,
comparing Luke and Mark, says, "Each imitated his teacher: Luke imitated
Paul flowing along with more than river fulness; but Mark imitated
Peter, who studied brevity of style." Besides, there is a greater
predominance of Jewish feeling and familiarity with the peculiarities of
the Jewish schools apparent in this Epistle than in Luke's writings.
There is no clear evidence for attributing the authorship to him, or to
Apollos, whom ALFORD upholds as the author. The grounds alleged for the
latter view are its supposed Alexandrian phraseology and modes of
thought. But these are such as any Palestinian Jew might have used; and
Paul, from his HebrÃ&brvbr;o-Hellenistic education at Jerusalem and
Tarsus, would be familiar with PHILO'S modes of thought, which are not,
as some think, necessarily all derived from his Alexandrian, but also
from his Jewish, education. It would be unlikely that the Alexandrian
Church should have so undoubtingly asserted the Pauline authorship, if
Apollos, their own countryman, had really been the author. The eloquence
of its style and rhetoric, a characteristic of Apollos' at Corinth,
whereas Paul there spoke in words unadorned by man's wisdom, are
doubtless designedly adapted to the minds of those whom Paul in this
Epistle addresses. To the Greek Corinthians, who were in danger of
idolizing human eloquence and wisdom, he writes in an unadorned style,
in order to fix their attention more wholly on the Gospel itself. But
the Hebrews were in no such danger. And his HebrÃ&brvbr;o-Grecian
education would enable him to write in a style attractive to the Hebrews
at Alexandria, where Greek philosophy had been blended with Judaism. The
Septuagint translation framed at Alexandria had formed a connecting link
between the latter and the former; and it is remarkable that all the
quotations from the Old Testament, excepting two ([Heb
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005).md), are taken from the Septuagint.
The fact that the peculiarities of the Septuagint are interwoven into
the argument proves that the Greek Epistle is an original, not a
translation; had the original been Hebrew, the quotations would have
been from the Hebrew Old Testament. The same conclusion follows from the
plays on similarly sounding words in the Greek, and alliterations, and
rhythmically constructed periods. CALVIN observes, If the Epistle had
been written in Hebrew, [Heb 9:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md)
would lose all its point, which consists in the play upon the double
meaning of the Greek "diathece," a "covenant," or a "testament," whereas
the Hebrew "berith" means only "covenant."

Internal evidence favors the Pauline authorship. Thus the topic so fully
handled in this Epistle, that Christianity is superior to Judaism,
inasmuch as the reality exceeds the type which gives place to it, is a
favorite one with Paul (compare [Co2
3:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md); [Gal
3:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md); [Gal
4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md), [Gal
4:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021.md), wherein the allegorical mode
of interpretation appears in its divinely sanctioned application--a mode
pushed to an unwarrantable excess in the Alexandrian school). So the
Divine Son appears in [Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), &c.,
as in other Epistles of Paul ([Phi
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md); [Col
1:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015).md), as the Image, or
manifestation of the Deity. His lowering of Himself for man's sake
similarly, compare [Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009.md), with [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Phi
2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md). Also His final exaltation,
compare [Heb 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md); [Heb
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md); [Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md), with [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md), [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md). The word "Mediator" is peculiar
to Paul alone, compare [Heb 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006.md), with
[Gal 3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md). Christ's death is
represented as the sacrifice for sin prefigured by the Jewish
sacrifices, compare [Rom 3:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md); [Co1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md), with Heb. 7:1-10:39. The phrase,
"God of Peace," is peculiar to Paul, compare [Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020.md); [Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033.md); [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023.md). Also, compare [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004.md), Margin, [Co1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md). Justification, or "righteousness
by faith." appears in [Heb 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md); [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md), as in [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Rom
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#022.md); [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md); [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md); [Phi
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md). The word of God is the "sword of
the Spirit," compare [Heb 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md), with
[Eph 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md). Inexperienced Christians
are children needing milk, that is, instruction in the elements, whereas
riper Christians, as full-grown men, require strong meat, compare [Heb
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); [Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md), with [Co1
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md); [Co1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md) [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md). Salvation is represented as a
boldness of access to God by Christ, compare [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md), with [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002.md); [Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md); [Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md). Afflictions are a fight, [Heb
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md); compare [Phi
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md); [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md). The Christian life is a race,
[Heb 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001.md); compare [Co1
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Phi
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md). The Jewish ritual is a
service, [Rom 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); compare [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md), [Heb
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006.md). Compare "subject to bondage,"
[Heb 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015.md), with [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md). Other characteristics of Paul's
style appear in this Epistle; namely, a propensity "to go off at a word"
and enter on a long parenthesis suggested by that word, a fondness for
play upon words of similar sound, and a disposition to repeat some
favorite word. Frequent appeals to the Old Testament, and quotations
linked by "and again," compare [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); [Heb
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012.md), with [Rom
15:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md). Also quotations in a peculiar
application, compare [Heb 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008.md), with
[Co1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md). Also the same passage quoted in
a form not agreeing with the Septuagint, and with the addition "saith
the Lord," not found in the Hebrew, in [Heb
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md); [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md).

The supposed Alexandrian (which are rather Philon-like) characteristics
of the Epistle are probably due to the fact that the Hebrews were
generally then imbued with the Alexandrian modes of thought of Philo,
&c., and Paul, without coloring or altering Gospel truth "to the Jews,
became (in style) as a Jew, that he might win the Jews" ([Co1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020).md). This will account for its being
recognized as Paul's Epistle in the Alexandrian and Jerusalem churches
unanimously, to the Hebrews of whom probably it was addressed. Not one
Greek father ascribes the Epistle to any but Paul, whereas in the
Western and Latin churches, which it did not reach for some time, it was
for long doubted, owing to its anonymous form, and generally less
distinctively Pauline style. Their reason for not accepting it as
Paul's, or indeed as canonical, for the first three centuries, was
negative, insufficient evidence for it, not positive evidence against
it. The positive evidence is generally for its Pauline origin. In the
Latin churches, owing to their distance from the churches to whom
belonged the Hebrews addressed, there was no generally received
tradition on the subject. The Epistle was in fact but little known at
all, whence we find it is not mentioned at all in the Canon of Muratori.
When at last, in the fourth century, the Latins found that it was
received as Pauline and canonical on good grounds in the Greek churches,
they universally acknowledged it as such.

The personal notices all favor its Pauline authorship, namely, his
intention to visit those addressed, shortly, along with Timothy, styled
"our brother," [Heb 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md); his being
then in prison, [Heb 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019.md); his
formerly having been imprisoned in Palestine, according to English
Version reading, [Heb 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md); the
salutations transmitted to them from believers of Italy, [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024.md). A reason for not prefixing the
name may be the rhetorical character of the Epistle which led the author
to waive the usual form of epistolary address.

DESIGN.--His aim is to show the superiority of Christianity over
Judaism, in that it was introduced by one far higher than the angels or
Moses, through whom the Jews received the law, and in that its
priesthood and sacrifices are far less perfecting as to salvation than
those of Christ; that He is the substance of which the former are but
the shadow, and that the type necessarily gives place to the antitype;
and that now we no longer are kept at a comparative distance as under
the law, but have freedom of access through the opened veil, that is,
Christ's flesh; hence he warns them of the danger of apostasy, to which
Jewish converts were tempted, when they saw Christians persecuted, while
Judaism was tolerated by the Roman authorities. He infers the
obligations to a life of faith, of which, even in the less perfect Old
Testament dispensation, the Jewish history contained bright examples. He
concludes in the usual Pauline mode, with practical exhortations and
pious prayers for them.

HIS MODE OF ADDRESS is in it hortatory rather than commanding, just as
we might have expected from Paul addressing the Jews. He does not write
to the rulers of the Jewish Christians, for in fact there was no
exclusively Jewish Church; and his Epistle, though primarily addressed
to the Palestinian Jews, was intended to include the Hebrews of all
adjoining churches. He inculcates obedience and respect in relation to
their rulers ([Heb 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md), [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017.md), [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024).md); a tacit obviating of the
objection that he was by writing this Epistle interfering with the
prerogative of Peter the apostle of the circumcision, and James the
bishop of Jerusalem. Hence arises his gentle and delicate mode of
dealing with them ([Heb 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022).md). So far
from being surprised at discrepancy of style between an Epistle to
Hebrews and Epistles to Gentile Christians, it is just what we should
expect. The Holy Spirit guided him to choose means best suited to the
nature of the ends aimed at. WORDSWORTH notices a peculiar Pauline Greek
construction, [Rom 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009.md), literally,
"Let your love be without dissimulation, ye abhorring . . . evil,
cleaving to . . . good," which is found nowhere else save [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md), literally, "Let your
conversation be without covetousness, ye being content with," &c. (a
noun singular feminine nominative absolute, suddenly passing into a
participle masculine nominative plural absolute). So in quoting Old
Testament Scripture, the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews quotes it
as a Jew writing to Jews would, "God spoke to our fathers," not, "it is
written." So [Heb 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018.md), "We trust we
have a good conscience" is an altogether Pauline sentiment ([Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md); [Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md); [Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003).md). Though he has not prefixed his
name, he has given at the close his universal token to identify him,
namely, his apostolic salutation, "Grace be with you all"; this
"salutation with his own hand" he declared ([Th2
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017).md) to be "his token in every
Epistle": so [Co1 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021.md), [Co1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023.md); [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018.md). The same prayer of greeting
closes every one of his Epistles, and is not found in any one of the
Epistles of the other apostles written in Paul's lifetime; but it is
found in the last book of the New Testament Revelation, and subsequently
in the Epistle of CLEMENT OF ROME. This proves that, by whomsoever the
body of the Epistle was committed to writing (whether a mere amanuensis
writing by dictation, or a companion of Paul by the Spirit's gift of
interpreting tongues, [Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md),
transfusing Paul's Spirit-taught sentiments into his own Spirit-guided
diction), Paul at the close sets his seal to the whole as really his,
and sanctioned by him as such. The churches of the East, and Jerusalem,
their center, to which quarter it was first sent, received it as Paul's
from the earliest times according to Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (A.D.
349). JEROME, though bringing with him from Rome the prejudices of the
Latins against the Epistle to the Hebrews, aggravated, doubtless, by its
seeming sanction of the Novatian heresy ([Heb
6:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md), was constrained by the force
of facts to receive it as Paul's, on the almost unanimous testimony of
all Greek Christians from the earliest times; and was probably the main
instrument in correcting the past error of Rome in rejecting it. The
testimony of the Alexandrian Church is peculiarly valuable, for it was
founded by Mark, who was with Paul at Rome in his first confinement,
when this Epistle seems to have been written ([Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010).md), and who possibly was the bearer
of this Epistle, at the same time visiting Colosse on the way to
Jerusalem (where Mark's mother lived), and thence to Alexandria.
Moreover, [Pe2 3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md), written
shortly before Peter's death, and like his first Epistle written by him,
"the apostle of the circumcision," to the "Hebrew" Christians dispersed
in the East, says, "As our beloved brother Paul hath written unto you"
([Pe2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md), that is, to the Hebrews;
also the words added, "As also in all his Epistles" ([Pe2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016).md), distinguish the Epistle to the
Hebrews from the rest; then he further speaks of it as on a level with
"other Scriptures," thus asserting at once its Pauline authorship and
divine inspiration. An interesting illustration of the power of
Christian faith and love; Peter, who had been openly rebuked by Paul
([Gal 2:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#007).md), fully adopted what Paul
wrote; there was no difference in the Gospel of the apostle of the
circumcision and that of the apostle of the uncircumcision. It
strikingly shows God's sovereignty that He chose as the instrument to
confirm the Hebrews, Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles ([Rom
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013).md); and on the other hand, Peter
to open the Gospel door to the Gentiles ([Act
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001), &c..md), though being the apostle
of the Jews; thus perfect unity reigns amidst the diversity of agencies.

Rome, in the person of CLEMENT OF ROME, originally received this
Epistle. Then followed a period in which it ceased to be received by the
Roman churches. Then, in the fourth century, Rome retracted her error. A
plain proof she is not unchangeable or infallible. As far as Rome is
concerned, the Epistle to the Hebrews was not only lost for three
centuries, but never would have been recovered at all but for the
Eastern churches; it is therefore a happy thing for Christendom that
Rome is not the Catholic Church.

It plainly was written before the destruction of Jerusalem, which would
have been mentioned in the Epistle had that event gone before, compare
[Heb 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md); and probably to churches
in which the Jewish members were the more numerous, as those in Judea,
and perhaps Alexandria. In the latter city were the greatest number of
resident Jews next to Jerusalem. In Leontopolis, in Egypt, was another
temple, with the arrangements of which, WIESELER thinks the notices in
this Epistle more nearly corresponded than with those in Jerusalem. It
was from Alexandria that the Epistle appears first to have come to the
knowledge of Christendom. Moreover, "the Epistle to the Alexandrians,"
mentioned in the Canon of Muratori, may possibly be this Epistle to the
Hebrews. He addresses the Jews as peculiarly "the people of God" ([Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md); [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md); [Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012).md), "the seed of Abraham," that
is, as the primary stock on which Gentile believers are grafted, to
which [Rom 11:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md) corresponds; but
he urges them to come out of the carnal earthly Jerusalem and to realize
their spiritual union to "the heavenly Jerusalem" ([Heb
12:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018.md); [Heb
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013).md).

The use of Greek rather than Hebrew is doubtless due to the Epistle
being intended, not merely for the Hebrew, but for the Hellenistic Jew
converts, not only in Palestine, but elsewhere; a view confirmed by the
use of the Septuagint. BENGEL thinks, probably (compare [Pe2
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015), explained above.md), the Jews
primarily, though not exclusively, addressed, were those who had left
Jerusalem on account of the war and were settled in Asia Minor.

The notion of its having been originally in Hebrew arose probably from
its Hebrew tone, method, and topics. It is reckoned among the Epistles,
not at first generally acknowledged, along with James, Second Peter,
Second and Third John, Jude, and Revelation. A beautiful link exists
between these Epistles and the universally acknowledged Epistles.
Hebrews unites the ordinances of Leviticus with their antitypical Gospel
fulfilment. James is the link between the highest doctrines of
Christianity and the universal law of moral duty--a commentary on the
Sermon on the Mount--harmonizing the decalogue law of Moses, and the
revelation to Job and Elias, with the Christian law of liberty. Second
Peter links the teaching of Peter with that of Paul. Jude links the
earliest unwritten to the latest written Revelation. The two shorter
Epistles to John, like Philemon, apply Christianity to the minute
details of the Christian life, showing that Christianity can sanctify
all earthly relations.
