### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 11:1</span></span>

JOAB BESIEGES RABBAH. ([Sa2 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#001).md)

at the time when kings go forth to battle--The return of spring was the
usual time of commencing military operations. This expedition took place
the year following the war against the Syrians; and it was entered upon
because the disaster of the former campaign having fallen chiefly upon
the Syrian mercenaries, the Ammonites had not been punished for their
insult to the ambassadors.

David sent Joab and his servants . . . they destroyed the children of
Ammon--The powerful army that Joab commanded ravaged the Ammonite
country and committed great havoc both on the people and their property,
until having reached the capital, they besieged Rabbah-- Rabbah denotes
a great city. This metropolis of the Ammonites was situated in the
mountainous tract of Gilead, not far from the source of the Arnon.
Extensive ruins are still found on its site.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 11:2</span></span>

DAVID COMMITS ADULTERY WITH BATH-SHEBA. ([Sa2
11:2-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002).md)

it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his
bed--The Hebrews, like other Orientals, rose at daybreak, and always
took a nap during the heat of the day. Afterwards they lounged in the
cool of the evening on their flat-roofed terraces. It is probable that
David had ascended to enjoy the open-air refreshment earlier than usual.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 11:3</span></span>

one said--literally, "he said to himself,"

Is not this Bath-sheba? &c.--She seems to have been a celebrated beauty,
whose renown had already reached the ears of David, as happens in the
East, from reports carried by the women from harem to harem.

Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam--or Ammiel ([Ch1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005).md), one of David's worthies ([Sa2
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#034).md), and son of Ahithophel.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 11:4</span></span>

David sent messengers, and took her--The despotic kings of the East,
when they take a fancy for a woman, send an officer to the house were
she lives, who announces it to be the royal pleasure she should remove
to the palace. An apartment is there assigned to her; and if she is made
queen, the monarch orders the announcement to be made that he has made
choice of her to be queen. Many instances in modern Oriental history
show the ease and despatch with which such secondary marriages are
contracted, and a new beauty added to the royal seraglio. But David had
to make a promise, or rather an express stipulation, to Bath-sheba,
before she complied with the royal will ([Kg1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#013.md), [Kg1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#015.md), [Kg1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#017.md), [Kg1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#028).md); for in addition to her
transcendent beauty, she appears to have been a woman of superior
talents and address in obtaining the object of her ambition; in her
securing that her son should succeed on the throne; in her promptitude
to give notice of her pregnancy; in her activity in defeating Adonijah's
natural expectation of succeeding to the crown; in her dignity as the
king's mother--in all this we see very strong indications of the
ascendency she gained and maintained over David, who, perhaps, had ample
leisure and opportunity to discover the punishment of this unhappy
connection in more ways than one \[TAYLOR, Calmet\].

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 11:5</span></span>

the woman conceived, and sent and told David--Some immediate measures of
concealing their sin were necessary, as well for the king's honor as for
her safety, for death was the punishment of an adulteress ([Lev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#010).md).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 11:8</span></span>

David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house--This sudden recall, the
manner of the king, his frivolous questions ([Sa2
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#007).md), and his urgency for Uriah to
sleep in his own house, probably awakened suspicions of the cause of
this procedure.

there followed him a mess of meat from the king--A portion of meat from
the royal table, sent to one's own house or lodgings, is one of the
greatest compliments which an Eastern prince can pay.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 11:9</span></span>

But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house--It is customary for
servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the
Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have
been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure,
and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose
from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety ([Sa2
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011).md). But, doubtless, the resolution
of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil,
and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 11:14</span></span>

URIAH SLAIN. ([Sa2 11:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#014).md)

David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah . . . Set
ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle--The various arts and
stratagems by which the king tried to cajole Uriah, till at last he
resorted to the horrid crime of murder--the cold-blooded cruelty of
despatching the letter by the hands of the gallant but much-wronged
soldier himself, the enlistment of Joab to be a partaker of his sin, the
heartless affectation of mourning, and the indecent haste of his
marriage with Bath-sheba--have left an indelible stain upon the
character of David, and exhibit a painfully humiliating proof of the
awful lengths to which the best of men may go when they forfeit the
restraining grace of God.
