### [Psalms Chapter 105](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 105:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 105:1</span></span>

After an exhortation to praise God, addressed especially to the chosen
people, the writer presents the special reason for praise, in a summary
of their history from the calling of Abraham to their settlement in
Canaan, and reminds them that their obedience was the end of all God's
gracious dealings. (Psa. 105:1-45)

call . . . name-- ([Psa 79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md); [Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013).md). Call on Him, according to His
historically manifested glory. After the example of Abraham, who, as
often as God acquired for Himself a name in guiding him, called in
solemn worship upon the name of the Lord ([Gen
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#008.md); [Gen
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#004).md).

among the people--or, "peoples" ([Psa
18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049).md).

deeds--or, "wonders" ([Psa 103:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 105:3</span></span>

Seeking God's favor is the only true mode of getting true happiness, and
His strength \[[Psa 105:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#004.md)\] is the
only true source of protection (compare [Psa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#011.md); [Psa
40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016).md).

Glory . . . name--boast in His perfections. The world glories in its
horses and chariots against the Church of God lying in the dust; but our
hope is in the name, that is, the power and love of God to His people,
manifested in past deliverances.

[Psalms 105:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 105:5</span></span>

judgments . . . mouth--His judicial decisions for the good and against
the wicked.

[Psalms 105:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 105:6</span></span>

chosen--rather qualifies "children" than "Jacob," as a plural.

[Psalms 105:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 105:7</span></span>

Rather, "He, Jehovah, is our God." His title, "JEHOVAH," implies that
He, the unchangeable, self-existing Being, makes things to be, that is,
fulfils His promises, and therefore will not forsake His people. Though
specially of His people, He is God over all.

[Psalms 105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 105:8</span></span>

The covenant was often ratified.

word--answering to "covenant" \[[Psa
105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md)\] in the parallel clause,
namely, the word of promise, which, according to [Psa
105:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010.md), He set forth for an inviolable
law.

commanded--or, "ordained" ([Psa
68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028).md).

to a thousand generations--perpetually. A verbal allusion to [Deu
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009.md) (compare [Exo
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 105:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 105:9</span></span>

Which covenant--or, "Word" ([Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 105:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 105:10</span></span>

Alluding to God's promise to Jacob ([Gen
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013).md). Out of the whole storehouse of
the promises of God, only one is prominently brought forward, namely,
that concerning the possession of Canaan \[[Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011.md)\]. Everything revolves around
this. The wonders and judgments have all for their ultimate design the
fulfilment of this promise.

[Psalms 105:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 105:12</span></span>

few . . . in number--alluding to Jacob's words ([Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030).md), "I being few in number."

yea, very few--literally, "as a few," that is, like fewness itself
(compare [Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009).md).

strangers--sojourners in the land of their future inheritance, as in a
strange country ([Heb 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 105:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 105:13</span></span>

from one nation to another--and so from danger to danger; now in Egypt,
now in the wilderness, and lastly in Canaan. Though a few strangers,
wandering among various nations, God protected them.

[Psalms 105:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 105:14</span></span>

reproved kings--Pharaoh of Egypt and Abimelech of Gerar ([Gen
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md); [Gen
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 105:15</span></span>

Touch not--referring to [Gen 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#011.md),
where Abimelech says of Isaac, "He that toucheth this man or his wife
shall surely be put to death."

mine anointed--as specially consecrated to Me ([Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).md). The patriarch was the prophet,
priest, and king of his family.

my prophets--in a similar sense, compare [Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md). The "anointed" are those vessels
of God, consecrated to His service, "in whom (as Pharaoh said of Joseph,
[Gen 41:38](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#038).md) the Spirit of God is"
\[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Psalms 105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 105:16</span></span>

God ordered the famine. God

called for a famine--as if it were a servant, ready to come at God's
bidding. Compare the centurion's words, as to disease being God's
servant ([Mat 8:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008).md).

upon the land--namely, Canaan ([Gen
41:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#054).md).

staff of bread--what supports life ([Lev
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md); [Psa
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md); [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 105:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 105:17</span></span>

Joseph was sent of God ([Gen 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 105:18</span></span>

hurt with fetters-- ([Gen 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#003).md).

was laid in iron--literally, "his soul" (see on [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).md), or, "he came into iron," or,
he was bound to his grief (compare [Psa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md); [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001).md). The "soul" is put for the whole
person, because the soul of the captive suffers still more than the
body. Joseph is referred to as being an appropriate type of those "bound
in affliction and iron" ([Psa 107:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 105:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 105:19</span></span>

his word came--His prophecy ([Gen
41:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#011).md) to the officers came to
pass, or was fulfilled ([Jdg 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#012.md),
[Jdg 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md); [Sa1
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#006), explain the form of speech.md).

the word of the Lord--or, "saying," or "decree of the Lord."

tried him--or, "proved him," by the afflictions it appointed him to
endure before his elevation (compare [Gen
41:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040).md).

[Psalms 105:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 105:22</span></span>

To bind--Not literally bind; but exercise over them absolute control, as
the parallel in the second clause shows; also [Gen
41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md), [Gen
41:44](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#044.md), in which not literal fettering,
but commanding obedience, is spoken of. It refers to [Psa
105:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#018.md). The soul that was once bound
itself now binds others, even princes. The same moral binding is
assigned to the saints ([Psa 149:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#008).md).

teach . . . senators wisdom--the ground of his exaltation by Pharaoh was
his wisdom ([Gen 41:39](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#039).md); namely, in
state policy, and ordering well a kingdom.

[Psalms 105:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 105:23</span></span>

Israel . . . and Jacob--that is, Jacob himself is meant, as [Psa
105:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#024.md) speaks of "his people." Still,
he came with his whole house ([Gen
46:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#006).md).

sojourned-- ([Gen 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#004).md).

land of Ham--or, Egypt ([Psa 78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051).md).

[Psalms 105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 105:25</span></span>

turned their heart--God controls men's free acts (compare [Sa1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009).md). "When Saul had turned his back
to go from (God's prophet) Samuel, God turned (Margin) him another
heart" (see [Exo 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008), &c..md). Whatever
evil the wicked man plots against God's people, God holds bound even his
heart, so as not to lay a single plan except what God permits. Thus
Isaiah ([Isa 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017).md) says it was God
who brought forth the army of Pharaoh to pursue Israel to their own
destruction ([Exo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#021.md); [Exo
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 105:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 105:26</span></span>

Moses . . . chosen--both what they were by divine choice ([Psa
78:70](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#070).md).

[Psalms 105:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 105:27</span></span>

signs--literally, "words of signs," or rather, as "words" in Hebrew
means "things," "things of His signs," that is, His marvellous tokens of
power ([Psa 145:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#005), Margin.md). Compare
the same Hebraism ([Psa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#003), Margin.md).

[Psalms 105:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 105:28</span></span>

The ninth plague is made prominent as peculiarly wonderful.

they rebelled not--Moses and Aaron promptly obeyed God ([Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md); (compare Exo. 7:1-11:10 and
[Psa 78:44-51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#044.md), with which this summary
substantially agrees). Or, rather, the "darkness" here is figurative
([Jer 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016).md), the literal plague of
darkness ([Exo 10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#022).md) being only
alluded to as the symbol of God's wrath which overhung Egypt as a dark
cloud during all the plagues. Hence, it is placed first, out of the
historical order. Thus, "They rebelled not (that is, no longer) against
His word," refers to the Egyptians. Whenever God sent a plague on them,
they were ready to let Israel go, though refusing when the plague
ceased.

his word--His command to let Israel go \[HENGSTENBERG\]. Of the ten
plagues, only eight are mentioned, the fifth, the murrain of beasts, and
the sixth, the boils, being omitted.

[Psalms 105:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 105:29</span></span>

He deprived them of their favorite "fish," and gave them instead, \[[Psa
105:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#030.md)\] out of the water, loathsome
"frogs," and ([Psa 105:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#031).md) upon their
land tormenting "flies" (the dog-fly, according to MAURER) and "lice"
(gnats, according to HENGSTENBERG).

[Psalms 105:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 105:32</span></span>

gave them--referring to [Lev 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md), "I
give you rain in due season." His "gift" to Israel's foes is one of a
very different kind from that bestowed on His people.

hail for rain--instead of fertilizing showers, hail destructive to
trees. This forms the transition to the vegetable kingdom. The locusts
in [Psa 105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034.md) similarly are
destructive to plants.

[Psalms 105:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 105:33</span></span>

their coasts--all their land ([Psa
78:54](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054).md).

[Psalms 105:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 105:34</span></span>

caterpillars--literally, "the lickers up," devouring insects; probably
the hairy-winged locust.

[Psalms 105:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 105:36</span></span>

the chief--literally, "the firstlings." The ascending climax passes from
the food of man to man himself. The language here is quoted from [Psa
78:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#051.md).

[Psalms 105:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 105:37</span></span>

with silver and gold--presented them by the Egyptians, as an
acknowledgment due for their labors in their bondage (compare [Exo
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#035).md).

one feeble person--or, "stumbler," unfit for the line of march. Compare
"harnessed," that is, accoutred and marshalled as an army on march ([Exo
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018.md); [Isa
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027).md).

[Psalms 105:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 105:38</span></span>

(Compare [Exo 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#033.md); [Deu
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#025).md).

[Psalms 105:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 105:39</span></span>

covering--in sense of protection (compare [Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md); [Num
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#034).md). In the burning sands of the
desert the cloud protected the congregation from the heat of the sun; an
emblem of God's protecting favor of His people, as interpreted by Isaiah
([Isa 4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); compare [Num
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#016).md).

[Psalms 105:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 105:42</span></span>

The reasons for these dealings: (1) God's faithfulness to His covenant,
"His holy promise" of Canaan, is the fountain whence flowed so many acts
of marvellous kindness to His people (compare [Psa
105:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#008.md), [Psa
105:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#011).md). [Exo
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#024.md) is the fundamental passage
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. (2) That they might be obedient. The observance of
God's commands by Abraham was the object of the covenant with him ([Gen
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019).md), as it was also the object of
the covenant with Israel, that they might observe God's statutes.

remembered . . . and Abraham--or, "remembered His holy word (that is,
covenant confirmed) with Abraham."

[Psalms 105:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 105:44</span></span>

inherited the labour--that is, the fruits of their labor; their corn and
vineyards ([Jos 21:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#043).md).
