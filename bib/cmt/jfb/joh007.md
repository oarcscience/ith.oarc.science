### [John Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001)

[John 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 7:1</span></span>

CHRIST AT THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES. (John 7:1-53)

After these things--that is, all that is recorded after [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018).

walked in Galilee--continuing His labors there, instead of going to
Judea, as might have been expected.

sought to kill him--referring back to [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018). Hence it appears that our Lord
did not attend the Passover mentioned in [Joh
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#004) --being the third since His
ministry began, if the feast mentioned in [Joh
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001) was a Passover.

[John 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 7:2</span></span>

feast of tabernacles . . . at hand--This was the last of the three
annual festivals, celebrated on the fifteenth of the seventh month
(September). (See [Lev 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#033), &c.;
[Deu 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#013), &c.; [Neh
8:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#014)).

[John 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 7:3</span></span>

His brethren said--(See on [Mat
13:54-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054)).

Depart . . . into Judea, &c.--In [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005) this speech is ascribed to their
unbelief. But as they were in the "upper room" among the one hundred and
twenty disciples who waited for the descent of the Spirit after the
Lord's ascension ([Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014)), they
seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps after His
resurrection. Indeed here their language is more that of strong
prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the best, too
frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief. There was also,
probably, a tincture of vanity in it. "Thou hast many disciples in
Judea; here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one
who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the
city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David'
is to be set up: 'seeking,' as Thou dost, 'to be known openly,' those
miracles of Thine ought not to be confined to this distant corner, but
submitted at headquarters to the inspection of 'the world.'" (See [Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008), "I am become a stranger to my
brethren, an alien unto my mother's children!")

[John 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 7:6</span></span>

My time is not yet come--that is, for showing Himself to the world.

your time is always ready--that is "It matters little when we go up, for
ye have no great plans in life, and nothing hangs upon your movements.
With Me it is otherwise; on every movement of Mine there hangs what ye
know not. The world has no quarrel with you, for ye bear no testimony
against it, and so draw down upon yourselves none of its wrath; but I am
here to lift up My voice against its hypocrisy, and denounce its
abominations; therefore it cannot endure Me, and one false step might
precipitate its fury on its Victim's head before the time. Away,
therefore, to the feast as soon as it suits you; I follow at the fitting
moment, but 'My time is not yet full come.'"

[John 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 7:10</span></span>

then went he . . . not openly--not "in the (caravan) company" \[MEYER\].
See on [Luk 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044).

as it were in secret--rather, "in a manner secretly"; perhaps by some
other route, and in a way not to attract notice.

[John 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 7:11</span></span>

Jews--the rulers.

sought him--for no good end.

Where is He?--He had not been at Jerusalem for probably a year and a
half.

[John 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 7:12</span></span>

much murmuring--buzzing.

among the people--the multitudes; the natural expression of a Jewish
writer, indicating without design the crowded state of Jerusalem at this
festival \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

a good man . . . Nay . . . deceiveth the people--the two opposite views
of His claims, that they were honest, and that they were an imposture.

[John 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 7:13</span></span>

none spake openly of him--that is, in His favor, "for fear of the
\[ruling\] Jews."

[John 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 7:14</span></span>

about the midst of the feast--the fourth or fifth day of the eight,
during which it lasted.

went up into the temple and taught--The word denotes formal and
continuous teaching, as distinguished from mere casual sayings. This was
probably the first time that He did so thus openly in Jerusalem. He had
kept back till the feast was half through, to let the stir about Him
subside, and entering the city unexpectedly, had begun His "teaching" at
the temple, and created a certain awe, before the wrath of the rulers
had time to break it.

[John 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 7:15</span></span>

How knoweth . . . letters--learning ([Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024)).

having never learned--at any rabbinical school, as Paul under Gamaliel.
These rulers knew well enough that He had not studied under any human
teacher--an important admission against ancient and modern attempts to
trace our Lord's wisdom to human sources \[MEYER\]. Probably His
teaching on this occasion was expository, manifesting that unrivalled
faculty and depth which in the Sermon on the Mount had excited the
astonishment of all.

[John 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 7:16</span></span>

doctrine . . . not mine, &c.--that is, from Myself unauthorized; I am
here by commission.

[John 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 7:17</span></span>

If any man will do his will, &c.--"is willing," or "wishes to do."

whether . . . of God, or . . . of myself--from above or from beneath; is
divine or an imposture of Mine. A principle of immense importance,
showing, on the one hand, that singleness of desire to please God is the
grand inlet to light on all questions vitally affecting one's eternal
interests, and on the other, that the want of his, whether perceived or
not, is the chief cause of infidelity amidst the light of revealed
religion.

[John 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 7:18</span></span>

seeketh his own glory--(See on [Joh
5:41-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041)).

[John 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 7:19</span></span>

Did not Moses, &c.--that is, In opposing Me ye pretend zeal for Moses,
but to the spirit and end of that law which he gave ye are total
strangers, and in "going about to kill Me" ye are its greatest enemies.

[John 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 7:20</span></span>

The people answered, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill
thee?--This was said by the multitude, who as yet had no bad feeling to
Jesus, and were not in the secret of the plot hatching, as our Lord
knew, against Him.

[John 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 7:21</span></span>

I have done one work, &c.--Taking no notice of the popular appeal, as
there were those there who knew well enough what He meant, He recalls
His cure of the impotent man, and the murderous rage it had kindled
([Joh 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009), [Joh
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016), [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018)). It may seem strange that He
should refer to an event a year and a half old, as if but newly done.
But their present attempt "to kill Him" brought up the past scene
vividly, not only to Him, but without doubt to them, too, if indeed they
had ever forgotten it; and by this fearless reference to it, exposing
their hypocrisy and dark designs, He gave His position great moral
strength.

[John 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 7:22</span></span>

Moses . . . gave unto you circumcision, &c.--Though servile work was
forbidden on the sabbath, the circumcision of males on that day (which
certainly was a servile work) was counted no infringement of the Law.
How much less ought fault to be found with One who had made a man "every
whit whole"--or rather, "a man's entire body whole"--on the sabbath-day?
What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none daring to meet the
bold appeal.

[John 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 7:24</span></span>

Judge not, &c.--that is, Rise above the letter into the spirit of the
law.

[John 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 7:25</span></span>

some of them of Jerusalem--the citizens, who, knowing the long-formed
purpose of the rulers to put Jesus to death, wondered that they were now
letting Him teach openly.

[John 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 7:26</span></span>

Do the rulers know, &c.--Have they got some new light in favor of His
claims?

[John 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 7:27</span></span>

Howbeit we know this man, &c.--This seems to refer to some current
opinion that Messiah's origin would be mysterious (not altogether
wrong), from which they concluded that Jesus could not be He, since they
knew all about His family at Nazareth.

[John 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 7:28</span></span>

cried Jesus--in a louder tone, and more solemn, witnessing style than
usual.

Ye both, &c.--that is, "Yes, ye know both Myself and My local parentage,
and (yet) I am not come of Myself."

but he that sent me is true, &c.--Probably the meaning is, "He that sent
Me is the only real Sender of any one."

[John 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 7:30</span></span>

sought to take . . . none laid hands--their impotence being equal to
their malignity.

[John 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 7:31</span></span>

When Christ cometh, will he, &c.--that is, If this be not the Christ,
what can the Christ do, when He does come, which has not been
anticipated and eclipsed by this man? This was evidently the language of
friendly persons, overborne by their spiteful superiors, but unable to
keep quite silent.

[John 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 7:32</span></span>

heard that the people murmured--that mutterings to this effect were
going about, and thought it high time to stop Him if He was not to be
allowed to carry away the people.

[John 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 7:33</span></span>

Yet a little while, &c.--that is, "Your desire to be rid of Me will be
for you all too soon fulfilled. Yet a little while and we part
company--for ever; for I go whither ye cannot come: nor, even when ye at
length seek Him whom ye now despise, shall ye be able to find
Him"--referring not to any penitential, but to purely selfish cries in
their time of desperation.

[John 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 7:35</span></span>

Whither will he go, &c.--They cannot comprehend Him, but seem awed by
the solemn grandeur of His warning. He takes no notice, however, of
their questions.

[John 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 7:37</span></span>

the last day, that great day of the feast--the eighth ([Lev
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#039)). It was a sabbath, the last
feast day of the year, and distinguished by very remarkable ceremonies.
"The generally joyous character of this feast broke out on this day into
loud jubilation, particularly at the solemn moment when the priest, as
was done on every day of this festival, brought forth, in golden
vessels, water from the stream of Siloah, which flowed under the
temple-mountain, and solemnly poured it upon the altar. Then the words
of [Isa 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003) were sung, With joy shall
ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation, and thus the symbolical
reference of this act, intimated in [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039), was expressed" \[OLSHAUSEN\]. So
ecstatic was the joy with which this ceremony was performed--accompanied
with sound of trumpets--that it used to be said, "Whoever had not
witnessed it had never seen rejoicing at all" \[LIGHTFOOT\].

Jesus stood--On this high occasion, then, He who had already drawn all
eyes upon Him by His supernatural power and unrivalled teaching--"JESUS
stood," probably in some elevated position.

and cried--as if making proclamation in the audience of all the people.

If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink!--What an offer! The
deepest cravings of the human spirit are here, as in the Old Testament,
expressed by the figure of "thirst," and the eternal satisfaction of
them by "drinking." To the woman of Samaria He had said almost the same
thing, and in the same terms ([Joh
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013)). But what to her was simply
affirmed to her as a fact, is here turned into a world-wide
proclamation; and whereas there, the gift by Him of the living water is
the most prominent idea--in contrast with her hesitation to give Him the
perishable water of Jacob's well--here, the prominence is given to
Himself as the Well spring of all satisfaction. He had in Galilee
invited all the WEARY AND HEAVY-LADEN of the human family to come under
His wing and they should find REST ([Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)), which is just the same deep
want, and the same profound relief of it, under another and equally
grateful figure. He had in the synagogue of Capernaum ([Joh
6:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#036)) announced Himself, in every
variety of form, as "the BREAD of Life," and as both able and authorized
to appease the "HUNGER," and quench the "THIRST," of all that apply to
Him. There is, and there can be, nothing beyond that here. But what was
on all those occasions uttered in private, or addressed to a provincial
audience, is here sounded forth in the streets of the great religious
metropolis, and in language of surpassing majesty, simplicity, and
grace. It is just Jehovah's ancient proclamation now sounding forth
through human flesh, "HO, EVERY ONE THAT THIRSTETH, COME YE TO THE
WATERS, AND HE THAT HATH NO MONEY!" &c. ([Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)). In this light we have but two
alternatives; either to say with Caiaphas of Him that uttered such
words, "He is guilty of death," or falling down before Him to exclaim
with Thomas, " MY LORD AND MY GOD!"

[John 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 7:38</span></span>

as the scripture hath said--These words belong to what follows, "Out of
his belly, as the scripture hath said, shall flow," &c. referring not to
any particular passage, but to such as [Isa
58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011); [Joe
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008); [Eze
47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001); in most of which the idea is
that of waters issuing from beneath the temple, to which our Lord
compares Himself and those who believe in Him.

out of his belly--that is, his inner man, his soul, as in [Pro
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#027).

rivers of living water--(See on [Joh
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013)). It refers primarily to the
copiousness, but indirectly also to the diffusiveness, of this living
water to the good of others.

[John 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 7:39</span></span>

this spake he of the Spirit--who, by His direct personal agency, opens
up this spring of living waters in the human spirit ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)), and by His indwelling in the
renewed soul ensures their unfailing flow.

they that believe, &c.--As the Holy Ghost is, in the redemption of man,
entirely at the service of Christ, as His Agent, so it is only in
believing connection with Christ that any one "receives" the Spirit.

for the Holy Ghost was not yet given--Beyond all doubt the word "given,"
or some similar word, is the right supplement. In [Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007) the Holy Ghost is represented not
only as the gift of Christ, but a gift the communication of which was
dependent upon His own departure to the Father. Now as Christ was not
yet gone, so the Holy Ghost was not yet given.

Jesus not yet glorified--The word "glorified" is here used advisedly, to
teach the reader not only that the departure of Christ to the Father was
indispensable to the giving of the Spirit, but that this illustrious
Gift, direct from the hands of the ascended Saviour, was God's
intimation to the world that He whom it had cast out, crucified, and
slain, was "His Elect, in whom His soul delighted," and that it was
through the smiting of that Rock that the waters of the Spirit--for
which the Church was waiting, and with pomp at the feast of tabernacles
proclaiming its expectation--had gushed forth upon a thirsty world.

[John 7:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 7:40</span></span>

Many . . . when they heard this . . . said, Of a truth, &c.--The only
wonder is they did not all say it. "But their minds were blinded."

[John 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 7:41</span></span>

Others said, This is the Christ--(See on [Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)).

Shall Christ come out of Galilee?

[John 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#042)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 7:42</span></span>

scripture said . . . of the seed of David, and out of . . . Bethlehem,
&c.--We accept this spontaneous testimony to our David-descended,
Bethlehem-born Saviour. Had those who gave it made the inquiry which the
case demanded, they would have found that Jesus "came out of Galilee"
([Joh 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#041)) and "out of Bethlehem"
both, alike in fulfilment of prophecy as in point of fact. ([Mat
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#023); [Mat
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013)).

[John 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 7:44</span></span>

would have taken him; but, &c.--(See on [Joh
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#030)).

[John 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 7:45</span></span>

Then came the officers--"sent to take him" ([Joh
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#032)).

Why . . . not brought him?--already thirsting for their Victim, and
thinking it an easy matter to seize and bring Him.

[John 7:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 7:46</span></span>

Never man spake like this man--Noble testimony of unsophisticated men!
Doubtless they were strangers to the profound intent of Christ's
teaching, but there was that in it which by its mysterious grandeur and
transparent purity and grace, held them spellbound. No doubt it was of
God that they should so feel, that their arm might be paralyzed, as
Christ's hour was not yet come; but even in human teaching there has
sometimes been felt such a divine power, that men who came to kill them
(for example, ROWLAND HISS) have confessed to all that they were
unmanned.

[John 7:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 7:47</span></span>

ye also deceived--In their own servants this seemed intolerable.

[John 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 7:48</span></span>

any of the rulers or . . . Pharisees believed--"Many of them" did,
including Nicodemus and Joseph, but not one of these had openly
"confessed Him" ([Joh 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#042)), and this
appeal must have stung such of them as heard it to the quick.

[John 7:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 7:49</span></span>

But this people--literally, "multitude," meaning the ignorant rabble.
(Pity these important distinctions, so marked in the original of this
Gospel, should not be also in our version.)

knoweth not the law--that is, by school learning, which only subverted
it by human traditions.

are cursed--a cursed set (a kind of swearing at them, out of mingled
rage and scorn).

[John 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 7:50</span></span>

Nicodemus--reappearing to us after nearly three years' absence from the
history, as a member of the council, probably then sitting.

[John 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 7:51</span></span>

Doth our law, &c.--a very proper, but all too tame rejoinder, and
evidently more from pressure of conscience than any design to pronounce
positively in the case. "The feebleness of his defense of Jesus has a
strong contrast in the fierceness of the rejoinders of the Pharisees"
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[John 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">joh 7:52</span></span>

thou of Galilee--in this taunt expressing their scorn of the party. Even
a word of caution, or the gentlest proposal to inquire before
condemning, was with them equivalent to an espousal of the hated One.

Search . . . out of Galilee . . . no prophet--Strange! For had not Jonah
(of Gath-hepher) and even Elijah (of Thisbe) arisen out of Galilee? And
there it may be more, of whom we have no record. But rage is blind, and
deep prejudice distorts all facts. Yet it looks as if they were afraid
of losing Nicodemus, when they take the trouble to reason the point at
all. It was just because he had "searched," as they advised him, that he
went the length even that he did.

[John 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">joh 7:53</span></span>

every man went unto his own home--finding their plot could not at that
time be carried into effect. Is your rage thus impotent, ye chief
priests?
