### [Joshua Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)

[Joshua 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 14:1</span></span>

THE NINE TRIBES AND A HALF TO HAVE THEIR INHERITANCE BY LOT. ([Jos
14:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#001))

these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the
land of Canaan--This chapter forms the introduction to an account of the
allocation of the land west of Jordan, or Canaan proper, to the nine
tribes and a half. It was also made by lot in presence of a select
number of superintendents, appointed according to divine directions
given to Moses (see on [Num 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016)). In
everything pertaining to civil government, and even the division of the
land, Joshua was the acknowledged chief. But in a matter to be
determined by lot, a solemn appeal was made to God, and hence Eleazar,
as high priest, is named before Joshua.

[Joshua 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 14:4</span></span>

The children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim--As two and
a half tribes were settled on the east Jordan, and the Levites had no
inheritance assigned them in land, there would have been only eight and
a half tribes to provide for. But Ephraim and Manasseh, the two sons of
Joseph, had been constituted two tribes ([Gen
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005)), and although Levi was excluded,
the original number of the tribes of Israel was still preserved.

[Joshua 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 14:5</span></span>

the children of Israel . . . divided the land--that is, they made the
preliminary arrangements for the work. A considerable time was requisite
for the survey and measurement.

[Joshua 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 14:6</span></span>

CALEB BY PRIVILEGE REQUESTS AND OBTAINS HEBRON. ([Jos
14:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006))

Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb . . .
said--This incident is recorded here because it occurred while the
preparations were being made for casting the lots, which, it appears,
were begun in Gilgal. The claim of Caleb to the mountains of Hebron as
his personal and family possessions was founded on a solemn promise of
Moses, forty-five years before ([Num
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#024); [Deu
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036); [Jos
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#010)), to give him that land on
account of his fidelity. Being one of the nominees appointed to preside
over the division of the country, he might have been charged with using
his powers as a commissioner to his own advantage, had he urged his
request in private; and therefore he took some of his brethren along
with him as witness of the justice and propriety of his conduct.

[Joshua 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 14:12</span></span>

give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day--this highland
region.

for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there--The report of
the spies, who tried to kindle the flame of sedition and discontent,
related chiefly to the people and condition of this mountain district,
and hence it was promised as the reward of Caleb's truth, piety, and
faithfulness.

[Joshua 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 14:13</span></span>

Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb Hebron for an
inheritance--Joshua, who was fully cognizant of all the circumstances,
not only admitted the claim, but in a public and earnest manner prayed
for the divine blessing to succor the efforts of Caleb in driving out
the idolatrous occupiers.

[Joshua 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 14:15</span></span>

Kirjath-arba--that is, the city of Arba, a warrior among the native race
remarkable for strength and stature.

the land had rest from war--Most of the kings having been slain and the
natives dispirited, there was no general or systematic attempt to resist
the progress and settlement of the Israelites.
