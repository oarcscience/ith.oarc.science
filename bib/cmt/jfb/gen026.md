### [Genesis Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001)

[Genesis 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 26:1</span></span>

SOJOURN IN GERAR. (Gen. 26:1-35)

And there was a famine in the land . . . And Isaac went unto . . .
Gerar--The pressure of famine in Canaan forced Isaac with his family and
flocks to migrate into the land of the Philistines, where he was exposed
to personal danger, as his father had been on account of his wife's
beauty; but through the seasonable interposition of Providence, he was
preserved ([Psa 105:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#014)).

[Genesis 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 26:12</span></span>

Then Isaac sowed in that land--During his sojourn in that district he
farmed a piece of land, which, by the blessing of God on his skill and
industry, was very productive ([Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013); [Psa
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#019)); and by his plentiful returns
he increased so rapidly in wealth and influence that the Philistines,
afraid or envious of his prosperity, obliged him to leave the place
([Pro 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004); [Ecc
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004)). This may receive illustration
from the fact that many Syrian shepherds at this day settle for a year
or two in a place, rent some ground, in the produce of which they trade
with the neighboring market, till the owners, through jealousy of their
growing substance, refuse to renew their lease and compel them to remove
elsewhere.

[Genesis 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 26:15</span></span>

all the wells which his father's servants had digged . . . the
Philistines had stopped, &c.--The same base stratagem for annoying those
against whom they have taken an umbrage is practiced still by choking
the wells with sand or stones, or defiling them with putrid carcases.

[Genesis 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 26:17</span></span>

valley of Gerar--torrent-bed or wady, a vast undulating plain,
unoccupied and affording good pasture.

[Genesis 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 26:18</span></span>

Isaac digged again the wells of water--The naming of wells by Abraham,
and the hereditary right of his family to the property, the change of
the names by the Philistines to obliterate the traces of their origin,
the restoration of the names by Isaac, and the contests between the
respective shepherds to the exclusive possession of the water, are
circumstances that occur among the natives in those regions as
frequently in the present day as in the time of Isaac.

[Genesis 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 26:26</span></span>

Then Abimelech went to him--As there was a lapse of ninety years between
the visit of Abraham and of Isaac, the Abimelech and Phichol spoken of
must have been different persons' official titles. Here is another proof
of the promise ([Gen 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002)) being
fulfilled, in an overture of peace being made to him by the king of
Gerar. By whatever motive the proposal was dictated--whether fear of his
growing power, or regret for the bad usage they had given him, the king
and two of his courtiers paid a visit to the tent of Isaac ([Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007)). His timid and passive temper
had submitted to the annoyances of his rude neighbors; but now that they
wish to renew the covenant, he evinces deep feeling at their conduct,
and astonishment at their assurance, or artifice, in coming near him.
Being, however, of a pacific disposition, Isaac forgave their offense,
accepted their proposals, and treated them to the banquet by which the
ratification of a covenant was usually crowned.

[Genesis 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">gen 26:34</span></span>

Esau . . . took to wife--If the pious feelings of Abraham recoiled from
the idea of Isaac forming a matrimonial connection with a Canaanitish
woman \[[Gen 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#003)\], that devout
patriarch himself would be equally opposed to such a union on the part
of his children; and we may easily imagine how much his pious heart was
wounded, and the family peace destroyed, when his favorite but wayward
son brought no less than two idolatrous wives among them--an additional
proof that Esau neither desired the blessing nor dreaded the curse of
God. These wives never gained the affections of his parents, and this
estrangement was overruled by God for keeping the chosen family aloof
from the dangers of heathen influence.
