### [Numbers Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001)

[Numbers 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 23:1</span></span>

BALAK'S SACRIFICES. (Num. 23:1-30)

Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars--Balak, being a
heathen, would naturally suppose these altars were erected in honor of
Baal, the patron deity of his country. It is evident, from [Num
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004) that they were prepared for the
worship of the true God; although in choosing the high places of Baal as
their site and rearing a number of altars ([Kg2
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022); [Isa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008); [Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013); [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011); [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001)), instead of one only, as God had
appointed, Balaam blended his own superstitions with the divine worship.
The heathen, both in ancient and modern times, attached a mysterious
virtue to the number seven; and Balaam, in ordering the preparation of
so many altars, designed to mystify and delude the king.

[Numbers 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 23:3</span></span>

Stand by thy burnt offering--as one in expectation of an important
favor.

peradventure the Lord will come to meet me: and whatsoever he showeth
me--that is, makes known to me by word or sign.

he went to an high place--apart by himself, where he might practise
rites and ceremonies, with a view to obtain a response of the oracle.

[Numbers 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 23:4</span></span>

God met Balaam--not in compliance with his incantations, but to
frustrate his wicked designs and compel him, contrary to his desires and
interests, to pronounce the following benediction \[[Num
23:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008)\].

[Numbers 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 23:7</span></span>

took up his parable--that is, spoke under the influence of inspiration,
and in the highly poetical, figurative, and oracular style of a prophet.

brought me from Aram--This word joined with "the mountains of the East,"
denotes the upper portion of Mesopotamia, lying on the east of Moab. The
East enjoyed an infamous notoriety for magicians and soothsayers ([Isa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006)).

[Numbers 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 23:8</span></span>

How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?--A divine blessing has been
pronounced over the posterity of Jacob; and therefore, whatever
prodigies can be achieved by my charms, all magical skill, all human
power, is utterly impotent to counteract the decree of God.

[Numbers 23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 23:9</span></span>

from the top--literally, "a bare place" on the rocks, to which Balak had
taken him, for it was deemed necessary to see the people who were to be
devoted to destruction. But that commanding prospect could contribute
nothing to the accomplishment of the king's object, for the destiny of
Israel was to be a distinct, peculiar people, separated from the rest of
the nations in government, religion, customs, and divine protection
([Deu 33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028)). So that although I might
be able to gratify your wishes against other people, I can do nothing
against them ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); [Lev
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#024)).

[Numbers 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 23:10</span></span>

Who can count the dust of Jacob?--an Oriental hyperbole for a very
populous nation, as Jacob's posterity was promised to be ([Gen
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016); [Gen
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014)).

the number of the fourth part of Israel--that is, the camp consisted of
four divisions; every one of these parts was formidable in numbers.

Let me die the death of the righteous--Hebrew, "of Jeshurun"; or, the
Israelites. The meaning is: they are a people happy, above all others,
not only in life, but at death, from their knowledge of the true God,
and their hope through His grace. Balaam is a representative of a large
class in the world, who express a wish for the blessedness which Christ
has promised to His people but are averse to imitate the mind that was
in Him.

[Numbers 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 23:13</span></span>

Come, . . . with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see
them--Surprised and disappointed at this unexpected eulogy on Israel,
Balak hoped that, if seen from a different point of observation, the
prophet would give utterance to different feelings; and so, having made
the same solemn preparations, Balaam retired, as before, to wait the
divine afflatus.

[Numbers 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 23:14</span></span>

he brought him into the field of Zophim . . . top of Pisgah--a flat
surface on the summit of the mountain range, which was cultivated land.
Others render it "the field of sentinels," an eminence where some of
Balak's guards were posted to give signals \[CALMET\].

[Numbers 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 23:18</span></span>

Rise up--As Balak was already standing ([Num
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#017)), this expression is equivalent
to "now attend to me." The counsels and promises of God respecting
Israel are unchangeable; and no attempt to prevail on Him to reverse
them will succeed, as they may with a man.

[Numbers 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">num 23:21</span></span>

He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob--Many sins were observed and
punished in this people. But no such universal and hopeless apostasy had
as yet appeared, to induce God to abandon or destroy them.

the Lord his God is with him--has a favor for them.

and the shout of a king is among them--such joyful acclamations as of a
people rejoicing in the presence of a victorious prince.

[Numbers 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">num 23:22</span></span>

he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn--Israel is not as they
were at the Exodus, a horde of poor, feeble, spiritless people, but
powerful and invincible as a reem--that is, a rhinoceros ([Job
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009); [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021); [Psa
92:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#010)).

[Numbers 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">num 23:23</span></span>

Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob--No art can ever prevail
against a people who are under the shield of Omnipotence, and for whom
miracles have been and yet shall be performed, which will be a theme of
admiration in succeeding ages.

[Numbers 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">num 23:26</span></span>

All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do--a remarkable confession that
he was divinely constrained to give utterances different from what it
was his purpose and inclination to do.

[Numbers 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">num 23:28</span></span>

Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor--or, Beth-peor ([Deu
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029)), the eminence on which a temple
of Baal stood.

that looketh toward Jeshimon--the desert tract in the south of
Palestine, on both sides of the Dead Sea.
