### [Ephesians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)

[Ephesians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 4:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS TO CHRISTIAN DUTIES RESTING ON OUR CHRISTIAN PRIVILEGES, AS
UNITED IN ONE BODY, THOUGH VARYING IN THE GRACES GIVEN TO THE SEVERAL
MEMBERS, THAT WE MAY COME UNTO A PERFECT MAN IN CHRIST. (Eph. 4:1-32)

Translate, according to the Greek order, "I beseech you, therefore
(seeing that such is your calling of grace, the first through third
chapters) I the prisoner in the Lord (that is, imprisoned in the Lord's
cause)." What the world counted ignominy, he counts the highest honor,
and he glories in his bonds for Christ, more than a king in his diadem
\[THEODORET\]. His bonds, too, are an argument which should enforce his
exhortation.

vocation--Translate, "calling" to accord, as the Greek does, with
"called" ([Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004); [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030)). [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015) similarly grounds Christian
duties on our Christian "calling." The exhortations of this part of the
Epistle are built on the conscious enjoyment of the privileges mentioned
in the former part. Compare [Eph 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032),
with [Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001) with [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030), with [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013); [Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015), with [Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).

[Ephesians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 4:2</span></span>

lowliness--In classic Greek, the meaning is meanness of spirit: the
Gospel has elevated the word to express a Christian grace, namely, the
esteeming of ourselves small, inasmuch as we are so; the thinking truly,
and because truly, therefore lowlily, of ourselves \[TRENCH\].

meekness--that spirit in which we accept God's dealings with us without
disputing and resisting; and also the accepting patiently of the
injuries done us by men, out of the thought that they are permitted by
God for the chastening and purifying of His people ([Sa2
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011); compare [Gal
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001); [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025); [Tit
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002)). It is only the lowly, humble
heart that is also meek ([Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)).
As "lowliness and meekness" answer to "forbearing one another in love"
(compare "love," [Eph 4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015)), so
"long-suffering" answers to ([Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004))
"endeavoring (Greek, 'earnestly' or 'zealously giving diligence') to
keep (maintain) the unity of the Spirit (the unity between men of
different tempers, which flows from the presence of the Spirit, who is
Himself 'one,' [Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004)) in (united
in) the bond of peace" (the "bond" by which "peace" is maintained,
namely, "love," [Col 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)
\[BENGEL\]; or, "peace" itself is the "bond" meant, uniting the members
of the Church \[ALFORD\]).

[Ephesians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 4:4</span></span>

In the apostle's creed, the article as to THE CHURCH properly follows
that as to THE HOLY GHOST. To the Trinity naturally is annexed the
Church, as the house to its tenant, to God His temple, the state to its
founder \[AUGUSTINE, Enchiridion, c. 15\]. There is yet to be a Church,
not merely potentially, but actually catholic or world-wide; then the
Church and the world will be co-extensive. Rome falls into inextricable
error by setting up a mere man as a visible head, antedating that
consummation which Christ, the true visible Head, at His appearing shall
first realize. As the "SPIRIT" is mentioned here, so the "LORD" (Jesus),
[Eph 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005), and "GOD the Father," [Eph
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006). Thus the Trinity is again set
forth.

hope--here associated with "the Spirit," which is the "earnest of our
inheritance" ([Eph 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)). As
"faith" is mentioned, [Eph 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005), so
"hope" here, and "love," [Eph 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002). The
Holy Spirit, as the common higher principle of life ([Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018), [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022)), gives to the Church its true
unity. Outward uniformity is as yet unattainable; but beginning by
having one mind, we shall hereafter end by having "one body." The true
"body" of Christ (all believers of every age) is already "one," as
joined to the one Head. But its unity is as yet not visible, even as the
Head is not visible; but it shall appear when He shall appear ([Joh
17:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)). Meanwhile the rule is, "In
essentials, unity; in doubtful questions, liberty; in all things,
charity." There is more real unity where both go to heaven under
different names than when with the same name one goes to heaven, the
other to hell. Truth is the first thing: those who reach it, will at
last reach unity, because truth is one; while those who seek unity as
the first thing, may purchase it at the sacrifice of truth, and so of
the soul itself.

of your calling--the one "hope" flowing from our "calling," is the
element "IN" which we are "called" to live. Instead of privileged
classes, as the Jews under the law, a unity of dispensation was
henceforth to be the common privilege of Jew and Gentile alike.
Spirituality, universality, and unity, were designed to characterize the
Church; and it shall be so at last ([Isa
2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009), [Isa
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013); [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009); [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009)).

[Ephesians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 4:5</span></span>

Similarly "faith" and "baptism" (the sacramental seal of faith) are
connected ([Mar 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#016); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012)). Compare [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013), "Faith" is not here that which
we believe, but the act of believing, the mean by which we apprehend the
"one Lord." "Baptism" is specified, being the sacrament whereby we are
incorporated into the "one body." Not the Lord's Supper, which is an act
of matured communion on the part of those already incorporate, "a symbol
of union, not of unity" \[ELLICOTT\]. In [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017), where a breach of union was in
question, it forms the rallying point \[ALFORD\]. There is not added,
"One pope, one council, one form of government" \[Cautions for Times\].
The Church is one in unity of faith ([Eph
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005); [Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003)); unity of origination ([Eph
2:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019)): unity of sacraments ([Eph
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005); [Co1
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)): unity of "hope" ([Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)); unity of charity ([Eph
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)): unity (not uniformity) of
discipline and government: for where there is no order, no ministry with
Christ as the Head, there is no Church \[PEARSON, Exposition of the
Creed, Article IX\].

[Ephesians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 4:6</span></span>

above--"over all." The "one God over all" (in His sovereignty and by His
grace) is the grand source and crowning apex of unity ([Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019), end).

through all--by means of Christ "who filleth all things" ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010); [Eph
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020)), and is "a propitiation" for
all men ([Jo1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002)).

in you all--The oldest manuscripts omit "you." Many of the oldest
versions and Fathers and old manuscripts read, "in us all." Whether the
pronoun be read or not, it must be understood (either from the "ye,"
[Eph 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004), or from the "us," [Eph
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007)); for other parts of Scripture
prove that the Spirit is not "in all" men, but only in believers ([Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009), [Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014)). God is "Father" both by
generation (as Creator) and regeneration ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010); [Jam
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017); [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001)).

[Ephesians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 4:7</span></span>

But--Though "one" in our common connection with "one Lord, one faith,
&c., one God," yet "each one of us" has assigned to him his own
particular gift, to be used for the good of the whole: none is
overlooked; none therefore can be dispensed with for the edifying of the
Church ([Eph 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012)). A motive to unity
([Eph 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003)). Translate, "Unto each one
of us was the grace (which was bestowed by Christ at His ascension, [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)) given according to," &c.

the measure--the amount "of the gift of Christ" ([Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003), [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006)).

[Ephesians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 4:8</span></span>

Wherefore--"For which reason," namely, in order to intimate that Christ,
the Head of the Church, is the author of all these different gifts, and
that giving of them is an act of His "grace" \[ESTIUS\].

he saith--God, whose word the Scripture is ([Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018)).

When he ascended--GOD is meant in the Psalm, represented by the ark,
which was being brought up to Zion in triumph by David, after that "the
Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies" (2Sa. 6:1-7:1;
1Ch. 15:1-29). Paul quotes it of CHRIST ascending to heaven, who is
therefore GOD.

captivity--that is, a band of captives. In the Psalm, the captive foes
of David. In the antitypical meaning, the foes of Christ the Son of
David, the devil, death, the curse, and sin ([Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)), led as it were in triumphal
procession as a sign of the destruction of the foe.

gave gifts unto men--in the Psalm, "received gifts for men," Hebrew,
"among men," that is, "thou hast received gifts" to distribute among
men. As a conqueror distributes in token of his triumph the spoils of
foes as gifts among his people. The impartation of the gifts and graces
of the Spirit depended on Christ's ascension ([Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039); [Joh
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)). Paul stops short in the middle
of the verse, and does not quote "that the Lord God might dwell among
them." This, it is true, is partly fulfilled in Christians being an
"habitation of God through the Spirit" ([Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022)). But the Psalm ([Psa
68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016)) refers to "the Lord dwelling in
Zion for ever"; the ascension amidst attendant angels, having as its
counterpart the second advent amidst "thousands of angels" ([Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017)), accompanied by the restoration
of Israel ([Psa 68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022)), the
destruction of God's enemies and the resurrection ([Psa
68:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020), [Psa
68:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#023)), the conversion of the kingdoms
of the world to the Lord at Jerusalem ([Psa
68:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029)).

[Ephesians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 4:9</span></span>

Paul reasons that (assuming Him to be God) His ascent implies a previous
descent; and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ,
who first descended, then ascended. For God the Father does not ascend
or descend. Yet the Psalm plainly refers to God ([Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008), [Eph
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017)). It must therefore be GOD THE
SON ([Joh 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#033), [Joh
6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062)). As He declares ([Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013)), "No man hath ascended up to
heaven, but He that came down from heaven." Others, though they did not
previously descend, have ascended; but none save Christ can be referred
to in the Psalm as having done so; for it is of God it speaks.

lower parts of the earth--The antithesis or contrast to "far above all
heavens," is the argument of ALFORD and others, to show that this phrase
means more than simply the earth, namely, the regions beneath it, even
as He ascended not merely to the visible heavens, but "far above" them.
Moreover, His design "that He might fill all things" ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010), Greek, "the whole universe of
things") may imply the same. But see on [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010) on those words. Also the leading
"captive" of the "captive hand" ("captivity") of satanic powers, may
imply that the warfare reached to their habitation itself ([Psa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009)). Christ, as Lord of all, took
possession first of the earth the unseen world beneath it (some
conjecture that the region of the lost is in the central parts of our
globe), then of heaven ([Act 2:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027)).
However, all we surely know is, that His soul at death descended to
Hades, that is, underwent the ordinary condition of departed spirits of
men. The leading captive of satanic powers here, is not said to be at
His descent, but at His ascension; so that no argument can be drawn from
it for a descent to the abodes of Satan. [Act
2:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#027), and [Rom
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007), favor the view of the reference
being simply to His descent to Hades. So PEARSON in Exposition of the
Creed ([Phi 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)).

[Ephesians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 4:10</span></span>

all heavens--Greek, "all the heavens" ([Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026); [Heb
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)), Greek, "passed through the
heavens" to the throne of God itself.

might fill--In Greek, the action is continued to the present time, both
"might" and "may fill," namely, with His divine presence and Spirit, not
with His glorified body. "Christ, as God, is present everywhere; as
glorified man, He can be present anywhere" \[ELLICOTT\].

[Ephesians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 4:11</span></span>

Greek, emphatical. "Himself" by His supreme power. "It is HE that gave,"
&c.

gave some, apostles--Translate, "some to be apostles, and some to be
prophets," &c. The men who filled the office, no less than the office
itself, were a divine gift \[EADIE\]. Ministers did not give themselves.
Compare with the list here, [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010), [Co1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028). As the apostles, prophets, and
evangelists were special and extraordinary ministers, so "pastors and
teachers" are the ordinary stated ministers of a particular flock,
including, probably, the bishops, presbyters, and deacons. Evangelists
were itinerant preachers like our missionaries, as Philip the deacon
([Act 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008)); as contrasted with
stationary "pastors and teachers" ([Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005)). The evangelist founded the
Church; the teacher built it up in the faith already received. The
"pastor" had the outward rule and guidance of the Church: the bishop. As
to revelation, the "evangelist" testified infallibly of the past; the
"prophet," infallibly of the future. The prophet derived all from the
Spirit; the evangelist, in the special case of the Four, recorded matter
of fact, cognizable to the senses, under the Spirit's guidance. No one
form of Church polity as permanently unalterable is laid down in the New
Testament though the apostolical order of bishops, or presbyters, and
deacons, superintended by higher overseers (called bishops after the
apostolic times), has the highest sanction of primitive usage. In the
case of the Jews, a fixed model of hierarchy and ceremonial unalterably
bound the people, most minutely detailed in the law. In the New
Testament, the absence of minute directions for Church government and
ceremonies, shows that a fixed model was not designed; the general rule
is obligatory as to ceremonies, "Let all things be done decently and in
order" (compare Article XXXIV, Church of England); and that a succession
of ministers be provided, not self-called, but "called to the work by
men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation, to
call and send ministers into the Lord's vineyard" \[Article XXIII\].
That the "pastors" here were the bishops and presbyters of the Church,
is evident from [Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028); [Pe1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001), where the bishops' and
presbyters' office is said to be "to feed" the flock. The term,
"shepherd" or "pastor," is used of guiding and governing and not merely
instructing, whence it is applied to kings, rather than prophets or
priests ([Eze 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023); [Jer
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004)). Compare the names of princes
compounded of "pharnas," Hebrew, "pastor," Holophernes, Tis-saphernes
(compare [Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028)).

[Ephesians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 4:12</span></span>

For--with a view to; the ultimate aim. "Unto."

perfecting--The Greek implies correcting in all that is deficient,
instructing and completing in number and all parts.

for--a different Greek word; the immediate object. Compare [Rom
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002), "Let every one . . . please his
neighbor for his good unto edification."

the ministry--Greek, "ministration"; without the article. The office of
the ministry is stated in this verse. The good aimed at in respect to
the Church ([Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013)). The way of
growth ([Eph 4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)).

edifying--that is, building up as the temple of the Holy Ghost.

[Ephesians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 4:13</span></span>

come in--rather, "attain unto." ALFORD expresses the Greek order, "Until
we arrive all of us at the unity," &c.

faith and . . . knowledge--Full unity of faith is then found, when all
alike thoroughly know Christ, the object of faith, and that in His
highest dignity as "the Son of God" \[DE WETTE\] ([Eph
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017), [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019); [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005)). Not even Paul counted himself to
have fully "attained" ([Phi 3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012)).
Amidst the variety of the gifts and the multitude of the Church's
members, its "faith" is to be ONE: as contrasted with the state of
"children carried about with EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE." ([Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)).

perfect man--unto the full-grown man ([Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006); [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015); [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014)); the maturity of an adult;
contrasted with children ([Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)).
Not "perfect men"; for the many members constitute but one Church joined
to the one Christ.

stature, &c.--The standard of spiritual "stature" is "the fulness of
Christ," that is, which Christ has ([Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023); [Eph
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019); compare [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019)); that the body should be worthy
of the Head, the perfect Christ.

[Ephesians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 4:14</span></span>

Translate, "To the end that"; the aim of the bestowal of gifts stated
negatively, as in [Eph 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013) it is
stated positively.

tossed to and fro--inwardly, even without wind; like billows of the sea.
So the Greek. Compare [Jam 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006).

carried about--with every wind from without.

doctrine--"teaching." The various teachings are the "winds" which keep
them tossed on a sea of doubts ([Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009); compare [Mat
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#007)).

by--Greek, "in"; expressing "the evil atmosphere in which the varying
currents of doctrine exert their force" \[ELLICOTT\].

sleight--literally, "dice playing." The player frames his throws of the
dice so that the numbers may turn up which best suit his purpose.

of men--contrasted with Christ ([Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013)).

and--Greek, "in."

cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive--Translate as
Greek, "craftiness tending to the methodized system of deceit" ("the
schemes of error") \[ALFORD\]. BENGEL takes "deceit," or "error," to
stand for "the parent of error," Satan (compare [Eph
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011)); referring to his concealed mode
of acting.

[Ephesians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 4:15</span></span>

speaking the truth--Translate, "holding the truth"; "following the
truth"; opposed to "error" or "deceit" ([Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)).

in love--"Truth" is never to be sacrificed to so-called "charity"; yet
it is to be maintained in charity. Truth in word and act, love in manner
and spirit, are the Christian's rule (compare [Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021), [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024)).

grow up--from the state of "children" to that of "full-grown men." There
is growth only in the spiritually alive, not in the dead.

into him--so as to be more and more incorporated with Him, and become
one with Him.

the head-- ([Eph 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022)).

[Ephesians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 4:16</span></span>

([Col 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019)).

fitly joined together--"being fitly framed together," as in [Eph
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#021); all the parts being in their
proper position, and in mutual relation.

compacted--implying firm consolidation.

by that which every joint supplieth--Greek, "by means of every joint of
the supply"; joined with "maketh increase of the body," not with
"compacted." "By every ministering (supplying) joint." The joints are
the points of union where the supply passes to the different members,
furnishing the body with the materials of its growth.

effectual working-- ([Eph 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019); [Eph
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007)). According to the effectual
working of grace in each member (or else, rather, "according to each
several member's working"), proportioned to the measure of its need of
supply.

every part--Greek, "each one part"; each individual part.

maketh increase--Translate, as the Greek is the same as [Eph
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#015), "maketh (carrieth on) the growth
of the body."

[Ephesians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 4:17</span></span>

therefore--resuming the exhortation which he had begun with, "I
therefore beseech you that ye walk worthy," &c. ([Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)).

testify in the Lord--in whom (as our element) we do all things
pertaining to the ministry ([Th1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001)
\[ALFORD\]; [Rom 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001)).

henceforth . . . not--Greek, "no longer"; resumed from [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).

other--Greek, "the rest of the Gentiles."

in the vanity, &c.--as their element: opposed to "in the Lord." "Vanity
of mind" is the waste of the rational powers on worthless objects, of
which idolatry is one of the more glaring instances. The root of it is
departure from the knowledge of the true God ([Eph
4:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018); [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021); [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005)).

[Ephesians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 4:18</span></span>

More literally, "Being darkened in their understanding," that is, their
intelligence, or perceptions (compare [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018); [Th1
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)).

alienated--This and "darkened," imply that before the fall they (in the
person of their first father) had been partakers of life and light: and
that they had revolted from the primitive revelation (compare [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)).

life of God--that life whereby God lives in His own people: as He was
the life and light in Adam before the irruption of death and darkness
into human nature; and as He is the life in the regenerate ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)). "Spiritual life in believers is
kindled from the life itself of God" \[BENGEL\].

through--rather as Greek, "on account of the ignorance," namely, of God.
Wilful ignorance in the first instance, their fathers not "choosing to
retain God in their knowledge." This is the beginning point of their
misery ([Act 17:30](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#030); [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021), [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028); [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014)).

because of--"on account of."

blindness--Greek, "hardness," literally, the hardening of the skin so as
not to be sensible of touch. Hence a soul's callousness to feeling ([Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005)). Where there is spiritual "life"
("the life of God") there is feeling; where there is not, there is
"hardness."

[Ephesians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 4:19</span></span>

past feeling--senseless, shameless, hopeless; the ultimate result of a
long process of "hardening," or habit of sin ([Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018)). "Being past hope," or
despairing, is the reading of the Vulgate; though not so well supported
as English Version reading, "past feeling," which includes the absence
of hope ([Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012)).

given themselves over--In [Rom 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024) it
is, "God gave them up to uncleanness." Their giving themselves to it was
punished in kind, God giving them up to it by withdrawing His preventing
grace; their sin thus was made their punishment. They gave themselves up
of their own accord to the slavery of their lust, to do all its
pleasure, as captives who have ceased to strive with the foe. God gave
them up to it, but not against their will; for they give themselves up
to it \[ZANCHIUS\].

lasciviousness--"wantonness" \[ALFORD\]. So it is translated in [Rom
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#013); [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018). It does not necessarily include
lasciviousness; but it means intemperate, reckless readiness for it, and
for every self-indulgence. "The first beginnings of unchastity"
\[GROTIUS\]. "Lawless insolence, and wanton caprice" \[TRENCH\].

to work all uncleanness--The Greek implies, "with a deliberate view to
the working (as if it were their work or business, not a mere accidental
fall into sin) of uncleanness of every kind."

with greediness--Greek, "in greediness." Uncleanness and greediness of
gain often go hand in hand ([Eph 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003),
[Eph 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)); though "greediness" here
includes all kinds of self-seeking.

[Ephesians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 4:20</span></span>

learned Christ-- ([Phi 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010)). To know
Christ Himself, is the great lesson of the Christian life: this the
Ephesians began to learn at their conversion. "Christ," in reference to
His office, is here specified as the object of learning. "Jesus," in
[Eph 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021), as the person.

[Ephesians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 4:21</span></span>

If so be that--not implying doubt; assuming what I have no reason to
doubt, that

heard him--The "Him" is emphatic: "heard Himself," not merely heard
about Him.

taught by him--Greek, "taught IN HIM," that is, being in vital union
with Him ([Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007)).

as the truth is in Jesus--Translate in connection with "taught"; "And in
Him have been taught, according as is truth in Jesus." There is no
article in the Greek. "Truth" is therefore used in the most
comprehensive sense, truth in its essence, and highest perfection, in
Jesus; "if according as it is thus in Him, ye have been so taught in
Him"; in contrast to "the vanity of mind of the Gentiles" ([Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017); compare [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), [Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)). Contrast [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).

[Ephesians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 4:22</span></span>

That ye--following "Ye have been taught" ([Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021)).

concerning the former conversation--"in respect to your former way of
life."

the old man--your old unconverted nature ([Rom
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006)).

is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts--rather, "which is being
corrupted ('perisheth,' compare [Gal
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008), 'corruption,' that is,
destruction) according to (that is, as might be expected from) the lusts
of deceit." Deceit is personified; lusts are its servants and tools. In
contrast to "the holiness of the truth," [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024), and "truth in Jesus," [Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021); and answering to Gentile
"vanity," [Eph 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017). Corruption and
destruction are inseparably associated together. The man's
old-nature-lusts are his own executioners, fitting him more and more for
eternal corruption and death.

[Ephesians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 4:23</span></span>

be renewed--The Greek (ananeousthai) implies "the continued renewal in
the youth of the new man." A different Greek word (anakainousthai)
implies "renewal from the old state."

in the spirit of your mind--As there is no Greek for "in," which there
is at [Eph 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017), "in the vanity of
their mind," it is better to translate, "By the Spirit of your mind,"
that is, by your new spiritual nature; the restored and divinely
informed leading principle of the mind. The "spirit" of man in New
Testament is only then used in its proper sense, as worthy of its place
and governing functions, when it is one spirit with the Lord. The
natural, or animal man, is described as "not having the Spirit" ([Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019)) \[ALFORD\]. Spirit is not in
this sense attributed to the unregenerate ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)).

[Ephesians 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 4:24</span></span>

put on the new man--Opposed to "the old man," which is to be "put off"
([Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)). The Greek here (kainon)
is different from that for "re-new-ed" ([Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023)). Put on not merely a renovated
nature, but a new, that is, altogether different nature, a changed
nature (compare Note,, see on [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010)).

after God, &c.--Translate, "Which hath been created (once for all: so
the Greek aorist means: in Christ, [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010); so that in each believer it has
not to be created again, but to be put on) after (the image of) God"
([Gen 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027); [Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010); [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015)), &c. God's image in which the
first Adam was originally created, is restored, to us far more
gloriously in the second Adam, the image of the invisible God ([Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)).

in righteousness--"IN" it as the element of the renewed man.

true holiness--rather, as the Greek, "holiness of the truth"; holiness
flowing from sincere following of "the truth of God" ([Rom
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025); [Rom
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007); [Rom
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)): opposed to "the lusts of
deceit" (Greek, [Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022)); compare
also [Eph 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021), "truth is in Jesus."
"Righteousness" is in relation to our fellow men, the second table of
the law; "Holiness," in relation to God, the first table; the religious
observance of offices of piety (compare [Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075)). In the parallel ([Col
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#010)) it is, "renewed in knowledge
after the image," &c. As at Colosse the danger was from false pretenders
to knowledge, the true "knowledge" which flows from renewal of the heart
is dwelt on; so at Ephesus, the danger being from the corrupt morals
prevalent around, the renewal in "holiness," contrasted with the Gentile
"uncleanness" ([Eph 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019)), and
"righteousness," in contrast to "greediness," is made prominent.

[Ephesians 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eph 4:25</span></span>

Wherefore--From the general character of "the new man," there will
necessarily result the particular features which he now details.

putting away--Greek, "having put away" once for all.

lying--"falsehood": the abstract. "Speak ye truth each one with his
neighbor," is quoted, slightly changed, from [Zac
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016). For "to," Paul quotes it "with,"
to mark our inner connection with one another, as "members one of
another" \[STIER\]. Not merely members of one body. Union to one another
in Christ, not merely the external command, instinctively leads
Christians to fulfil mutual duties. One member could not injure or
deceive another, without injuring himself, as all have a mutual and
common interest.

[Ephesians 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eph 4:26</span></span>

Be ye angry, and sin not--So the Septuagint, [Psa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004). Should circumstances arise to
call for anger on your part, let it be as Christ's "anger" ([Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005)), without sin. Our natural
feelings are not wrong when directed to their legitimate object, and
when not exceeding due bounds. As in the future literal, so in the
present spiritual, resurrection, no essential constituent is
annihilated, but all that is a perversion of the original design is
removed. Thus indignation at dishonor done to God, and wrong to man, is
justifiable anger. Passion is sinful (derived from "passio," suffering:
implying that amidst seeming energy, a man is really passive, the slave
of his anger, instead of ruling it).

let not the sun go down upon your wrath--"wrath" is absolutely
forbidden; "anger" not so, though, like poison sometimes used as
medicine, it is to be used with extreme caution. The sense is not, Your
anger shall not be imputed to you if you put it away before nightfall;
but "let no wrath (that is, as the Greek, personal 'irritation' or
'exasperation') mingle with your 'anger,' even though, the latter be
righteous, \[TRENCH, Greek Synonyms of the New Testament\]. "Put it away
before sunset" (when the Jewish day began), is proverbial for put it
away at once before another day begin ([Deu
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015)); also before you part with your
brother for the night, perhaps never in this world to meet again. So
JONA, "Let not night and anger against anyone sleep with you, but go and
conciliate the other party, though he have been the first to commit the
offense." Let not your "anger" at another's wickedness verge into
hatred, or contempt, or revenge \[VATABLUS\].

[Ephesians 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eph 4:27</span></span>

Neither give place--that is, occasion, or scope, to the devil, by
continuing in "wrath." The keeping of anger through the darkness of
night, is giving place to the devil, the prince of darkness ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)).

[Ephesians 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eph 4:28</span></span>

Greek, "Let him that stealeth." The imperfect or past tense is, however,
mainly meant, though not to the exclusion of the present. "Let the
stealing person steal no more." Bandits frequented the mountains near
Ephesus. Such are meant by those called "thieves" in the New Testament.

but rather--For it is not enough to cease from a sin, but the sinner
must also enter on the path that is its very opposite \[CHRYSOSTOM\].
The thief, when repentant, should labor more than he would be called on
to do, if he had never stolen.

let him labour--Theft and idleness go together.

the thing which is good--in contrast with theft, the thing which was
evil in his past character.

with his hands--in contrast with his former thievish use of his hands.

that he may have to give--"that he may have wherewith to impart." He who
has stolen should exercise liberality beyond the restitution of what he
has taken. Christians in general should make not selfish gain their aim
in honest industry, but the acquisition of the means of greater
usefulness to their fellow men; and the being independent of the alms of
others. So Paul himself ([Act 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035);
[Th2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008)) acted as he taught ([Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011)).

[Ephesians 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eph 4:29</span></span>

corrupt--literally, "insipid," without "the salt of grace" ([Col
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)), so worthless and then becoming
corrupt: included in "foolish talking" ([Eph
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004)). Its opposite is "that which is
good to edifying."

communication--language.

that which, &c.--Greek, "whatever is good."

use of edifying--literally, "for edifying of the need," that is, for
edifying where it is needed. Seasonably edifying; according as the
occasion and present needs of the hearers require, now censure, at
another time consolation. Even words good in themselves must be
introduced seasonably lest by our fault they prove injurious instead of
useful. TRENCH explains, Not vague generalities, which would suit a
thousand other cases equally well, and probably equally ill: our words
should be as nails fastened in a sure place, words suiting the present
time and the present person, being "for the edifying of the occasion"
([Col 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)).

minister--Greek, "give." The word spoken "gives grace to the hearers"
when God uses it as His instrument for that purpose.

[Ephesians 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eph 4:30</span></span>

grieve not--A condescension to human modes of thought most touching.
Compare "vexed His Holy Spirit" ([Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010); [Psa
78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040)); "fretted me" ([Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043) : implying His tender love to
us); and of hardened unbelievers, "resist the Holy Ghost" ([Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051)). This verse refers to believers,
who grieve the Spirit by inconsistencies such as in the context are
spoken of, corrupt or worthless conversation, &c.

whereby ye are sealed--rather, "wherein (or 'in whom') ye were sealed."
As in [Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013), believers are said to
be sealed "in" Christ, so here "in the Holy Spirit," who is one with
Christ, and who reveals Christ in the soul: the Greek implies that the
sealing was done already once for all. It is the Father "BY" whom
believers, as well as the Son Himself, were sealed ([Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027)). The Spirit is represented as
itself the seal ([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013), for the
image employed, see on [Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013)).
Here the Spirit is the element IN which the believer is sealed, His
gracious influences being the seal itself.

unto--kept safely against the day of redemption, namely, of the
completion of redemption in the deliverance of the body as well as the
soul from all sin and sorrow ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014); [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028); [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)).

[Ephesians 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eph 4:31</span></span>

bitterness--both of spirit and of speech: opposed to "kind."

wrath--passion for a time: opposed to "tender-hearted." Whence BENGEL
translates for "wrath," harshness.

anger--lasting resentment: opposed to "forgiving one another."

clamour--compared by CHRYSOSTOM to a horse carrying anger for its rider:
"Bridle the horse, and you dismount its rider." "Bitterness" begets
"wrath"; "wrath," "anger"; "anger," "clamor"; and "clamor," the more
chronic "evil-speaking," slander, insinuations, and surmises of evil.
"Malice" is the secret root of all: "fires fed within, and not appearing
to by-standers from without, are the most formidable" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Ephesians 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eph 4:32</span></span>

([Luk 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#042); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)).

even as--God hath shown Himself "kind, tender-hearted, and forgiving to
you"; it is but just that you in turn shall be so to your fellow men,
who have not erred against you in the degree that you have erred against
God ([Mat 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#033)).

God for Christ's sake--rather as Greek, "God in Christ" ([Co2
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)). It is in Christ that God
vouchsafes forgiveness to us. It cost God the death of His Son, as man,
to forgive us. It costs us nothing to forgive our fellow man.

hath forgiven--rather as Greek, "forgave you." God has, once for all,
forgiven sin in Christ, as a past historical fact.
