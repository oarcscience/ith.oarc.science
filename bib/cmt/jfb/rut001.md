Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Ruth Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

[Ruth 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rut 1:1</span></span>

ELIMELECH, DRIVEN BY FAMINE INTO MOAB, DIES THERE. ([Rut
1:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001).md)

in the days when the judges ruled--The beautiful and interesting story
which this book relates belongs to the early times of the judges. The
precise date cannot be ascertained.

[Ruth 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rut 1:2</span></span>

Elimelech--signifies "My God is king."

Naomi--"fair or pleasant"; and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, are
supposed to be the same as Joash and Saraph ([Ch1
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#022).md).

Ephrathites--The ancient name of Beth-lehem was Ephrath ([Gen
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md); [Gen
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007).md), which was continued after the
occupation of the land by the Hebrews, even down to the time of the
prophet Micah ([Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md).

Beth-lehem-judah--so called to distinguish it from a town of the same
name in Zebulun. The family, compelled to emigrate to Moab through
pressure of a famine, settled for several years in that country. After
the death of their father, the two sons married Moabite women. This was
a violation of the Mosaic law ([Deu
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#003.md); [Deu
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md); [Ezr
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002.md); [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023).md); and Jewish writers say that
the early deaths of both the young men were divine judgments inflicted
on them for those unlawful connections.

[Ruth 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rut 1:6</span></span>

NAOMI RETURNING HOME, RUTH ACCOMPANIES HER. ([Rut
1:6-18](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#006).md)

Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the
country of Moab--The aged widow, longing to enjoy the privileges of
Israel, resolved to return to her native land as soon as she was assured
that the famine had ceased, and made the necessary arrangements with her
daughters-in-law.

[Ruth 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rut 1:8</span></span>

Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her
mother's house--In Eastern countries women occupy apartments separate
from those of men, and daughters are most frequently in those of their
mother.

the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead--that is,
with my sons, your husbands, while they lived.

[Ruth 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rut 1:9</span></span>

The Lord grant you that ye may find rest--enjoy a life of tranquillity,
undisturbed by the cares, incumbrances, and vexatious troubles to which
a state of widowhood is peculiarly exposed.

Then she kissed them--the Oriental manner when friends are parting.

[Ruth 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rut 1:11</span></span>

are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your
husbands?--This alludes to the ancient custom ([Gen
38:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#026).md) afterwards expressly sanctioned
by the law of Moses ([Deu 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005).md), which
required a younger son to marry the widow of his deceased brother.

[Ruth 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rut 1:12</span></span>

Turn again, my daughters, go your way--That Naomi should dissuade her
daughters-in-law so strongly from accompanying her to the land of Israel
may appear strange. But it was the wisest and most prudent course for
her to adopt: first, because they might be influenced by hopes which
could not be realized; second, because they might be led, under
temporary excitement, to take a step they might afterwards regret; and,
third, because the sincerity and strength of their conversion to the
true religion, which she had taught them, would be thoroughly tested.

[Ruth 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rut 1:13</span></span>

the hand of the Lord is gone out against me--that is, I am not only not
in a condition to provide you with other husbands, but so reduced in
circumstances that I cannot think of your being subjected to privations
with me. The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who returned to
her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even in the pages
of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing which so calls
forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple effusion he has
borrowed from Scripture--of Ruth to her mother-in-law \[CHALMERS\].

[Ruth 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rut 1:19</span></span>

THEY COME TO BETH-LEHEM. ([Rut
1:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#019).md)

all the city was moved about them--The present condition of Naomi, a
forlorn and desolate widow, presented so painful a contrast to the
flourishing state of prosperity and domestic bliss in which she had been
at her departure.

[Ruth 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rut 1:22</span></span>

in the beginning of barley harvest--corresponding to the end of our
March.
