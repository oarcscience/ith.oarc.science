### [Philippians Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 4:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS: THANKS FOR THE SUPPLY FROM PHILIPPI: GREETING; AND CLOSING
BENEDICTION. (Phi. 4:1-23)

"Wherefore"; since we have such a glorious hope ([Phi
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md).

dearly beloved--repeated again at the close of the verse, implying that
his great love to them should be a motive to their obedience.

longed for--"yearned after" in your absence ([Phi
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#008).md).

crown--in the day of the Lord ([Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019).md).

so--as I have admonished you.

stand fast-- ([Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md).

[Philippians 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 4:2</span></span>

Euodia and Syntyche were two women who seem to have been at variance;
probably deaconesses of the church. He repeats, "I beseech," as if he
would admonish each separately, and with the utmost impartiality.

in the Lord--the true element of Christian union; for those "in the
Lord" by faith to be at variance, is an utter inconsistency.

[Philippians 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 4:3</span></span>

And--Greek, "Yea."

true yoke-fellow--yoked with me in the same Gospel yoke ([Mat
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md); compare [Ti1
5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017).md). Either Timothy, Silas ([Act
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#040.md); [Act
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019), at Philippi.md), or the chief
bishop of Philippi. Or else the Greek, "Sunzugus," or "Synzygus," is a
proper name: "Who art truly, as thy name means, a yoke-fellow."
Certainly not Paul's wife, as [Co1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005.md)
implies he had none.

help those women--rather, as Greek, "help them," namely, Euodia and
Syntyche. "Co-operate with them" \[BIRKS\]; or as ALFORD, "Help in the
work of their reconciliation."

which laboured with me--"inasmuch as they labored with me." At Philippi,
women were the first hearers of the Gospel, and Lydia the first convert.
It is a coincidence which marks genuineness, that in this Epistle alone,
special instructions are given to women who labored with Paul in the
Gospel. In selecting the first teachers, those first converted would
naturally be fixed on. Euodia and Syntyche were doubtless two of "the
women who resorted to the riverside, where prayer was wont to be made"
([Act 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013).md), and being early
converted, would naturally take an active part in teaching other women
called at a later period; of course not in public preaching, but in a
less prominent sphere ([Ti1 2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011).md).

Clement--bishop of Rome shortly after the death of Peter and Paul. His
Epistle from the Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth is extant. It
makes no mention of the supremacy of the See of Peter. He was the most
eminent of the apostolical fathers. ALFORD thinks that the Clement here
was a Philippian, and not necessarily Clement, bishop of Rome. But
ORIGEN \[Commentary, [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md)\]
identifies the Clement here with the bishop of Rome.

in the book of life--the register-book of those whose "citizenship is in
heaven" ([Luk 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). Anciently, free cities had a
roll book containing the names of all those having the right of
citizenship (compare [Exo 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028.md); [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md).

[Philippians 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 4:4</span></span>

([Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)..md)

alway--even amidst the afflictions now distressing you ([Phi
1:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028).md).

again--as he had already said, "Rejoice" ([Phi
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001).md). Joy is the predominant feature
of the Epistle.

I say--Greek, rather, "I will say."

[Philippians 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 4:5</span></span>

moderation--from a Greek root, "to yield," whence yieldingness
\[TRENCH\]; or from a root, "it is fitting," whence "reasonableness of
dealing" \[ALFORD\], that considerateness for others, not urging one's
own rights to the uttermost, but waiving a part, and thereby rectifying
the injustices of justice. The archetype of this grace is God, who
presses not the strictness of His law against us as we deserve ([Psa
130:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003).md); though having exacted the
fullest payment for us from our Divine Surety. There are included in
"moderation," candor and kindliness. Joy in the Lord raises us above
rigorism towards others ([Phi 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005).md),
and carefulness ([Phi 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006).md) as to one's
own affairs. Sadness produces morose harshness towards others, and a
troublesome spirit in ourselves.

Let . . . be known--that is, in your conduct to others, let nothing
inconsistent with "moderation" be seen. Not a precept to make a display
of moderation. Let this grace "be known" to men in acts; let "your
requests be made to God" in word ([Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006).md).

unto all men--even to the "perverse" ([Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md), that so ye may win them.
Exercise "forbearance" even to your persecutors. None is so ungracious
as not to be kindly to someone, from some motive or another, on some
occasion; the believer is to be so "unto all men" at all times.

The Lord is at hand--The Lord's coming again speedily is the grand
motive to every Christian grace ([Jam
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008).md). Harshness to others (the
opposite of "moderation") would be taking into our own hands prematurely
the prerogatives of judging, which belongs to the Lord alone ([Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005).md); and so provoking God to judge us
by the strict letter of the law ([Jam
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012).md).

[Philippians 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 4:6</span></span>

Translate, "Be anxious about nothing." Care and prayer are as mutually
opposed as fire and water \[BENGEL\].

by prayer and supplication--Greek, "by the prayer and the supplication"
appropriate to each case \[ALFORD\]. Prayer for blessings; and the
general term. Supplication, to avert ills; a special term, suppliant
entreaty (see on [Eph 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018).md).

thanksgiving--for every event, prosperity and affliction alike ([Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018.md); [Jam
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#013).md). The Philippians might remember
Paul's example at Philippi when in the innermost prison ([Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025).md). Thanksgiving gives effect to
prayer ([Ch2 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021).md), and frees from
anxious carefulness by making all God's dealings matter for praise, not
merely for resignation, much less murmuring. "Peace" is the companion of
"thanksgiving" ([Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md); [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015).md).

let your requests be made known unto God--with generous, filial,
unreserved confidence; not keeping aught back, as too great, or else too
small, to bring before God, though you might feel so as to your fellow
men. So Jacob, when fearing Esau ([Gen
32:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009).md); Hezekiah fearing Sennacherib
([Kg2 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014.md); [Psa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005).md).

[Philippians 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 4:7</span></span>

And--The inseparable consequence of thus laying everything before God in
"prayer with thanksgiving."

peace--the dispeller of "anxious care" ([Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006).md).

of God--coming from God, and resting in God ([Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027.md); [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md); [Col
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015).md).

passeth--surpasseth, or exceedeth, all man's notional powers of
understanding its full blessedness ([Co1
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020.md); compare [Pro
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#017).md).

shall keep--rather, "shall guard"; shall keep as a well-garrisoned
stronghold ([Isa 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001.md), [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003).md). The same Greek verb is used in
[Pe1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md). There shall be peace secure
within, whatever outward troubles may besiege.

hearts and minds--rather, "hearts (the seat of the thoughts) and
thoughts" or purposes.

through--rather as Greek, "in Christ Jesus." It is in Christ that we are
"kept" or "guarded" secure.

[Philippians 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 4:8</span></span>

Summary of all his exhortations as to relative duties, whether as
children or parents, husbands or wives, friends, neighbors, men in the
intercourse of the world, &c.

true--sincere, in words.

honest--Old English for "seemly," namely, in action; literally, grave,
dignified.

just--towards others.

pure--"chaste," in relation to ourselves.

lovely--lovable (compare [Mar 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021.md);
[Luk 7:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004).md).

of good report--referring to the absent ([Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md); as "lovely" refers to what is
lovable face to face.

if there be any virtue--"whatever virtue there is" \[ALFORD\]. "Virtue,"
the standing word in heathen ethics, is found once only in Paul's
Epistles, and once in Peter's ([Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005).md); and this in uses different from
those in heathen authors. It is a term rather earthly and human, as
compared with the names of the spiritual graces which Christianity
imparts; hence the rarity of its occurrence in the New Testament. Piety
and true morality are inseparable. Piety is love with its face towards
God; morality is love with its face towards man. Despise not anything
that is good in itself; only let it keep its due place.

praise--whatever is praiseworthy; not that Christians should make man's
praise their aim (compare [Joh 12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043).md);
but they should live so as to deserve men's praise.

think on--have a continual regard to, so as to "do" these things ([Phi
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009).md) whenever the occasion arises.

[Philippians 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 4:9</span></span>

both--rather, "The things also which ye have learned . . . these
practice"; the things which besides recommending them in words, have
been also recommended by my example, carry into practice.

heard--though ye have not yet sufficiently "received" them.

seen--though ye have not as yet sufficiently "learned" them \[BENGEL\].

and--"and then," as the necessary result ([Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007).md). Not only "the peace of God," but
"the God of peace" Himself "shall be with you."

[Philippians 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 4:10</span></span>

But--transitional conjunction. But "now" to pass to another subject.

in the Lord--He views everything with reference to Christ.

at the last--"at last"; implying he was expecting their gift, not from a
selfish view, but as a "fruit" of their faith, and to "abound" to their
account ([Phi 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md), [Phi
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017).md). Though long in coming, owing to
Epaphroditus' sickness and other delays, he does not imply their gift
was too late.

your care . . . hath flourished again--Greek, "Ye have flourished again
(revived, as trees sprouting forth again in spring) in your care for
me."

wherein ye were also careful--in respect to which (revival, namely, the
sending of a supply to me) "ye were also (all along) careful, but ye
lacked opportunity"; whether from want of means or want of a messenger.
Your "lack of service" ([Phi 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030).md),
was owing to your having "lacked opportunity."

[Philippians 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 4:11</span></span>

I have learned--The I in Greek is emphatical. I leave it to others if
they will, to be discontented. I, for my part, have learned, by the
teaching of the Holy Spirit, and the dealings of Providence ([Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008).md), to be content in every state.

content--The Greek, literally expresses "independent of others, and
having sufficiency in one's self." But Christianity has raised the term
above the haughty self-sufficiency of the heathen Stoic to the
contentment of the Christian, whose sufficiency is not in self, but in
God ([Co2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md); [Ti1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md), [Ti1
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008.md); [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005.md); compare [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036.md); [Jer
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#005).md).

[Philippians 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 4:12</span></span>

abased--in low circumstances ([Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md); [Co2
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#009).md).

everywhere--rather, "in each, and in all things" \[ALFORD\].

instructed--in the secret. Literally, "initiated" in a secret teaching,
which is a mystery unknown to the world.

[Philippians 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 4:13</span></span>

I can do all things--Greek, "I have strength for all things"; not merely
"how to be abased and how to abound." After special instances he
declares his universal power--how triumphantly, yet how humbly!
\[MEYER\].

through Christ which strengtheneth me--The oldest manuscripts omit
"Christ"; then translate, "In Him who giveth me power," that is, by
virtue of my living union and identification with Him, who is my
strength ([Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md). Compare [Ti1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md), whence probably, "Christ" was
inserted here by transcribers.

[Philippians 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 4:14</span></span>

He here guards against their thinking from what he has just said, that
he makes light of their bounty.

ye did communicate with my affliction--that is, ye made yourselves
sharers with me in my present affliction, namely, by sympathy; of which
sympathy your contribution is the proof.

[Philippians 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 4:15</span></span>

Now--"Moreover." Arrange as Greek, "Ye also know (as well as I do
myself)."

in the beginning of the gospel--dating from the Philippian Christian
era; at the first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi.

when I departed from Macedonia-- ([Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014).md). The Philippians had followed
Paul with their bounty when he left Macedonia and came to Corinth. [Co2
11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md) thus accords with the passage
here, the dates assigned to the donation in both Epistles agreeing;
namely, "in the beginning of the Gospel" here, and there, at the time of
his first visit to Corinth \[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\].
However, the supply meant here is not that which he received at Corinth,
but the supply sent to him when "in Thessalonica, once and again" ([Phi
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016).md), \[ALFORD\].

as concerning giving and receiving--In the account between us, "the
giving" was all on your part; "the receiving" all on mine.

ye only--We are not to wait for others in a good work, saying, "I will
do so, when others do it." We must go forward, though alone.

[Philippians 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 4:16</span></span>

even in Thessalonica--"even" as early as when I had got no further than
Thessalonica, ye sent me supplies for my necessities more than once.

[Philippians 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 4:17</span></span>

a gift--Greek, "the gift." Translate, "It is not that I seek after the
gift, but I do seek after the fruit that aboundeth to your account";
what I do seek is your spiritual good, in the abounding of fruits of
your faith which shall be put down to your account, against the day of
reward ([Heb 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md).

[Philippians 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 4:18</span></span>

But--Though "the gift" is not what I chiefly "seek after" ([Phi
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017).md), yet I am grateful for the gift,
and hereby acknowledge it as ample for all my needs. Translate, "I have
all" that I want, "and more than enough." Literally, as English Version,
"I abound" over and above my needs.

I am full--Greek, "I am filled full."

the odour of a sweet smell--(See on [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002).md). The figure is drawn from the
sweet-smelling incense which was burnt along with the sacrifices; their
gift being in faith was not so much to Paul, as to God ([Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040).md), before whom it "came up for a
memorial" ([Act 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#004).md), sweet-smelling
in God's presence ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md).

sacrifice acceptable-- ([Heb 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016).md).

[Philippians 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 4:19</span></span>

my--Paul calls God here "my God," to imply that God would reward their
bounty to HIS servant, by "fully supplying" (translate so, literally,
fill to the full) their every "need" ([Co2
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008).md), even as they had "fully"
supplied his "need" ([Phi 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md), [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018).md). My Master will fully repay you;
I cannot. The Philippians invested their bounty well since it got them
such a glorious return.

according to his riches--The measure of His supply to you will be the
immeasurable "riches of His grace" ([Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007).md).

in glory--These words belong to the whole sentence. "Glory" is the
element in which His rich grace operates; and it will be the element IN
which He will "supply fully all your need."

by Christ Jesus--by virtue of your being "IN" (so Greek, not "by")
Christ Jesus, the Giver and Mediator of all spiritual blessings.

[Philippians 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 4:20</span></span>

God and our Father--Translate, "Unto our God and Father."

be glory--rather as the Greek, "be the glory." Not to us, but to Him be
"the glory" alike of your gift, and of His gracious recompense to you.

[Philippians 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 4:21</span></span>

Salute every saint--individually.

greet--salute you.

The brethren which are with me--Perhaps Jewish believers are meant ([Act
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#021).md). I think [Phi
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md) precludes our thinking of "closer
friends," "colleagues in the ministry" \[ALFORD\]; he had only one close
friend with him, namely, Timothy.

[Philippians 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 4:22</span></span>

they that are of CÃ&brvbr;sar's household--the slaves and dependents of
Nero who had been probably converted through Paul's teaching while he
was a prisoner in the PrÃ&brvbr;torian barrack attached to the palace.
Philippi was a Roman "colony," hence there might arise a tie between the
citizens of the mother city and those of the colony; especially between
those of both cities who were Christians, converted as many of them were
by the same apostle, and under like circumstances, he having been
imprisoned at Philippi, as he now is at Rome.

[Philippians 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 4:23</span></span>

([Gal 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018).md).

be with you all. Amen--The oldest manuscripts read, "Be with your
spirit," and omit "Amen."
