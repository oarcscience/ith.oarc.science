### [Ezekiel Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 31:1</span></span>

THE OVERTHROW OF EGYPT ILLUSTRATED BY THAT OF ASSYRIA. (Eze. 31:1-18)

third month--two months later than the prophecy delivered in [Eze
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 31:2</span></span>

Whom art thou like--The answer is, Thou art like the haughty king of
Assyria; as he was overthrown by the Chaldeans, so shalt thou be by the
same.

[Ezekiel 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 31:3</span></span>

He illustrates the pride and the consequent overthrow of the Assyrian,
that Egypt may the better know what she must expect.

cedar in Lebanon--often eighty feet high, and the diameter of the space
covered by its boughs still greater: the symmetry perfect. Compare the
similar image ([Eze 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md); [Dan
4:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#020).md).

with a shadowing shroud--with an overshadowing thicket.

top . . . among . . . thick boughs--rather \[HENGSTENBERG\], "among the
clouds." But English Version agrees better with the Hebrew. The top, or
topmost shoot, represents the king; the thick boughs, the large
resources of the empire.

[Ezekiel 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 31:4</span></span>

waters . . . little rivers--the Tigris with its branches and "rivulets,"
or "conduits" for irrigation, the source of Assyria's fertility. "The
deep" is the ever flowing water, never dry. Metaphorically, for
Assyria's resources, as the "conduits" are her colonies.

[Ezekiel 31:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 31:5</span></span>

when he shot forth--because of the abundant moisture which nourished him
in shooting forth. But see Margin.

[Ezekiel 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 31:6</span></span>

fowls . . . made . . . nests in . . . boughs--so [Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023.md); [Dan
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#012.md). The gospel kingdom shall gather
all under its covert, for their good and for the glory of God, which the
world kingdoms did for evil and for self-aggrandizement ([Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032).md).

[Ezekiel 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 31:8</span></span>

cedars . . . could not hide him--could not outtop him. No other king
eclipsed him.

were not like--were not comparable to.

garden of God--As in the case of Tyre ([Eze
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#013).md), the imagery, that is applied
to the Assyrian king, is taken from Eden; peculiarly appropriate, as
Eden was watered by rivers that afterwards watered Assyria ([Gen
2:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010).md). This cedar seemed to revive
in itself all the glories of paradise, so that no tree there outtopped
it.

[Ezekiel 31:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 31:9</span></span>

I . . . made him--It was all due to My free grace.

[Ezekiel 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 31:10</span></span>

thou . . . he--The change of persons is because the language refers
partly to the cedar, partly to the person signified by the cedar.

[Ezekiel 31:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 31:11</span></span>

Here the literal supersedes the figurative.

shall surely deal with him--according to his own pleasure, and according
to the Assyrian's (Sardanapalus) desert. Nebuchadnezzar is called "the
mighty one" (El, a name of God), because he was God's representative and
instrument of judgment ([Dan 2:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#037).md).

[Ezekiel 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 31:12</span></span>

from his shadow--under which they had formerly dwelt as their covert
([Eze 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 31:13</span></span>

Birds and beasts shall insult over his fallen trunk.

[Ezekiel 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 31:14</span></span>

trees by the waters--that is, that are plentifully supplied by the
waters: nations abounding in resources.

stand up in their height--that is, trust in their height: stand upon it
as their ground of confidence. FAIRBAIRN points the Hebrew differently,
so as for "their trees," to translate, "(And that none that drink water
may stand) on themselves, (because of their greatness)." But the usual
reading is better, as Assyria and the confederate states throughout are
compared to strong trees. The clause, "All that drink water," marks the
ground of the trees' confidence "in their height," namely, that they
have ample sources of supply. MAURER, retaining the same Hebrew,
translates, "that neither their terebinth trees may stand up in their
height, nor all (the other trees) that drink water."

to . . . nether . . . earth . . . pit-- ([Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md); [Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 31:15</span></span>

covered the deep--as mourners cover their heads in token of mourning, "I
made the deep that watered the cedar" to wrap itself in mourning for
him. The waters of the deep are the tributary peoples of Assyria ([Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015).md).

fainted--literally, were "faintness" (itself); more forcible than the
verb.

[Ezekiel 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 31:16</span></span>

hell--Sheol or Hades, the unseen world: equivalent to, "I cast him into
oblivion" (compare [Isa 14:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md).

shall be comforted--because so great a king as the Assyrian is brought
down to a level with them. It is a kind of consolation to the wretched
to have companions in misery.

[Ezekiel 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 31:17</span></span>

his arm, that dwelt under his shadow--those who were the helpers or tool
of his tyranny, and therefore enjoyed his protection (for example, Syria
and her neighbors). These were sure to share her fate. Compare the same
phrase as to the Jews living under the protection of their king ([Lam
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020).md); both alike "making flesh their
arm, and in heart departing from the Lord" ([Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005).md).

[Ezekiel 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 31:18</span></span>

Application of the parabolic description of Assyria to the parallel case
of Egypt. "All that has been said of the Assyrian consider as said to
thyself. To whom art thou so like, as thou art to the Assyrian? To
none." The lesson on a gigantic scale of Eden-like privileges abused to
pride and sin by the Assyrian, as in the case of the first man in Eden,
ending in ruin, was to be repeated in Egypt's case. For the unchangeable
God governs the world on the same unchangeable principles.

thou shall lie in . . . uncircumcised--As circumcision was an object of
mocking to thee, thou shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, slain
by their sword \[GROTIUS\]. Retribution in kind ([Eze
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#010).md).

This is Pharaoh--Pharaoh's end shall be the same humiliating one as I
have depicted the Assyrian's to have been. "This" is demonstrative, as
if he were pointing with the finger to Pharaoh lying prostrate, a
spectacle to all, as on the shore of the Red Sea ([Exo
14:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030).md).
