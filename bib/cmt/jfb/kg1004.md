### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 4:1</span></span>

SOLOMON'S PRINCES. ([Kg1 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#001))

So King Solomon was king over all Israel--This chapter contains a
general description of the state and glory of the Hebrew kingdom during
the more flourishing or later years of his reign.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 4:2</span></span>

these were the princes--or chief officers, as is evident from two of
them marrying Solomon's daughters.

Azariah the son of Zadok the priest--rather, "the prince," as the Hebrew
word frequently signifies ([Gen 41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045);
[Exo 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#016); [Sa2
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018)); so that from the precedency
given to his person in the list, he seems to have been prime minister,
the highest in office next the king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 4:3</span></span>

scribes--that is, secretaries of state. Under David, there had been only
one \[[Sa2 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017); [Sa2
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025)\]. The employment of three
functionaries in this department indicates either improved regulations
by the division of labor, or a great increase of business, occasioned by
the growing prosperity of the kingdom, or a more extensive
correspondence with foreign countries.

recorder--that is, historiographer, or annalist--an office of great
importance in Oriental courts, and the duties of which consisted in
chronicling the occurrences of every day.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 4:4</span></span>

Benaiah . . . was over the host--formerly captain of the guard. He had
succeeded Joab as commander of the forces.

Zadok and Abiathar were the priests--Only the first discharged the
sacred functions; the latter had been banished to his country seat and
retained nothing more than the name of high priest.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 4:5</span></span>

over the officers--that is, the provincial governors enumerated in [Kg1
4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#017).

principal officer, and the king's friend--perhaps president of the privy
council, and Solomon's confidential friend or favorite. This high
functionary had probably been reared along with Solomon. That he should
heap those honors on the sons of Nathan was most natural, considering
the close intimacy of the father with the late king, and the deep
obligations under which Solomon personally lay to the prophet.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 4:6</span></span>

Ahishar was over the household--steward or chamberlain of the palace.

Adoniram--or Adoram ([Sa2 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#024); [Kg1
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#018)), or Hadoram ([Ch2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#018)),

was over the tribute--not the collection of money or goods, but the levy
of compulsory laborers (compare [Kg1
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg1 4:7</span></span>

HIS TWELVE OFFICERS. ([Kg1 4:7-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#007))

Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel--The royal revenues were
raised according to the ancient, and still, in many parts, existing
usage of the East, not in money payments, but in the produce of the
soil. There would be always a considerable difficulty in the collection
and transmission of these tithes ([Sa1
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#015)). Therefore, to facilitate the
work, Solomon appointed twelve officers, who had each the charge of a
tribe or particular district of country, from which, in monthly
rotation, the supplies for the maintenance of the king's household were
drawn, having first been deposited in "the store cities" which were
erected for their reception ([Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019); [Ch2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#004), [Ch2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#006)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 4:8</span></span>

The son of Hur--or, as the Margin has it, Benhur, Bendekar. In the rural
parts of Syria, and among the Arabs, it is still common to designate
persons not by their own names, but as the sons of their fathers.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg1 4:21</span></span>

Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river--All the petty kingdoms
between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean were tributary to him.
Similar is the statement in [Kg1 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 4:22</span></span>

Solomon's provision for one day--not for the king's table only, but for
all connected with the court, including, besides the royal
establishment, those of his royal consorts, his principal officers, his
bodyguards, his foreign visitors, &c. The quantity of fine floor used is
estimated at two hundred forty bushels; that of meal or common flour at
four hundred eighty. The number of cattle required for consumption,
besides poultry and several kinds of game (which were abundant on the
mountains) did not exceed in proportion what is needed in other courts
of the East.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 4:24</span></span>

from Tiphsah--that is, Thapsacus, a large and flourishing town on the
west bank of the Euphrates, the name of which was derived from a
celebrated ford near it, the lowest on that river.

even to Azzah--that is, Gaza, on the southwestern extremity, not far
from the Mediterranean.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">kg1 4:25</span></span>

every man under his vine and . . . fig tree--This is a common and
beautiful metaphor for peace and security ([Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004); [Zac
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010)), founded on the practice, still
common in modern Syria, of training these fruit trees up the walls and
stairs of houses, so as to make a shady arbor, beneath which the people
sit and relax.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 4:26</span></span>

forty thousand stalls--for the royal mews (see on [Ch2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#025)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 4:28</span></span>

Barley . . . and straw--Straw is not used for litter, but barley mixed
with chopped straw is the usual fodder of horses.

dromedaries--one-humped camels, distinguished for their great fleetness.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 4:29</span></span>

HIS WISDOM. ([Kg1 4:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029))

God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness
of heart--that is, high powers of mind, great capacity for receieving,
as well as aptitude for communicating knowledge.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">kg1 4:30</span></span>

Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
country--that is, the Arabians, Chaldeans, and Persians ([Gen
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006)).

all the wisdom of Egypt--Egypt was renowned as the seat of learning and
sciences, and the existing monuments, which so clearly describe the
ancient state of society and the arts, show the high culture of the
Egyptian people.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">kg1 4:31</span></span>

wiser than all men--that is, all his contemporaries, either at home or
abroad.

than Ethan--or Jeduthun, of the family of Merari ([Ch1
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#044)).

Heman-- ([Ch1 15:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017)) --the chief of
the temple musicians and the king's seers ([Ch1
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1025.htm#005)); the other two are not known.

the sons of Mahol--either another name for Zerah ([Ch1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#006)); or taking it as a common noun,
signifying a dance, a chorus, "the sons of Mahol" signify persons
eminently skilled in poetry and music.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">kg1 4:32</span></span>

he spake three thousand proverbs--embodying his moral sentiments and
sage observations on human life and character.

songs . . . a thousand and five-- Psalm 72, 127, 132, and the Song of
Songs are his.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 4:33</span></span>

he spake of trees, from the cedar . . . to the hyssop--all plants, from
the greatest to the least. The Spirit of God has seen fit to preserve
comparatively few memorials of the fruits of his gigantic mind. The
greater part of those here ascribed to him have long since fallen a prey
to the ravages of time, or perished in the Babylonish captivity,
probably because they were not inspired.
