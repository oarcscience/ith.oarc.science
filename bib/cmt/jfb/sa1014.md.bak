### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 14:1</span></span>

JONATHAN MIRACULOUSLY SMITES THE PHILISTINES' GARRISON. ([Sa1
14:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001).md)

the Philistines' garrison--"the standing camp" ([Sa1
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023), Margin.md) "in the passage of
Michmash" ([Sa1 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#016).md), now Wady
Es-Suweinit. "It begins in the neighborhood of Betin (Beth-el) and
El-Bireh (Beetroth), and as it breaks through the ridge below these
places, its sides form precipitous walls. On the right, about a quarter
of an acre below, it again breaks off, and passes between high
perpendicular precipices" \[ROBINSON\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 14:2</span></span>

Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah--Hebrew, "Geba";
entrenched, along with Samuel and Ahiah the high priest, on the top of
one of the conical or spherical hills which abound in the Benjamite
territory, and favorable for an encampment, called Migron ("a
precipice").

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 14:4</span></span>

between the passages--that is, the deep and great ravine of Suweinit.

Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison--a distance of
about three miles running between two jagged points; Hebrew, "teeth of
the cliff."

there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other
side . . . Bozez--("shining") from the aspect of the chalky rock.

Seneh--("the thorn") probably from a solitary acacia on its top. They
are the only rocks of the kind in this vicinity; and the top of the crag
towards Michmash was occupied as the post of the Philistines. The two
camps were in sight of each other; and it was up the steep rocky sides
of this isolated eminence that Jonathan and his armorbearer ([Sa1
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006).md) made their adventurous approach.
This enterprise is one of the most gallant that history or romance
records. The action, viewed in itself, was rash and contrary to all
established rules of military discipline, which do not permit soldiers
to fight or to undertake any enterprise that may involve important
consequences without the order of the generals.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 14:6</span></span>

it may be that the Lord will work for us--This expression did not imply
a doubt; it signified simply that the object he aimed at was not in his
own power--but it depended upon God--and that he expected success
neither from his own strength nor his own merit.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 14:9</span></span>

if they say, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath
delivered them into our hand--When Jonathan appears here to prescribe a
sign or token of God's will, we may infer that the same spirit which
inspired this enterprise suggested the means of its execution, and put
into his heart what to ask of God. (See on [Gen
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#012).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 14:11</span></span>

Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes--As it could not occur
to the sentries that two men had come with hostile designs, it was a
natural conclusion that they were Israelite deserters. And hence no
attempt was made to hinder their ascent, or stone them.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 14:14</span></span>

that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was
about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke
of oxen might plow--This was a very ancient mode of measurement, and it
still subsists in the East. The men who saw them scrambling up the rock
had been surprised and killed, and the spectacle of twenty corpses would
suggest to others that they were attacked by a numerous force. The
success of the adventure was aided by a panic that struck the enemy,
produced both by the sudden surprise and the shock of an earthquake. The
feat was begun and achieved by the faith of Jonathan, and the issue was
of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa1 14:16</span></span>

the watchmen of Saul . . . looked--The wild disorder in the enemies'
camp was described and the noise of dismay heard on the heights of
Gibeah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 14:17</span></span>

Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see
who is gone from us--The idea occurred to him that it might be some
daring adventurer belonging to his own little troop, and it would be
easy to discover him.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 14:18</span></span>

Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God--There is no evidence
that the ark had been brought from Kirjath-jearim. The Septuagint
version is preferable; which, by a slight variation of the text, reads,
"the ephod"; that is, the priestly cape, which the high priest put on
when consulting the oracle. That this should be at hand is natural, from
the presence of Ahiah himself, as well as the nearness of Nob, where the
tabernacle was then situated.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 14:19</span></span>

Withdraw thine hand--The priest, invested with the ephod, prayed with
raised and extended hands. Saul perceiving that the opportunity was
inviting, and that God appeared to have sufficiently declared in favor
of His people, requested the priest to cease, that they might
immediately join in the contest. The season for consultation was
past--the time for prompt action was come.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 14:20</span></span>

Saul and all the people--All the warriors in the garrison at Gibeah, the
Israelite deserters in the camp of the Philistines, and the fugitives
among the mountains of Ephraim, now all rushed to the pursuit, which was
hot and sanguinary.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 14:23</span></span>

So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto
Beth-aven--that is, "Beth-el." It passed over the forest, now destroyed,
on the central ridge of Palestine, then over to the other side from the
eastern pass of Michmash ([Sa1 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031).md),
to the western pass of Aijalon, through which they escaped into their
own plains.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa1 14:24</span></span>

Saul had adjured the people--Afraid lest so precious an opportunity of
effectually humbling the Philistine power might be lost, the impetuous
king laid an anathema on any one who should taste food until the
evening. This rash and foolish denunciation distressed the people, by
preventing them taking such refreshments as they might get on the march,
and materially hindered the successful attainment of his own patriotic
object.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 14:25</span></span>

all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey--The honey is
described as "upon the ground," "dropping" from the trees, and in
honeycombs--indicating it to be bees' honey. "Bees in the East are not,
as in England, kept in hives; they are all in a wild state. The forests
literally flow with honey; large combs may be seen hanging on the trees
as you pass along, full of honey" \[ROBERTS\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 14:31</span></span>

the people were very faint. And the people flew upon the spoil--at
evening, when the time fixed by Saul had expired. Faint and famishing,
the pursuers fell voraciously upon the cattle they had taken, and threw
them on the ground to cut off their flesh and eat them raw, so that the
army, by Saul's rashness, were defiled by eating blood, or living
animals; probably, as the Abyssinians do, who cut a part of the animal's
rump, but close the hide upon it, and nothing mortal follows from that
wound. They were painfully conscientious in keeping the king's order for
fear of the curse, but had no scruple in transgressing God's command. To
prevent this violation of the law, Saul ordered a large stone to be
rolled, and those that slaughtered the oxen to cut their throats on that
stone. By laying the animal's head on the high stone, the blood oozed
out on the ground, and sufficient evidence was afforded that the ox or
sheep was dead before it was attempted to eat it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:45](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">sa1 14:45</span></span>

the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not--When Saul became aware of
Jonathan's transgression in regard to the honey, albeit it was done in
ignorance and involved no guilt, he was, like Jephthah \[[Jdg
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#031.md), [Jdg
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#035.md)\], about to put his son to
death, in conformity with his vow \[[Sa1
14:44](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#044.md)\]. But the more enlightened
conscience of the army prevented the tarnishing the glory of the day by
the blood of the young hero, to whose faith and valor it was chiefly
due.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 14:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">sa1 14:47</span></span>

So Saul . . . fought against all his enemies on every side--This signal
triumph over the Philistines was followed, not only by their expulsion
from the land of Israel, but by successful incursions against various
hostile neighbors, whom he harassed though he did not subdue them.
