### [John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

[John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 1:1</span></span>

THE WORD MADE FLESH. ([Joh 1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001).md)

In the beginning--of all time and created existence, for this Word gave
it being ([Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md), [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010).md); therefore, "before the world
was" ([Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md); or, from all eternity.

was the Word--He who is to God what man's word is to himself, the
manifestation or expression of himself to those without him. (See on
[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md). On the origin of this most
lofty and now for ever consecrated title of Christ, this is not the
place to speak. It occurs only in the writings of this seraphic apostle.

was with God--having a conscious personal existence distinct from God
(as one is from the person he is "with"), but inseparable from Him and
associated with Him ([Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md), where "THE FATHER" is used in
the same sense as "GOD" here.

was God--in substance and essence GOD; or was possessed of essential or
proper divinity. Thus, each of these brief but pregnant statements is
the complement of the other, correcting any misapprehensions which the
others might occasion. Was the Word eternal? It was not the eternity of
"the Father," but of a conscious personal existence distinct from Him
and associated with Him. Was the Word thus "with God?" It was not the
distinctness and the fellowship of another being, as if there were more
Gods than one, but of One who was Himself God--in such sense that the
absolute unity of the God head, the great principle of all religion, is
only transferred from the region of shadowy abstraction to the region of
essential life and love. But why all this definition? Not to give us any
abstract information about certain mysterious distinctions in the
Godhead, but solely to let the reader know who it was that in the
fulness of time "was made flesh." After each verse, then, the reader
must say, "It was He who is thus, and thus, and thus described, who was
made flesh."

[John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 1:2</span></span>

The same, &c.--See what property of the Word the stress is laid
upon--His eternal distinctness, in unity, from God--the Father ([Joh
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002).md).

[John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 1:3</span></span>

All things, &c.--all things absolutely (as is evident from [Joh
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md); [Co1
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md); [Col
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); but put beyond question by
what follows).

without Him was not any thing--not one thing.

made--brought into being.

that was made--This is a denial of the eternity and non-creation of
matter, which was held by the whole thinking world outside of Judaism
and Christianity: or rather, its proper creation was never so much as
dreamt of save by the children of revealed religion.

[John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 1:4</span></span>

In Him was life--essentially and originally, as the previous verses show
to be the meaning. Thus He is the Living Word, or, as He is called in
[Jo1 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md), "the Word of Life."

the life . . . the light of men--All that in men which is true
light--knowledge, integrity, intelligent, willing subjection to God,
love to Him and to their fellow creatures, wisdom, purity, holy joy,
rational happiness--all this "light of men" has its fountain in the
essential original "life" of "the Word" ([Jo1
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md); [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009).md).

[John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 1:5</span></span>

shineth in darkness, &c.--in this dark, fallen world, or in mankind
"sitting in darkness and the shadow of death," with no ability to find
the way either of truth or of holiness. In this thick darkness, and
consequent intellectual and moral obliquity, "the light of the Word"
shineth--by all the rays whether of natural or revealed teaching which
men (apart from the Incarnation of the Word) are favored with.

the darkness comprehended it not--did not take it in, a brief summary of
the effect of all the strivings of this unincarnate Word throughout this
wide world from the beginning, and a hint of the necessity of His
putting on flesh, if any recovery of men was to be effected ([Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021).md).

[John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 1:6</span></span>

The Evangelist here approaches his grand thesis, so paving his way for
the full statement of it in [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md),
that we may be able to bear the bright light of it, and take in its
length and breadth and depth and height.

[John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 1:7</span></span>

through him--John.

[John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 1:8</span></span>

not that Light--(See on [Joh 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).md).
What a testimony to John to have to explain that "he was not that
Light!" Yet was he but a foil to set it off, his night-taper dwindling
before the Dayspring from on high ([Joh
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#030).md).

[John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 1:9</span></span>

lighteth every man, &c.--rather, "which, coming into the world,
enlighteneth every man"; or, is "the Light of the world" ([Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005).md). "Coming into the world" is a
superfluous and quite unusual description of "every man"; but it is of
all descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar, especially in the
writings of this Evangelist ([Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046.md); [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md); [Joh
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md); [Jo1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009.md); [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015), &c..md).

[John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 1:10</span></span>

He was in the world, &c.--The language here is nearly as wonderful as
the thought. Observe its compact simplicity, its sonorousness--"the
world" resounding in each of its three members--and the enigmatic form
in which it is couched, startling the reader and setting his ingenuity
a-working to solve the stupendous enigma of Christ ignored in His own
world. "The world," in the first two clauses, plainly means the created
world, into which He came, says [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); "in it He was," says this verse.
By His Incarnation, He became an inhabitant of it, and bound up with it.
Yet it "was made by Him" ([Joh 1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).md).
Here, then, it is merely alluded to, in contrast partly with His being
in it, but still more with the reception He met with from it. "The world
that knew Him not" ([Jo1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md) is of
course the intelligent world of mankind. (See on [Joh
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011).md). Taking the first two clauses
as one statement, we try to apprehend it by thinking of the infant
Christ conceived in the womb and born in the arms of His own creature,
and of the Man Christ Jesus breathing His own air, treading His own
ground, supported by substances to which He Himself gave being, and the
Creator of the very men whom He came to save. But the most vivid
commentary on this entire verse will be got by tracing (in His matchless
history) Him of whom it speaks walking amidst all the elements of
nature, the diseases of men and death itself, the secrets of the human
heart, and "the rulers of the darkness of this world" in all their
number, subtlety, and malignity, not only with absolute ease, as their
conscious Lord, but, as we might say, with full consciousness on their
part of the presence of their Maker, whose will to one and all of them
was law. And this is He of whom it is added, "the world knew Him not!"

[John 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 1:11</span></span>

his own--"His own" (property or possession), for the word is in the
neuter gender. It means His own land, city, temple, Messianic rights and
possessions.

and his own--"His own (people)"; for now the word is masculine. It means
the Jews, as the "peculiar people." Both they and their land, with all
that this included, were "HIS OWN," not so much as part of "the world
which was made by Him," but as "THE HEIR" of the inheritance ([Luk
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#014.md); see also on [Mat
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#001).md).

received him not--nationally, as God's chosen witnesses.

[John 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 1:12</span></span>

But as many--individuals, of the "disobedient and gainsaying people."

gave he power--The word signifies both authority and ability, and both
are certainly meant here.

to become--Mark these words: Jesus is the Son of God; He is never said
to have become such.

the sons--or more simply, "sons of God," in name and in nature.

believe on his name--a phrase never used in Scripture of any mere
creature, to express the credit given to human testimony, even of
prophets or apostles, inasmuch it carries with it the idea of trust
proper only towards GOD. In this sense of supreme faith, as due to Him
who "gives those that believe in Himself power to become sons of God,"
it is manifestly used here.

[John 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 1:13</span></span>

Which were born--a sonship therefore not of mere title and privilege,
but of nature, the soul being made conscious of the vital capacities,
perceptions, and emotions of a child of God, before unknown.

not of blood, &c.--not of superior human descent, not of human
generation at all, not of man in any manner of way. By this elaborate
threefold denial of the human source of this sonship, immense force is
given to what follows,

but of God--Right royal gift, and He who confers must be absolutely
divine. For who would not worship Him who can bring him into the family,
and evoke within him the very life, of the sons of God?

[John 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 1:14</span></span>

And the Word, &c.--To raise the reader to the altitude of this climax
were the thirteen foregoing verses written.

was made flesh--BECAME MAN, in man's present frail, mortal condition,
denoted by the word "flesh" ([Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md); [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024).md). It is directed probably against
the DocetÃ&brvbr;, who held that Christ was not really but only
apparently man; against whom this gentle spirit is vehement in his
Epistles ([Jo1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003.md); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007.md), [Jo2
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010).md), \[LUCKE, &c.\]. Nor could He
be too much so, for with the verity of the Incarnation all substantial
Christianity vanishes. But now, married to our nature, henceforth He is
as personally conscious of all that is strictly human as of all that is
properly divine; and our nature is in His Person redeemed and quickened,
ennobled and transfigured.

and dwelt--tabernacled or pitched his tent; a word peculiar to John, who
uses it four times, all in the sense of a permanent stay ([Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md); [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md); [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md). For ever wedded to our "flesh,"
He has entered this tabernacle to "go no more out." The allusion is to
that tabernacle where dwelt the Shekinah (see on [Mat
23:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038).md), or manifested "GLORY OF THE
LORD," and with reference to God's permanent dwelling among His people
([Lev 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md); [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md); [Psa
132:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027).md). This is put almost beyond
doubt by what immediately follows, "And we beheld his glory" \[LUCKE,
MEYER, DE WETTE which last critic, rising higher than usual, says that
thus were perfected all former partial manifestations of God in an
essentially Personal and historically Human manifestation\].

full of grace and truth--So it should read: "He dwelt among us full of
grace and truth"; or, in Old Testament phrase, "Mercy and truth,"
denoting the whole fruit of God's purposes of love towards sinners of
mankind, which until now existed only in promise, and the fulfilment at
length of that promise in Christ; in one great word, "the SURE MERCIES
of David" ([Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md); [Act
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034.md); compare [Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005).md). In His Person all that Grace
and Truth which had been floating so long in shadowy forms, and darting
into the souls of the poor and needy its broken beams, took everlasting
possession of human flesh and filled it full. By this Incarnation of
Grace and Truth, the teaching of thousands of years was at once
transcended and beggared, and the family of God sprang into Manhood.

and we beheld his glory--not by the eye of sense, which saw in Him only
"the carpenter." His glory was "spiritually discerned" ([Co1
2:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md), [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md); [Co2
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016).md) --the glory of surpassing grace,
love, tenderness, wisdom, purity, spirituality; majesty and meekness,
richness and poverty, power and weakness, meeting together in unique
contrast; ever attracting and at times ravishing the "babes" that
followed and forsook all for Him.

the glory as of the only begotten of the Father--(See on [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035).md); not like, but "such as (belongs
to)," such as became or was befitting the only begotten of the Father
\[CHRYSOSTOM in LUCKE, CALVIN, &c.\], according to a well-known use of
the word "as."

[John 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 1:15</span></span>

A SAYING OF THE BAPTIST CONFIRMATORY OF THIS. ([Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015).md)

after me--in official manifestation.

before me--in rank and dignity.

for he was before me--in existence; "His goings forth being from of old,
from everlasting" ([Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md).
(Anything lower than this His words cannot mean); that is, "My Successor
is my Superior, for He was my Predecessor." This enigmatic play upon the
different senses of the words "before" and "after" was doubtless
employed by the Baptist to arrest attention, and rivet the thought; and
the Evangelist introduces it just to clinch his own statements.

[John 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 1:16</span></span>

SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED. ([Joh 1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016).md)

of his fulness--of "grace and truth," resuming the thread of [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md).

grace for grace--that is, grace upon grace (so all the best
interpreters), in successive communications and larger measures, as each
was able to take it in. Observe, the word "truth" is here dropped.
"Grace" being the chosen New Testament word for the whole fulness of the
new covenant, all that dwells in Christ for men.

[John 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 1:17</span></span>

For, &c.--The Law elicits the consciousness of sin and the need of
redemption; it only typifies the reality. The Gospel, on the contrary,
actually communicates reality and power from above (compare [Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014).md). Hence Paul terms the Old
Testament "shadow," while he calls the New Testament "substance" ([Col
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017).md) \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[John 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 1:18</span></span>

No man--"No one," in the widest sense.

hath seen God--by immediate gaze, or direct intuition.

in the bosom of the Father--A remarkable expression, used only here,
presupposing the Son's conscious existence distinct from the Father, and
expressing His immediate and most endeared access to, and absolute
acquaintance with, Him.

he--emphatic; As if he should say, "He and He only hath declared Him,"
because He only can.

[John 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 1:19</span></span>

THE BAPTIST'S TESTIMONY TO CHRIST. (John 1:19-36)

record--testimony.

the Jews--that is, the heads of the nation, the members of the
Sanhedrim. In this peculiar sense our Evangelist seems always to use the
term.

[John 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 1:20</span></span>

confessed, &c.--that is, While many were ready to hail him as the
Christ, he neither gave the slightest ground for such views, nor the
least entertainment to them.

[John 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 1:21</span></span>

Elias--in His own proper person.

that prophet--announced in [Deu 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md),
&c., about whom they seem not to have been agreed whether he were the
same with the Messiah or no.

[John 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 1:25</span></span>

Why baptizest thou, if not, &c.--Thinking he disclaimed any special
connection with Messiah's kingdom, they demand his right to gather
disciples by baptism.

[John 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 1:26</span></span>

there standeth--This must have been spoken after the baptism of Christ,
and possibly just after His temptation (see on [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).md).

[John 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 1:28</span></span>

Bethabara--Rather, "Bethany" (according to nearly all the best and most
ancient manuscripts); not the Bethany of Lazarus, but another of the
same name, and distinguished from it as lying "beyond Jordan," on the
east.

[John 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 1:29</span></span>

seeth Jesus--fresh, probably, from the scene of the temptation.

coming unto him--as to congenial company ([Act
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023).md), and to receive from him His
first greeting.

and saith--catching a sublime inspiration at the sight of Him
approaching.

the Lamb of God--the one God-ordained, God-gifted sacrificial offering.

that taketh away--taketh up and taketh away. The word signifies both, as
does the corresponding Hebrew word. Applied to sin, it means to be
chargeable with the guilt of it ([Exo
28:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#038.md); [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md); [Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020).md), and to bear it away (as
often). In the Levitical victims both ideas met, as they do in Christ,
the people's guilt being viewed as transferred to them, avenged in their
death, and so borne away by them ([Lev
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#015.md); [Lev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015.md), [Lev
16:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#021.md); and compare [Isa
53:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md).

the sin--The singular number being used to mark the collective burden
and all-embracing efficacy.

of the world--not of Israel only, for whom the typical victims were
exclusively offered. Wherever there shall live a sinner throughout the
wide world, sinking under that burden too heavy for him to bear, he
shall find in this "Lamb of God," a shoulder equal to the weight. The
right note was struck at the first--balm, doubtless, to Christ's own
spirit; nor was ever after, or ever will be, a more glorious utterance.

[John 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 1:31</span></span>

knew him not--Living mostly apart, the one at Nazareth, the other in the
Judean desert--to prevent all appearance of collusion, John only knew
that at a definite time after his own call, his Master would show
Himself. As He drew near for baptism one day, the last of all the crowd,
the spirit of the Baptist heaving under a divine presentiment that the
moment had at length arrived, and an air of unwonted serenity and
dignity, not without traits, probably, of the family features, appearing
in this Stranger, the Spirit said to him as to Samuel of his youthful
type, "Arise, anoint Him, for this is He!" ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012).md). But the sign which he was told
to expect was the visible descent of the Spirit upon Him as He emerged
out of the baptismal water. Then, catching up the voice from heaven, "he
saw and bare record that this is the Son of God."

[John 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 1:35</span></span>

John stood--"was standing," at his accustomed place.

[John 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 1:36</span></span>

looking--having fixed his eyes, with significant gaze, on Jesus.

as he walked--but not now to him. To have done this once (see on [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029).md) was humility enough \[BENGEL\].

Behold, &c.--The repetition of that wonderful proclamation, in identical
terms and without another word, could only have been meant as a gentle
hint to go after Him--as they did.

FIRST GATHERING OF DISCIPLES--JOHN ANDREW, SIMON, PHILIP, NATHANAEL.
([Joh 1:37-51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#037).md)

What seek ye--gentle, winning question, remarkable as the Redeemer's
first public utterance. (See on [Mat
12:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018)..md)

where dwellest thou--that is, "That is a question we cannot answer in a
moment; but had we Thy company for a calm hour in private, gladly should
we open our burden."

[John 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 1:39</span></span>

Come and see--His second utterance, more winning still.

tenth hour--not ten A.M. (as some), according to Roman, but four P.M.,
according to Jewish reckoning, which John follows. The hour is mentioned
to show why they stayed out the day with him--because little of it
remained.

[John 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 1:40</span></span>

One . . . was Andrew--The other was doubtless our Evangelist himself.
His great sensitiveness is touchingly shown in his representation of
this first contact with the Lord; the circumstances are present to him
in the minutest details; he still remembers the Very hour. But "he
reports no particulars of those discourses of the Lord by which he was
bound to Him for the whole of His life; he allows everything personal to
retire" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

Peter's brother--and the elder of the two.

[John 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 1:41</span></span>

have found the Messias--The previous preparation of their simple hearts
under the Baptist's ministry, made quick work of this blessed
conviction, while others hesitated till doubt settled into obduracy. So
it is still.

[John 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 1:42</span></span>

brought him to Jesus--Happy brothers that thus do to each other!

beheld him--fixed his eyes on him, with significant gaze (as [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036).md).

Cephas . . . stone--(See on [Mat
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md).

[John 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 1:43</span></span>

would go . . . into Galilee--for from His baptism He had sojourned in
Judea (showing that the calling at the Sea of Galilee \[[Mat
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018.md)\] was a subsequent one, see on
[Luk 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001).md).

Follow me--the first express call given, the former three having come to
Him spontaneously.

[John 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">joh 1:44</span></span>

the city of Andrew and Peter--of their birth probably, for they seem to
have lived at Capernaum ([Mar 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029).md).

[John 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">joh 1:45</span></span>

Nathanael--(See on [Mat 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#003).md).

Moses--(See [Joh 5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046).md).

son of Joseph--the current way of speaking. (See [Luk
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023).md).

[John 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">joh 1:46</span></span>

any good out of Nazareth--remembering Bethlehem, perhaps, as Messiah's
predicted birthplace, and Nazareth having no express prophetic place at
all, besides being in no repute. The question sprang from mere dread of
mistake in a matter so vital.

Come and see--Noble remedy against preconceived opinions \[BENGEL\].
Philip, though he could not perhaps solve his difficulty, could show him
how to get rid of it. (See on [Joh
6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068).md).

[John 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">joh 1:47</span></span>

an Israelite indeed . . . no guile--not only no hypocrite, but with a
guileless simplicity not always found even in God's own people, ready to
follow wherever truth might lead him, saying, Samuel-like, "Speak, Lord,
for Thy servant heareth" ([Sa1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010).md).

[John 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">joh 1:48</span></span>

Whence knowest thou me--conscious that his very heart had been read, and
at this critical moment more than ever before.

Before Philip called thee--showing He knew all that passed between
Philip and him at a distance.

when . . . under the fig tree, &c.--where retirement for meditation and
prayer was not uncommon \[LIGHTFOOT\]. Thither, probably--hearing that
his master's Master had at length appeared, and heaving with mingled
eagerness to behold Him and dread of deception--he had retired to pour
out his guileless heart for light and guidance, ending with such a
prayer as this, "Show me a token for good!" (See on [Luk
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008).md). Now he has it, "Thou guileless
one, that fig tree scene, with all its heaving anxieties, deep pleadings
and tremulous hopes--I saw it all." The first words of Jesus had
astonished, but this quite overpowered and won him.

[John 1:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">joh 1:49</span></span>

Son of God . . . King of Israel--the one denoting His person, the other
His office. How much loftier this than anything Philip had said to him!
But just as the earth's vital powers, the longer they are frost-bound,
take the greater spring when at length set free, so souls, like
Nathanael and Thomas (see on [Joh
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028).md), the outgoings of whose faith
are hindered for a time, take the start of their more easy-going
brethren when loosed and let go.

[John 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">joh 1:50</span></span>

Because I said, &c.--"So quickly convinced, and on this evidence
only?"--an expression of admiration.

[John 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">joh 1:51</span></span>

Hereafter, &c.--The key to this great saying is Jacob's vision ([Gen
28:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#012).md), to which the allusion
plainly is. To show the patriarch that though alone and friendless on
earth his interests were busying all heaven, he was made to see "heaven
opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon a" mystic
"ladder reaching from heaven to earth." "By and by," says Jesus here,
"ye shall see this communication between heaven and earth thrown wide
open, and the Son of man the real Ladder of this intercourse."
