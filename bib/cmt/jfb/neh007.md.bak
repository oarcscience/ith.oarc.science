### [Nehemiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 7:2</span></span>

NEHEMIAH COMMITS THE CHARGE OF JERUSALEM TO HANANI AND HANANIAH. ([Neh
7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#001).md)

I gave my brother Hanani . . . charge over Jerusalem--If, as is commonly
supposed, Nehemiah was now contemplating a return to Shushan according
to his promise, it was natural that he should wish to entrust the
custody of Jerusalem and the management of its civic affairs to men on
whose ability, experience, and fidelity, he could confide. Hanani, a
near relative ([Neh 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#002).md), was one, and
with him was associated, as colleague, Hananiah, "the ruler of the
palace"--that is, the marshal or chamberlain of the viceregal court,
which Nehemiah had maintained in Jerusalem. The high religious
principle, as well as the patriotic spirit of those two men, recommended
them as pre-eminently qualified for being invested with an official
trust of such peculiar importance.

and feared God above many--The piety of Hananiah is especially mentioned
as the ground of his eminent fidelity in the discharge of all his duties
and, consequently, the reason of the confidence which Nehemiah reposed
in him; for he was fully persuaded that Hananiah's fear of God would
preserve him from those temptations to treachery and unfaithfulness
which he was likely to encounter on the governor's departure from
Jerusalem.

[Nehemiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">neh 7:3</span></span>

Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot, &c.--In
the East it is customary to open the gates of a city at sunrise, and to
bar them at sunset--a rule which is very rarely, and not except to
persons of authority, infringed upon. Nehemiah recommended that the
gates of Jerusalem should not be opened so early; a precaution necessary
at a time when the enemy was practising all sorts of dangerous
stratagems, to ensure that the inhabitants were all astir and enjoyed
the benefit of clear broad daylight for observing the suspicious
movements of any enemy. The propriety of regularly barring the gates at
sunset was, in this instance, accompanied with the appointment of a
number of the people to act as sentinels, each mounting guard in front
of his own house.

[Nehemiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">neh 7:4</span></span>

Now the city was large and great--The walls being evidently built on the
old foundations, the city covered a large extent of surface, as all
Oriental towns do, the houses standing apart with gardens and orchards
intervening. This extent, in the then state of Jerusalem, was the more
observable as the population was comparatively small, and the
habitations of the most rude and simple construction--mere wooden sheds
or coverings of loose, unmortared stones.

[Nehemiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">neh 7:5</span></span>

GENEALOGY OF THOSE WHO CAME AT THE FIRST OUT OF BABYLON. (Neh. 7:5-38)

my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, &c.--The
arrangement about to be described, though dictated by mere common
prudence, is, in accordance with the pious feelings of Nehemiah,
ascribed not to his own prudence or reflection, but to the grace of God
prompting and directing him. He resolved to prepare a register of the
returned exiles, containing an exact record of the family and ancestral
abode of every individual. While thus directing his attention, he
discovered a register of the first detachment who had come under the
care of Zerubbabel. It is transcribed in the following verses, and
differs in some few particulars from that given in Ezra 2:1-61. But the
discrepancy is sufficiently accounted for from the different
circumstances in which the two registers were taken; that of Ezra having
been made up at Babylon, while that of Nehemiah was drawn out in Judea,
after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt. The lapse of so many
years might well be expected to make a difference appear in the
catalogue, through death or other causes; in particular, one person
being, according to Jewish custom, called by different names. Thus
Hariph ([Neh 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#024).md) is the same as
Jorah ([Ezr 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#018).md), Sia ([Neh
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#047).md) the same as Siaha ([Ezr
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#044).md), &c. Besides other purposes to
which this genealogy of the nobles, rulers, and people was subservient,
one leading object contemplated by it was to ascertain with accuracy the
parties to whom the duty legally belonged of ministering at the altar
and conducting the various services of the temple. For guiding to exact
information in this important point of enquiry, the possession of the
old register of Zerubbabel was invaluable.

[Nehemiah 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">neh 7:39</span></span>

OF THE PRIESTS. (Neh. 7:39-73)

The priests--It appears that only four of the courses of the priests
returned from the captivity; and that the course of Abia ([Luk
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005).md) is not in the list. But it must
be noticed that these four courses were afterwards divided into
twenty-four, which retained the names of the original courses which
David appointed.

[Nehemiah 7:70](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#070.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">neh 7:70</span></span>

And some of the chief of the fathers, &c.--With [Neh
7:69](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#069.md) the register ends, and the thread
of Nehemiah's history is resumed. He was the tirshatha, or governor, and
the liberality displayed by him and some of the leading men for the
suitable equipment of the ministers of religion, forms the subject of
the remaining portion of the chapter. Their donations consisted
principally in garments. This would appear a singular description of
gifts to be made by any one among us; but, in the East, a present of
garments, or of any article of use, is conformable to the prevailing
sentiments and customs of society.

drams of gold--that is, darics. A daric was a gold coin of ancient
Persia, worth Â£1 5s.

[Nehemiah 7:71](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">neh 7:71</span></span>

pound of silver--that is, mina (sixty shekels, or Â£9).

[Nehemiah 7:73](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#073.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">neh 7:73</span></span>

So . . . all Israel, dwelt in their cities--The utility of these
genealogical registers was thus found in guiding to a knowledge of the
cities and localities in each tribe to which every family anciently
belonged.
