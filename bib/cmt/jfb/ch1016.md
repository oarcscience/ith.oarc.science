### [1 Chronicles Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001)

[1 Chronicles 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 16:2</span></span>

DAVID'S FESTIVAL SACRIFICE AND LIBERALITY TO THE PEOPLE. ([Ch1
16:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001))

he blessed the people in the name of the Lord--The king commended their
zeal, supplicated the divine blessing upon them, and ordered the remains
of the thank offerings which had been profusely sacrificed during the
procession, to be distributed in certain proportions to every
individual, that the ceremonial might terminate with appropriate
festivities ([Deu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007)).

[1 Chronicles 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 16:3</span></span>

flagon of wine--The two latter words are a supplement by our
translators, and the former is, in other versions, rendered not a
"flagon," but a "cake," a confection, as the Septuagint renders it, made
of flour and honey.

[1 Chronicles 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 16:4</span></span>

he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the
Lord--No sooner was the ark deposited in its tent than the Levites, who
were to officiate in the choirs before it, entered upon their duties. A
select number of the musicians were chosen for the service from the list
([Ch1 15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019)) of those who had taken
a prominent part in the recent procession. The same arrangement was to
be observed in their duties, now that the ark again was stationary;
Asaph, with his associates, composing the first or principal company,
played with cymbals; Zechariah and his colleagues, with whom were
conjoined Jeiel and Obed-edom, forming the second company, used harps
and similar instruments.

[1 Chronicles 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 16:5</span></span>

Jeiel--the same as Aziel ([Ch1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020)).

[1 Chronicles 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 16:6</span></span>

Benaiah also and Jahaziel--The name of the former is mentioned among the
priests ([Ch1 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024)), but not the
latter. The office assigned to them was that of blowing trumpets at
regular intervals before the ark and in the tabernacle.

[1 Chronicles 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 16:7</span></span>

HIS PSALM OF THANKSGIVING. (1Ch. 16:7-43)

Then on that day David delivered first this psalm--Among the other
preparations for this solemn inauguration, the royal bard had composed a
special hymn for the occasion. Doubtless it had been previously in the
hands of Asaph and his assistants, but it was now publicly committed to
them as they entered for the first time on the performance of their
sacred duties. It occupies the greater part of this chapter (1Ch.
16:8-36), and seems to have been compiled from other psalms of David,
previously known to the Israelites, as the whole of it will be found,
with very slight variations, in [Psa
96:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001); [Psa
105:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#001); [Psa
106:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047). In the form, however, in
which it is given by the sacred historian, it seems to have been the
first psalm given for use in the tabernacle service. Abounding, as it
does, with the liveliest ascriptions of praise to God for the revelation
of His glorious character and the display of His marvellous works and
containing, as it does, so many pointed allusions to the origin,
privileges, and peculiar destiny of the chosen people, it was admirably
calculated to animate the devotions and call forth the gratitude of the
assembled multitude.

[1 Chronicles 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 16:36</span></span>

all the people said, Amen--(Compare [Psa
72:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019); [Psa
106:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#048)). In the former, the author of
the doxology utters the "amen" himself, while in the latter the people
are exhorted to say "amen." This may arise from the fact that the latter
psalm originally concluded with the injunction to say "amen." But in
this historical account of the festival, it was necessary to relate that
the people obeyed this injunction on the occasion referred to, and
therefore the words "let them praise," were altered into "and they
praised" \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">ch1 16:37</span></span>

So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Asaph and
his brethren, &c.--The sequel of the chapter describes the appointment
of the sacred musicians and their respective duties.

[1 Chronicles 16:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">ch1 16:38</span></span>

Obed-edom with their brethren--Hosah, mentioned at the close of the
verse, and a great number besides (see on [Ch1
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#001)).

to be porters--doorkeepers.

[1 Chronicles 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 16:39</span></span>

And Zadok . . . before the tabernacle . . . at Gibeon--While the
above-mentioned officers under the superintendence of Abiathar, were
appointed to officiate in Jerusalem, whither the ark had been brought,
Zadok and the priests subordinate to him were stationed at Gibeon to
perform the sacred service before the ancient tabernacle which still
remained there.

[1 Chronicles 16:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 16:40</span></span>

continually morning and evening--as the law enjoined ([Exo
29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038); [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003), [Num
28:6](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#006)).

and do according to all that is written in the law--(See Num. 28:1-31).
Thus, in the time of David, the worship was performed at two places,
where the sacred things that had been transmitted from the age of Moses
were preserved. Before the Ark in Jerusalem, Asaph and his brethren
officiated as singers, Obed-edom and Hosah served as doorkeepers, and
Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets. While at the tabernacle and
burnt offering in Gibeon, Heman and Jeduthun presided over the sacred
music, the sons of Jeduthun were door keepers, and Zadok, with his suite
of attendant priests, offered the sacrifices.
