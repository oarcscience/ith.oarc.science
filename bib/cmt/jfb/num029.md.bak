### [Numbers Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 29:1</span></span>

THE OFFERING AT THE FEAST OF TRUMPETS. (Num. 29:1-40)

in the seventh month--of the ecclesiastical year, but the first month of
the civil year, corresponding to our September. It was, in fact, the New
Year's Day, which had been celebrated among the Hebrews and other
contemporary nations with great festivity and joy and ushered in by a
flourish of trumpets. This ordinance was designed to give a religious
character to the occasion by associating it with some solemn
observances. (Compare [Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002.md); [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024).md).

it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you--This made it a solemn
preparation for the sacred feasts--a greater number of which were held
during this month than at any other season of the year. Although the
institution of this feast was described before, there is more
particularity here as to what the burnt offering should consist of; and,
in addition to it, a sin offering is prescribed. The special offerings,
appointed for certain days, were not to interfere with the offerings
usually requisite on these days, for in [Num
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#006.md) it is said that the daily
offerings, as well as those for the first day of the month, were to take
place in their ordinary course.

[Numbers 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 29:7</span></span>

ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy
convocation--This was the great day of atonement. Its institution,
together with the observance to which that day was devoted, was
described ([Lev 16:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029).md). But
additional offerings seem to be noticed, namely, the large animal
sacrifice for a general expiation, which was a sweet savor unto the
Lord, and the sin offering to atone for the sins that mingled with that
day's services. The prescriptions in this passage appear supplementary
to the former statement in Leviticus.

[Numbers 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 29:12</span></span>

on the fifteenth day--was to be held the feast of booths or tabernacles.
(See [Lev 23:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034).md). The feast was to
last seven days, the first and last of which were to be kept as
Sabbaths, and a particular offering was prescribed for each day, the
details of which are given with a minuteness suited to the infant state
of the church. Two things are deserving of notice: First, that this
feast was distinguished by a greater amount and variety of sacrifices
than any other--partly because, occurring at the end of the year, it
might be intended to supply any past deficiencies--partly because, being
immediately after the ingathering of the fruits, it ought to be a
liberal acknowledgment--and partly, perhaps, because God consulted the
weakness of mankind, who naturally grow weary both of the charge and
labor of such services when they are long-continued, and made them every
day less toilsome and expensive \[PATRICK\]. Secondly, it will be
remarked that the sacrifices varied in a progressive ratio of decrease
every day.

[Numbers 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 29:18</span></span>

after the manner--according to the ritual order appointed by divine
authority--that for meat offerings ([Num
29:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#003).md), and drink offerings ([Num
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#007.md), [Num
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#014).md).

[Numbers 29:35](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">num 29:35</span></span>

On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly--The feast of
tabernacles was brought to a close on the eighth day, which was the
great day ([Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). Besides the
common routine sacrifices, there were special offerings appointed for
that day though these were fewer than on any of the preceding days; and
there were also, as was natural on that occasion when vast multitudes
were convened for a solemn religious purpose, many spontaneous gifts and
services, so that there was full scope for the exercise of a devout
spirit in the people, both for their obedience to the statutory
offerings, and by the presentation of those which were made by free will
or in consequence of vows.

[Numbers 29:39](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">num 29:39</span></span>

These things ye shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts--From the
statements made in this and the preceding chapter, it appears that the
yearly offerings made to the altar at the public expense, without taking
into account a vast number of voluntary vow and trespass offerings, were
calculated at the following amount:--goats, fifteen; kids, twenty-one;
rams, seventy-two; bullocks, one hundred thirty-two; lambs, 1,101;
sum-total of animals sacrificed at public cost, 1,241. This, of course,
is exclusive of the prodigious addition of lambs slain at the passover,
which in later times, according to JOSEPHUS, amounted in a single year
to the immense number of 255,600.
