[2 Timothy](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">ti2 0:0</span></span>

PLACE OF WRITING.--Paul, in the interval between his first and second
imprisonment, after having written First Timothy from Macedonia or
Corinth \[BIRKS\] (if we are to adopt the opinion that First Timothy was
written after his first imprisonment), returned to Ephesus, as he
intended, by way of Troas, where he left the books, &c. (mentioned in
[Ti2 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013).md), with Carpus. From Ephesus
he went to Crete for a short visit and returned, and then wrote to
Titus. Next he went by Miletus to Corinth ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md), and thence to Nicopolis ([Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).md), whence he proceeded to Rome.
From his prison there he wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, shortly
before his martyrdom. It is not certain where Timothy was at this time.
Some of the internal evidences favor the view of his having been then at
Ephesus; thus the salutation of Priscilla and Aquila, who generally
resided there ([Ti2 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019).md); also that
of the household of Onesiphorus, who is stated in [Ti2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md) to have ministered to Paul at
Ephesus, a circumstance implying his residence there. Also, the
HymenÃ&brvbr;us of [Ti2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md) seems to
be the same as the HymenÃ&brvbr;us at Ephesus ([Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md); and probably "Alexander the
coppersmith" ([Ti2 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md) is the same
as the Alexander joined with HymenÃ&brvbr;us ([Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md), and possibly the same as the
Alexander put forward by the Jews to clear themselves, not to befriend
Paul, at the riot in Ephesus ([Act
19:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033).md). The difficulty is, on this
supposition, how to account for [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md), [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md) : if Timothy was at Ephesus, why
did he need to be told that Paul had sent Tychicus to Ephesus? or that
Paul had left Trophimus, himself an Ephesian ([Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029).md), sick at Miletus, which was
only thirty miles from Ephesus? However, see on [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020.md). Troas lay on the road to Rome
from either Ephesus or Pontus, so that [Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013.md) will accord with the theory of
either Ephesus or any other place in the northwest of Asia Minor, being
Timothy's place of sojourn at the time. Probably, he had the general
superintendence of the Pauline churches in Asia Minor, in accordance
with his mission combining the office of evangelist, or itinerant
missionary, with that of presiding overseer. Ephesus was probably his
headquarters.

TIME OF WRITING.--(1) Paul's first imprisonment, described in [Act
28:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017.md), was much milder than that in
which he was when writing Second Timothy. In the former, he had liberty
to lodge in his own hired house, and to receive all comers, guarded only
by a single soldier; in the latter, he was so closely confined that
Onesiphorus with difficulty found him; he was chained, his friends had
forsaken him, and he had narrowly escaped sentence of execution from the
Roman emperor. Medieval legends represent the Mamertine prison, or
Tullianum, as the scene of his incarceration with Peter. But this is
irreconcilable with the fact of Onesiphorus, Linus, Pudens, &c., having
access to him. He was probably under military custody, as in his former
imprisonment, though of a severer kind ([Ti2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016.md); [Ti2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md); [Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md), [Ti2
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)). (2.md) The visit to Troas ([Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013).md) can hardly have been that
mentioned in [Act 20:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005.md), the last
before his first imprisonment; for, if it were, the interval between
that visit and the first imprisonment would be seven or eight years, a
period most unlikely for him to have allowed to pass without sending for
his cloak and parchments, when they might have been of service to him in
the interim. (3) Paul's leaving Trophimus sick at Miletus ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md), could not have been on the
occasion mentioned in [Act 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015.md); for,
subsequent to that, Trophimus was with Paul in Jerusalem ([Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029)). (4.md) The words ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020).md), "Erastus abode at Corinth,"
imply that Paul had shortly before been at Corinth, where he left
Erastus. But before his first imprisonment, Paul had not been at Corinth
for several years; and in the interval Timothy had been with him, so
that Timothy did not need at a later period to be told about that visit
([Act 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002.md), [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004).md). For all these reasons the
imprisonment, during which he wrote Second Timothy, is shown to be his
second imprisonment. Moreover, [Heb
13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md), represents the writer (who
was probably Paul) as in Italy, and at liberty. So CLEMENT OF ROME
\[First Epistle to the Corinthians, 1.5\], the disciple of Paul,
explicitly states, "In the east and west, Paul as a preacher instructed
the whole world (that is, the Roman empire) in righteousness, and having
gone to the extremity of the west, and having borne witness before the
rulers (of Rome), he so was removed from the world." This plainly
implies that he fulfilled his design ([Rom
15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024).md) of a missionary journey into
Spain. The canon of the New Testament, compiled about A.D. 170 (called
MURATORI'S Canon), also mentions "the journey of Paul from Rome to
Spain." See ROUTH \[Sacred Fragments, vol. 4, p. 1-12\].

His martyrdom is universally said to have occurred in Nero's reign
\[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 2.22; JEROME, On Illustrious Men\].
Five years thus seem to have elapsed between the first imprisonment,
A.D. 63 ([Act 28:17-31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017).md), and his
martyrdom, June A.D. 68, the last year of Nero's reign. He was probably
arrested by the magistrates in Nicopolis ([Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).md) in Epirus, in the winter, on a
double charge, first, of being one of the Christians who had conspired,
it was alleged by Nero's partisans, to set fire to Rome, A.D. 64;
secondly, of introducing a novel and unlawful religion. His friends all
left him, except Luke: Demas from "love of this present world": the
others from various causes ([Ti2
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010).md). On the first charge he seems
to have been acquitted. His liberation from his first imprisonment took
place in A.D. 63, the year before the great fire at Rome, which Nero
made the pretext for his persecution of the Christians. Every cruelty
was heaped on them; some were crucified; some were arrayed in the skins
of wild beasts and hunted to death by dogs; some were wrapped in
pitch-robes and set on fire by night to illuminate the circus of the
Vatican and gardens of Nero, while that monster mixed among the
spectators in the garb of a charioteer. But now (A.D. 67 or 68) some
years had elapsed since the first excitement which followed the fire.
Hence, Paul, being a Roman citizen, was treated in his trial with a
greater respect for the forms of the law, and hence was acquitted ([Ti2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017).md) on the first charge of having
instigated the Christians to their supposed acts of incendiarism before
his last departure from Rome. Alexander the coppersmith seems to have
been a witness against him ([Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md). Had he been condemned on the
first charge, he would probably have been burnt alive, as the preceding
martyrs were, for arson. His judge was the city PrÃ&brvbr;fect. CLEMENT
OF ROME specifies that his trial was (not before the emperor, but)
"before the rulers." No advocate ventured to plead his cause, no patron
appeared for him, such as under ordinary circumstances might have aided
him; for instance, one of the powerful Ã†milian house, under which his
family possibly enjoyed clientship ([Ti2
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016).md), whence he may have taken his
name Paul. The place of trial was, probably, one of the great basilicas
in the Forum, two of which were called the Pauline Basilicas, from L.
Ã†milius Paulus, who had built one and restored the other. He was
remanded for the second stage of his trial. He did not expect this to
come on until the following "winter" ([Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021).md), whereas it took place about
midsummer; if in Nero's reign, not later than June. In the interim Luke
was his only constant companion; but one friend from Asia, Onesiphorus,
had diligently sought him and visited him in prison, undeterred by the
danger. Linus, too, the future bishop of Rome, Pudens, the son of a
senator, and Claudia, his bride, perhaps the daughter of a British king
(see on [Ti2 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021).md), were among his
visitors; and Tychicus, before he was sent by Paul to Ephesus ([Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012.md); perhaps bearing with him this
Epistle).

OBJECT OF THE EPISTLE.--He was anxious to see his disciple Timothy,
before his death, and that Timothy should bring Mark with him ([Ti2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md); [Ti2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md), [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md), [Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021).md). But feeling how uncertain it
was whether Timothy should arrive in time, he felt it necessary, also,
to give him by letter a last warning as to the heresies, the germs of
which were then being scattered in the Churches. Hence he writes a
series of exhortations to faithfulness, and zeal for sound doctrine, and
patience amidst trials: a charge which Timothy seems to have needed, if
we are to judge from the apostle's earnestness in urging him to boldness
in Christ's cause, as though Paul thought he saw in him some signs of
constitutional timidity ([Ti2 2:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md);
[Ti2 4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md); [Ti1
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022).md).

PAUL'S DEATH.--DIOYSIUS, bishop of Corinth (quoted in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 2.25\]) about A.D. 170, is the earliest
authority for the tradition that Peter suffered martyrdom at Rome "about
the same time" as Paul, after having labored for some time there. He
calls Peter and Paul "the founders of the Corinthian and Roman
Churches." The Roman presbyter, CAIUS (about A.D. 200), mentions the
tradition that Peter suffered martyrdom in the Vatican. But (1) Peter's
work was among the Jews ([Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009).md),
whereas Rome was a Gentile Church ([Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013). Moreover, (2.md) the First Epistle
of Peter ([Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md); [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md) represents him as laboring in
Babylon in Mesopotamia. (3) The silence concerning Peter of Paul's
Epistles written in Rome, negatives the tradition of his having founded,
or labored long at Rome; though it is possible he may have endured
martyrdom there. His martyrdom, certainly, was not, as JEROME says, "on
the same day" with that of Paul, else Paul would have mentioned Peter's
being at Rome in [Ti2 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011.md). The legend
says that Peter, through fear, was fleeing from Rome at early dawn by
the Appian Way, when he met our Lord, and falling at His feet, asked,
Lord, whither goest thou? to which the Lord replied, I go again to be
crucified. The disciple returned penitent and ashamed, and was martyred.
The Church of Domine quo vadis, on the Appian Way, commemorates the
supposed fact. Paul, according to CAIUS (quoted in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 2.25\]), suffered martyrdom on the Ostian Way.
So also JEROME, who gives the date, the fourteenth year of Nero. It was
common to send prisoners, whose death might attract too much notice at
Rome, to some distance from the city, under a military escort, for
execution; hence the soldier's sword, not the executioner's axe, was the
instrument of his decapitation \[OROSIUS, The Seven Books of History
against the Pagans, 7.7\]. Paul appears, from Phi. 1:12-30, to have had
his partisans even in the palace, and certainly must have exercised such
an influence as would excite sympathy in his behalf, to avoid which the
execution was ordered outside the city. Compare TACITUS \[Histories,
4.11\]. The Basilica of St. Paul, first built by Constantine, now stands
outside Rome on the road to Ostia: before the Reformation it was under
the protection of the kings of England, and the emblem of the order of
the Garter is still to be seen among its decorations. The traditional
spot of the martyrdom is the Tre Fontane, not far from the Basilica
\[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].
