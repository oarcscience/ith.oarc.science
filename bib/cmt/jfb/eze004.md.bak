### [Ezekiel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 4:1</span></span>

SYMBOLICAL VISION OF THE SIEGE AND THE INIQUITY-BEARING. (Eze. 4:1-17)

tile--a sun-dried brick, such as are found in Babylon, covered with
cuneiform inscriptions, often two feet long and one foot broad.

[Ezekiel 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 4:2</span></span>

forth--rather, "watch tower" ([Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004).md) wherein the besieges could watch
the movements of the besieged \[GESENIUS\]. A wall of circumvallation
\[Septuagint and ROSENMULLER\]. A kind of battering-ram \[MAURER\]. The
first view is best.

a mount--wherewith the Chaldeans could be defended from missiles.

battering-rams--literally, "through-borers." In [Eze
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022.md) the same Hebrew is translated
"captains."

[Ezekiel 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 4:3</span></span>

iron pan--the divine decree as to the Chaldean army investing the city.

set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city--Ezekiel, in the
person of God, represents the wall of separation between him and the
people as one of iron: and the Chaldean investing army. His instrument
of separating them from him, as one impossible to burst through.

set . . . face against it--inexorably ([Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016).md). The exiles envied their
brethren remaining in Jerusalem, but exile is better than the straitness
of a siege.

[Ezekiel 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 4:4</span></span>

Another symbolical act performed at the same time as the former, in
vision, not in external action, wherein it would have been only puerile:
narrated as a thing ideally done, it would make a vivid impression. The
second action is supplementary to the first, to bring out more fully the
same prophetic idea.

left side--referring to the position of the ten tribes, the northern
kingdom, as Judah, the southern, answers to "the right side" ([Eze
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006).md). The Orientals facing the east in
their mode, had the north on their left, and the south on their right
([Eze 16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046).md). Also the right was more
honorable than the left: so Judah as being the seat of the temple, was
more so than Israel.

bear the iniquity--iniquity being regarded as a burden; so it means,
"bear the punishment of their iniquity" ([Num
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034).md). A type of Him who was the
great sin-bearer, not in mimic show as Ezekiel, but in reality ([Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), [Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md), [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 4:5</span></span>

three hundred and ninety days--The three hundred ninety years of
punishment appointed for Israel, and forty for Judah, cannot refer to
the siege of Jerusalem. That siege is referred to in [Eze
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001.md), and in a sense restricted to
the literal siege, but comprehending the whole train of punishment to be
inflicted for their sin; therefore we read here merely of its sore
pressure, not of its result. The sum of three hundred ninety and forty
years is four hundred thirty, a period famous in the history of the
covenant-people, being that of their sojourn in Egypt ([Exo
12:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#040.md); [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md). The forty alludes to the forty
years in the wilderness. Elsewhere ([Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003).md), God threatened to bring them
back to Egypt, which must mean, not Egypt literally, but a bondage as
bad as that one in Egypt. So now God will reduce them to a kind of new
Egyptian bondage to the world: Israel, the greater transgressor, for a
longer period than Judah (compare [Eze
20:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035).md). Not the whole of the four
hundred thirty years of the Egypt state is appointed to Israel; but this
shortened by the forty years of the wilderness sojourn, to imply, that a
way is open to their return to life by their having the Egypt state
merged into that of the wilderness; that is, by ceasing from idolatry
and seeking in their sifting and sore troubles, through God's covenant,
a restoration to righteousness and peace \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The three
hundred ninety, in reference to the sin of Israel, was also literally
true, being the years from the setting up of the calves by Jeroboam
([Kg1 12:20-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#020).md), that is, from 975 to
583 B.C.: about the year of the Babylonians captivity; and perhaps the
forty of Judah refers to that part of Manasseh's fifty-five year's reign
in which he had not repented, and which, we are expressly told, was the
cause of God's removal of Judah, notwithstanding Josiah's reformation
([Kg1 21:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#010.md); [Kg2
23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026).md).

[Ezekiel 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 4:6</span></span>

each day for a year--literally, "a day for a year, a day for a year."
Twice repeated, to mark more distinctly the reference to [Num
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#034.md). The picturing of the future
under the image of the past, wherein the meaning was far from lying on
the surface, was intended to arouse to a less superficial mode of
thinking, just as the partial veiling of truth in Jesus' parables was
designed to stimulate inquiry; also to remind men that God's dealings in
the past are a key to the future, for He moves on the same everlasting
principles, the forms alone being transitory.

[Ezekiel 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 4:7</span></span>

arm . . . uncovered--to be ready for action, which the long Oriental
garment usually covered it would prevent ([Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010).md).

thou shalt prophesy against it--This gesture of thine will be a tacit
prophecy against it.

[Ezekiel 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 4:8</span></span>

bands-- ([Eze 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#025).md).

not turn from . . . side--to imply the impossibility of their being able
to shake off the punishment.

[Ezekiel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 4:9</span></span>

wheat . . . barley, &c.--Instead of simple flour used for delicate cakes
([Gen 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006).md), the Jews should have a
coarse mixture of six different kinds of grain, such as the poorest
alone would eat.

fitches--spelt or dhourra.

three hundred and ninety--The forty days are omitted, since these latter
typify the wilderness period when Israel stood separate from the
Gentiles and their pollution, though partially chastened by stint of
bread and water ([Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016).md), whereas
the eating of the polluted bread in the three hundred ninety days
implies a forced residence "among the Gentiles" who were polluted with
idolatry ([Eze 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013).md). This last is
said of "Israel" primarily, as being the most debased ([Eze
4:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#009).md); they had spiritually sunk to
a level with the heathen, therefore God will make their condition
outwardly to correspond. Judah and Jerusalem fare less severely, being
less guilty: they are to "eat bread by weight and with care," that is,
have a stinted supply and be chastened with the milder discipline of the
wilderness period. But Judah also is secondarily referred to in the
three hundred ninety days, as having fallen, like Israel, into Gentile
defilements; if, then, the Jews are to escape from the exile among
Gentiles, which is their just punishment, they must submit again to the
wilderness probation ([Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 4:10</span></span>

twenty shekels--that is, little more than ten ounces; a scant measure to
sustain life ([Jer 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md). But it
applies not only to the siege, but to their whole subsequent state.

[Ezekiel 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 4:11</span></span>

sixth . . . of . . . hin--about a pint and a half.

[Ezekiel 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 4:12</span></span>

dung--as fuel; so the Arabs use beasts' dung, wood fuel being scarce.
But to use human dung so implies the most cruel necessity. It was in
violation of the law ([Deu 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#003.md); [Deu
23:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#012).md); it must therefore have been
done only in vision.

[Ezekiel 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 4:13</span></span>

Implying that Israel's peculiar distinction was to be abolished and that
they were to be outwardly blended with the idolatrous heathen ([Deu
28:68](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 4:14</span></span>

Ezekiel, as a priest, had been accustomed to the strictest abstinence
from everything legally impure. Peter felt the same scruple at a similar
command ([Act 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#014.md); compare [Isa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004).md). Positive precepts, being
dependent on a particular command can be set aside at the will of the
divine ruler; but moral precepts are everlasting in their obligation
because God cannot be inconsistent with His unchanging moral nature.

abominable flesh--literally, "flesh that stank from putridity." Flesh of
animals three days killed was prohibited ([Lev
7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#017.md); [Lev
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 4:15</span></span>

cow's dung--a mitigation of the former order ([Eze
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#012).md); no longer "the dung of man";
still the bread so baked is "defiled," to imply that, whatever partial
abatement there might be for the prophet's sake, the main decree of God,
as to the pollution of Israel by exile among Gentiles, is unalterable.

[Ezekiel 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 4:16</span></span>

staff of bread--bread by which life is supported, as a man's weight is
by the staff he leans on ([Lev 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md);
[Psa 105:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#016.md); [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001).md).

by weight, and with care--in scant measure ([Eze
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 4:17</span></span>

astonied one with another--mutually regard one another with
astonishment: the stupefied look of despairing want.
