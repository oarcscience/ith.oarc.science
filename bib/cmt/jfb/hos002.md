### [Hosea Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 2:1</span></span>

APPLICATION OF THE SYMBOLS IN THE FIRST CHAPTER. (Hos. 2:1-23)

Israel's spiritual fornication, and her threatened punishment: yet a
promise of God's restored favor, when chastisements have produced their
designed effect.

Say . . . unto . . . brethren, Ammi, &c.--that is, When the prediction
([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).md) shall be accomplished,
then ye will call one another, as brothers and sisters in the family of
God, Ammi and Ruhamah.

[Hosea 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 2:2</span></span>

Plead--expostulate.

mother--that is the nation collectively. The address is to "her
children," that is, to the individual citizens of the state (compare
[Isa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md).

for she is not my wife--She has deprived herself of her high privilege
by spiritual adultery.

out of her sight--rather, "from her face." Her very countenance
unblushingly betrayed her lust, as did also her exposed "breasts."

[Hosea 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 2:3</span></span>

set her as in the day . . . born-- ([Eze
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md); [Eze
23:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md), [Eze
23:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#028).md). The day of her political
"birth" was when God delivered her from the bondage of Egypt, and set up
the theocracy.

make her as a wilderness-- ([Jer 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md);
[Zep 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013).md). Translate, "make her as
the wilderness," namely, that in which she passed forty years on her way
to her goodly possession of Canaan. With this agrees the mention of
"thirst" (compare [Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006).md).

[Hosea 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 2:4</span></span>

her children--Not even her individual members shall escape the doom of
the nation collectively, for they are individually guilty.

[Hosea 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 2:5</span></span>

I will go after--The Hebrew expresses a settled determination.

lovers--the idols which Israel fancied to be the givers of all their
goods, whereas God gave all these goods ([Hos
2:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md); compare [Jer
44:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017).md).

bread and . . . water--the necessaries of life in food.

wool . . . flax--clothing.

oil . . . drink--perfumed unguents and palatable drinks: the luxuries of
Hebrew life.

[Hosea 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 2:6</span></span>

thorns . . . wall-- ([Job 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#008.md); [Lam
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007.md), [Lam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009).md). The hindrances which the
captivity interposed between Israel and her idols. As she attributes all
her temporal blessings to idols, I will reduce her to straits in which,
when she in vain has sought help from false gods, she will at last seek
Me as her only God and Husband, as at the first ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md); [Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008).md).

then--before Israel's apostasy, under Jeroboam. The way of duty is
hedged about with thorns; it is the way of sin that is hedged up with
thorns. Crosses in an evil course are God's hedges to turn us from it.
Restraining grace and restraining providences (even sicknesses and
trials) are great blessings when they stop us in a course of sin.
Compare [Luk 15:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#014.md), "I will arise,
and go to my father." So here, "I will go, and return," &c.; crosses in
the both cases being sanctified to produce this effect.

[Hosea 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 2:8</span></span>

she did not know that I--not the idols, as she thought: the "lovers"
alluded to in [Hos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md).

which they prepared for Baal--that is, of which they made images of
Baal, or at least the plate covering of them ([Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md). Baal was the PhÅ“nician sun-god:
answering to the female Astarte, the moon-goddess. The name of the idol
is found in the PhÅ“nician Hannibal, Hasdrubal. Israel borrowed it from
the Tyrians.

[Hosea 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 2:9</span></span>

my corn . . . my wool . . . my flax--in contrast to "my bread . . . my
wool . . . my flax," ([Hos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005).md).
Compare also [Hos 2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md), on God as
the great First Cause giving these through secondary instruments in
nature. "Return, and take away," is equivalent to, "I will take back
again," namely, by sending storms, locusts, Assyrian enemies, &c.
"Therefore," that is, because she did not acknowledge Me as the Giver.

in the time thereof--in the harvest-time.

[Hosea 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 2:10</span></span>

lewdness--rather, "the shame of her nakedness"; laying aside the figure,
"I will expose her in her state, bereft of every necessary, before her
lovers," that is, the idols (personified, as if they could see), who,
nevertheless, can give her no help. "Discover" is appropriate to
stripping off the self-flatteries of her hypocrisy.

[Hosea 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 2:11</span></span>

her feast days--of Jeroboam's appointment, distinct from the Mosaic
([Kg1 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#032).md). However, most of the
Mosaic feasts, "new-moons" and "sabbaths" to Jehovah, remained, but to
degenerate Israel worship was a weariness; they cared only for the
carnal indulgence on them ([Amo 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005).md).

[Hosea 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 2:12</span></span>

my rewards--my hire as a harlot ([Isa
23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017).md).

lovers--idols.

destroy . . . vines . . . make . . . forest-- ([Isa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md); [Isa
7:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023).md). Fulfilled in the overthrow
of Israel by Assyria ([Hos 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004).md).

[Hosea 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 2:13</span></span>

days of Baalim--the days consecrated to the Baals, or various images of
Baal in different cities, whence the names Baal-gad, Baal-hermon, &c.

decked herself with . . . earrings--rather, "nose-rings" ([Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021.md); [Eze
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#012), Margin.md), with which harlots
decked themselves to attract admirers: answering to the ornaments in
which the Israelites decked themselves on the idols' feasts.

forgat me--worse than the nations which had never known God. Israel
wilfully apostatized from Jehovah, whom she had known.

[Hosea 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 2:14</span></span>

Therefore--rather, "Nevertheless" \[HENDERSON\]. English Version gives a
more lovely idea of God. That which would provoke all others to
unappeasable wrath, Israel's perversity and consequent punishment, is
made a reason why God should at last have mercy on her. As the
"therefore" ([Hos 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009).md) expresses
Israel's punishment as the consequence of Israel's guilt, so "therefore"
here, as in [Hos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md), expresses, that
when that punishment has effected its designed end, the hedging up her
way with thorns so that she returns to God, her first love, the
consequence in God's wondrous grace is, He "speaks comfortably"
(literally, "speaks to her heart"; compare [Jdg
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#008.md); [Rut
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#013).md). So obstinate is she that God
has to "allure her," that is, so to temper judgment with unlooked-for
grace as to win her to His ways. For this purpose it was necessary to
"bring her into the wilderness" (that is, into temporal want and trials)
first, to make her sin hateful to her by its bitter fruits, and God's
subsequent grace the more precious to her by the contrast of the
"wilderness." JEROME makes the "bringing into the wilderness" to be
rather a deliverance from her enemies, just as ancient Israel was
brought into the wilderness from the bondage of Egypt; to this the
phrase here alludes (compare [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015).md). The wilderness sojourn,
however, is not literal, but moral: while still in the land of their
enemies locally, by the discipline of the trial rendering the word of
God sweet to them, they are to be brought morally into the wilderness
state, that is, into a state of preparedness for returning to their
temporal and spiritual privileges in their own land; just as the literal
wilderness prepared their fathers for Canaan: thus the bringing of them
into the wilderness state is virtually a deliverance from their enemies.

[Hosea 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 2:15</span></span>

from thence--returning from the wilderness. God gives Israel a fresh
grant of Canaan, which she had forfeited; so of her vineyards, &c. ([Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009.md), [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md).

Achor--that is "trouble." As formerly Israel, after their tedious
journey through the wilderness, met with the trouble resulting from
Achan's crime in this valley, on the very threshold of Canaan, and yet
that trouble was presently turned into joy at the great victory at Ai,
which threw all Canaan into their hands (Jos. 7:1-8:28); so the very
trouble of Israel's wilderness state will be the "door of hope" opening
to better days. The valley of Achor, near Jericho, was specially
fruitful ([Isa 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010).md); so "trouble"
and "hope" are rightly blended in connection with it.

sing . . . as . . . when she came . . . out of . . . Egypt--It shall be
a second exodus song, such as Israel sang after the deliverance at the
Red Sea (Exo. 15:1-21; compare [Isa
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).md); and "the song of Moses"
([Rev 15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002).md) sung by those who
through the Lamb overcome the beast, and so stand on the sea of glass
mingled with fire, emblems of fiery trial, such as that of Israel at the
Red Sea.

[Hosea 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 2:16</span></span>

Ishi . . . no more Baali--"my Husband . . . no more my Lord." Affection
is the prominent idea in "Husband"; rule, in "Lord." The chief reason
for the substitution of Husband for Lord appears in [Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md); namely, Baali, the Hebrew for my
Lord, had been perverted to express the images of Baal, whose name ought
not to be taken on their lips ([Exo
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013.md); [Zac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002).md).

[Hosea 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 2:17</span></span>

Baalim--plural, expressing the various images of Baal, which, according
to the places of their erection, received various names, Baal-gad,
Baal-ammon, &c.

[Hosea 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 2:18</span></span>

for them--for their benefit.

covenant . . . with the beasts--not to hurt them ([Job
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023).md). They shall fulfil the original
law of their creation by becoming subject to man, when man fulfils the
law of his being by being subject to God. To be realized fully in
millennial times ([Isa 11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006).md).

break the bow . . . out of the earth--rather, "out of the land"; that
is, I will break and remove war out of the earth ([Psa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009).md); and "out of the land" of Israel
first ([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md); [Eze
39:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md); [Zac
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009).md).

lie down--A reclining posture is the usual one with Orientals when not
in action.

safely-- ([Jer 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006).md).

[Hosea 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hos 2:19</span></span>

"Betroth" is thrice repeated, implying the intense love of God to His
people; and perhaps, also, the three Persons of the Triune God,
severally engaging to make good the betrothal. The marriage covenant
will be as it were renewed from the beginning, on a different footing;
not for a time only, as before, through the apostasy of the people, but
"forever" through the grace of God writing the law on their hearts by
the Spirit of Messiah ([Jer 31:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031).md).

righteousness . . . judgment--in rectitude and truth.

loving-kindness, &c.--Hereby God assures Israel, who might doubt the
possibility of their restoration to His favor; low, sunk, and unworthy
as thou art. I will restore thee from a regard to My own
"loving-kindness," not thy merits.

[Hosea 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">hos 2:20</span></span>

faithfulness--to My new covenant of grace with thee ([Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Heb
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023).md).

[Hosea 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">hos 2:21</span></span>

in that day--of grace to Israel.

heavens . . . hear the earth--personification. However many be the
intermediate instruments, God is the Great First Cause of all nature's
phenomena. God had threatened ([Hos
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#009).md) He would take back His corn, His
wine, &c. Here, on the contrary, God promises to hearken to the skies,
as it were, supplicating Him to fill them with rain to pour on the
earth; and that the skies again would hearken to the earth begging for a
supply of the rain it requires; and again, that the earth would hearken
to the corn, wine, and oil, begging it to bring them forth; and these
again would hear Jezreel, that is, would fulfil Israel's prayers for a
supply of them. Israel is now no longer "Jezreel" in the sense, "God
will SCATTER" ([Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004).md), but in the
sense, "God will PLANT" ([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">hos 2:23</span></span>

I will sow her--referring to the meaning of Jezreel ([Hos
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#022).md).
