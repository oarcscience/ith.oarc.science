19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021.md); [Jam
4:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md).

envy--or, "jealousy" (compare Margin; [Pro

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 27:5</span></span>

secret love--not manifested in acts is useless; and even, if its

those of genuine friendship.

[Proverbs 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#011.md)

[Proverbs 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 27:16</span></span>

effort, as that of holding the wind.

17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md); [Psa
18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035).md). His right hand endeavors to
repress perfume, but vainly. Some prefer: "His right hand comes on oil,"

Men's cupidity is as insatiable as the grave.

[Proverbs 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 27:21</span></span>

Praise tests character.

a man to his praise--according to his praise, as he bears it. Thus vain
men seek it, weak men are inflated by it, wise men disregard it, &c.

household--literally, "house," the family ([Act
