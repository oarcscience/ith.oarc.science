### [Ezekiel Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 26:1</span></span>

THE JUDGMENT ON TYRE THROUGH NEBUCHADNEZZAR (TWENTY-SIXTH THROUGH
TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTERS). (Eze. 26:1-21)

The specification of the date, which had been omitted in the case of the
four preceding objects of judgment, marks the greater weight attached to
the fall of Tyre.

eleventh year--namely, after the carrying away of Jehoiachin, the year
of the fall of Jerusalem. The number of the month is, however, omitted,
and the day only given. As the month of the taking of Jerusalem was
regarded as one of particular note, namely, the fourth month, also the
fifth, on which it was actually destroyed ([Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006.md), [Jer
52:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012).md), RABBI DAVID reasonably
supposes that Tyre uttered her taunt at the close of the fourth month,
as her nearness to Jerusalem enabled her to hear of its fall very soon,
and that Ezekiel met it with his threat against herself on "the first
day" of the fifth month.

[Ezekiel 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 26:2</span></span>

Tyre-- ([Jos 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#029.md); [Sa2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#007).md), literally, meaning "the
rock-city," Zor; a name applying to the island Tyre, called New Tyre,
rather than Old Tyre on the mainland. They were half a mile apart. "New
Tyre," a century and a half before the fall of Jerusalem, had
successfully resisted Shalmaneser of Assyria, for five years besieging
it (MENANDER, from the Tyrian archives, quoted by JOSEPHUS, Antiquities,
9.14. 2). It was the stronger and more important of the two cities, and
is the one chiefly, though not exclusively, here meant. Tyre was
originally a colony of Zidon. Nebuchadnezzar's siege of it lasted
thirteen years ([Eze 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018.md); Isa.
23:1-18). Though no profane author mentions his having succeeded in the
siege, JEROME states he read the fact in Assyrian histories.

Aha!--exultation over a fallen rival ([Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021.md), [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025).md).

she . . . that was the gates--that is, the single gate composed of two
folding doors. Hence the verb is singular. "Gates" were the place of
resort for traffic and public business: so here it expresses a mart of
commerce frequented by merchants. Tyre regards Jerusalem not as an open
enemy, for her territory being the narrow, long strip of land north of
Philistia, between Mount Lebanon and the sea, her interest was to
cultivate friendly relations with the Jews, on whom she was dependent
for corn ([Eze 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017.md); [Kg1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#009.md); [Act
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020).md). But Jerusalem had intercepted
some of the inland traffic which she wished to monopolize to herself;
so, in her intensely selfish worldly-mindedness, she exulted heartlessly
over the fall of Jerusalem as her own gain. Hence she incurred the wrath
of God as pre-eminently the world's representative in its ambition,
selfishness, and pride, in defiance of the will of God ([Isa
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#009).md).

she is turned unto me--that is, the mart of corn, wine, oil, balsam,
&c., which she once was, is transferred to me. The caravans from
Palmyra, Petra, and the East will no longer be intercepted by the market
("the gates") of Jerusalem, but will come to me.

[Ezekiel 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 26:3</span></span>

nations . . . as the sea . . . waves--In striking contrast to the
boasting of Tyre, God threatens to bring against her Babylon's army
levied from "many nations," even as the Mediterranean waves that dashed
against her rock-founded city on all sides.

scrape her dust . . . make her . . . top of . . . rock--or, "a bare
rock" \[GROTIUS\]. The soil which the Tyrians had brought together upon
the rock on which they built their city, I will scrape so clean away as
to leave no dust, but only the bare rock as it was. An awful contrast to
her expectation of filling herself with all the wealth of the East now
that Jerusalem has fallen.

[Ezekiel 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 26:5</span></span>

in the midst of the sea--plainly referring to New Tyre ([Eze
27:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#032).md).

[Ezekiel 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 26:6</span></span>

her daughters . . . in the field--The surrounding villages, dependent on
her in the open country, shall share the fate of the mother city.

[Ezekiel 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 26:7</span></span>

from the north--the original locality of the Chaldeans; also, the
direction by which they entered Palestine, taking the route of Riblah
and Hamath on the Orontes, in preference to that across the desert
between Babylon and Judea.

king of kings--so called because of the many kings who owned allegiance
to him ([Kg2 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#028).md). God had delegated
to him the universal earth-empire which is His ([Dan
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047).md). The Son of God alone has the
right and title inherently, and shall assume it when the world kings
shall have been fully proved as abusers of the trust ([Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md); [Rev
17:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012.md); [Rev
19:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md). Ezekiel's prophecy was not
based on conjecture from the past, for Shalmaneser, with all the might
of the Assyrian empire, had failed in his siege of Tyre. Yet
Nebuchadnezzar was to succeed. JOSEPHUS tells us that Nebuchadnezzar
began the siege in the seventh year of Ithobal's reign, king of Tyre.

[Ezekiel 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 26:9</span></span>

engines of war--literally, "an apparatus for striking." "He shall apply
the stroke of the battering-ram against thy walls." HAVERNICK
translates, "His enginery of destruction"; literally, the "destruction
(not merely the stroke) of his enginery."

axes--literally, "swords."

[Ezekiel 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 26:10</span></span>

dust--So thick shall be the "dust" stirred up by the immense numbers of
"horses," that it shall "cover" the whole city as a cloud.

horses . . . chariots--As in [Eze
26:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md), New Tyre on the insular rock
in the sea (compare [Isa 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md), [Isa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#004.md), [Isa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006).md) is referred to; so here, in [Eze
26:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#009.md), Old Tyre on the mainland.
Both are included in the prophecies under one name.

wheels--FAIRBAIRN thinks that here, and in [Eze
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#024.md), as "the wheels" are distinct
from the "chariots," some wheelwork for riding on, or for the operations
of the siege, are meant.

[Ezekiel 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 26:11</span></span>

thy strong garrisons--literally, "the statutes of thy strength"; so the
forts which are "monuments of thy strength." MAURER understands, in
stricter agreement with the literal meaning, "the statues" or "obelisks
erected in honor of the idols, the tutelary gods of Tyre," as Melecarte,
answering to the Grecian Hercules, whose temple stood in Old Tyre
(compare [Jer 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013), Margin.md).

[Ezekiel 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 26:12</span></span>

lay thy stones . . . timber . . . in . . . midst of . . .
water--referring to the insular New Tyre ([Eze
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#003.md), [Eze
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#005.md); [Eze
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#004.md), [Eze
27:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#025).md). When its lofty buildings
and towers fall, surrounded as it was with the sea which entered its
double harbor and washed its ramparts, the "stones . . . timbers . . .
and dust" appropriately are described as thrown down "in the midst of
the water." Though Ezekiel attributes the capture of Tyre to
Nebuchadnezzar (see on [Eze 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018).md),
yet it does not follow that the final destruction of it described is
attributed by him to the same monarch. The overthrow of Tyre by
Nebuchadnezzar was the first link in the long chain of evil--the first
deadly blow which prepared for, and was the earnest of, the final doom.
The change in this verse from the individual conqueror "he," to the
general "they," marks that what he did was not the whole, but only paved
the way for others to complete the work begun by him. It was to be a
progressive work until she was utterly destroyed. Thus the words here
answer exactly to what Alexander did. With the "stones, timber," and
rubbish of Old Tyre, he built a causeway in seven months to New Tyre on
the island and so took it \[CURTIUS, 4, 2\], 322 B.C.

[Ezekiel 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 26:13</span></span>

Instead of the joyousness of thy prosperity, a death-like silence shall
reign ([Isa 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md); [Jer
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034).md).

[Ezekiel 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 26:14</span></span>

He concludes in nearly the same words as he began ([Eze
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#004).md).

built no more--fulfilled as to the mainland Tyre, under Nebuchadnezzar.
The insular Tyre recovered partly, after seventy years ([Isa
23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#017).md), but again suffered under
Alexander, then under Antigonus, then under the Saracens at the
beginning of the fourteenth century. Now its harbors are choked with
sand, precluding all hope of future restoration, "not one entire house
is left, and only a few fishermen take shelter in the vaults"
\[MAUNDRELL\]. So accurately has God's word come to pass.

[Ezekiel 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 26:15</span></span>

The impression which the overthrow of Tyre produced on other maritime
nations and upon her own colonies, for example, Utica, Carthage, and
Tartessus or Tarshish in Spain.

isles--maritime lands. Even mighty Carthage used to send a yearly
offering to the temple of Hercules at Tyre: and the mother city gave
high priests to her colonies. Hence the consternation at her fall felt
in the widely scattered dependencies with which she was so closely
connected by the ties of religion, as well as commercial intercourse.

shake--metaphorically: "be agitated" ([Jer
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#021).md).

[Ezekiel 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 26:16</span></span>

come down from their thrones . . . upon the ground--"the throne of the
mourners" ([Job 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013.md); [Jon
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#006).md).

princes of the sea--are the merchant rulers of Carthage and other
colonies of Tyre, who had made themselves rich and powerful by trading
on the sea ([Isa 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008).md).

clothe . . . with trembling--Hebrew, "tremblings." Compare [Eze
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#027.md), "clothed with desolation"; [Psa
132:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#018.md). In a public calamity the
garment was changed for a mourning garb.

[Ezekiel 26:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 26:17</span></span>

inhabited of seafaring men--that is, which was frequented by merchants
of various sea-bordering lands \[GROTIUS\]. FAIRBAIRN translates with
Peschito, "Thou inhabitant of the seas" (the Hebrew literal meaning).
Tyre rose as it were out of the seas as if she got thence her
inhabitants, being peopled so closely down to the waters. So Venice was
called "the bride of the sea."

strong in the sea--through her insular position.

cause their terror to be on all that haunt it--namely, the sea. The
Hebrew is rather, "they put their terror upon all her (the city's)
inhabitants," that is, they make the name of every Tyrian to be feared
\[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 26:18</span></span>

thy departure-- [Isa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#006.md), [Isa
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012.md) predicts that the Tyrians, in
consequence of the siege, should pass over the Mediterranean to the
lands bordering on it ("Chittim," "Tarshish," &c.). So Ezekiel here.
Accordingly JEROME says that he read in Assyrian histories that, "when
the Tyrians saw no hope of escaping, they fled to Carthage or some
islands of the Ionian and Ã†gean Seas" \[BISHOP NEWTON\]. (See on [Eze
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018).md). GROTIUS explains "departure,"
that is, "in the day when hostages shall be carried away from thee to
Babylon." The parallelism to "thy fall" makes me think "departure" must
mean "thy end" in general, but with an included allusion to the
"departure" of most of her people to her colonies at the fall of the
city.

[Ezekiel 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 26:19</span></span>

great waters--appropriate metaphor of the Babylonian hosts, which
literally, by breaking down insular Tyre's ramparts, caused the sea to
"cover" part of her.

[Ezekiel 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 26:20</span></span>

the pit--Tyre's disappearance is compared to that of the dead placed in
their sepulchres and no more seen among the living (compare [Eze
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md), [Eze
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md); [Isa
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011.md), [Isa
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015.md), [Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019).md).

I shall set glory in the land--In contrast to Tyre consigned to the
"pit" of death, I shall set glory (that is, My presence symbolized by
the Shekinah cloud, the antitype to which shall be Messiah, "the glory
as of the only-begotten of the Father," [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013).md) in Judah.

of the living--as opposed to Tyre consigned to the "pit" of death. Judea
is to be the land of national and spiritual life, being restored after
its captivity ([Eze 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009).md). FAIRBAIRN
loses the antithesis by applying the negative to both clauses, "and that
thou be not set as a glory in the land of the living."

[Ezekiel 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 26:21</span></span>

terror--an example of judgment calculated to terrify all evildoers.

thou shall be no more--Not that there was to be no more a Tyre, but she
was no more to be the Tyre that once was: her glory and name were to be
no more. As, to Old Tyre, the prophecy was literally fulfilled, not a
vestige of it being left.
