### [Job Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md)

[Job 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 26:2</span></span>

JOB'S REPLY. ([Job 26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001).md)

without power . . . no strength . . . no wisdom--The negatives are used
instead of the positives, powerlessness, &c., designedly (so [Isa
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md); [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md). Granting I am, as you say
([Job 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#017.md); [Job
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002).md), powerlessness itself, &c. "How
hast thou helped such a one?"

savest--supportest.

[Job 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 26:3</span></span>

plentifully . . . the thing as it is--rather, "abundantly--wisdom."
Bildad had made great pretensions to abundant wisdom. How has he shown
it?

[Job 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 26:4</span></span>

For whose instruction were thy words meant? If for me I know the subject
(God's omnipotence) better than my instructor; [Job
26:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md) is a sample of Job's knowledge
of it.

whose spirit--not that of God ([Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008).md); nay, rather, the borrowed
sentiment of Eliphaz ([Job 4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#017.md);
[Job 15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#014).md).

[Job 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 26:5</span></span>

As before in the ninth and twelfth chapters, Job had shown himself not
inferior to the friends' inability to describe God's greatness, so now
he describes it as manifested in hell (the world of the dead), [Job
26:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005.md); on earth, [Job
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md); in the sky, [Job
26:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008.md); the sea, [Job
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md); the heavens, [Job
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md).

Dead things are formed--Rather, "The souls of the dead (Rephaim)
tremble." Not only does God's power exist, as Bildad says ([Job
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/job025.htm#002)), "in high places" (heaven.md), but
reaches to the region of the dead. Rephaim here, and in [Pro
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#016.md) and [Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), is from a Hebrew root, meaning
"to be weak," hence "deceased"; in [Gen
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005.md) it is applied to the Canaanite
giants; perhaps in derision, to express their weakness, in spite of
their gigantic size, as compared with Jehovah \[UMBREIT\]; or, as the
imagination of the living magnifies apparitions, the term originally was
applied to ghosts, and then to giants in general \[MAGEE\].

from under--UMBREIT joins this with the previous word "tremble from
beneath" (so [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009).md). But the
Masoretic text joins it to "under the waters." Thus the place of the
dead will be represented as "under the waters" ([Psa
18:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004).md); and the waters as under the
earth ([Psa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002).md). MAGEE well
translates thus: "The souls of the dead tremble; (the places) under the
waters, and their inhabitants." Thus the Masoretic connection is
retained; and at the same time the parallel clauses are evenly balanced.
"The inhabitants of the places under the waters" are those in Gehenna,
the lower of the two parts into which Sheol, according to the Jews, is
divided; they answer to "destruction," that is, the place of the wicked
in [Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md), as "Rephaim" ([Job
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#005)) to "Hell" (Sheol.md) ([Job
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006).md). "Sheol" comes from a Hebrew
root--"ask," because it is insatiable ([Pro
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#020).md); or "ask as a loan to be
returned," implying Sheol is but a temporary abode, previous to the
resurrection; so for English Version "formed," the Septuagint and
Chaldee translate; shall be born, or born again, implying the dead are
to be given back from Sheol and born again into a new state \[MAGEE\].

[Job 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 26:6</span></span>

([Job 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#017.md); [Psa
139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008.md); [Pro
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011).md).

destruction--the abode of destruction, that is, of lost souls. Hebrew,
Abaddon ([Rev 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011).md).

no covering--from God's eyes.

[Job 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 26:7</span></span>

Hint of the true theory of the earth. Its suspension in empty space is
stated in the second clause. The north in particular is specified in the
first, being believed to be the highest part of the earth ([Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md). The northern hemisphere or
vault of heaven is included; often compared to a stretched-out canopy
([Psa 104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002).md). The chambers of the
south are mentioned ([Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009).md), that
is, the southern hemisphere, consistently with the earth's globular
form.

[Job 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 26:8</span></span>

in . . . clouds--as if in airy vessels, which, though light, do not
burst with the weight of water in them ([Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004).md).

[Job 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 26:9</span></span>

Rather, He encompasseth or closeth. God makes the clouds a veil to
screen the glory not only of His person, but even of the exterior of His
throne from profane eyes. His agency is everywhere, yet He Himself is
invisible ([Psa 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md); [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).md).

[Job 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 26:10</span></span>

Rather, "He hath drawn a circular bound round the waters" ([Pro
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#027.md); [Psa
104:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#009).md). The horizon seems a circle.
Indication is given of the globular form of the earth.

until the day, &c.--to the confines of light and darkness. When the
light falls on our horizon, the other hemisphere is dark. UMBREIT and
MAURER translate "He has most perfectly (literally, to perfection) drawn
the bound (taken from the first clause) between light and darkness"
(compare [Gen 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#004.md), [Gen
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md), [Gen
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009).md): where the bounding of the light
from darkness is similarly brought into proximity with the bounding of
the waters.

[Job 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 26:11</span></span>

pillars--poetically for the mountains which seem to bear up the sky
([Psa 104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032).md).

astonished--namely, from terror. Personification.

his reproof-- ([Psa 104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007).md). The
thunder, reverberating from cliff to cliff ([Hab
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010.md); [Nah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005).md).

[Job 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 26:12</span></span>

divideth-- ([Psa 74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013).md). Perhaps at
creation ([Gen 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009).md). The parallel
clause favors UMBREIT, "He stilleth." But the Hebrew means "He moves."
Probably such a "moving" is meant as that at the assuaging of the flood
by the wind which "God made to pass over" it ([Gen
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#001.md); [Psa
104:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#007).md).

the proud--rather, "its pride," namely, of the sea ([Job
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013).md).

[Job 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 26:13</span></span>

UMBREIT less simply, "By His breath He maketh the heavens to revive":
namely, His wind dissipates the clouds, which obscured the shining
stars. And so the next clause in contrast, "His hand doth strangle,"
that is, obscures the north constellation, the dragon. Pagan astronomy
typified the flood trying to destroy the ark by the dragon
constellation, about to devour the moon in its eclipsed crescent-shape
like a boat ([Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008), Margin.md). But
better as English Version ([Psa 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006).md).

crooked--implying the oblique course, of the stars, or the ecliptic.
"Fleeing" or "swift" \[UMBREIT\] ([Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md). This particular constellation
is made to represent the splendor of all the stars.

[Job 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 26:14</span></span>

parts--Rather, "only the extreme boundaries of," &c., and how faint is
the whisper that we hear of Him!

thunder--the entire fulness. In antithesis to "whisper" ([Co1
13:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009.md), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md).

It was now Zophar's turn to speak. But as he and the other two were
silent, virtually admitting defeat, after a pause Job proceeds.
