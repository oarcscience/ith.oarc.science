### [Psalms Chapter 84](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)

[Psalms 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 84:1</span></span>

(See on [Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001), title, and [Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001), title). The writer describes the
desirableness of God's worship and prays for a restoration to its
privileges. ([Psa 84:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001))

amiable--not lovely, but beloved.

tabernacles-- ([Psa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#003)).

[Psalms 84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 84:2</span></span>

longeth--most intensely ([Gen 31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030);
[Psa 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#012)).

fainteth--exhausted with desire.

courts--as tabernacles ([Psa 84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001))
--the whole building.

crieth out--literally, "sings for joy"; but here, and [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019), expresses an act of sorrow as
the corresponding noun ([Psa 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001);
[Psa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002)).

heart and . . . flesh--as in [Psa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001).

[Psalms 84:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 84:3</span></span>

thine altars--that is, of burnt offering and incense, used for the whole
tabernacle. Its structure afforded facilities for sparrows and swallows
to indulge their known predilections for such places. Some understand
the statement as to the birds as a comparison: "as they find homes, so
do I desire thine altars," &c.

[Psalms 84:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 84:4</span></span>

This view is favored by the language here, which, as in [Psa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001); [Psa
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006), recognizes the blessing of
membership in God's family by terms denoting a dwelling in His house.

[Psalms 84:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 84:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 68:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#028)).

in whose heart . . . the ways--that is, who knows and loves the way to
God's favor ([Pro 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017); [Isa
40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003)).

[Psalms 84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 84:6</span></span>

valley of Baca--or, "weeping." Through such, by reason of their dry and
barren condition, the worshippers often had to pass to Jerusalem. As
they might become wells, or fountains, or pools, supplied by refreshing
rain, so the grace of God, by the exercises of His worship, refreshes
and revives the hearts of His people, so that for sorrows they have
"rivers of delight" ([Psa 36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008); [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004)).

[Psalms 84:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 84:7</span></span>

The figure of the pilgrim is carried out. As such daily refit their
bodily strength till they reach Jerusalem, so the spiritual worshipper
is daily supplied with spiritual strength by God's grace till he appears
before God in heaven.

appeareth . . . God--the terms of the requisition for the attendance on
the feasts (compare [Deu 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016)),

[Psalms 84:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 84:9</span></span>

God is addressed as a shield (compare [Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011)).

thine anointed--David ([Sa1 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012)).

[Psalms 84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 84:10</span></span>

I had . . . doorkeeper--literally, "I choose to sit on the threshold,"
the meanest place.

[Psalms 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 84:11</span></span>

As a sun God enlightens ([Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001));
as a shield He protects.

grace--God's favor, its fruit--

glory--the honor He bestows.

uprightly-- ([Psa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002); [Psa
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023)).

[Psalms 84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 84:12</span></span>

that trusteth--constantly.
