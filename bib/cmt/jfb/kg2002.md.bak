### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 2:1</span></span>

ELIJAH DIVINES JORDAN. ([Kg2 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#001).md)

when the Lord would take up Elijah--A revelation of this event had been
made to the prophet; but, unknown to him, it had also been revealed to
his disciples, and to Elisha in particular, who kept constantly beside
him.

Gilgal--This Gilgal (Jiljil) was near Ebal and Gerizim; a school of the
prophets was established there. At Beth-el there was also a school of
the prophets, which Elijah had founded, notwithstanding that place was
the headquarters of the calf-worship; and at Jericho there was another
\[[Kg2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#004.md)\]. In travelling to these
places, which he had done through the impulse of the Spirit ([Kg2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#002.md), [Kg2
2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#004).md), Elijah wished to pay a
farewell visit to these several institutions, which lay on his way to
the place of ascension and, at the same time, from a feeling of humility
and modesty, to be in solitude, where there would be no eye-witnesses of
his glorification. All his efforts, however, to prevail on his attendant
to remain behind, were fruitless. Elisha knew that the time was at hand,
and at every place the sons of the prophets spoke to him of the
approaching removal of his master. Their last stage was at the Jordan.
They were followed at a distance by fifty scholars of the prophets, from
Jericho, who were desirous, in honor of the great occasion, to witness
the miraculous translation of the prophet. The revelation of this
striking event to so many was a necessary part of the dispensation; for
it was designed to be under the law, like that of Enoch in the
patriarchal age, a visible proof of another state, and a type of the
resurrection of Christ.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 2:3</span></span>

take away thy master from they head--an allusion to the custom of
scholars sitting at the feet of their master, the latter being over
their heads ([Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 2:8</span></span>

Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
waters--Like the rod of Moses, it had the divinely operating power of
the Spirit.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 2:9</span></span>

Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee--trusting either
that it would be in his power to bequeath it, or that God, at his
entreaty, would grant it.

let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me--This request was not, as
is commonly supposed, for the power of working miracles exceeding the
magnitude and number of his master's, nor does it mean a higher
endowment of the prophetic spirit; for Elisha was neither superior to,
nor perhaps equally great with, his predecessor. But the phrase, "a
double portion," was applied to the first-born \[[Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017.md)\], and therefore Elisha's
request was, simply, to be heir to the prophetic office and gifts of his
master.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 2:10</span></span>

Thou hast asked a hard thing--an extraordinary blessing which I cannot,
and God only, can give. Nevertheless he, doubtless by the secret
directions of the Spirit, proposed to Elisha a sign, the observation of
which would keep him in the attitude of an anxious waiter, as well as
suppliant for the favor.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 2:11</span></span>

HE IS TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE. ([Kg2
2:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011).md)

behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire--some
bright effulgence, which, in the eyes of the spectators, resembled those
objects.

went up by a whirlwind--a tempest or storm wind accompanied with vivid
flashes of fire, figuratively used for the divine judgments ([Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 2:12</span></span>

Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father--that is, spiritual father, as
the pupils of the prophets are called their sons.

the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof--that is, that as
earthly kingdoms are dependent for their defense and glory upon warlike
preparations, there a single prophet had done more for the preservation
and prosperity of Israel than all her chariots and horsemen.

took hold of his own clothes and rent them--in token of his grief for
his loss.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 2:13</span></span>

He took up also the mantle of Elijah--The transference of this prophetic
cloak was, to himself, a pledge of his being appointed successor, and it
was an outward token to others of the spirit of Elijah resting upon him.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 2:14</span></span>

smote the waters--The waving of the mantle on the river, and the
miraculous division of the waters consequent upon it, was an evidence
that the Lord God of Elijah was with him, and as this miracle was
witnessed by the scholars of the prophets from Jericho, they forthwith
recognized the pre-eminence of Elisha, as now the prophet of Israel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">kg2 2:16</span></span>

fifty strong men, let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master--Though
the young prophets from Jericho had seen Elijah's miraculous passage of
the Jordan, they had not witnessed the ascension. They imagined that he
might have been cast by the whirlwind on some mountain or valley; or, if
he had actually been admitted into heaven, they expected that his body
would still be remaining somewhere on earth. In compliance with their
importunity, he gave them permission, but told them what the result
would be.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 2:20</span></span>

ELISHA HEALS THE WATERS. ([Kg2
2:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#019).md)

Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein--The noxious qualities of the
water could not be corrected by the infusion of salt--for, supposing the
salt was possessed of such a property, a whole spring could not be
purified by a dishful for a day, much less in all future time. The
pouring in of the salt was a symbolic act with which Elisha accompanied
the word of the Lord, by which the spring was healed \[KEIL\].

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 2:23</span></span>

there came forth little children out of the city--that is, the
idolatrous, or infidel young men of the place, who affecting to
disbelieve the report of his master's translation, sarcastically urged
him to follow in the glorious career.

bald head--an epithet of contempt in the East, applied to a person even
with a bushy head of hair. The appalling judgment that befell them was
God's interference to uphold his newly invested prophet.
