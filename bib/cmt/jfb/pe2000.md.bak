AUTHENTICITY AND GENUINENESS.--If not a gross imposture, its own
internal witness is unequivocal in its favor. It has Peter's name and
apostleship in its heading: not only his surname, but his original name
Simon, or Simeon, he thus, at the close of his life, reminding his
readers who he originally was before his call. Again, in [Pe2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md), he mentions his presence at
the Transfiguration, and Christ's prophecy of his death! and in [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md), his brotherhood with Paul.
Again, in [Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md), the author speaks
of himself as author of the former Epistle: it is, moreover, addressed
so as to include (but not to be restricted to) the same persons as the
first, whom he presupposes to be acquainted with the writings of Paul,
by that time recognized as "Scripture" ([Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015.md), "the long-suffering of God,"
compare [Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004).md). This necessarily
implies a late date, when Paul's Epistles (including Romans) already had
become generally diffused and accepted as Scripture in the Church. The
Church of the fourth century had, besides the testimony which we have of
the doubts of the earlier Christians, other external evidence which we
have not, and which, doubtless, under God's overruling providence,
caused them to accept it. It is hard to understand how a book palpably
false (as it would be if Peter be not the author) could have been
accepted in the Canon as finally established in the Councils of
Laodicea, A.D. 360 (if the fifty-ninth article be genuine), Hippo, and
Carthage in the fourth century (393 and 397). The whole tone and spirit
of the Epistle disprove its being an imposture. He writes as one not
speaking of himself, but moved by the Holy Ghost ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021).md). An attempt at such a fraud in
the first ages would have brought only shame and suffering, alike from
Christians and heathen, on the perpetrator: there was then no temptation
to pious frauds as in later times. That it must have been written in the
earliest age is plain from the wide gulf in style which separates it and
the other New Testament Scriptures from even the earliest and best of
the post-apostolic period. DAILLE well says, "God has allowed a fosse to
be drawn by human weakness around the sacred canon to protect it from
all invasion."

Traces of acquaintance with it appear in the earliest Fathers. HERMAS
\[Similitudes, 6.4\] (compare [Pe2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#013).md), Greek, "luxury in the day . . .
luxuriating with their own deceivings"; and \[Shepherd, Vision 3.7\],
"They have left their true way" (compare [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015).md); and \[Shepherd, Vision 4.3\],
"Thou hast escaped this world" (compare [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020).md). CLEMENT OF ROME, \[Epistle to
the Corinthians, 7.9; 10\], as to Noah's preaching and Lot's
deliverance, "the Lord making it known that He does not abandon those
that trust in Him, but appoints those otherwise inclined to judgment"
(compare [Pe2 2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md), [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009).md). IRENÃ†US, A.D. 178 ("the day of
the Lord is as a thousand years"), and JUSTIN MARTYR seem to allude to
[Pe2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008.md). HIPPOLYTUS \[On
Antichrist\], seems to refer to [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md), "The prophets spake not of their
own private (individual) ability and will, but what was (revealed) to
them alone by God." The difficulty is, neither TERTULLIAN, CYPRIAN,
CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA, nor the oldest Syriac (Peschito) version (the
later Syriac has it), nor the fragment known as Muratori's Canon,
mentions it. The first writer who has expressly named it is ORIGEN, in
the third century (Homily on Joshua; also Homily 4 on Leviticus, and
Homily 13 on Numbers), who names it "Scripture," quoting [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md); [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md); however (in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 6.25\]), he mentions that the Second Epistle
was doubted by some. FIRMILIAN, bishop of Cappadocia, in Epistle to
Cyrpian speaks of Peter's Epistles as warning us to avoid heretics (a
monition which occurs in the Second, not the First Epistle). Now
Cappadocia is one of the countries mentioned (compare [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md) with [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001).md) as addressed; and it is striking,
that from Cappadocia we get the earliest decisive testimony. "Internally
it claims to be written by Peter, and this claim is confirmed by the
Christians of that very region in whose custody it ought to have been
found" \[TREGELLES\].

The books disputed (Antilegomena), as distinguished from those
universally recognized (Homologoumena), are Epistles Second Peter,
James, Second and Third John, Jude, the Apocalypse, Epistle to Hebrews
(compare EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History, 3.3,25\]). The Antilegomena
stand in quite a different class from the Spurious; of these there was
no dispute, they were universally rejected; for example, the Shepherd of
Hermas, the Revelation of Peter, the Epistle of Barnabas. CYRIL OF
JERUSALEM (A.D. 348) enumerates seven Catholic Epistles, including
Second Peter; so also GREGORY NAZIANZEN (A.D. 389), and EPIPHANIUS (A.D.
367). The oldest Greek manuscripts extant (of the fourth century)
contain the Antilegomena. JEROME \[On Illustrious Men\], conjectured,
from a supposed difference of style between the two Epistles, that
Peter, being unable to write Greek, employed a different translator of
his Hebrew dictation in the Second Epistle, and not the same as
translated the First into Greek. Mark is said to have been his
translator in the case of the Gospel according to Mark; but this is all
gratuitous conjecture. Much of the same views pervade both Epistles. In
both alike he looks for the Lord's coming suddenly, and the end of the
world (compare [Pe2 3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008.md) with [Pe1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005).md); the inspiration of the prophets
(compare [Pe1 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md) with [Pe2
1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md); [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002).md); the new birth by the divine word
a motive to abstinence from worldly lusts ([Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md); compare [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md); also compare [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md) with [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md), both containing in the Greek the
rare word "virtue" ([Pe1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md) with
[Pe2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003).md).

It is not strange that distinctive peculiarities of STYLE should mark
each Epistle, the design of both not being the same. Thus the sufferings
of Christ are more prominent in the First Epistle, the object there
being to encourage thereby Christian sufferers; the glory of the exalted
Lord is more prominent in the Second, the object being to communicate
fuller "knowledge" of Him as the antidote to the false teaching against
which Peter warns his readers. Hence His title of redemption, "Christ,"
is the one employed in the First Epistle; but in the Second Epistle,
"the Lord." Hope is characteristic of the First Epistle; full knowledge,
of the Second Epistle. In the First Epistle he puts his apostolic
authority less prominently forward than in the Second, wherein his
design is to warn against false teachers. The same difference is
observable in Paul's Epistles. Contrast [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md); [Th2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001.md), with [Gal
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001.md); [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md). The reference to Paul's writings
as already existing in numbers, and as then a recognized part of
Scripture ([Pe2 3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md), implies that
this Epistle was written at a late date, just before Peter's death.

Striking verbal coincidences occur: compare [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md), end, with [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md), end; "His own," Greek, [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md), [Pe2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#016.md); [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md) with [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md), [Pe1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005.md). The omission of the Greek
article, [Pe1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md) with [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md); [Pe2
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md), [Pe2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md). Moreover, two words occur, [Pe2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md), "tabernacle," that is, the body,
and [Pe2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015.md), "decease," which at
once remind us of the transfiguration narrative in the Gospel. Both
Epistles refer to the deluge, and to Noah as the eighth that was saved.
Though the First Epistle abounds in quotations of the Old Testament,
whereas the Second contains none, yet references to the Old Testament
occur often ([Pe2 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md); [Pe2
2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005.md), [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md); [Pe2
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md), [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md). Compare Greek, "putting away,"
[Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md), with [Pe2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md); Greek, "pass the time," [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md), with [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md); "walked in," [Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md), with [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md); [Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md); "called you," [Pe1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010.md), with [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md).

Moreover, more verbal coincidences with the speeches of Peter in Acts
occur in this Second, than in the First Epistle. Compare Greek,
"obtained," [Pe2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md) with [Act
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017.md); Greek, "godliness," [Pe2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md), with [Act
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md), the only passage where the term
occurs, except in the Pastoral Epistles; and [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009.md) with [Act
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002.md), [Act
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#007.md); "punished," [Pe2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009.md), with [Act
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021.md), the only places where the term
occurs; the double genitive, [Pe2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md),
with [Act 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032.md); "the day of the Lord,"
[Pe2 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md), with [Act
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#020.md), where only it occurs, except in
[Th1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002.md).

The testimony of Jude, [Jde 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#017.md),
is strong for its genuineness and inspiration, by adopting its very
words, and by referring to it as received by the churches to which he,
Jude, wrote, "Remember the words which were spoken before of the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you there should
be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly
lusts." Jude, therefore, must have written after Second Peter, to which
he plainly refers; not before, as ALFORD thinks. No less than eleven
passages of Jude rest on similar statements of Second Peter. [Jde
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#002.md), compare [Pe2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004.md), compare [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md); [Jde
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md), compare [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md); [Jde
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md), compare [Pe2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006.md); [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md), compare [Pe2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md); [Jde
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md), compare [Pe2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#011.md); [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011.md), compare [Pe2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#015.md); [Jde
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#012.md), compare [Pe2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#017.md); [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016.md), compare [Pe2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018.md), compare [Pe2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md); [Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003.md). Just in the same way Micah, [Mic
4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md), leans on the somewhat earlier
prophecy of Isaiah, whose inspiration he thereby confirms. ALFORD
reasons that because Jude, in many of the passages akin to Second Peter,
is fuller than Second Peter, he must be prior. This by no means follows.
It is at least as likely, if not more so, that the briefer is the
earlier, rather than the fuller. The dignity and energy of the style is
quite consonant to what we should expect from the prompt and ardent
foreman of the apostles. The difference of style between First and
Second Peter accords with the distinctness of the subjects and objects.

THE DATE, from what has been said, would be about A.D. 68 or 69, about a
year after the first, and shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem,
the typical precursor of the world's end, to which [Pe2
3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010.md) so solemnly calls attention,
after Paul's ministry had closed (compare Greek aorist tense, "wrote,"
past time, [Pe2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md), just before
Peter's own death. It was written to include the same persons, and
perhaps in, or about the same place, as the first. Being without
salutations of individuals, and entrusted to the care of no one church,
or particular churches as the first is, but directed generally "to them
that have obtained like precious faith with us" ([Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001).md), it took a longer time in being
recognized as canonical. Had Rome been the place of its composition or
publication, it could hardly have failed to have had an early
acceptance--an incidental argument against the tradition of Peter's
martyrdom at Rome. The remote scene of its composition in Babylon, or
else in some of the contiguous regions beyond the borders of the Roman
empire, and of its circulation in Cappadocia, Pontus, &c., will
additionally account for its tardy but at last universal acceptance in
the catholic Church. The former Epistle, through its more definite
address, was earlier in its general acceptance.

OBJECT.--In [Pe2 3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md) the twofold
design of the Epistle is set forth; namely, to guard his readers against
"the error" of false teachers, and to exhort them to grow in
experimental "knowledge of our Lord and Saviour" ([Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018).md). The ground on which this
knowledge rests is stated, [Pe2
1:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md), namely, the inspired
testimony of apostles and prophets. The danger now, as of old, was about
to arise from false teachers, who soon were to come among them, as Paul
also (to whom reference is made, [Pe2
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015).md) testified in the same region.
The grand antidote is "the full knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,"
through which we know God the Father, partake of His nature, escape from
the pollutions of the world, and have entrance into Christ's kingdom.
The aspect of Christ presented is not so much that of the past
suffering, as of the future reigning, Saviour, His present power, and
future new kingdom. This aspect is taken as best fitted to counteract
the theories of the false teachers who should "deny" His Lordship and
His coming again, the two very points which, as an apostle and
eye-witness, Peter attests (His "power" and His "coming"); also, to
counteract their evil example in practice, blaspheming the way of truth,
despising governments, slaves to covetousness and filthy lusts of the
flesh, while boasting of Christian freedom, and, worst of all, apostates
from the truth. The knowledge of Christ, as being the knowledge of "the
way of righteousness," "the right way," is the antidote of their bad
practice. Hence "the preacher" of righteousness, Noah, and "righteous
Lot," are instanced as escaping the destruction which overtook the
"unjust" or "unrighteous"; and Balaam is instanced as exemplifying the
awful result of "unrighteousness" such as characterized the false
teachers. Thus the Epistle forms one connected whole, the parts being
closely bound together by mutual relation, and the end corresponding
with the beginning; compare [Pe2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md),
[Pe2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018.md) with [Pe2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002.md), in both "grace" and "peace" being
connected with "the knowledge" of our Saviour; compare also [Pe2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#017.md) with [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md), [Pe2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md), [Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md); and [Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018.md), "grow in grace and knowledge,"
with the fuller [Pe2 1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md); and [Pe2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md); and [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md), "righteousness," with [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md); and [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md) with [Pe2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md); and [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002.md) with [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md).

The germs of Carpocratian and Gnostic heresies already existed, but the
actual manifestation of these heresies is spoken of as future ([Pe2
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001), &c..md): another proof that this
Epistle was written, as it professes, in the apostolic age, before the
development of the Gnostic heresies in the end of the first and the
beginning of the second centuries. The description is too general to
identify the heresies with any particular one of the subsequent forms of
heresy, but applies generally to them all.

Though altogether distinct in aim from the First Epistle, yet a
connection may be traced. The neglect of the warnings to circumspection
in the walk led to the evils foretold in the Second Epistle. Compare the
warning against the abuse of Christian freedom, [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md) with [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md), "While they promise them
liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption"; also the
caution against pride, [Pe1 5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md) with
[Pe2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md), "they speak great swelling
words of vanity."
