### [Numbers Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 33:1</span></span>

TWO AND FORTY JOURNEYS OF THE ISRAELITES--FROM EGYPT TO SINAI. ([Num
33:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#001).md)

These are the journeys of the children of Israel--This chapter may be
said to form the winding up of the history of the travels of the
Israelites through the wilderness; for the three following chapters
relate to matters connected with the occupation and division of the
promised land. As several apparent discrepancies will be discovered on
comparing the records here given of the journeyings from Sinai with the
detailed accounts of the events narrated in the Book of Exodus and the
occasional notices of places that are found in that of Deuteronomy, it
is probable that this itinerary comprises a list of only the most
important stations in their journeys--those where they formed prolonged
encampments, and whence they dispersed their flocks and herds to pasture
on the adjacent plains till the surrounding herbage was exhausted. The
catalogue extends from their departure out of Egypt to their arrival on
the plains of Moab.

went forth . . . with their armies--that is, a vast multitude marshalled
in separate companies, but regular order.

[Numbers 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 33:2</span></span>

Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the
commandment of the Lord--The wisdom of this divine order is seen in the
importance of the end to which it was subservient--namely, partly to
establish the truth of the history, partly to preserve a memorial of
God's marvellous interpositions on behalf of Israel, and partly to
confirm their faith in the prospect of the difficult enterprise on which
they were entering, the invasion of Canaan.

[Numbers 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 33:3</span></span>

Rameses--generally identified with Heroopoils, now the modern
Abu-Keisheid (see on [Exo 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#037).md),
which was probably the capital of Goshen, and, by direction of Moses,
the place of general rendezvous previous to their departure.

[Numbers 33:4](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 33:4</span></span>

upon their gods--used either according to Scripture phraseology to
denote their rulers (the first-born of the king and his princes) or the
idolatrous objects of Egyptian worship.

[Numbers 33:5](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 33:5</span></span>

pitched in Succoth--that is, "booths"--a place of no note except as a
temporary halting place, at Birketel-Hadji, the Pilgrim's Pool
\[CALMET\].

[Numbers 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 33:6</span></span>

Etham--edge, or border of all that part of Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a which
lay contiguous to Egypt and was known by the general name of Shur.

[Numbers 33:7](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 33:7</span></span>

Pi-hahiroth, Baal-zephon . . . Migdol--(See on [Exo
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002).md).

[Numbers 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 33:8</span></span>

Marah--thought to be Ain Howarah, both from its position and the time
(three days) it would take them with their children and flocks to march
from the water of Ayun Musa to that spot.

[Numbers 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 33:9</span></span>

Elim--supposed to be Wady Ghurundel (see on [Exo
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027).md).

[Numbers 33:10](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 33:10</span></span>

encamped by the Red Sea--The road from Wady Ghurundel leads into the
interior, in consequence of a high continuous ridge which excludes all
view of the sea. At the mouth of Wady-et-Tayibeh, after about three
days' march, it opens again on a plain along the margin of the Red Sea.
The minute accuracy of the Scripture narrative, in corresponding so
exactly with the geographical features of this region, is remarkably
shown in describing the Israelites as proceeding by the only practicable
route that could be taken. This plain, where they encamped, was the
Desert of Sin (see on [Exo 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001).md).

[Numbers 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 33:12</span></span>

Dophkah . . . Alush . . . Rephidim--These three stations, in the great
valleys of El Sheikh and Feiran, would be equivalent to four days'
journey for such a host. Rephidim ([Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006).md) was in Horeb, the burnt
region--a generic name for a hot, mountainous country. \[See on [Exo
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md).\]

wilderness of Sinai--the Wady Er-Raheh.

[Numbers 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">num 33:16</span></span>

FROM SINAI TO KADESH AND PLAINS OF MOAB. (Num. 33:16-56)

Kibroth-Hattaavah ("the graves of lust," see on [Num
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#034).md) --The route, on breaking up the
encampment at Sinai, led down Wady Sheikh; then crossing Jebel-et-Tih,
which intersected the peninsula, they descended into Wady Zalaka,
pitching successively at two brief, though memorable, stations ([Deu
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#022).md); then they encamped at Hazeroth
("unwalled villages"), supposed to be at Ain-Hadera (see on [Num
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#035).md). Kadesh, or Kadesh-barnea, is
supposed to be the great valley of the Ghor, and the city Kadesh to have
been situated on the border of this valley \[BURCKHARDT; ROBINSON\]. But
as there are no less than eighteen stations inserted between Hazeroth
and Kadesh, and only eleven days were spent in performing that journey
([Deu 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002).md), it is evident that the
intermediate stations here recorded belong to another and totally
different visit to Kadesh. The first was when they left Sinai in the
second month ([Num 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#011.md); [Num
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#020).md), and were in Kadesh in August
([Deu 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#045).md), and "abode many days" in
it. Then, murmuring at the report of the spies, they were commanded to
return into the desert "by the way of the Red Sea." The arrival at
Kadesh, mentioned in this catalogue, corresponds to the second sojourn
at that place, being the first month, or April ([Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md). Between the two visits there
intervened a period of thirty-eight years, during which they wandered
hither and thither through all the region of El-Tih ("wanderings"),
often returning to the same spots as the pastoral necessities of their
flocks required; and there is the strongest reason for believing that
the stations named between Hazeroth ([Num
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#008).md) and Kadesh ([Num
33:36](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#036).md) belong to the long interval of
wandering. No certainty has yet been attained in ascertaining the locale
of many of these stations. There must have been more than are recorded;
for it is probable that those only are noted where they remained some
time, where the tabernacle was pitched, and where Moses and the elders
encamped, the people being scattered for pasture in various directions.
From Ezion-geber, for instance, which stood at the head of the gulf of
Akaba, to Kadesh, could not be much less than the whole length of the
great valley of the Ghor, a distance of not less than a hundred miles,
whatever might be the exact situation of Kadesh; and, of course, there
must have been several intervening stations, though none are mentioned.
The incidents and stages of the rest of the journey to the plains of
Moab are sufficiently explicit from the preceding chapters.

[Numbers 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 33:18</span></span>

Rithmah ("the place of the broom")--a station possibly in some wady
extending westward of the Ghor.

[Numbers 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">num 33:19</span></span>

Rimmon-parez, or Rimmon--a city of Judah and Simeon ([Jos
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#032).md); Libnah, so called from its
white poplars ([Jos 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029).md), or, as
some think, a white hill between Kadesh and Gaza ([Jos
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#029)); Rissah (El-arish.md); mount
Shapher (Cassius); Moseroth, adjacent to mount Hor, in Wady Mousa.
Ezion-geber, near Akaba, a seaport on the western shore of the Elanitic
gulf; Wilderness of Zin, on the east side of the peninsula of Sinai;
Punon, in the rocky ravines of mount Hor and famous for the mines and
quarries in its vicinity as well as for its fruit trees, now Tafyle, on
the border of Edom; Abarim, a ridge of rugged hills northwest of the
Arnon--the part called Nebo was one of its highest peaks--opposite
Jericho. (See on [Deu 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006).md).

[Numbers 33:50](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">num 33:50</span></span>

ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you--not,
however, by expulsion, but extermination ([Deu
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#001).md).

and destroy all their pictures--obelisks for idolatrous worship (see on
[Lev 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001).md).

and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
places--by metonymy for all their groves and altars, and materials of
worship on the tops of hills.

[Numbers 33:54](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">num 33:54</span></span>

ye shall divide the land by lot--The particular locality of each tribe
was to be determined in this manner while a line was to be used in
measuring the proportion ([Jos 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010.md);
[Psa 16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005).md).

[Numbers 33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">num 33:55</span></span>

But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
you--No associations were to be formed with the inhabitants; otherwise,
"if ye let remain, they will be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your
sides"--that is, they would prove troublesome and dangerous neighbors,
enticing to idolatry, and consequently depriving you of the divine favor
and blessing. The neglect of the counsel against union with the
idolatrous inhabitants became fatal to them. This earnest admonition
given to the Israelites in their peculiar circumstances conveys a
salutary lesson to us to allow no lurking habits of sin to remain in us.
That spiritual enemy must be eradicated from our nature; otherwise it
will be ruinous to our present peace and future salvation.
