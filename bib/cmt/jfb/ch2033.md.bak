### [2 Chronicles Chapter 33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 33:1</span></span>

MANASSEH'S WICKED REIGN. ([Ch2
33:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#001).md)

Manasseh . . . did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord--(See on
2Ki. 21:1-16).

[2 Chronicles 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 33:11</span></span>

HE IS CARRIED UNTO BABYLON, WHERE HE HUMBLES HIMSELF BEFORE GOD, AND IS
RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM. ([Ch2
33:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md)

the captains of the host of the king of Assyria--This king was
Esar-haddon. After having devoted the first years of his reign to the
consolidation of his government at home, he turned his attention to
repair the loss of the tributary provinces west of the Euphrates, which,
on the disaster and death of Sennacherib, had taken the opportunity of
shaking off the Assyrian yoke. Having overrun Palestine and removed the
remnant that were left in the kingdom of Israel, he despatched his
generals, the chief of whom was Tartan ([Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md), with a portion of his army for
the reduction of Judah also. In a successful attack upon Jerusalem, they
took multitudes of captives, and got a great prize, including the king
himself, among the prisoners.

took Manasseh among the thorns--This may mean, as is commonly supposed,
that he had hid himself among a thicket of briers and brambles. We know
that the Hebrews sometimes took refuge from their enemies in thickets
([Sa1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md). But, instead of the
Hebrew, Bacochim, "among the thorns", some versions read Bechayim,
"among the living", and so the passage would be "took him alive."

bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon--The Hebrew word
rendered "fetters" denotes properly two chains of brass. The humiliating
state in which Manasseh appeared before the Assyrian monarch may be
judged of by a picture on a tablet in the Khorsabad palace, representing
prisoners led bound into the king's presence. "The captives represented
appear to be inhabitants of Palestine. Behind the prisoners stand four
persons with inscriptions on the lower part of their tunics; the first
two are bearded, and seem to be accusers; the remaining two are nearly
defaced; but behind the last appears the eunuch, whose office it seems
to be to usher into the presence of the king those who are permitted to
appear before him. He is followed by another person of the same race as
those under punishment; his hands are manacled, and on his ankles are
strong rings fastened together by a heavy bar" \[Nineveh and Its
Palaces\]. No name is given, and, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn
that the figure represents Manasseh. But the people appear to be
Hebrews, and this pictorial scene will enable us to imagine the manner
in which the royal captive from Judah was received in the court of
Babylon. Esar-haddon had established his residence there; for though
from the many revolts that followed the death of his father, he
succeeded at first only to the throne of Assyria, yet having some time
previous to his conquest of Judah, recovered possession of Babylon, this
enterprising king had united under his sway the two empires of Babylon
and Chaldea and transferred the seat of his government to Babylon.

[2 Chronicles 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 33:12</span></span>

when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God--In the solitude
of exile or imprisonment, Manasseh had leisure for reflection. The
calamities forced upon him a review of his past life, under a conviction
that the miseries of his dethronement and captive condition were owing
to his awful and unprecedented apostasy ([Ch2
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#007).md) from the God of his fathers. He
humbled himself, repented, and prayed for an opportunity of bringing
forth the fruits of repentance. His prayer was heard; for his conqueror
not only released him, but, after two years' exile, restored him, with
honor and the full exercise of royal power, to a tributary and dependent
kingdom. Some political motive, doubtless, prompted the Assyrian king to
restore Manasseh, and that was most probably to have the kingdom of
Judah as a barrier between Egypt and his Assyrian dominions. But God
overruled this measure for higher purposes. Manasseh now showed himself,
by the influence of sanctified affliction, a new and better man. He made
a complete reversal of his former policy, by not only destroying all the
idolatrous statues and altars he had formerly erected in Jerusalem, but
displaying the most ardent zeal in restoring and encouraging the worship
of God.

[2 Chronicles 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 33:14</span></span>

he built a wall without the city . . . on the west side of Gihon . . .
even to the entering in at the fish gate--"The well-ascertained position
of the fish gate, shows that the valley of Gihon could be no other than
that leading northwest of Damascus gate, and gently descending
southward, uniting with the TyropÅ“on at the northeast corner of Mount
Zion, where the latter turns at right angles and runs towards Siloam.
The wall thus built by Manasseh on the west side of the valley of Gihon,
would extend from the vicinity of the northeast corner of the wall of
Zion in a northerly direction, until it crossed over the valley to form
a junction with the outer wall at the trench of Antonia, precisely in
the quarter where the temple would be most easily assailed" \[BARCLAY\].

[2 Chronicles 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 33:17</span></span>

the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the Lord
their God only--Here it appears that the worship on high places, though
it originated in a great measure from the practice of heathenism, and
too often led to it, did not necessarily imply idolatry.

[2 Chronicles 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 33:20</span></span>

HE DIES AND AMON SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Ch2
33:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#020).md)

Manasseh slept with his fathers . . . Amon began to reign--(See on [Kg2
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#019).md).
