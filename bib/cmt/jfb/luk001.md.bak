*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Luke Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

[Luke 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 1:1</span></span>

([Luk 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001).md)

set forth in order--more simply, to draw up a narrative.

[Luke 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 1:2</span></span>

from the beginning--that is, of His public ministry, as is plain from
what follows.

[Luke 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 1:3</span></span>

from the very first--that is, from the very earliest events; referring
to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our
Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone.

in order--or "consecutively"--in contrast, probably, with the disjointed
productions to which he had referred. But this must not be pressed too
far; for, on comparing it with the other Gospels, we see that in some
particulars the strict chronological order is not observed in this
Gospel.

most excellent--or "most noble"--a title of rank applied by this same
writer twice to Felix and once to Festus ([Act
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#026.md); [Act
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003.md); [Act
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025).md). It is likely, therefore, that
"Theophilus" was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Luke 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 1:4</span></span>

that thou mightest know--"know thoroughly."

hast been instructed--orally instructed--literally, "catechized" or
"catechetically taught," at first as a catechumen or candidate for
Christian baptism.

[Luke 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 1:5</span></span>

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FORERUNNER. (Luke 1:5-25)

Herod--(See on [Mat 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001).md).

course of Abia--or Abijah; the eighth of the twenty-four orders of
courses into which David divided the priests (see [Ch1
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#001.md), [Ch1
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#004.md), [Ch1
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#010).md). Of these courses only four
returned after the captivity ([Ezr
2:34-39](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#034).md), which were again subdivided
into twenty-four--retaining the ancient name and order of each. They
took the whole temple service for a week each.

his wife was of the daughters of Aaron--The priests might marry into any
tribe, but "it was most commendable of all to marry one of the priests'
line" \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[Luke 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 1:6</span></span>

commandments and ordinances--The one expressing their moral--the other
their ceremonial--obedience \[CALVIN and BENGEL\], (Compare [Eze
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020.md); [Heb
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001).md). It has been denied that any such
distinction was known to the Jews and New Testament writers. But [Mar
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md), and other passages, put this
beyond all reasonable doubt.

[Luke 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 1:7</span></span>

So with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Elkanah and Hannah, Manoah
and his wife.

[Luke 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 1:9</span></span>

his lot was to burn incense--The part assigned to each priest in his
week of service was decided by lot. Three were employed at the offering
of incense--to remove the ashes of the former service; to bring in and
place on the golden altar the pan filled with hot burning coals taken
from the altar of burnt offering; and to sprinkle the incense on the hot
coals; and, while the smoke of it ascended, to make intercession for the
people. This was the most distinguished part of the service ([Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md), and this was what fell to the
lot of Zacharias at this time \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[Luke 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 1:10</span></span>

praying without--outside the court in front of the temple, where stood
the altar of burnt offering; the men and women in separate courts, but
the altar visible to all.

the time of incense--which was offered along with the morning and
evening sacrifice of every day; a beautiful symbol of the acceptableness
of the sacrifice offered on the altar of burnt offering, with coals from
whose altar the incense was burnt ([Lev
16:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#012).md). This again was a symbol of
the "living sacrifice" of themselves and their services offered daily to
God by the worshippers. Hence the language of [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003.md). But that the acceptance of this
daily offering depended on the expiatory virtue presupposed in the burnt
offering, and pointing to the one "sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor"
([Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002).md), is evident from [Isa
6:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006.md).

[Luke 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 1:11</span></span>

right side--the south side, between the altar and the candlestick,
Zacharias being on the north side, in front of the altar, while offering
incense \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\]. But why there? The right was the
favorable side ([Mat 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033).md)
\[SCHOTTGEN and WESTEIN in MEYER\]; compare [Mar
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005.md).

[Luke 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 1:13</span></span>

thy prayer is heard--doubtless for offspring, which by some presentiment
he even yet had not despaired of.

John--the same as "Johanan," so frequent in the Old Testament, meaning
"Jehovah's gracious gift."

[Luke 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 1:14</span></span>

shall rejoice--so they did ([Luk 1:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#058.md),
[Luk 1:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#066).md); but the meaning rather is,
"shall have cause to rejoice"--it would prove to many a joyful event.

[Luke 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 1:15</span></span>

great in the sight of the Lord--nearer to Him in official standing than
all the prophets. (See [Mat 11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#010)..md)

drink neither wine nor strong drink--that is, shall be a Nazarite, or "a
separated one" ([Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002), &c..md). As the
leper was the living symbol of sin, so was the Nazarite of holiness;
nothing inflaming was to cross his lips; no razor to come on his head;
no ceremonial defilement to be contracted. Thus was he to be "holy to
the Lord \[ceremonially\] all the days of his separation." This
separation was in ordinary cases temporary and voluntary: only Samson
([Jdg 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#007).md), Samuel ([Sa1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011).md), and John Baptist were Nazarites
from the womb. It was fitting that the utmost severity of legal
consecration should be seen in Christ's forerunner. HE was the REALITY
and PERFECTION of the Nazarite without the symbol, which perished in
that living realization of it: "Such an High Priest became us, who was
SEPARATE FROM SINNERS" ([Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).md).

filled with the Holy Ghost, from . . . womb--a holy vessel for future
service.

[Luke 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 1:16</span></span>

A religious and moral reformer, Elijah-like, he should be ([Mal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#006.md), where the "turning of the
people's heart to the Lord" is borrowed from [Kg1
18:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#037).md). In both cases their success,
though great, was partial--the nation was not gained.

[Luke 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 1:17</span></span>

before him--before "the Lord their God" ([Luk
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#016).md). By comparing this with [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md) and [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md), it is plainly "Jehovah" in the
flesh of Messiah \[CALVIN and OLSHAUSEN\] before whom John was to go as
a herald to announce His approach, and a pioneer o prepare His way.

in the spirit--after the model.

and power of Elias--not his miraculous power, for John did no miracle"
([Joh 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#041).md), but his power "turning
the heart," or with like success in his ministry. Both fell on
degenerate times; both witnessed fearlessly for God; neither appeared
much save in the direct exercise of their ministry; both were at the
head of schools of disciples; the success of both was similar.

fathers to the children--taken literally, this denotes the restoration
of parental fidelity \[MEYER and others\], the decay of which is the
beginning of religious and social corruption--one prominent feature of
the coming revival being put for the whole. But what follows,
explanatory of this, rather suggests a figurative sense. If "the
disobedient" be "the children," and to "the fathers" belongs "the wisdom
of the just" \[BENGEL\], the meaning will be, "he shall bring back the
ancient spirit of the nation into their degenerate children" \[CALVIN,
&c.\]. So Elijah invoked "the God Abraham, Isaac, and Israel," when
seeking to "turn their heart back again" ([Kg1
18:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036).md).

to make ready, &c.--more clearly, "to make ready for the Lord a prepared
people," to have in readiness a people prepared to welcome Him. Such
preparation requires, in every age and every soul, an operation
corresponding to the Baptist's ministry.

[Luke 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 1:18</span></span>

Whereby, &c.--Mary believed what was far harder without a sign. Abraham,
though older, and doubtless Sarah, too, when the same promise was made
to him, "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was
strong in faith, giving glory to God." This was that in which Zacharias
failed.

[Luke 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 1:19</span></span>

Gabriel--signifying "man of God," the same who appeared to Daniel at the
time of incense ([Dan 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021).md) and to
Mary ([Luk 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026).md).

it.

until the day that these things shall be performed--See on [Luk
1:64](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#064.md).

thought vengeance had stricken the people's representative for something
wrong \[LIGHTFOOT\].

[Luke 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 1:22</span></span>

1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006), "made accepted".md): compare [Luk
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md), "Thou hast found favour with
God." The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, "full of grace," has been
taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church. As the mother of our
Lord, she was the most "blessed among women" in external distinction;
but let them listen to the Lord's own words. "Nay, rather blessed are
they that hear the word of God and keep it." (See on [Luk
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#027).md).

[Luke 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 1:31</span></span>

The angel purposely conforms his language to Isaiah's famous prophecy
([Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md) \[CALVIN\].

[Luke 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 1:32</span></span>

This is but an echo of the sublime prediction in [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md).

[Luke 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 1:34</span></span>

How, &c.--not the unbelief of Zacharias, "Whereby shall I know this?"
but, taking the fact for granted, "How is it to be, so contrary to the
unbroken law of human birth?" Instead of reproof, therefore, her
question is answered in mysterious detail.

[Luke 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035.md)

the Holy Ghost.

be this Power \[BENGEL\]; and its mysterious secrecy, withdrawn, as if
by a cloud, from human scrutiny \[CALVIN\].

that holy thing born of thee--that holy Offspring of thine.

therefore . . . Son of God--That Christ is the Son of God in His divine
and eternal nature is clear from all the New Testament; yet here we see
that Sonship efflorescing into human and palpable manifestation by His
being born, through "the power of the Highest," an Infant of days. We
must neither think of a double Sonship, as some do, harshly and without
all ground, nor deny what is here plainly expressed, the connection
between His human birth and His proper personal Sonship.

[Luke 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 1:36</span></span>

faith.

[Luke 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 1:37</span></span>

For, &c.--referring to what was said by the angel to Abraham in like
case ([Gen 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014).md), to strengthen her
faith.

[Luke 1:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">luk 1:38</span></span>

Marvellous faith in such circumstances!

VISIT OF MARY TO ELISABETH. (Luke 1:39-56)

from north to south \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

tidings, now first made known to her, of Elisabeth's condition.

a city of Juda--probably Hebron (see [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md); [Jos

babe leaped--From [Luk 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#044.md) it is
plain that this maternal sensation was something extraordinary--a
sympathetic emotion of the unconscious babe, at the presence of the
mother of his Lord.

[Luke 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 1:42</span></span>

What beautiful superiority to envy have we here! High as was the
distinction conferred upon herself, Elisabeth loses sight of it
altogether, in presence of one more honored still; upon whom, with her
unborn Babe, in an ecstasy of inspiration, she pronounces a benediction,
feeling it to be a wonder unaccountable that "the mother of her Lord
should come to her." "Turn this as we will, we shall never be able to
see the propriety of calling an unborn child "Lord," but by supposing
Elisabeth, like the prophets of old, enlightened to perceive the
Messiah's Divine nature" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Luke 1:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#043.md)

An additional benediction on the Virgin for her implicit faith, in tacit
and delicate contrast with her own husband.

[Luke 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 1:46</span></span>

A magnificent canticle, in which the strain of Hannah's ancient song, in
like circumstances, is caught up, and just slightly modified and
sublimed. Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed
Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas
and the tone of this hymn, so that when the life and fire of inspiration
penetrated her whole soul it spontaneously swept the chorus of this
song, enriching the Hymnal of the Church with that spirit-stirring
canticle which has resounded ever since from its temple walls? In both
songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold "the proud, the
mighty, the rich," passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen
to usher in the greatest events, sing of this as no capricious movement,
but a great law of the kingdom of God, by which He delights to "put down
the mighty from their seats and exalt them of low degree." In both songs
the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of "Jehovah's
King"--to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He
will "give strength"; His "Anointed," whose horn He will exalt ([Sa1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010).md); in the Virgin's song, it is as
the "Help" promised to Israel by all the prophets.

My soul . . . my spirit--"all that is within me" ([Psa
103:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#001).md).

"immaculate conception"--in the offensive language of the Romanists--any
more than of her own immaculate life.

a parenthesis. (Compare [Mic 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020.md);

is now to be seen, while the progeny of those two women--the one but the
honored pioneer of the other--have made the world new.

CHILD. (Luke 1:57-80)

eighth day--The law ([Gen 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012).md) was
observed, even though the eighth day after birth should be a sabbath
([Joh 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#023.md); and see [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005).md).

called him--literally, "were calling"--that is, (as we should say) "were
for calling." The naming of children at baptism has its origin in the
Jewish custom at circumcision ([Gen
21:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#003).md); and the names of Abram and
Sarai were changed at its first performance ([Gen
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md), [Gen

vision, for disbelieving which he had been struck dumb ([Luk

in these events (compare [Luk 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#026.md);

destined to some great work ([Kg1

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_068">luk 1:68</span></span>

There is not a word in this noble burst of divine song about his own
child; like Elisabeth losing sight entirely of self, in the glory of a
Greater than both.

Lord God of Israel--the ancient covenant God of the peculiar people.

visited and redeemed--that is, in order to redeem: returned after long
absence, and broken His long silence (see [Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031).md). In the Old Testament, God is
said to "visit" chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy.
Zacharias would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such "visiting and
redeeming," "saving from and delivering out of the hand of enemies"
([Luk 1:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#071.md), [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074).md). But this Old Testament
phraseology, used at first with a lower reference, is, when viewed in
the light of a loftier and more comprehensive kingdom of God, equally
adapted to express the most spiritual conceptions of the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus.

[Luke 1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_069">luk 1:69</span></span>

horn of salvation--that is "strength of salvation," or "mighty
Salvation," meaning the Saviour Himself, whom Simeon calls "Thy
Salvation" ([Luk 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030).md). The metaphor
is taken from those animals whose strength is in their horns ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md); [Psa
75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010.md); [Psa
132:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#017).md).

house of . . . David--This shows that Mary must have been known to be of
the royal line, independent of Joseph; of whom Zacharias, if he knew
anything, could not know that after this he would recognize Mary.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_073">luk 1:73</span></span>

the oath . . . to . . . Abraham--The whole work and kingdom of Messiah
is represented as a mercy pledged on oath to Abraham and his seed, to be
realized at an appointed period; and at length, in "the fulness of the
time," gloriously made good. Hence, not only "grace," or the thing
promised; but "truth," or fidelity to the promise, are said to "come by
Jesus Christ" ([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017).md).

[Luke 1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md)

That he would grant us, &c.--How comprehensive is the view here given!
(1) The purpose of all redemption--"that we should serve Him"--that is,
"the Lord God of Israel" ([Luk 1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068).md).
The word signifies religious service distinctively--"the priesthood of
the New Testament" \[BENGEL\]. (2) The nature of this service--"in
holiness and righteousness before Him" ([Luk
1:75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075).md) --or, as in His presence
(compare [Psa 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013)). (3.md) Its
freedom--"being delivered out of the hand of our enemies." (4) Its
fearlessness--"might serve Him without fear." (5) Its duration--"all the
days of our life."

Here are the dying echoes of this song; and very beautiful are these
closing notes--like the setting sun, shorn indeed of its noontide
radiance, but skirting the horizon with a wavy and quivering light--as
of molten gold--on which the eye delights to gaze, till it disappears
from the view. The song passes not here from Christ to John, but only
from Christ direct to Christ as heralded by His forerunner.

thou child--not "my son"--this child's relation to himself being lost in
his relation to a Greater than either.

prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before him--that is, "the
Highest." As "the Most High" is an epithet in Scripture only of the
supreme God, it is inconceivable that inspiration should apply this
term, as here undeniably, to Christ, unless He were "God over all
blessed for ever" ([Rom 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005).md).

[Luke 1:77](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#077.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_077">luk 1:77</span></span>

to give knowledge of salvation--To sound the note of a needed and
provided "salvation" was the noble office of John, above all that
preceded him; as it is that of all subsequent ministers of Christ; but
infinitely loftier was it to be the "Salvation" itself ([Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md) and [Luk
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030).md).

by the remission of . . . sins--This stamps at once the spiritual nature
of the salvation here intended, and explains [Luk
1:71](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#071.md), [Luk
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md).

[Luke 1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_078">luk 1:78</span></span>

Through the tender mercy of our God--the sole spring, necessarily, of
all salvation for sinners.

dayspring from on high--either Christ Himself, as the "Sun of
righteousness" ([Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002).md), arising on
a dark world \[BEZA, GROTIUS, CALVIN, DE WETTE, OLSHAUSEN, &c.\], or the
light which He sheds. The sense, of course, is one.

(Compare [Isa 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Mat
4:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013).md). "That St. Luke, of all the
Evangelists, should have obtained and recorded these inspired utterances
of Zacharias and Mary--is in accordance with his character and habits,
as indicated in [Luk 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001.md)" \[WEBSTER
and WILKINSON\].

And the child, &c.--"a concluding paragraph, indicating, in strokes full
of grandeur, the bodily and mental development of the Baptist; and
bringing his life up to the period of his public appearance"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).md), whither he had retired early in
life, in the Nazarite spirit, and where, free from rabbinical influences
and alone with God, his spirit would be educated, like Moses in the
desert, for his future high vocation.
