### [Psalms Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 19:1</span></span>

After exhibiting the harmonious revelation of God's perfections made by
His works and His word, the Psalmist prays for conformity to the Divine
teaching. ([Psa 19:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001).md)

the glory of God--is the sum of His perfections ([Psa
24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md); [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).md).

firmament--another word for "heavens" ([Gen
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#008).md).

handywork--old English for "work of His hands."

[Psalms 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 19:2</span></span>

uttereth--pours forth as a stream; a perpetual testimony.

[Psalms 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 19:3</span></span>

Though there is no articulate speech or words, yet without these their
voice is heard (compare Margin).

[Psalms 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 19:4</span></span>

Their line--or, "instruction"--the influence exerted by their tacit
display of God's perfections. Paul ([Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008).md), quoting from the Septuagint,
uses "sound," which gives the same sense.

[Psalms 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 19:5</span></span>

The sun, as the most glorious heavenly body, is specially used to
illustrate the sentiment; and his vigorous, cheerful, daily, and
extensive course, and his reviving heat (including light), well display
the wondrous wisdom of his Maker.

[Psalms 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 19:7</span></span>

The law is described by six names, epithets, and effects. It is a rule,
God's testimony for the truth, His special and general prescription of
duty, fear (as its cause) and judicial decision. It is distinct and
certain, reliable, right, pure, holy, and true. Hence it revives those
depressed by doubts, makes wise the unskilled ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md), rejoices the lover of truth,
strengthens the desponding ([Psa 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#004.md);
[Psa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#006).md), provides permanent
principles of conduct, and by God's grace brings a rich reward.

[Psalms 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 19:12</span></span>

The clearer our view of the law, the more manifest are our sins. Still
for its full effect we need divine grace to show us our faults, acquit
us, restrain us from the practice, and free us from the power, of sin.
Thus only can our conduct be blameless, and our words and thoughts
acceptable to God.
