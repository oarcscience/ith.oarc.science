### [Luke Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001)

[Luke 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 13:1</span></span>

THE LESSON, "REPENT OR PERISH," SUGGESTED BY TWO RECENT INCIDENTS, AND
ILLUSTRATED BY THE PARABLE OF THE BARREN FIG TREE. ([Luk
13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001))

Galileans--possibly the followers of Judas of Galilee, who, some twenty
years before this, taught that Jews should not pay tribute to the
Romans, and of whom we learn, from [Act
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037), that he drew after him a
multitude of followers, who on his being slain were all dispersed. About
this time that party would be at its height, and if Pilate caused this
detachment of them to be waylaid and put to death as they were offering
their sacrifices at one of the festivals, that would be "mingling their
blood with their sacrifices" \[GROTIUS, WEBSTER and WILKINSON, but
doubted by DE WETTE, MEYER, ALFORD, &c.\]. News of this being brought to
our Lord, to draw out His views of such, and whether it was not a
judgment of Heaven, He simply points them to the practical view of the
matter: "These men are not signal examples of divine vengeance, as ye
suppose; but every impenitent sinner--ye yourselves, except ye
repent--shall be like monuments of the judgment of Heaven, and in a more
awful sense." The reference here to the impending destruction of
Jerusalem is far from exhausting our Lord's weighty words; they
manifestly point to a "perdition" of a more awful kind--future,
personal, remediless.

[Luke 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 13:4</span></span>

tower in Siloam--probably one of the towers of the city wall, near the
pool of Siloam. Of its fall nothing is known.

[Luke 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 13:6</span></span>

fig tree--Israel, as the visible witness of God in the world, but
generally all within the pale of the visible Church of God; a familiar
figure (compare [Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001); [Joh
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001), &c.).

vineyard--a spot selected for its fertility, separated from the
surrounding fields, and cultivated with special care, with a view solely
to fruit.

came and sought fruit--a heart turned to God; the fruits of
righteousness; compare [Mat 21:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033),
and [Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002), "He looked that it
should bring forth fruit"; He has a right to it, and will require it.

[Luke 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 13:7</span></span>

three years--a long enough trial for a fig tree, and so denoting
probably just a sufficient period of culture for spiritual fruit. The
supposed allusion to the duration of our Lord's ministry is precarious.

cut it down--indignant language.

cumbereth--not only doing no good, but wasting ground.

[Luke 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 13:8</span></span>

he answering, &c.--Christ, as Intercessor, loath to see it cut down so
long as there was any hope (see [Luk
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034)).

dig, &c.--loosen the earth about it and enrich it with manure; pointing
to changes of method in the divine treatment of the impenitent, in order
to freshen spiritual culture.

[Luke 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 13:9</span></span>

if . . . fruit, well--Genuine repentance, however late, avails to save
([Luk 23:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#042)).

after that, &c.--The final perdition of such as, after the utmost limits
of reasonable forbearance, are found fruitless, will be pre-eminently
and confessedly just ([Pro 1:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024);
[Eze 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013)).

[Luke 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 13:11</span></span>

WOMAN OF EIGHTEEN YEAR'S INFIRMITY HEALED ON THE SABBATH. ([Luk
13:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#010))

spirit of infirmity--Compare [Luk
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#017), "whom Satan hath bound." From
this it is probable, though not certain, that her protracted infirmity
was the effect of some milder form of possession; yet she was "a
daughter of Abraham," in the same gracious sense, no doubt, as Zaccheus,
after his conversion, was "a son of Abraham" ([Luk
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009)).

[Luke 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 13:12</span></span>

said . . . Woman . . . and laid--both at once.

[Luke 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 13:14</span></span>

with indignation--not so much at the sabbath violation as at the
glorification of Christ. (Compare [Mat
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#015)) \[TRENCH\].

said to the people--"Not daring directly to find fault with the Lord, he
seeks circuitously to reach Him through the people, who were more under
his influence, and whom he feared less" \[TRENCH\].

[Luke 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 13:15</span></span>

the Lord--(See on [Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001)).

hypocrite!--How "the faithful and true Witness" tears off the masks
which men wear!

his ox, &c.--(See on [Mat 12:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009); and
[Luk 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009)).

[Luke 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 13:16</span></span>

ought not, &c.--How gloriously the Lord vindicates the superior claims
of this woman, in consideration of the sadness and long duration of her
suffering, and of her dignity notwithstanding, as an heir of the
promise!

[Luke 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 13:18</span></span>

MISCELLANEOUS TEACHINGS. ([Luk
13:18-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#018))

mustard seed . . . leaven--(See on [Mar
4:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#030)). The parable of "the Leaven"
sets forth, perhaps, rather the inward growth of the kingdom, while "the
Mustard Seed" seems to point chiefly to the outward. It being a woman's
work to knead, it seems a refinement to say that "the woman" here
represents the Church, as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor
does it yield much satisfaction to understand the "three measures of
meal" of that threefold division of our nature into "spirit, soul, and
body," (alluded to in [Th1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)) or of
the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah ([Gen
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#032)), as some do. It yields more
real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating
and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet
mould all institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole
earth one "Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ." (See on [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015)).

[Luke 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 13:23</span></span>

Lord, &c.--one of those curious questions by talking of which some
flatter themselves they are religious.

said unto them--the multitude; taking no notice of the man or his
question, save as furnishing the occasion of a solemn warning not to
trifle with so momentous a matter as "salvation."

[Luke 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 13:24</span></span>

Strive--The word signifies to "contend" as for the mastery, to
"struggle," expressive of the difficulty of being saved, as if one would
have to force his way in.

strait gate--another figure of the same. (See on [Mat
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013)).

for many . . . will seek--"desire," that is, with a mere wish or
slothful endeavor.

and shall not be able--because it must be made a life-and-death
struggle.

[Luke 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 13:25</span></span>

master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door--awfully
sublime and vivid picture! At present he is represented as in a sitting
posture, as if calmly looking on to see who will "strive," while
entrance is practicable, and who will merely "seek" to enter in. But
this is to have an end, by the great Master of the house Himself rising
and shutting the door, after which there will be no admittance.

Lord, Lord--emphatic reduplication, expressive of the earnestness now
felt, but too late. (See on [Mat
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021)).

[Luke 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 13:26</span></span>

See on the similar passage ([Mat
7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

eaten and drunk, &c.--We have sat with Thee at the same table. (See on
[Mat 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022)).

taught in our streets--Do we not remember listening in our own streets
to Thy teaching? Surely we are not to be denied admittance?

[Luke 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 13:27</span></span>

But he shall say, &c.--(See on [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)). No nearness of external
communion with Christ will avail at the great day, in place of that
holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. Observe the style
which Christ intimates that He will then assume, that of absolute
Disposer of men's eternal destinies, and contrast it with His "despised
and rejected" condition at that time.

[Luke 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 13:28</span></span>

(See [Mat 8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011)). Also see on [Mat
13:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#042).

[Luke 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 13:31</span></span>

MESSAGE TO HEROD. ([Luk 13:31-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#031))

and depart hence--and "go forward," push on. He was on His way out of
Perea, east of Jordan, and in Herod's dominions, "journeying towards
Jerusalem" ([Luk 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#022)). Haunted by
guilty fears, probably, Herod wanted to get rid of Him (see on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014)), and seems, from our Lord's
answer, to have sent these Pharisees, under pretense of a friendly hint,
to persuade Him that the sooner He got beyond Herod's jurisdiction the
better it would be for His own safety. Our Lord saw through both of
them, and sends the cunning ruler a message couched in dignified and
befitting irony.

[Luke 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 13:32</span></span>

that fox--that crafty, cruel enemy of God's innocent servants.

Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures--that is, "Plot on and ply thy
wiles; I also have My plans; My works of mercy are nearing completion,
but some yet remain; I have work for to-day and to-morrow too, and the
third day; by that time I shall be where his jurisdiction reaches not;
the guilt of My blood shall not lie at his door; that dark deed is
reserved for others." He does not say, I preach the Gospel--that would
have made little impression upon Herod--in the light of the merciful
character of Christ's actions the malice of Herod's snares is laid bare
\[BENGEL\].

to-day, to-morrow, the third day--remarkable language expressive of
successive steps of His work yet remaining, the calm deliberateness with
which He meant to go through with them, one after another, to the last,
unmoved by Herod's threat, yet the rapid march with which they were now
hastening to completion. (Compare [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037)).

I shall be perfected--I finish my course, I attain completion.

[Luke 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 13:33</span></span>

it cannot be that a prophet, &c.--"It would never do that," &c.--awful
severity of satire this upon "the bloody city!" "He seeks to kill me,
does he? Ah! I must be out of Herod's jurisdiction for that. Go tell him
I neither fly from him nor fear him, but Jerusalem is the prophets'
slaughter-house."

[Luke 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 13:34</span></span>

O Jerusalem, &c.--(See on [Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037);
[Mat 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039)).
