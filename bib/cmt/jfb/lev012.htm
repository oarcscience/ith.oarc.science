<p>If a woman, &amp;c.--The mother of a boy was ceremonially unclean for a week, at the end of which the child was circumcised (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012">Gen 17:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011">Rom 4:11-13</A>); the mother of a girl for two weeks (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005">Lev 12:5</A>) --a stigma on the sex (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014">Ti1 2:14-15</A>) for sin, which was removed by Christ; everyone who came near her during that time contracted a similar defilement. After these periods, visitors might approach her though she was still excluded from the public ordinances of religion [<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004">Lev 12:4</A>].

The offerings were to be presented the day after the period of her separation had ended--that is, forty-first for a boy, eighty-first for a girl.

This was the offering made by Mary, the mother of Jesus, and it affords an incontestable proof of the poor and humble condition of the family (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022">Luk 2:22-24</A>).
