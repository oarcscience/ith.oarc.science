### [Micah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)

[Micah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 2:1</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF THE EVILS PREVALENT: THE PEOPLE'S UNWILLINGNESS TO HEAR
THE TRUTH: THEIR EXPULSION FROM THE LAND THE FITTING FRUIT OF THEIR SIN:
YET JUDAH AND ISRAEL ARE HEREAFTER TO BE RESTORED. ([Mic
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001))

devise . . . work . . . practise--They do evil not merely on a sudden
impulse, but with deliberate design. As in the former chapter sins
against the first table are reproved, so in this chapter sins against
the second table. A gradation: "devise" is the conception of the evil
purpose; "work" ([Psa 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002)), or
"fabricate," the maturing of the scheme; "practise," or "effect," the
execution of it.

because it is in the power of their hand--for the phrase see [Gen
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#029); [Pro
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#027). Might, not right, is what
regulates their conduct. Where they can, they commit oppression; where
they do not, it is because they cannot.

[Micah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mic 2:2</span></span>

Parallelism, "Take by violence," answers to "take away"; "fields" and
"houses," to "house" and "heritage" (that is, one's land).

[Micah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 2:3</span></span>

against this family--against the nation, and especially against those
reprobates in [Mic 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).

I devise an evil--a happy antithesis between God's dealings and the Jews
dealings ([Mic 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001)). Ye "devise evil"
against your fellow countrymen; I devise evil against you. Ye devise it
wrongfully, I by righteous retribution in kind.

from which ye shall not remove your necks--as ye have done from the law.
The yoke I shall impose shall be one which ye cannot shake off. They who
will not bend to God's "easy yoke" ([Mat
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)), shall feel His iron yoke.

go haughtily--(Compare Note, see on [Jer
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028)). Ye shall not walk as now with
neck haughtily uplifted, for the yoke shall press down your "neck."

this time is evil--rather, "for that time shall be an evil time,"
namely, the time of the carrying away into captivity (compare [Amo
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013); [Eph
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016)).

[Micah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 2:4</span></span>

one take up a parable against you--that is, Some of your foes shall do
so, taking in derision from your own mouth your "lamentation," namely,
"We be spoiled," &c.

lament with a doleful lamentation--literally, "lament with a lamentation
of lamentations." Hebrew, naha, nehi, nihyah, the repetition
representing the continuous and monotonous wail.

he hath changed the portion of my people--a charge of injustice against
Jehovah. He transfers to other nations the sacred territory assigned as
the rightful portion of our people ([Mic
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015)).

turning away he hath divided our fields--Turning away from us to the
enemy, He hath divided among them our fields. CALVIN, as the Margin,
explains, "Instead of restoring our territory, He hath divided our
fields among our enemies, each of whom henceforward will have an
interest in keeping what he hath gotten: so that we are utterly shut out
from hope of restoration." MAURER translates as a noun, "He hath divided
our fields to a rebel," that is, to the foe who is a rebel against the
true God, and a worshipper of idols. So "backsliding," that is,
backslider ([Jer 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#004)). English
Version gives a good sense; and is quite tenable in the Hebrew.

[Micah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 2:5</span></span>

Therefore--resumed from [Mic 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003). On
account of your crimes described in [Mic
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).

thou--the ideal individual ("me," [Mic
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)), representing the guilty people
in whose name he spoke.

none that . . . cast a cord by lot--none who shall have any possession
measured out.

in the congregation of the Lord--among the people consecrated to
Jehovah. By covetousness and violence ([Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002)) they had forfeited "the portion
of Jehovah's people." This is God's implied answer to their complaint of
injustice ([Mic 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)).

[Micah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 2:6</span></span>

Prophesy ye not, say they--namely, the Israelites say to the true
prophets, when announcing unwelcome truths. Therefore God judicially
abandons them to their own ways: "The prophets, by whose ministry they
might have been saved from shame (ignominious captivity), shall not
(that is, no longer) prophesy to them" ([Isa
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010); [Amo
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#012); [Amo
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#016)). MAURER translates the latter
clause, "they shall not prophesy of such things" (as in [Mic
2:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#003), these being rebellious Israel's
words); "let them not prophesy"; "they never cease from insult" (from
prophesying insults to us). English Version is supported by the
parallelism: wherein the similarity of sound and word implies how
exactly God makes their punishment answer to their sin, and takes them
at their own word. "Prophesy," literally, "drop" ([Deu
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#002); [Eze
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002)).

[Micah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 2:7</span></span>

O thou . . . named the house of Jacob--priding thyself on the name,
though having naught of the spirit, of thy progenitor. Also, bearing the
name which ought to remind thee of God's favors granted to thee because
of His covenant with Jacob.

is the Spirit of the Lord straitened?--Is His compassion contracted
within narrower limits now than formerly, so that He should delight in
your destruction (compare [Psa 77:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#007);
[Isa 59:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001))?

are these his doings?--that is, Are such threatenings His delight? Ye
dislike the prophets' threatenings ([Mic
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006)): but who is to blame? Not God,
for He delights in blessing, rather than threatening; but yourselves
([Mic 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008)) who provoke His
threatenings \[GROTIUS\]. CALVIN translates, "Are your doings such as
are prescribed by Him?" Ye boast of being God's peculiar people: Do ye
then conform your lives to God's law?

do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly--Are not My words
good to the upright? If your ways were upright, My words would not be
threatening (compare [Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026); [Mat
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017)).

[Micah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 2:8</span></span>

Your ways are not such that I can deal with you as I would with the
upright.

Even of late--literally, "yesterday," "long ago." So "of old." Hebrew,
"yesterday" ([Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033));
"heretofore," Hebrew, "since yesterday" ([Jos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#004)).

my people is risen up as an enemy--that is, has rebelled against My
precepts; also has become an enemy to the unoffending passers-by.

robe with the garment--Not content with the outer "garment," ye greedily
rob passers-by of the ornamental "robe" fitting the body closely and
flowing down to the feet \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\] ([Mat
5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040)).

as men averse from war--in antithesis to (My people) "as an enemy."
Israel treats the innocent passers-by, though "averse from war," as an
enemy" would treat captives in his power, stripping them of their
habiliments as lawful spoils. GROTIUS translates, "as men returning from
war," that is, as captives over whom the right of war gives the victors
an absolute power. English Version is supported by the antithesis.

[Micah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 2:9</span></span>

The women of my people--that is, the widows of the men slain by you
([Mic 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002)) ye cast out from their
homes which had been their delight, and seize on them for yourselves.

from their children--that is, from the orphans of the widows.

taken away my glory--namely, their substance and raiment, which, being
the fruit of God's blessing on the young, reflected God's glory. Thus
Israel's crime was not merely robbery, but sacrilege. Their sex did not
save the women, nor their age the children from violence.

for ever--There was no repentance. They persevered in sin. The pledged
garment was to be restored to the poor before sunset ([Exo
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026)); but these never restored
their unlawful booty.

[Micah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 2:10</span></span>

Arise ye, and depart--not an exhortation to the children of God to
depart out of an ungodly world, as it is often applied; though that
sentiment is a scriptural one. This world is doubtless not our "rest,"
being "polluted" with sin: it is our passage, not our portion; our aim,
not our home ([Co2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)). The imperatives express the
certainty of the future event predicted. "Since such are your doings
(compare [Mic 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007), &c.), My sentence
on you is irrevocable ([Mic 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)),
however distasteful to you ([Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006));
ye who have cast out others from their homes and possessions ([Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002), [Mic
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#008)) must arise, depart, and be cast
out of your own ([Mic 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004)): for this
is not your rest" ([Num 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#033); [Deu
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#009); [Psa
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011)). Canaan was designed to be a
rest to them after their wilderness fatigues. But it is to be so no
longer. Thus God refutes the people's self-confidence, as if God were
bound to them inseparably. The promise ([Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)) is quite consistent with
temporary withdrawal of God from Israel for their sins.

it shall destroy you--The land shall spew you out, because of the
defilements wherewith ye "polluted" it ([Lev
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025), [Lev
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#028); [Jer
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002); [Eze
36:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#012)).

[Micah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 2:11</span></span>

walking in the spirit--The Hebrew means also "wind." "If a man
professing to have the 'spirit' of inspiration ([Eze
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003); so 'man of the spirit,' that is,
one claiming inspiration, [Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007)),
but really walking in 'wind' (prophecy void of nutriment for the soul,
and unsubstantial as the wind) and falsehood, do lie, saying (that which
ye like to hear), I will prophesy," &c., even such a one, however false
his prophecies, since he flatters your wishes, shall be your prophet
(compare [Mic 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#006); [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031)).

prophesy . . . of wine--that is, of an abundant supply of wine.

[Micah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 2:12</span></span>

A sudden transition from threats to the promise of a glorious
restoration. Compare a similar transition in [Hos
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009). Jehovah, too, prophesies of
good things to come, but not like the false prophets, "of wine and
strong drink" ([Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)). After I
have sent you into captivity as I have just threatened, I will thence
assemble you again (compare [Mic
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006)).

all of thee--The restoration from Babylon was partial. Therefore that
here meant must be still future, when "all Israel shall be saved" ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)). The restoration from "Babylon"
(specified ([Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010)) is the type of
the future one.

Jacob . . . Israel--the ten tribes' kingdom ([Hos
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002)) and Judah ([Ch2
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#008); [Ch2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#002), [Ch2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#004)).

remnant--the elect remnant, which shall survive the previous calamities
of Judah, and from which the nation is to spring into new life ([Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013); [Isa
10:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020)).

as the sheep of Bozrah--a region famed for its rich pastures (compare
[Kg2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004)). GESENIUS for Bozrah
translates, "sheepfold." But thus there will be tautology unless the
next clause be translated, "in the midst of their pasture." English
Version is more favored by the Hebrew.

[Micah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 2:13</span></span>

The breaker--Jehovah-Messiah, who breaks through every obstacle in the
way of their restoration: not as formerly breaking forth to destroy them
for transgression ([Exo 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022); [Jdg
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015)), but breaking a way for them
through their enemies.

they--the returning Israelites and Jews.

passed through the gate--that is, through the gate of the foe's city in
which they had been captives. So the image of the resurrection ([Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014)) represents Israel's
restoration.

their king--"the Breaker," peculiarly "their king" ([Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005); [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037)).

pass before them--as He did when they went up out of Egypt ([Exo
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021); [Deu
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#030), [Deu
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033)).

the Lord on the head of them--Jehovah at their head ([Isa
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012)). Messiah, the second person, is
meant (compare [Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020); [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014); [Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009)).
