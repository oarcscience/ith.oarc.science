### [Matthew Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 21:23</span></span>

THE AUTHORITY OF JESUS QUESTIONED AND THE REPLY--THE PARABLES OF THE TWO
SONS, AND OF THE WICKED HUSBANDMAN. ( = Mark 11:27-12:12; Luke 20:1-19).
(Mat. 21:23-46)

By what authority doest thou these things!--referring particularly to
the expulsion of the buyers and sellers from the temple, and who gave
thee this authority?

[Matthew 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 21:24</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing,
&c.

[Matthew 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 21:25</span></span>

The baptism of John--meaning his whole mission and ministry, of which
baptism was the proper character.

whence was it? from heaven, or of men?--What wisdom there was in this
way of meeting their question will best appear by their reply.

If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then
believe him?--"Why did ye not believe the testimony which he bore to Me,
as the promised and expected Messiah?" for that was the burden of John's
whole testimony.

[Matthew 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 21:26</span></span>

But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people--rather, "the
multitude." In Luke ([Luk 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#006).md) it is,
"all the people will stone us."

for all hold John as a prophet--Crooked, cringing hypocrites! No wonder
Jesus gave you no answer.

[Matthew 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 21:27</span></span>

And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell--Evidently their
difficulty was, how to answer, so as neither to shake their
determination to reject the claims of Christ nor damage their reputation
with the people. For the truth itself they cared nothing whatever.

Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things--What composure
and dignity of wisdom does our Lord here display, as He turns their
question upon themselves, and, while revealing His knowledge of their
hypocrisy, closes their mouths! Taking advantage of the surprise,
silence, and awe produced by this reply, our Lord followed it up
immediately by the two following parables.

Parable of the Two Sons ([Mat
21:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028).md).

[Matthew 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 21:28</span></span>

But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first
and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard--for true religion is a
practical thing, a "bringing forth fruit unto God."

[Matthew 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 21:29</span></span>

He answered and said, I will not--TRENCH notices the rudeness of this
answer, and the total absence of any attempt to excuse such
disobedience, both characteristic; representing careless, reckless
sinners resisting God to His face.

[Matthew 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 21:30</span></span>

And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said,
I go, sir--"I, sir." The emphatic "I," here, denotes the self-righteous
complacency which says, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men"
([Luk 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011).md).

and went not--He did not "afterward repent" and refuse to go; for there
was here no intention to go. It is the class that "say and do not" ([Mat
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#003).md) --a falseness more abominable to
God, says STIER, than any "I will not."

[Matthew 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 21:31</span></span>

Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? They say unto him, The
first--Now comes the application.

Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the
harlots go--or, "are going"; even now entering, while ye hold back.

into the kingdom of God before you--The publicans and the harlots were
the first son, who, when told to work in the Lord's vineyard, said, I
will not; but afterwards repented and went. Their early life was a flat
and flagrant refusal to do what they were commanded; it was one
continued rebellion against the authority of God. The chief priests and
the elders of the people, with whom our Lord was now speaking, were the
second son, who said, I go, sir, but went not. They were early called,
and all their life long professed obedience to God, but never rendered
it; their life was one of continued disobedience.

[Matthew 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 21:32</span></span>

For John came unto you in the way of righteousness--that is, calling you
to repentance; as Noah is styled "a preacher of righteousness" ([Pe2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#005).md), when like the Baptist he warned
the old world to "flee from the wrath to come."

and ye believed him not--They did not reject him; nay, they "were
willing for a season to rejoice in his light" ([Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).md); but they would not receive his
testimony to Jesus.

but the publicans and the harlots believed him--Of the publicans this is
twice expressly recorded, [Luk 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md);
[Luk 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#029.md). Of the harlots, then, the
same may be taken for granted, though the fact is not expressly
recorded. These outcasts gladly believed the testimony of John to the
coming Saviour, and so hastened to Jesus when He came. See [Luk
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037.md); [Luk
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md), &c.

and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might
believe him--Instead of being "provoked to jealousy" by their example,
ye have seen them flocking to the Saviour and getting to heaven,
unmoved.

Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen ([Mat
21:33-46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md).

[Matthew 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 21:33</span></span>

Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a
vineyard--(See on [Luk 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006).md).

and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a
tower--These details are taken, as is the basis of the parable itself,
from that beautiful parable of [Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md), in order to fix down the
application and sustain it by Old Testament authority.

and let it out to husbandmen--These are just the ordinary spiritual
guides of the people, under whose care and culture the fruits of
righteousness are expected to spring up.

and went into a far country--"for a long time" ([Luk
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009).md), leaving the vineyard to the
laws of the spiritual husbandry during the whole time of the Jewish
economy. On this phraseology, see on [Mar
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mat 21:34</span></span>

And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the
husbandmen--By these "servants" are meant the prophets and other
extraordinary messengers, raised up from time to time. See on [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md).

that they might receive the fruits of it--Again see on [Luk
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#006.md).

[Matthew 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 21:35</span></span>

And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one--see [Jer
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md); [Jer
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md).

and killed another--see [Jer 26:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020.md).

and stoned another--see [Ch2 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md).
Compare with this whole verse [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md), where our Lord reiterates these
charges in the most melting strain.

[Matthew 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 21:36</span></span>

Again, he sent other servants more than the first; and they did unto
them likewise--see [Kg2 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013.md); [Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016.md), [Ch2
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018.md); [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026.md).

[Matthew 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 21:37</span></span>

But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence
my son--In Mark ([Mar 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#006).md) this is
most touchingly expressed: "Having yet therefore one son, His
well-beloved, He sent Him also last unto them, saying, They will
reverence My Son." Luke's version of it too ([Luk
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#013).md) is striking: "Then said the
lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send My beloved Son: it
may be they will reverence Him when they see Him." Who does not see that
our Lord here severs Himself, by the sharpest line of demarcation, from
all merely human messengers, and claims for Himself Sonship in its
loftiest sense? (Compare [Heb 3:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003).md).
The expression, "It may be they will reverence My Son," is designed to
teach the almost unimaginable guilt of not reverentially welcoming God's
Son.

[Matthew 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 21:38</span></span>

But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves--Compare
[Gen 37:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#018.md); [Joh
11:47-53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047.md).

This is the heir--Sublime expression this of the great truth, that God's
inheritance was destined for, and in due time is to come into the
possession of, His own Son in our nature ([Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md).

come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance--that so,
from mere servants, we may become lords. This is the deep aim of the
depraved heart; this is emphatically "the root of all evil."

[Matthew 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 21:39</span></span>

And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard--compare [Heb
13:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011.md) ("without the gate--without
the camp"); [Kg1 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md); [Joh
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md).

and slew him.

[Matthew 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 21:40</span></span>

When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh--This represents "the
settling time," which, in the case of the Jewish ecclesiastics, was that
judicial trial of the nation and its leaders which issued in the
destruction of their whole state.

what will he do unto those husbandmen?

[Matthew 21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 21:41</span></span>

They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men--an
emphatic alliteration not easily conveyed in English: "He will badly
destroy those bad men," or "miserably destroy those miserable men," is
something like it.

and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render
him the fruits in their seasons--If this answer was given by the
Pharisees, to whom our Lord addressed the parable, they thus unwittingly
pronounced their own condemnation: as did David to Nathan the prophet
([Sa2 12:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005).md), and Simon the Pharisee
to our Lord ([Luk 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#043), &c..md). But if
it was given, as the two other Evangelists agree in representing it, by
our Lord Himself, and the explicitness of the answer would seem to favor
that supposition, then we can better explain the exclamation of the
Pharisees which followed it, in Luke's report ([Luk
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#016).md) --"And when they heard it, they
said, God forbid"--His whole meaning now bursting upon them.

[Matthew 21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 21:42</span></span>

Jesus saith unto them. Did ye never read in the scriptures-- ([Psa
118:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022).md).

The stone which the builders rejected, &c.--A bright Messianic prophecy,
which reappears in various forms ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016), &c..md), and was made glorious use
of by Peter before the Sanhedrim ([Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011).md). He recurs to it in his first
epistle ([Pe1 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md).

[Matthew 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 21:43</span></span>

Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God--God's visible Kingdom, or
Church, upon earth, which up to this time stood in the seed of Abraham.

shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof--that is, the great evangelical community of the faithful,
which, after the extrusion of the Jewish nation, would consist chiefly
of Gentiles, until "all Israel should be saved" ([Rom
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md). This vastly important
statement is given by Matthew only.

[Matthew 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 21:44</span></span>

And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder--The Kingdom of
God is here a Temple, in the erection of which a certain stone, rejected
as unsuitable by the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the
House, made the keystone of the whole. On that Stone the builders were
now "falling" and being "broken" ([Isa
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015).md). They were sustaining great
spiritual hurt; but soon that Stone should "fall upon them" and "grind
them to powder" ([Dan 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md); [Zac
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002).md) --in their corporate capacity,
in the tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, but personally, as
unbelievers, in a more awful sense still.

[Matthew 21:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 21:45</span></span>

And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
parables--referring to that of the Two Sons and this one of the Wicked
Husbandmen.

they perceived that he spake of them.

[Matthew 21:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 21:46</span></span>

But when they sought to lay hands on him--which Luke ([Luk
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#019).md) says they did "the same hour,"
hardly able to restrain their rage.

they feared the multitude--rather, "the multitudes."

because they took him for a prophet--just as they feared to say John's
baptism was of men, because the masses took him for a prophet ([Mat
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#026).md). Miserable creatures! So, for
this time, "they left Him and went their way" ([Mar
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#012).md).
