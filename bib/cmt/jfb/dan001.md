### [Daniel Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

[Daniel 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 1:1</span></span>

THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY BEGINS; DANIEL'S EDUCATION AT BABYLON, &C.
(Dan. 1:1-21)

third year--compare [Jer 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md), "the
fourth year; Jehoiakim came to the throne at the end of the year, which
Jeremiah reckons as the first year, but which Daniel leaves out of
count, being an incomplete year: thus, in Jeremiah, it is "the fourth
year"; in Daniel, "the third" \[JAHN\]. However, Jeremiah ([Jer
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md); [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002).md) merely says, the fourth year of
Jehoiakim coincided with the first of Nebuchadnezzar, when the latter
conquered the Egyptians at Carchemish; not that the deportation of
captives from Jerusalem was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim: this
probably took place in the end of the third year of Jehoiakim, shortly
before the battle of Carchemish \[FAIRBAIRN\]. Nebuchadnezzar took away
the captives as hostages for the submission of the Hebrews. Historical
Scripture gives no positive account of this first deportation, with
which the Babylonian captivity, that is, Judah's subjection to Babylon
for seventy years ([Jer 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md),
begins. But [Ch2 36:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md), states that
Nebuchadnezzar had intended "to carry Jehoiakim to Babylon," and that he
"carried off the vessels of the house of the Lord" thither. But
Jehoiakim died at Jerusalem, before the conqueror's intention as to him
was carried into effect ([Jer
22:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018.md); [Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030).md), and his dead body, as was
foretold, was dragged out of the gates by the Chaldean besiegers, and
left unburied. The second deportation under Jehoiachin was eight years
later.

[Daniel 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 1:2</span></span>

Shinar--the old name of Babylonia ([Gen
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md); [Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001.md); [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md); [Zac
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#011).md). Nebuchadnezzar took only "part
of the vessels," as he did not intend wholly to overthrow the state, but
to make it tributary, and to leave such vessels as were absolutely
needed for the public worship of Jehovah. Subsequently all were taken
away and were restored under Cyrus ([Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md).

his god--Bel. His temple, as was often the case among the heathen, was
made "treasure house" of the king.

[Daniel 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 1:3</span></span>

master of . . . eunuchs--called in Turkey the kislar aga.

of the king's seed--compare the prophecy, [Kg2
20:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#017.md).

[Daniel 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 1:4</span></span>

no blemish--A handsome form was connected, in Oriental ideas, with
mental power. "Children" means youths of twelve or fourteen years old.

teach . . . tongue of . . . Chaldeans--their language and literature,
the Aramaic-Babylonian. That the heathen lore was not altogether
valueless appears from the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses; the
Eastern Magi who sought Jesus, and who may have drawn the tradition as
to the "King of the Jews" from [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), &c., written in the East. As
Moses was trained in the learning of the Egyptian sages, so Daniel in
that of the Chaldeans, to familiarize his mind with mysterious lore, and
so develop his heaven-bestowed gift of understanding in visions ([Dan
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#004.md), [Dan
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017).md).

[Daniel 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 1:5</span></span>

king's meat--It is usual for an Eastern king to entertain, from the food
of his table, many retainers and royal captives ([Jer
52:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#033).md). The Hebrew for "meat"
implies delicacies.

stand before the king--as attendant courtiers; not as eunuchs.

[Daniel 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 1:6</span></span>

children of Judah--the most noble tribe, being that to which the "king's
seed" belonged (compare [Dan 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003).md).

[Daniel 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 1:7</span></span>

gave names--designed to mark their new relation, that so they might
forget their former religion and country ([Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045).md). But as in Joseph's case (whom
Pharaoh called Zaphnath-paaneah), so in Daniel's, the name indicative of
his relation to a heathen court ("Belteshazzar," that is, "Bel's
prince"), however flattering to him, is not the one retained by
Scripture, but the name marking his relation to God ("Daniel," God my
Judge, the theme of his prophecies being God's judgment on the heathen
world powers).

Hananiah--that is, "whom Jehovah hath favored."

Shadrach--from Rak, in Babylonian, "the King," that is, "the Sun"; the
same root as in Abrech ([Gen 41:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#043.md),
Margin), inspired or illumined by the Sun-god."

Mishael--that is, "who is what God is?" Who is comparable to God?

Meshach--The Babylonians retained the first syllable of Mishael, the
Hebrew name; but for El, that is, GOD, substituted Shak, the Babylonian
goddess, called Sheshach ([Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md);
[Jer 51:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#041).md), answering to the Earth,
or else Venus, the goddess of love and mirth; it was during her feast
that Cyrus took Babylon.

Azariah--that is, "whom Jehovah helps."

Abed-nego--that is, "servant of the shining fire." Thus, instead of to
Jehovah, these His servants were dedicated by the heathen to their four
leading gods \[HERODOTUS, Clio\]; Bel, the Chief-god, the Sun-god,
Earth-god, and Fire-god. To the last the three youths were consigned
when refusing to worship the golden image ([Dan
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012).md). The Chaldee version translates
"Lucifer," in [Isa 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012.md), Nogea, the
same as Nego. The names thus at the outset are significant of the
seeming triumph, but sure downfall, of the heathen powers before Jehovah
and His people.

[Daniel 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 1:8</span></span>

Daniel . . . would not defile himself with . . . king's meat--Daniel is
specified as being the leader in the "purpose" (the word implies a
decided resolution) to abstain from defilement, thus manifesting a
character already formed for prophetical functions. The other three
youths, no doubt, shared in his purpose. It was the custom to throw a
small part of the viands and wine upon the earth, as an initiatory
offering to the gods, so as to consecrate to them the whole
entertainment (compare [Deu 32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038).md). To
have partaken of such a feast would have been to sanction idolatry, and
was forbidden even after the legal distinction of clean and unclean
meats was done away ([Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md), [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md); [Co1
10:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#027).md). Thus the faith of these
youths was made instrumental in overruling the evil foretold against the
Jews ([Eze 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#013.md); [Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003).md), to the glory of God. Daniel and
his three friends, says AUBERLEN, stand out like an oasis in the desert.
Like Moses, Daniel "chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season" ([Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025); see Dan. 9:3-19.md). He who is to
interpret divine revelations must not feed on the dainties, nor drink
from the intoxicating cup, of this world. This made him as dear a name
to his countrymen as Noah and Job, who also stood alone in their piety
among a perverse generation ([Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md); [Eze
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003).md).

requested--While decided in principle, we ought to seek our object by
gentleness, rather than by an ostentatious testimony, which, under the
plea of faithfulness, courts opposition.

[Daniel 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 1:9</span></span>

God . . . brought Daniel into favour--The favor of others towards the
godly is the doing of God. So in Joseph's case ([Gen
39:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#021).md). Especially towards Israel
([Psa 106:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#046.md); compare [Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007).md).

[Daniel 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 1:10</span></span>

worse liking--looking less healthy.

your sort--of your age, or class; literally, "circle."

endanger my head--An arbitrary Oriental despot could, in a fit of wrath
at his orders having been disobeyed, command the offender to be
instantly decapitated.

[Daniel 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 1:11</span></span>

Melzar--rather, the steward, or chief butler, entrusted by Ashpenaz with
furnishing the daily portion to the youths \[GESENIUS\]. The word is
still in use in Persia.

[Daniel 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 1:12</span></span>

pulse--The Hebrew expresses any vegetable grown from seeds, that is,
vegetable food in general \[GESENIUS\].

[Daniel 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 1:13</span></span>

Illustrating [Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md), "Man doth not
live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
of the Lord."

[Daniel 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 1:17</span></span>

God gave them knowledge-- ([Exo
31:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md); [Kg1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#012.md); [Job
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008.md); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md), [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017).md).

Daniel had understanding in . . . dreams--God thus made one of the
despised covenant-people eclipse the Chaldean sages in the very science
on which they most prided themselves. So Joseph in the court of Pharaoh
([Gen 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#005.md); [Gen
41:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001).md). Daniel, in these praises of
his own "understanding," speaks not through vanity, but by the direction
of God, as one transported out of himself. See my Introduction,
"CONTENTS OF THE BOOK."

[Daniel 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 1:18</span></span>

brought them in--that is, not only Daniel and his three friends, but
other youths ([Dan 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#003.md), [Dan
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#019), "among them all".md).

[Daniel 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 1:19</span></span>

stood . . . before the king--that is, were advanced to a position of
favor near the throne.

[Daniel 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 1:20</span></span>

ten times--literally, "ten hands."

magicians--properly, "sacred scribes, skilled in the sacred writings, a
class of Egyptian priests" \[GESENIUS\]; from a Hebrew root, "a pen."
The word in our English Version, "magicians," comes from mag, that is,
"a priest." The Magi formed one of the six divisions of the Medes.

astrologers--Hebrew, "enchanters," from a root, "to conceal," pactisers
of the occult arts.

[Daniel 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 1:21</span></span>

Daniel continued . . . unto . . . first year of Cyrus-- ([Ch2
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md); [Ezr
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001).md). Not that he did not continue
beyond that year, but the expression is designed to mark the fact that
he who was one of the first captives taken to Babylon, lived to see the
end of the captivity. See my Introduction, "SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY." In [Dan 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001.md) he
is mentioned as living "in the third year of Cyrus." See Margin Note, on
the use of "till" ([Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), [Psa
112:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#008).md).
