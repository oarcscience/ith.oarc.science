Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#001.md)

[Luke 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 14:2</span></span>

HEALING OF A DROPSICAL MAN, AND MANIFOLD TEACHINGS AT A SABBATH FEAST.
(Luke 14:1-24)

man before him--not one of the company, since this was apparently before
the guests sat down, and probably the man came in hope of a cure, though
not expressly soliciting it \[DE WETTE\].

[Luke 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 14:3</span></span>

(See on [Mat 12:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#011).md).

[Luke 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 14:7</span></span>

a parable--showing that His design was not so much to inculcate mere
politeness or good manners, as underneath this to teach something deeper
([Luk 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011).md).

chief rooms--principal seats, in the middle part of the couch on which
they reclined at meals, esteemed the most honorable.

[Luke 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 14:8</span></span>

wedding--and seating thyself at the wedding feast. Our Lord avoids the
appearance of personality by this delicate allusion to a different kind
of entertainment than this of his host \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 14:9</span></span>

the lowest--not a lower merely \[BENGEL\].

with shame--"To be lowest is only ignominious to him who affects the
highest" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 14:10</span></span>

Friend--said to the modest guest only, not the proud one ([Luk
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#009).md) \[BENGEL\].

worship--honor. The whole of this is but a reproduction of [Pro
25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#006.md). But it was reserved for the
matchless Teacher to utter articulately, and apply to the regulation of
the minutest features of social life, such great laws of the Kingdom of
God, as that of [Luk 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md).

[Luke 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 14:11</span></span>

whosoever, &c.--couching them in a chaste simplicity and proverbial
terseness of style which makes them "apples of gold in a setting of
silver." (See on [Luk 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014).md).

[Luke 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 14:12</span></span>

call not thy friends--Jesus certainly did not mean us to dispense with
the duties of ordinary fellowship, but, remitting these to their proper
place, inculcates what is better \[BENGEL\].

lest . . . a recompense be given thee--a fear the world is not afflicted
with \[BENGEL\]. The meaning, however, is that no exercise of principle
is involved in it, as selfishness itself will suffice to prompt to it
([Mat 5:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046).md).

[Luke 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 14:13</span></span>

call the poor--"Such God Himself calls" ([Luk
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021).md) \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 14:14</span></span>

blessed--acting from disinterested, god-like compassion for the
wretched.

[Luke 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 14:15</span></span>

when one . . . heard . . . he said, Blessed, &c.--As our Lord's words
seemed to hold forth the future "recompense" under the idea of a great
Feast, the thought passes through this man's mind, how blessed they
would be who should be honored to sit down to it. Our Lord's reply is in
substance this: "The great Feast is prepared already; the invitations
are issued, but declined; the feast, notwithstanding, shall not want
abundance of guests; but not one of its present contemners--who shall
yet come to sue for admission--shall be allowed to taste of it." This
shows what was lacking in the seemingly pious exclamation of this man.
It was Balaam's, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last
end be like his" ([Num 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#010).md), without
any anxiety about living his life; fondly wishing that all were right
with him at last, while all heedless of the precious present.

[Luke 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 14:16</span></span>

a great supper--(Compare [Isa 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md).

bade many--historically, the Jews (see on [Mat
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#003).md); generally, those within the
pale of professed discipleship.

[Luke 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 14:17</span></span>

supper-time . . . all now ready--pointing undoubtedly to the now
ripening preparations for the great Gospel call. (See on [Mat
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#004)..md)

[Luke 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 14:18</span></span>

all began to make excuse--(Compare [Mat
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#005).md). Three excuses, given as
specimens of the rest, answer to "the care of this world" ([Luk
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#018).md), "the deceitfulness of riches"
([Luk 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#019).md), and "the pleasures of
this life" ([Luk 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#020).md), which "choke
the word" ([Mat 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022.md) and [Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014).md). Each differs from the other,
and each has its own plausibility, but all come to the same result: "We
have other things to attend to, more pressing just now." Nobody is
represented as saying, I will not come; nay, all the answers imply that
but for certain things they would come, and when these are out of the
way they will come. So it certainly is in the case intended, for the
last words clearly imply that the refusers will one day become
petitioners.

[Luke 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 14:21</span></span>

came, and showed, &c.--saying as in [Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). "It is the part of ministers to
report to the Lord in their prayers the compliance or refusal of their
hearers" \[BENGEL\].

angry--in one sense a gracious word, showing how sincere he was in
issuing his invitations ([Eze 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011).md).
But it is the slight put upon him, the sense of which is intended to be
marked by this word.

streets and lanes--historically, those within the same pale of "the
city" of God as the former class, but the despised and outcasts of the
nation, the "publicans and sinners" \[TRENCH\]; generally, all similar
classes, usually overlooked in the first provision for supplying the
means of grace to a community, half heathen in the midst of revealed
light, and in every sense miserable.

[Luke 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 14:22</span></span>

yet there is room--implying that these classes had embraced the
invitation ([Mat 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#032.md); [Mar
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#037.md), last clause; [Joh
7:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048).md); and beautifully expressing
the longing that should fill the hearts of ministers to see their
Master's table filled.

[Luke 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 14:23</span></span>

highways and hedges--outside the city altogether; historically, the
heathen, sunk in the lowest depths of spiritual wretchedness, as being
beyond the pale of all that is revealed and saving, "without Christ,
strangers from the covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God
in the world" ([Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md); generally,
all such still. Thus, this parable prophetically contemplates the
extension of the kingdom of God to the whole world; and spiritually,
directs the Gospel invitations to be carried to the lowest strata, and
be brought in contact with the outermost circles, of human society.

compel them to come in--not as if they would make the "excuses" of the
first class, but because it would be hard to get them over two
difficulties: (1) "We are not fit company for such a feast." (2) "We
have no proper dress, and are ill in order for such a presence." How
fitly does this represent the difficulties and fears of the sincere! How
is this met? "Take no excuse--make them come as they are--bring them
along with you." What a directory for ministers of Christ!

that my house may be filled--"Grace no more than nature will endure a
vacuum" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 14:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 14:24</span></span>

I say unto you, That none--Our Lord here appears to throw off the veil
of the parable, and proclaim the Supper His own, intimating that when
transferred and transformed into its final glorious form, and the
refusers themselves would give all for another opportunity, He will not
allow one of them to taste it. (Note. This parable must not be
confounded with that of [Pro 1:24-33](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md);
The Marriage Supper, [Mat 22:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002).md).

[Luke 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 14:25</span></span>

ADDRESS TO GREAT MULTITUDES TRAVELLING WITH HIM. ([Luk
14:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#025).md)

great multitudes with him--on His final journey to Jerusalem. The "great
multitudes" were doubtless people going to the passover, who moved along
in clusters ([Luk 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044).md), and who on
this occasion falling in with our Lord had formed themselves into one
mass about Him.

[Luke 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 14:26</span></span>

If any man, &c.--(See on [Mat
10:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md), and [Mar
8:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#034).md).

[Luke 14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 14:28</span></span>

which of you, &c.--Common sense teaches men not to begin any costly work
without first seeing that they have wherewithal to finish. And he who
does otherwise exposes himself to general ridicule. Nor will any wise
potentate enter on a war with any hostile power without first seeing to
it that, despite formidable odds (two to one), he be able to stand his
ground; and if he has no hope of this, he will feel that nothing remains
for him but to make the best terms he can. Even so, says our Lord, "in
the warfare you will each have to wage as My disciples, despise not your
enemy's strength, for the odds are all against you; and you had better
see to it that, despite every disadvantage, you still have wherewithal
to hold out and win the day, or else not begin at all, and make the best
you can in such awful circumstances." In this simple sense of the
parable (STIER, ALFORD, &c., go wide of the mark here in making the
enemy to be God, because of the "conditions of peace," [Luk
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#032)), two things are taught: (1.md)
Better not begin ([Rev 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#015).md), than
begin and not finish. (2) Though the contest for salvation be on our
part an awfully unequal one, the human will, in the exercise of that
"faith which overcometh the world" ([Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md), and nerved by power from above,
which "out of weakness makes it strong" ([Heb
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md); [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).md), becomes heroical and will come
off "more than conqueror." But without absolute surrender of self the
contest is hopeless ([Luk 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033).md).

[Luke 14:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 14:34</span></span>

Salt, &c.--(See on [Mat 5:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013.md); and
[Mar 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).md).
