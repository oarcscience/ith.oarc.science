<p>
<p>Eliphaz shows that man's goodness does not add to, or man's badness take from, the happiness of God; therefore it cannot be that God sends prosperity to some and calamities on others for His own advantage; the cause of the goods and ills sent must lie in the men themselves (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002">Psa 16:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010">Luk 17:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025">Act 17:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014">Ch1 29:14</A>). So Job's calamities must arise from guilt. Eliphaz, instead of meeting the facts, tries to show that it could not be so.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 22:2</A></FONT></span></p>as he that is wise--rather, yea the pious man profiteth himself. So "understanding" or "wise"--pious (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003">Dan 12:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010">Dan 12:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002">Psa 14:2</A>) [MICHAELIS].

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004">Job 22:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 22:4</A></FONT></span></p>Is the punishment inflicted on thee from fear of thee, in order to disarm thee? as Job had implied (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012">Job 7:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020">Job 7:20</A>; and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017">Job 10:17</A>). 
<p>
<p>will he enter . . . into judgment?-- Job had desired this (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003">Job 13:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</A>). He ought rather to have spoken as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002">Psa 143:2</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005">Job 22:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 22:5</A></FONT></span></p>Heretofore Eliphaz had only insinuated, now he plainly asserts Job's guilt, merely on the ground of his sufferings.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006">Job 22:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 22:6</A></FONT></span></p>The crimes alleged, on a harsh inference, by Eliphaz against Job are such as he would think likely to be committed by a rich man. The Mosaic law (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026">Exo 22:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010">Deu 24:10</A>) subsequently embodied the feeling that existed among the godly in Job's time against oppression of debtors as to their pledges. Here the case is not quite the same; Job is charged with taking a pledge where he had no just claim to it; and in the second clause, that pledge (the outer garment which served the poor as a covering by day and a bed by night) is represented as taken from one who had not "changes of raiment" (a common constituent of wealth in the East), but was poorly clad--"naked" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036">Mat 25:36</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015">Jam 2:15</A>); a sin the more heinous in a rich man like Job.

Eliphaz repeats his charge (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028">Job 15:28</A>; so Zophar, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#019">Job 20:19</A>), that it was by violence Job wrung houses and lands from the poor, to whom now he refused relief (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007">Job 22:7</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009">Job 22:9</A>) [MICHAELIS].

The Mosaic law especially protected the widow and fatherless (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022">Exo 22:22</A>); the violation of it in their case by the great is a complaint of the prophets (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017">Isa 1:17</A>).

<p>
<p>but the counsel . . . is--rather, "may the counsel be," &amp;c. Eliphaz sarcastically quotes in continuation Job's words (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016">Job 21:16</A>). Yet, after uttering this godless sentiment, thou dost hypocritically add, "May the counsel," &amp;c.

If "substance" be retained, translate, rather as the Septuagint, "Has not their substance been taken away, and . . . ?" But the Hebrew is rather, "Truly our adversary is cut down" [GESENIUS]. The same opposition exists between the godly and ungodly seed as between the unfallen and restored Adam and Satan (adversary); this forms the groundwork of the book (Job 1:1-2:13; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</A>). 
<p>
<p>remnant--all that "is left" of the sinner; repeated from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026">Job 20:26</A>, which makes UMBREIT'S rendering "glory" (Margin), "excellency," less probable.

First is mentioned destruction by water (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016">Job 22:16</A>); here, by fire (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005">Pe2 3:5-7</A>).

<p>
<p>gold--rather, "precious" or "glittering metal," parallel to "(gold) of Ophir," in the second clause [UMBREIT and MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>Ophir--derived from a Hebrew word "dust," namely, gold dust. HEEREN thinks it a general name for the rich countries of the South, on the African, Indian, and especially the Arabian coast (where was the port Aphar. El Ophir, too, a city of Oman, was formerly the center of Arabian commerce). It is curious that the natives of Malacca still call their mines Ophirs. 
<p>
<p>stones of the brooks--If thou dost let the gold of Ophir remain in its native valley among the stones of the brooks; that is, regard it as of little worth as the stones, &amp;c. The gold was washed down by mountain torrents and lodged among the stones and sand of the valley.

<p>
<p>plenty of silver--rather, "And shall be to thee in the place of laboriously-obtained treasures of silver" [GESENIUS]. Elegantly implying, it is less labor to find God than the hidden metals; at least to the humble seeker (Job 28:12-28). But [MAURER] "the shining silver."

<p>
<p>he--God. 
<p>
<p>humble--Hebrew, "him that is of low eyes." Eliphaz implies that Job is not so now in his affliction; therefore it continues: with this he contrasts the blessed effect of being humble under it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006">Jam 4:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005">Pe1 5:5</A> probably quote this passage). Therefore it is better, I think, to take the first clause as referred to by "God resisteth the proud." When (men) are cast down, thou shalt say (behold the effects of) pride. Eliphaz hereby justifies himself for attributing Job's calamities to his pride. "Giveth grace to the humble," answers to the second clause.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#030">Job 22:30</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">job 22:30</A></FONT></span></p>island--that is, "dwelling." But the Hebrew expresses the negative (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021">Sa1 4:21</A>); translate "Thus He (God) shall deliver him who was not guiltless," namely, one, who like Job himself on conversion shall be saved, but not because he was, as Job so constantly affirms of himself, guiltless, but because he humbles himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029">Job 22:29</A>); an oblique attack on Job, even to the last.
