### [Luke Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

[Luke 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 6:1</span></span>

PLUCKING CORN-EARS ON THE SABBATH. ([Luk
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001).md)

second sabbath after the first--an obscure expression, occurring here
only, generally understood to mean, the first sabbath after the second
day of unleavened bread. The reasons cannot be stated here, nor is the
opinion itself quite free from difficulty.

[Luke 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 6:5</span></span>

Lord also--rather "even" (as in [Mat
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008).md).

of the sabbath--as naked a claim to all the authority of Him who gave
the law at Mount Sinai as could possibly be made; that is, "I have said
enough to vindicate the men ye carp at on My account: but in this place
is the Lord of the law, and they have His sanction." (See [Mar
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#028)..md)

[Luke 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 6:7</span></span>

WITHERED HAND HEALED. ([Luk 6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#006).md)

watched whether, &c.--In Matthew ([Mat
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#009).md) this is put as an ensnaring
question of theirs to our Lord, who accordingly speaks to the state of
their hearts ([Luk 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009).md), just as if
they had spoken it out.

[Luke 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 6:9</span></span>

good, or . . . evil, save . . . or destroy--By this novel way of putting
His case, our Lord teaches the great ethical principle, that to neglect
any opportunity of doing good is to incur the guilt of doing evil; and
by this law He bound His own spirit. (See [Mar
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004)..md)

[Luke 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 6:11</span></span>

filled with madness--The word denotes senseless rage at the confusion to
which our Lord had put them, both by word and deed.

what . . . do to Jesus--not so much whether to get rid of Him, but how
to compass it. (See on [Mat 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006)..md)

[Luke 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 6:12</span></span>

THE TWELVE APOSTLES CHOSEN--GATHERING MULTITUDES--GLORIOUS HEALING.
(Luke 6:12-49)

went out--probably from Capernaum.

all night in prayer . . . and when . . . day, he called, &c.--The work
with which the next day began shows what had been the burden of this
night's devotions. As He directed His disciples to pray for "laborers"
just before sending themselves forth (see on [Mat
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md); [Mat
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001).md), so here we find the Lord
Himself in prolonged communion with His Father in preparation for the
solemn appointment of those men who were to give birth to His Church,
and from whom the world in all time was to take a new mould. How
instructive is this!

[Luke 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 6:13</span></span>

(See on [Mat 10:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#002)..md)

[Luke 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 6:17</span></span>

in the plain--by some rendered "on a level place," that is, a piece of
high tableland, by which they understand the same thing, as "on the
mountain," where our Lord delivered the sermon recorded by Matthew ([Mat
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001).md), of which they take this
following discourse of Luke to be but an abridged form. But as the sense
given in our version is the more accurate, so there are weighty reasons
for considering the discourses different. This one contains little more
than a fourth of the other; it has woes of its own, as well as the
beatitudes common to both; but above all, that of Matthew was plainly
delivered a good while before, while this was spoken after the choice of
the twelve; and as we know that our Lord delivered some of His
weightiest sayings more than once, there is no difficulty in supposing
this to be one of His more extended repetitions; nor could anything be
more worthy of it.

[Luke 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 6:19</span></span>

healed--kept healing, denoting successive acts of mercy till it went
over "all" that needed. There is something unusually grand and pictorial
in this touch of description.

[Luke 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 6:20</span></span>

In the Sermon on the Mount the benediction is pronounced upon the "poor
in spirit" and those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness" ([Mat
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md), [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006).md). Here it is simply on the "poor"
and the "hungry now." In this form of the discourse, then, our Lord
seems to have had in view "the poor of this world, rich in faith, and
heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him," as
these very beatitudes are paraphrased by James ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md).

[Luke 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 6:21</span></span>

laugh--How charming is the liveliness of this word, to express what in
Matthew is called being "comforted!"

[Luke 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 6:22</span></span>

separate you--whether from their Church, by excommunication, or from
their society; both hard to flesh and blood.

for the Son of man's sake--Compare [Mat
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md), "for MY SAKE"; and immediately
before, "for righteousness' sake" ([Luk
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#010).md). Christ thus binds up the cause
of righteousness in the world with the reception of Himself.

[Luke 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 6:23</span></span>

leap for joy--a livelier word than "be exceeding glad" of "exult" ([Mat
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012).md).

[Luke 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 6:24</span></span>

rich . . . full . . . laugh--who have all their good things and joyous
feelings here and now, in perishable objects.

received your consolation--(see on [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025).md).

shall hunger--their inward craving strong as ever, but the materials of
satisfaction forever gone.

[Luke 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 6:26</span></span>

all . . . speak well of you--alluding to the court paid to the false
prophets of old ([Mic 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011).md). For the
principle of this woe, and its proper limits, see [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md).

[Luke 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 6:27</span></span>

(See on [Mat 5:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md); [Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md); and [Mat
14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#012)..md)

[Luke 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 6:37</span></span>

See on [Mat 7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md); but this is much
fuller and more graphic.

[Luke 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 6:39</span></span>

Can the blind, &c.--not in the Sermon on the Mount, but recorded by
Matthew in another and very striking connection ([Mat
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014).md).

[Luke 6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 6:40</span></span>

The disciple, &c.--that is, "The disciple aims to come up to his master,
and he thinks himself complete when he does so: if you then be blind
leaders of the blind, the perfection of one's training under you will
only land him the more certainly in one common ruin with yourselves."

[Luke 6:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 6:41</span></span>

(See on [Mat 7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#003.md), [Mat
7:16-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016)..md)
