### [Isaiah Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)

[Isaiah 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 58:1</span></span>

REPROOF OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR DEPENDENCE ON MERE OUTWARD FORMS OF
WORSHIP. ([Isa 58:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001))

aloud--Hebrew, "with the throat," that is, with full voice, not merely
from the lips ([Sa1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013)). Speak loud
enough to arrest attention.

my people--the Jews in Isaiah's time, and again in the time of our Lord,
more zealous for externals than for inward holiness. ROSENMULLER thinks
the reference to be to the Jews in the captivity practising their rites
to gain God's favor and a release; and that hence, sacrifices are not
mentioned, but only fasting and Sabbath observance, which they could
keep though far away from the temple in Jerusalem. The same also applies
to their present dispersion, in which they cannot offer sacrifices, but
can only show their zeal in fastings, &c. Compare as to our Lord's time,
[Mat 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016), [Mat
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023); [Luk
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#012).

[Isaiah 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 58:2</span></span>

Put the stop at "ways"; and connect "as a nation that," &c. with what
follows; "As a nation that did righteousness," thus answers to, "they
ask of Me just judgments" (that is, as a matter of justice due to them,
salvation to themselves, and destruction to their enemies); and "forsook
not the ordinance of their God," answers to "they desire the drawing
near of God" (that God would draw near to exercise those "just
judgments" in behalf of them, and against their enemies) \[MAURER\]. So
JEROME, "In the confidence, as it were, of a good conscience, they
demand a just judgment, in the language of the saints: Judge me, O Lord,
for I have walked in mine integrity." So in [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017), they affect to be scandalized at
the impunity of the wicked, and impugn God's justice \[HORSLEY\]. Thus,
"seek Me daily, and desire (English Version not so well, 'delight') to
know My ways," refers to their requiring to know why God delayed so long
in helping them. English Version gives a good, though different sense;
namely, dispelling the delusion that God would be satisfied with outward
observances, while the spirit of the law, was violated and the heart
unchanged ([Isa 58:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003); [Eze
33:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#031); compare [Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028)), scrupulosity side by side with
murder. The prophets were the commentators on the law, as their Magna
Charta, in its inward spirit and not the mere letter.

[Isaiah 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 58:3</span></span>

Wherefore--the words of the Jews: "Why is it that, when we fast, Thou
dost not notice it" (by delivering us)? They think to lay God under
obligation to their fasting ([Psa
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013); [Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014)).

afflicted . . . soul-- ([Lev 16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029)).

Behold--God's reply.

pleasure--in antithesis to their boast of having "afflicted their soul";
it was only in outward show they really enjoyed themselves. GESENIUS not
so well translates, "business."

exact . . . labours--rather, "oppressive labors" \[MAURER\]. HORSLEY,
with Vulgate, translates, "Exact the whole upon your debtors"; those who
owe you labor ([Neh 5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001), [Neh
5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#008), &c.).

[Isaiah 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 58:4</span></span>

ye shall not fast--rather, "ye do not fast at this time, so as to make
your voice to be heard on high," that is, in heaven; your aim in fasting
is strife, not to gain the ear of God \[MAURER\] ([Kg1
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#009), [Kg1
21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#012)). In English Version the
sense is, If you wish acceptance with God, ye must not fast as ye now
do, to make your voice heard high in strife.

[Isaiah 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 58:5</span></span>

for a man to afflict his soul--The pain felt by abstinence is not the
end to be sought, as if it were meritorious; it is of value only in so
far as it leads us to amend our ways ([Isa
58:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006)).

bow . . . head . . . sackcloth--to affect the outward tokens, so as to
"appear to men to fast" ([Mat 6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017);
[Kg1 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027); [Est
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 58:6</span></span>

loose . . . bands of wickedness--that is, to dissolve every tie
wherewith one has unjustly bound his fellow men ([Lev
25:49](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#049), &c.). Servitude, a fraudulent
contract, &c.

undo . . . heavy burdens--Hebrew, "loose the bands of the yoke."

oppressed--literally, "the broken." The expression, "to let go free,"
implies that those "broken" with the yoke of slavery, are meant ([Neh
5:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#010); [Jer
34:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#009), [Jer
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014), [Jer
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#016)). JEROME interprets it, broken
with poverty; bankrupt.

[Isaiah 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 58:7</span></span>

deal--distribute ([Job 31:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#016)).

cast out--rather, reduced \[HORSLEY\].

naked . . . cover him-- ([Mat 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036)).

hide . . . thyself--means to be strange towards them, and not to relieve
them in their poverty ([Mat 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#005)).

flesh--kindred ([Gen 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014)). Also
brethren in common descent from Adam, and brethren in Christ ([Jam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 58:8</span></span>

light--emblem of prosperity ([Isa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010); [Job
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#017)).

health--literally, a long bandage, applied by surgeons to heal a wound
(compare [Isa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006)). Hence restoration
from all past calamities.

go before thee--Thy conformity to the divine covenant acts as a leader,
conducting thee to peace and prosperity.

glory . . . reward--like the pillar of cloud and fire, the symbol of
God's "glory," which went behind Israel, separating them from their
Egyptian pursuers ([Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012); [Exo
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 58:9</span></span>

Then . . . call . . . answer--when sin is renounced ([Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024)). When the Lord's call is not
hearkened to, He will not hear our "call" ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018); [Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024), [Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028); [Pro
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#029); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009)).

putting forth of . . . finger--the finger of scorn pointed at
simple-minded godly men. The middle finger was so used by the Romans.

speaking vanity--every injurious speech \[LOWTH\].

[Isaiah 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 58:10</span></span>

draw out thy soul--"impart of thine own subsistence," or "sustenance"
\[HORSLEY\]. "Soul" is figurative for "that wherewith thou sustainest
thy soul," or "life."

light . . . in obscurity--Calamities shall be suddenly succeeded by
prosperity ([Psa 112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 58:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 58:11</span></span>

satisfy . . . in drought-- ([Isa
41:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017)). Literally, "drought," that
is, parched places \[MAURER\].

make fat--rather, "strengthen" \[NOYES\]. "Give thee the free use of thy
bones" \[JEROME\], or, "of thy strength" \[HORSLEY\].

watered garden--an Oriental picture of happiness.

fail not--Hebrew, "deceive not"; as streams that disappoint the caravan
which had expected to find water, as formerly, but find it dried up
([Job 6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015)).

[Isaiah 58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 58:12</span></span>

they . . . of thee--thy people, the Israelites.

old waste places--the old ruins of Jerusalem ([Isa
61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004); [Eze
36:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#033)).

foundations of many generations--that is, the buildings which had lain
in ruins, even to their foundations, for many ages; called in the
parallel passage ([Isa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004)), "the
former desolations"; and in the preceding clause here, "the old waste
places." The literal and spiritual restoration of Israel is meant, which
shall produce like blessed results on the Gentile world ([Amo
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011); [Act
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016)).

be called--appropriately: the name truly designating what thou shalt do.

breach--the calamity wherewith God visited Israel for their sin ([Isa
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#026); [Ch1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#013)).

paths to dwell in--not that the paths were to be dwelt in, but the paths
leading to their dwellings were to be restored; "paths, so as to dwell
in the land" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 58:13</span></span>

([Isa 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#002); [Neh
13:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015)). The Sabbath, even under the
new dispensation, was to be obligatory ([Isa
66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023)).

foot--the instrument of motion (compare [Pro
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027)); men are not to travel for mere
pleasure on the Sabbath ([Act 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012)).
The Jews were forbidden to travel on it farther than the tabernacle or
temple. If thou keep thy foot from going on thy own ways and "doing thy
pleasure," &c. ([Exo 20:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#010)).

my holy day--God claims it as His day; to take it for our pleasure is to
rob Him of His own. This is the very way in which the Sabbath is mostly
broken; it is made a day of carnal pleasure instead of spiritual
"delight."

holy of the Lord--not the predicate, but the subject; "if thou call the
holy (day) of Jehovah honorable"; if thou treat it as a day to be
honored.

him--or else, it, the Sabbath.

not doing . . . own way--answering to, "turn away thy foot from the
Sabbath."

nor finding . . . pleasure--answering to, "doing thy pleasure." "To keep
the Sabbath in an idle manner is the sabbath of oxen and asses; to pass
it in a jovial manner is the sabbath of the golden calf, when the people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose again to play; to keep it in
surfeiting and wantonness is the sabbath of Satan, the devil's holiday"
\[BISHOP ANDREWES\].

nor speaking . . . words--answering to, "call Sabbath a delight . . .
honorable." Man's "own words" would "call" it a "weariness"; it is the
spiritual nature given from above which "calls it a delight" ([Amo
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005); [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013)).

[Isaiah 58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 58:14</span></span>

delight . . . in . . . Lord--God rewards in kind, as He punishes in
kind. As we "delight" in keeping God's "Sabbath," so God will give us
"delight" in Himself ([Gen 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001); [Job
22:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021); [Psa
37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004)).

ride upon . . . high places--I will make thee supreme lord of the land;
the phrase is taken from a conqueror riding in his chariot, and
occupying the hills and fastnesses of a country \[VITRINGA\], ([Deu
32:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#013); [Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003); [Hab
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019)). Judea was a land of hills; the
idea thus is, "I will restore thee to thine own land" \[CALVIN\]. The
parallel words, "heritage of Jacob," confirm this ([Gen
27:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#028); [Gen
28:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013)).

mouth of . . . Lord . . . spoken it--a formula to assure men of the
fulfilment of any solemn promise which God has made ([Isa
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#005)).

The reason why Jehovah does not deliver His people, notwithstanding
their religious services ([Isa 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003)),
is not want of power on His part, but because of their sins ([Isa
59:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)); [Isa
59:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009) contain their confession; [Isa
59:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016), the consequent promise of
the Messiah.
