[Psalms 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 26:6</span></span>

wash mine hands--expressive symbol of freedom from sinful acts (compare
[Mat 27:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#024)).

[Psalms 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008)

was not yet permanently fixed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 26:11</span></span>

But, &c.--He contrasts his character and destiny with that of the wicked
(compare [Psa 26:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#001)).

[Psalms 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#012)

denoted. Hence he will render to God his praise publicly.
