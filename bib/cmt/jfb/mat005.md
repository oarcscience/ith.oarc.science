### [Matthew Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 5:1</span></span>

THE BEATITUDES, AND THEIR BEARING UPON THE WORLD. (Mat. 5:1-16)

And seeing the multitudes--those mentioned in [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025.md).

he went up into a mountain--one of the dozen mountains which ROBINSON
says there are in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee, any one of them
answering about equally well to the occasion. So charming is the whole
landscape that the descriptions of it, from JOSEPHUS downwards \[Wars of
the Jews, 4.10,8\], are apt to be thought a little colored.

and when he was set--had sat or seated Himself.

his disciples came unto him--already a large circle, more or less
attracted and subdued by His preaching and miracles, in addition to the
smaller band of devoted adherents. Though the latter only answered to
the subjects of His kingdom, described in this discourse, there were
drawn from time to time into this inner circle souls from the outer one,
who, by the power of His matchless word, were constrained to forsake
their all for the Lord Jesus.

[Matthew 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 5:2</span></span>

And he opened his mouth--a solemn way of arousing the reader's
attention, and preparing him for something weighty. ([Job
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#001.md); [Act
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#035.md); [Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034).md).

and taught them, saying--as follows.

[Matthew 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 5:3</span></span>

Blessed--Of the two words which our translators render "blessed," the
one here used points more to what is inward, and so might be rendered
"happy," in a lofty sense; while the other denotes rather what comes to
us from without (as [Mat 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034).md). But
the distinction is not always clearly carried out. One Hebrew word
expresses both. On these precious Beatitudes, observe that though eight
in number, there are here but seven distinct features of character. The
eighth one--the "persecuted for righteousness' sake"--denotes merely the
possessors of the seven preceding features, on account of which it is
that they are persecuted ([Ti2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012).md).
Accordingly, instead of any distinct promise to this class, we have
merely a repetition of the first promise. This has been noticed by
several critics, who by the sevenfold character thus set forth have
rightly observed that a complete character is meant to be depicted, and
by the sevenfold blessedness attached to it, a perfect blessedness is
intended. Observe, again, that the language in which these Beatitudes
are couched is purposely fetched from the Old Testament, to show that
the new kingdom is but the old in a new form; while the characters
described are but the varied forms of that spirituality which was the
essence of real religion all along, but had well-nigh disappeared under
corrupt teaching. Further, the things here promised, far from being mere
arbitrary rewards, will be found in each case to grow out of the
characters to which they are attached, and in their completed form are
but the appropriate coronation of them. Once more, as "the kingdom of
heaven," which is the first and the last thing here promised, has two
stages--a present and a future, an initial and a consummate stage--so
the fulfilment of each of these promises has two stages--a present and a
future, a partial and a perfect stage.

Blessed are the poor in spirit--All familiar with Old Testament
phraseology know how frequently God's true people are styled "the poor"
(the "oppressed," "afflicted," "miserable") or "the needy"--or both
together (as in [Psa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017.md); [Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017).md). The explanation of this lies
in the fact that it is generally "the poor of this world" who are "rich
in faith" ([Jam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md); compare [Co2
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#010.md); [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009).md); while it is often "the ungodly"
who "prosper in the world" ([Psa
73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012).md). Accordingly, in [Luk
6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#020.md), it seems to be this
class--the literally "poor" and "hungry"--that are specially addressed.
But since God's people are in so many places styled "the poor" and "the
needy," with no evident reference to their temporal circumstances (as in
[Psa 68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010.md); [Psa
69:29-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#029.md); [Psa
132:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002).md), it is plainly a frame of mind
which those terms are meant to express. Accordingly, our translators
sometimes render such words "the humble" ([Psa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012.md), [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017).md), "the meek" ([Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026).md), "the lowly" ([Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034).md), as having no reference to
outward circumstances. But here the explanatory words, "in spirit," fix
the sense to "those who in their deepest consciousness realize their
entire need" (compare the Greek of [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md); [Joh
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#033.md); [Joh
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#021.md); [Act
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022.md); [Rom
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#011.md); [Co1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).md). This self-emptying conviction,
that "before God we are void of everything," lies at the foundation of
all spiritual excellence, according to the teaching of Scripture.
Without it we are inaccessible to the riches of Christ; with it we are
in the fitting state for receiving all spiritual supplies ([Rev
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md); [Mat
9:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012).md).

for theirs is the kingdom of heaven--(See on [Mat
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002).md). The poor in spirit not only
shall have--they already have--the kingdom. The very sense of their
poverty is begun riches. While others "walk in a vain show"--"in a
shadow," "an image"--in an unreal world, taking a false view of
themselves and all around them--the poor in spirit are rich in the
knowledge of their real case. Having courage to look this in the face,
and own it guilelessly, they feel strong in the assurance that "unto the
upright there ariseth light in the darkness" ([Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004).md); and soon it breaks forth as
the morning. God wants nothing from us as the price of His saving gifts;
we have but to feel our universal destitution, and cast ourselves upon
His compassion ([Job 33:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027.md); [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009).md). So the poor in spirit are
enriched with the fulness of Christ, which is the kingdom in substance;
and when He shall say to them from His great white throne, "Come, ye
blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you," He will
invite them merely to the full enjoyment of an already possessed
inheritance.

[Matthew 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 5:4</span></span>

Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted--This
"mourning" must not be taken loosely for that feeling which is wrung
from men under pressure of the ills of life, nor yet strictly for sorrow
on account of committed sins. Evidently it is that entire feeling which
the sense of our spiritual poverty begets; and so the second beatitude
is but the complement of the first. The one is the intellectual, the
other the emotional aspect of the same thing. It is poverty of spirit
that says, "I am undone"; and it is the mourning which this causes that
makes it break forth in the form of a lamentation--"Woe is me! for I am
undone." Hence this class are termed "mourners in Zion," or, as we might
express it, religious mourners, in sharp contrast with all other sorts
([Isa 61:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002).md). Religion, according to the
Bible, is neither a set of intellectual convictions nor a bundle of
emotional feelings, but a compound of both, the former giving birth to
the latter. Thus closely do the first two beatitudes cohere. The
mourners shall be "comforted." Even now they get beauty for ashes, the
oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
heaviness. Sowing in tears, they reap even here in joy. Still, all
present comfort, even the best, is partial, interrupted, short-lived.
But the days of our mourning shall soon be ended, and then God shall
wipe away all tears from our eyes. Then, in the fullest sense, shall the
mourners be "comforted."

[Matthew 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 5:5</span></span>

Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth--This promise to
the meek is but a repetition of [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md); only the word which our
Evangelist renders "the meek," after the Septuagint, is the same which
we have found so often translated "the poor," showing how closely allied
these two features of character are. It is impossible, indeed, that "the
poor in spirit" and "the mourners" in Zion should not at the same time
be "meek"; that is to say, persons of a lowly and gentle carriage. How
fitting, at least, it is that they should be so, may be seen by the
following touching appeal: "Put them in mind to be subject to
principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every
good work, to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
showing all meekness unto all men: FOR WE OURSELVES WERE ONCE FOOLISH,
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures . . . But
after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared
. . . : according to His mercy He saved us," &c. ([Tit
3:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001).md). But He who had no such
affecting reasons for manifesting this beautiful carriage, said,
nevertheless, of Himself, "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I
am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls"
([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).md); and the apostle besought
one of the churches by "the meekness and gentleness of Christ" ([Co2
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001).md). In what esteem this is held by
Him who seeth not as man seeth, we may learn from [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004.md), where the true adorning is said
to be that of "a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of
great price." Towards men this disposition is the opposite of
high-mindedness, and a quarrelsome and revengeful spirit; it "rather
takes wrong, and suffers itself to be defrauded" ([Co1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#007).md); it "avenges not itself, but
rather gives place unto wrath" ([Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019).md); like the meek One, "when
reviled, it reviles not again; when it suffers, it threatens not: but
commits itself to Him that judgeth righteously" ([Pe1
2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019).md). "The earth" which the meek
are to inherit might be rendered "the land"--bringing out the more
immediate reference to Canaan as the promised land, the secure
possession of which was to the Old Testament saints the evidence and
manifestation of God's favor resting on them, and the ideal of all true
and abiding blessedness. Even in the Psalm from which these words are
taken the promise to the meek is not held forth as an arbitrary reward,
but as having a kind of natural fulfilment. When they delight themselves
in the Lord, He gives them the desires of their heart: when they commit
their way to Him, He brings it to pass; bringing forth their
righteousness as the light, and their judgment as the noonday: the
little that they have, even when despoiled of their rights, is better
than the riches of many wicked (Psa. 37:1-24). All things, in short, are
theirs--in the possession of that favor which is life, and of those
rights which belong to them as the children of God--whether the world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are theirs
([Co1 3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021).md); and at length,
overcoming, they "inherit all things" ([Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007).md). Thus are the meek the only
rightful occupants of a foot of ground or a crust of bread here, and
heirs of all coming things.

[Matthew 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 5:6</span></span>

Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
they shall be filled--"shall be saturated." "From this verse," says
THOLUCK, "the reference to the Old Testament background ceases."
Surprising! On the contrary, none of these beatitudes is more manifestly
dug out of the rich mine of the Old Testament. Indeed, how could any one
who found in the Old Testament "the poor in spirit," and "the mourners
in Zion," doubt that he would also find those same characters also
craving that righteousness which they feel and mourn their want of? But
what is the precise meaning of "righteousness" here? Lutheran
expositors, and some of our own, seem to have a hankering after that
more restricted sense of the term in which it is used with reference to
the sinner's justification before God. (See [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md); [Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md); [Rom
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md). But, in so comprehensive a
saying as this, it is clearly to be taken--as in [Mat
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md) also--in a much wider sense, as
denoting that spiritual and entire conformity to the law of God, under
the want of which the saints groan, and the possession of which
constitutes the only true saintship. The Old Testament dwells much on
this righteousness, as that which alone God regards with approbation
([Psa 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007.md); [Psa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#003.md); [Psa
106:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#003.md); [Pro
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028.md); [Pro
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#031.md); [Isa
64:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#005), &c..md). As hunger and thirst are
the keenest of our appetites, our Lord, by employing this figure here,
plainly means "those whose deepest cravings are after spiritual
blessings." And in the Old Testament we find this craving variously
expressed: "Hearken unto Me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
seek the Lord" ([Isa 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001).md); "I have
waited for Thy salvation, O Lord," exclaimed dying Jacob ([Gen
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018).md); "My soul," says the sweet
Psalmist, "breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thy judgments at
all times" ([Psa 119:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020).md): and in
similar breathings does he give vent to his deepest longings in that and
other Psalms. Well, our Lord just takes up here--this blessed frame of
mind, representing it as--the surest pledge of the coveted supplies, as
it is the best preparative, and indeed itself the beginning of them.
"They shall be saturated," He says; they shall not only have what they
so highly value and long to possess, but they shall have their fill of
it. Not here, however. Even in the Old Testament this was well
understood. "Deliver me," says the Psalmist, in language which, beyond
all doubt, stretches beyond the present scene, "from men of the world,
which have their portion in this life: as for me, I shall behold Thy
face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy
likeness" ([Psa 17:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013).md). The
foregoing beatitudes--the first four--represent the saints rather as
conscious of their need of salvation, and acting suitably to that
character, than as possessed of it. The next three are of a different
kind--representing the saints as having now found salvation, and
conducting themselves accordingly.

[Matthew 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 5:7</span></span>

Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy--Beautiful is the
connection between this and the preceding beatitude. The one has a
natural tendency to beget the other. As for the words, they seem
directly fetched from [Psa 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md),
"With the merciful Thou wilt show Thyself merciful." Not that our
mercifulness comes absolutely first. On the contrary, our Lord Himself
expressly teaches us that God's method is to awaken in us compassion
towards our fellow men by His own exercise of it, in so stupendous a way
and measure, towards ourselves. In the parable of the unmerciful debtor,
the servant to whom his lord forgave ten thousand talents was naturally
expected to exercise the small measure of the same compassion required
for forgiving his fellow servant's debt of a hundred pence; and it is
only when, instead of this, he relentlessly imprisoned him till he
should pay it up, that his lord's indignation was roused, and he who was
designed for a vessel of mercy is treated as a vessel of wrath ([Mat
18:23-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#023.md); and see [Mat
5:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md); [Mat
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#015.md); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013).md). "According to the view given in
Scripture," says TRENCH most justly, "the Christian stands in a middle
point, between a mercy received and a mercy yet needed." Sometimes the
first is urged upon him as an argument for showing mercy--"forgiving one
another, as Christ forgave you" ([Col
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#032).md): sometimes the last--"Blessed
are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy"; "Forgive, and ye shall
be forgiven" ([Luk 6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037.md); [Jam
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#009).md). And thus, while he is ever to
look back on the mercy received as the source and motive of the mercy
which he shows, he also looks forward to the mercy which he yet needs,
and which he is assured that the merciful--according to what BENGEL
beautifully calls the benigna talio ("the gracious requital") of the
kingdom of God--shall receive, as a new provocation to its abundant
exercise. The foretastes and beginnings of this judicial recompense are
richly experienced here below: its perfection is reserved for that day
when, from His great white throne, the King shall say, "Come, ye blessed
of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world; for I was an hungered, and thirsty, and a stranger, and
naked, and sick, and in prison, and ye ministered unto Me." Yes, thus He
acted towards us while on earth, even laying down His life for us; and
He will not, He cannot disown, in the merciful, the image of Himself.

[Matthew 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 5:8</span></span>

Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God--Here, too, we are
on Old Testament ground. There the difference between outward and inward
purity, and the acceptableness of the latter only in the sight of God,
are everywhere taught. Nor is the "vision of God" strange to the Old
Testament; and though it was an understood thing that this was not
possible in the present life ([Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md); and compare [Job
19:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#026.md); [Isa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md), yet spiritually it was known and
felt to be the privilege of the saints even here ([Gen
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md); [Gen
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009.md); [Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md); [Gen
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md); [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md); [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009.md); [Psa
63:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002.md); [Isa
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003.md), [Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011), &c..md). But oh, with what grand
simplicity, brevity, and power is this great fundamental truth here
expressed! And in what striking contrast would such teaching appear to
that which was then current, in which exclusive attention was paid to
ceremonial purification and external morality! This heart purity begins
in a "heart sprinkled from an evil conscience," or a "conscience purged
from dead works" ([Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); and see [Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009).md); and this also is taught in the
Old Testament ([Psa 32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md); compare
[Rom 4:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md); [Isa
6:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md). The conscience thus
purged--the heart thus sprinkled--there is light within wherewith to see
God. "If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as He is in
the light, we have fellowship one with the other"--He with us and we
with Him--"and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us"--us who
have this fellowship, and who, without such continual cleansing, would
soon lose it again--"from all sin" ([Jo1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).md). "Whosoever sinneth hath not
seen Him, neither known Him" ([Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006).md); "He that doeth evil hath not
seen God" ([Jo3 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#011).md). The inward
vision thus clarified, and the whole inner man in sympathy with God,
each looks upon the other with complacency and joy, and we are "changed
into the same image from glory to glory." But the full and beatific
vision of God is reserved for that time to which the Psalmist stretches
his views--"As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall
be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness" ([Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015).md). Then shall His servants serve
Him: and they shall see His face; and His name shall be in their
foreheads ([Rev 22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003).md). They shall
see Him as He is ([Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). But, says
the apostle, expressing the converse of this beatitude--"Follow
holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord" ([Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014).md).

[Matthew 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 5:9</span></span>

Blessed are the peacemakers--who not only study peace, but diffuse it.

for they shall be called the children of God--shall be called sons of
God. Of all these beatitudes this is the only one which could hardly be
expected to find its definite ground in the Old Testament; for that most
glorious character of God, the likeness of which appears in the
peacemakers, had yet to be revealed. His glorious name, indeed--as "The
Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant
in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
sin"--had been proclaimed in a very imposing manner ([Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006).md), and manifested in action with
affecting frequency and variety in the long course of the ancient
economy. And we have undeniable evidence that the saints of that economy
felt its transforming and ennobling influence on their own character.
But it was not till Christ "made peace by the blood of the cross" that
God could manifest Himself as "the God of peace, that brought again from
the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant" ([Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020).md) --could reveal Himself as "in
Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them," and hold Himself forth in the astonishing attitude of
beseeching men to be "reconciled to Himself" ([Co2
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019).md). When this reconciliation
actually takes place, and one has "peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ"--even "the peace of God which passeth all understanding"--the
peace-receivers become transformed into peace-diffusers. God is thus
seen reflected in them; and by the family likeness these peacemakers are
recognized as the children of God. In now coming to the eighth, or
supplementary beatitude, it will be seen that all that the saints are in
themselves has been already described, in seven features of character;
that number indicating completeness of delineation. The last feature,
accordingly, is a passive one, representing the treatment that the
characters already described may expect from the world. He who shall one
day fix the destiny of all men here pronounces certain characters
"blessed"; but He ends by forewarning them that the world's estimation
and treatment of them will be the reserve of His.

[Matthew 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 5:10</span></span>

Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, &c.--How
entirely this final beatitude has its ground in the Old Testament, is
evident from the concluding words, where the encouragement held out to
endure such persecutions consists in its being but a continuation of
what was experienced by the Old Testament servants of God. But how, it
may be asked, could such beautiful features of character provoke
persecution? To this the following answers should suffice: "Every one
that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his
deeds should be reproved." "The world cannot hate you; but Me it hateth,
because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil." "If ye were
of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of
the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
hateth you." "There is yet one man (said wicked Ahab to good
Jehoshaphat) by whom we may inquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he
never prophesied good unto me, but always evil" ([Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020.md); [Joh
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007.md); [Joh
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md); [Ch2
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#007).md). But more particularly, the
seven characters here described are all in the teeth of the spirit of
the world, insomuch that such hearers of this discourse as breathed that
spirit must have been startled, and had their whole system of thought
and action rudely dashed. Poverty of spirit runs counter to the pride of
men's heart; a pensive disposition, in the view of one's universal
deficiencies before God, is ill relished by the callous, indifferent,
laughing, self-satisfied world; a meek and quiet spirit, taking wrong,
is regarded as pusillanimous, and rasps against the proud, resentful
spirit of the world; that craving after spiritual blessings rebukes but
too unpleasantly the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
pride of life; so does a merciful spirit the hard-heartedness of the
world; purity of heart contrasts painfully with painted hypocrisy; and
the peacemaker cannot easily be endured by the contentious, quarrelsome
world. Thus does "righteousness" come to be "persecuted." But blessed
are they who, in spite of this, dare to be righteous.

for theirs is the kingdom of heaven--As this was the reward promised to
the poor in spirit--the leading one of these seven beatitudes--of course
it is the proper portion of such as are persecuted for exemplifying
them.

[Matthew 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 5:11</span></span>

Blessed are ye when men shall revile you--or abuse you to your face, in
opposition to backbiting. (See [Mar
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#032).md).

and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you,
falsely, for my sake--Observe this. He had before said, "for
righteousness' sake." Here He identifies Himself and His cause with that
of righteousness, binding up the cause of righteousness in the world
with the reception of Himself. Would Moses, or David, or Isaiah, or Paul
have so expressed themselves? Never. Doubtless they suffered for
righteousness' sake. But to have called this "their sake," would, as
every one feels, have been very unbecoming. Whereas He that speaks,
being Righteousness incarnate (see [Mar
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024.md); [Act
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).md), when He so speaks, speaks only
like Himself.

[Matthew 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 5:12</span></span>

Rejoice, and be exceeding glad--"exult." In the corresponding passage of
Luke ([Luk 6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022).md), where every
indignity trying to flesh and blood is held forth as the probable lot of
such as were faithful to Him, the word is even stronger than here:
"leap," as if He would have their inward transport to overpower and
absorb the sense of all these affronts and sufferings; nor will anything
else do it.

for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets
which were before you:--that is, "You do but serve yourselves heirs to
their character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."

[Matthew 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 5:13</span></span>

We have here the practical application of the foregoing principles to
those disciples who sat listening to them, and to their successors in
all time. Our Lord, though He began by pronouncing certain characters to
be blessed--without express reference to any of His hearers--does not
close the beatitudes without intimating that such characters were in
existence, and that already they were before Him. Accordingly, from
characters He comes to persons possessing them, saying, "Blessed are ye
when men shall revile you," &c. ([Mat
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011).md). And now, continuing this mode
of direct personal address, He startles those humble, unknown men by
pronouncing them the exalted benefactors of their whole species.

Ye are the salt of the earth--to preserve it from corruption, to season
its insipidity, to freshen and sweeten it. The value of salt for these
purposes is abundantly referred to by classical writers as well as in
Scripture; and hence its symbolical significance in the religious
offerings as well of those without as of those within the pale of
revealed religion. In Scripture, mankind, under the unrestrained
workings of their own evil nature, are represented as entirely corrupt.
Thus, before the flood ([Gen 6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#011).md);
after the flood ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021).md); in the
days of David ([Psa 14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002).md); in the
days of Isaiah ([Isa 1:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005).md); and in
the days of Paul ([Eph 2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md); see also
[Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md); [Job
15:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015.md); [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md); compared with [Rom
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008.md); [Tit
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002).md). The remedy for this, says our
Lord here, is the active presence of His disciples among their fellows.
The character and principles of Christians, brought into close contact
with it, are designed to arrest the festering corruption of humanity and
season its insipidity. But how, it may be asked, are Christians to do
this office for their fellow men, if their righteousness only exasperate
them, and recoil, in every form of persecution, upon themselves? The
answer is: That is but the first and partial effect of their
Christianity upon the world: though the great proportion would dislike
and reject the truth, a small but noble band would receive and hold it
fast; and in the struggle that would ensue, one and another even of the
opposing party would come over to His ranks, and at length the Gospel
would carry all before it.

but if the salt have lost his savour--"become unsavory" or "insipid";
losing its saline or salting property. The meaning is: If that
Christianity on which the health of the world depends, does in any age,
region, or individual, exist only in name, or if it contain not those
saving elements for want of which the world languishes,

wherewith shall it be salted?--How shall the salting qualities be
restored it? (Compare [Mar 9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050).md).
Whether salt ever does lose its saline property--about which there is a
difference of opinion--is a question of no moment here. The point of the
case lies in the supposition--that if it should lose it, the consequence
would be as here described. So with Christians. The question is not:
Can, or do, the saints ever totally lose that grace which makes them a
blessing to their fellow men? But, What is to be the issue of that
Christianity which is found wanting in those elements which can alone
stay the corruption and season the tastelessness of an all--pervading
carnality? The restoration or non-restoration of grace, or true living
Christianity, to those who have lost it, has, in our judgment, nothing
at all to do here. The question is not, If a man lose his grace, how
shall that grace be restored to him? but, Since living Christianity is
the only "salt of the earth," if men lose that, what else can supply its
place? What follows is the appalling answer to this question.

it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out--a figurative
expression of indignant exclusion from the kingdom of God (compare [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012.md); [Mat
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md); [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md); [Joh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034).md).

and to be trodden under foot of men--expressive of contempt and scorn.
It is not the mere want of a certain character, but the want of it in
those whose profession and appearance were fitted to beget expectation
of finding it.

[Matthew 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 5:14</span></span>

Ye are the light of the world--This being the distinctive title which
our Lord appropriates to Himself ([Joh
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md); [Joh
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005.md); and see [Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md), [Joh
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); [Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019.md); [Joh
12:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035).md) --a title expressly said to
be unsuitable even to the highest of all the prophets ([Joh
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#008).md) --it must be applied here by our
Lord to His disciples only as they shine with His light upon the world,
in virtue of His Spirit dwelling in them, and the same mind being in
them which was also in Christ Jesus. Nor are Christians anywhere else so
called. Nay, as if to avoid the august title which the Master has
appropriated to Himself, Christians are said to "shine"--not as
"lights," as our translators render it, but--"as luminaries in the
world" ([Phi 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md); and the Baptist is
said to have been "the burning and shining"--not "light," as in our
translation, but "lamp" of his day ([Joh
5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035).md). Let it be observed, too, that
while the two figures of salt and sunlight both express the same
function of Christians--their blessed influence on their fellow
men--they each set this forth under a different aspect. Salt operates
internally, in the mass with which it comes in contact; the sunlight
operates externally, irradiating all that it reaches. Hence Christians
are warily styled "the salt of the earth"--with reference to the masses
of mankind with whom they are expected to mix; but "the light of the
world"--with reference to the vast and variegated surface which feels
its fructifying and gladdening radiance. The same distinction is
observable in the second pair of those seven parables which our Lord
spoke from the Galilean Lake--that of the "mustard seed," which grew to
be a great overshadowing tree, answering to the sunlight which invests
the world, and that of the "leaven," which a woman took and, like the
salt, hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened ([Mat
13:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#031).md).

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid--nor can it be supposed to
have been so built except to be seen by many eyes.

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven--As nobody lights a lamp only
to cover it up, but places it so conspicuously as to give light to all
who need light, so Christians, being the light of the world, instead of
hiding their light, are so to hold it forth before men that they may see
what a life the disciples of Christ lead, and seeing this, may glorify
their Father for so redeeming, transforming, and ennobling earth's
sinful children, and opening to themselves the way to like redemption
and transformation.

IDENTITY OF THESE PRINCIPLES WITH THOSE OF THE ANCIENT ECONOMY; IN
CONTRAST WITH THE REIGNING TRADITIONAL TEACHING. (Mat. 5:17-48)

Think not that I am come--that I came.

to destroy the law, or the prophets--that is, "the authority and
principles of the Old Testament." (On the phrase, see [Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md); [Mat
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040.md); [Luk
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md); [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015).md). This general way of taking the
phrase is much better than understanding "the law" and "the prophets"
separately, and inquiring, as many good critics do, in what sense our
Lord could be supposed to meditate the subversion of each. To the
various classes of His hearers, who might view such supposed abrogation
of the law and the prophets with very different feelings, our Lord's
announcement would, in effect, be such as this--"Ye who tremble at the
word of the Lord, fear not that I am going to sweep the foundation from
under your feet: Ye restless and revolutionary spirits, hope not that I
am going to head any revolutionary movement: And ye who hypocritically
affect great reverence for the law and the prophets, pretend not to find
anything in My teaching derogatory to God's living oracles."

I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil--Not to subvert, abrogate, or
annul, but to establish the law and the prophets--to unfold them, to
embody them in living form, and to enshrine them in the reverence,
affection, and character of men, am I come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mat 5:18</span></span>

For verily I say unto you--Here, for the first time, does that august
expression occur in our Lord's recorded teaching, with which we have
grown so familiar as hardly to reflect on its full import. It is the
expression manifestly, of supreme legislative authority; and as the
subject in connection with which it is uttered is the Moral Law, no
higher claim to an authority strictly divine could be advanced. For when
we observe how jealously Jehovah asserts it as His exclusive prerogative
to give law to men ([Lev 18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#001.md); [Lev
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037.md); [Lev
26:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md), [Lev
26:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013), &c..md), such language as this
of our Lord will appear totally unsuitable, and indeed abhorrent, from
any creature lips. When the Baptist's words--"I say unto you" ([Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009).md) --are compared with those of his
Master here, the difference of the two cases will be at once apparent.

Till heaven and earth pass--Though even the Old Testament announces the
ultimate "perdition of the heavens and the earth," in contrast with the
immutability of Jehovah ([Psa
102:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#024).md), the prevalent
representation of the heavens and the earth in Scripture, when employed
as a popular figure, is that of their stability ([Psa
119:89-91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089.md); [Ecc
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#004.md); [Jer
33:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025).md). It is the enduring
stability, then, of the great truths and principles, moral and
spiritual, of the Old Testament revelation which our Lord thus
expresses.

one jot--the smallest of the Hebrew letters.

one tittle--one of those little strokes by which alone some of the
Hebrew letters are distinguished from others like them.

shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled--The meaning
is that "not so much as the smallest loss of authority or vitality shall
ever come over the law." The expression, "till all be fulfilled," is
much the same in meaning as "it shall be had in undiminished and
enduring honor, from its greatest to its least requirements." Again,
this general way of viewing our Lord's words here seems far preferable
to that doctrinal understanding of them which would require us to
determine the different kinds of "fulfilment" which the moral and the
ceremonial parts of it were to have.

Whosoever therefore shall break--rather, "dissolve," "annul," or make
"invalid."

one of these least commandments--an expression equivalent to "one of the
least of these commandments."

and shall teach men so--referring to the Pharisees and their teaching,
as is plain from [Mat 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020.md), but of
course embracing all similar schools and teaching in the Christian
Church.

he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven--As the thing
spoken of is not the practical breaking, or disobeying, of the law, but
annulling or enervating its obligation by a vicious system of
interpretation, and teaching others to do the same; so the thing
threatened is not exclusion from heaven, and still less the lowest place
in it, but a degraded and contemptuous position in the present stage of
the kingdom of God. In other words, they shall be reduced by the
retributive providence that overtakes them, to the same condition of
dishonor to which, by their system and their teaching, they have brought
down those eternal principles of God's law.

but whosoever shall do and teach them--whose principles and teaching go
to exalt the authority and honor of God's law, in its lowest as well as
highest requirements.

the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven--shall, by that
providence which watches over the honor of God's moral administration,
be raised to the same position of authority and honor to which they
exalt the law.

For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees--The superiority to the
Pharisaic righteousness here required is plainly in kind, not degree;
for all Scripture teaches that entrance into God's kingdom, whether in
its present or future stage, depends, not on the degree of our
excellence in anything, but solely on our having the character itself
which God demands. Our righteousness, then--if it is to contrast with
the outward and formal righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees--must
be inward, vital, spiritual. Some, indeed, of the scribes and Pharisees
themselves might have the very righteousness here demanded; but our Lord
is speaking, not of persons, but of the system they represented and
taught.

ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven--If this refer, as
in [Mat 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019.md), rather to the earthly
stage of this kingdom, the meaning is that without a righteousness
exceeding that of the Pharisees, we cannot be members of it at all, save
in name. This was no new doctrine ([Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Rom
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).md). But our Lord's teaching here
stretches beyond the present scene, to that everlasting stage of the
kingdom, where without "purity of heart" none "shall see God."

The Spirituality of the True Righteousness in Contrast with That of the
Scribes and Pharisees, Illustrated from the Sixth Commandment. ([Mat
5:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021).md).

[Matthew 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mat 5:21</span></span>

Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time--or, as in the
Margin, "to them of old time." Which of these translations is the right
one has been much controverted. Either of them is grammatically
defensible, though the latter--"to the ancients"--is more consistent
with New Testament usage (see the Greek of [Rom
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012.md), [Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md); [Rev
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md); [Rev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004).md); and most critics decide in favor
of it. But it is not a question of Greek only. Nearly all who would
translate "to the ancients" take the speaker of the words quoted to be
Moses in the law; "the ancients" to be the people to whom Moses gave the
law; and the intention of our Lord here to be to contrast His own
teaching, more or less, with that of Moses; either as opposed to it--as
some go the length of affirming--or at least as modifying, enlarging,
elevating it. But who can reasonably imagine such a thing, just after
the most solemn and emphatic proclamation of the perpetuity of the law,
and the honor and glory in which it was to be held under the new
economy? To us it seems as plain as possible that our Lord's one object
is to contrast the traditional perversions of the law with the true
sense of it as expounded by Himself. A few of those who assent to this
still think that "to the ancients" is the only legitimate translation of
the words; understanding that our Lord is reporting what had been said
to the ancients, not by Moses, but by the perverters of his law. We do
not object to this; but we incline to think (with BEZA, and after him
with FRITZSCHE, OLSHAUSEN, STIER, and BLOOMFIELD) that "by the ancients"
must have been what our Lord meant here, referring to the corrupt
teachers rather than the perverted people.

Thou shall not kill:--that is, This being all that the law requires,
whosoever has imbrued his hands in his brother's blood, but he only, is
guilty of a breach of this commandment.

and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment--liable to
the judgment; that is, of the sentence of those inferior courts of
judicature which were established in all the principal towns, in
compliance with [Deu 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016.md). Thus was
this commandment reduced, from a holy law of the heart-searching God, to
a mere criminal statute, taking cognizance only of outward actions, such
as that which we read in [Exo 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#012.md);
[Lev 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#017.md).

[Matthew 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 5:22</span></span>

But I say unto you--Mark the authoritative tone in which--as Himself the
Lawgiver and Judge--Christ now gives the true sense, and explains the
deep reach, of the commandment.

That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in
danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca!
shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool!
shall be in danger of hell-fire--It is unreasonable to deny, as
ALEXANDER does, that three degrees of punishment are here meant to be
expressed, and to say that it is but a threefold expression of one and
the same thing. But Romish expositors greatly err in taking the first
two--"the judgment" and "the council"--to refer to degrees of temporal
punishment with which lesser sins were to be visited under the Gospel,
and only the last--"hell-fire"--to refer to the future life. All three
clearly refer to divine retribution, and that alone, for breaches of
this commandment; though this is expressed by an allusion to Jewish
tribunals. The "judgment," as already explained, was the lowest of
these; the "council," or "Sanhedrim,"which sat at Jerusalem--was the
highest; while the word used for "hell-fire" contains an allusion to the
"valley of the son of Hinnom" ([Jos
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#016).md). In this valley the Jews, when
steeped in idolatry, went the length of burning their children to Molech
"on the high places of Tophet"--in consequence of which good Josiah
defiled it, to prevent the repetition of such abominations ([Kg2
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010).md); and from that time forward, if
we may believe the Jewish writers, a fire was kept burning in it to
consume the carrion and all kinds of impurities that collected about the
capital. Certain it is, that while the final punishment of the wicked is
described in the Old Testament by allusions to this valley of Tophet or
Hinnom ([Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md), our Lord Himself describes the
same by merely quoting these terrific descriptions of the evangelical
prophet ([Mar 9:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043).md). What precise
degrees of unholy feeling towards our brothers are indicated by the
words "Raca" and "fool" it would be as useless as it is vain to inquire.
Every age and every country has its modes of expressing such things; and
no doubt our Lord seized on the then current phraseology of unholy
disrespect and contempt, merely to express and condemn the different
degrees of such feeling when brought out in words, as He had immediately
before condemned the feeling itself. In fact, so little are we to make
of mere words, apart from the feeling which they express, that as anger
is expressly said to have been borne by our Lord towards His enemies
though mixed with "grief for the hardness of their hearts" ([Mar
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005).md), and as the apostle teaches us
that there is an anger which is not sinful ([Eph
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026).md); so in the Epistle of James
([Jam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020).md) we find the words, "O vain
(or, empty) man"; and our Lord Himself applies the very word "fools"
twice in one breath to the blind guides of the people ([Mat
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#017.md), [Mat
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#019).md) --although, in both cases, it
is to false reasoners rather than persons that such words are applied.
The spirit, then, of the whole statement may be thus given: "For ages ye
have been taught that the sixth commandment, for example, is broken only
by the murderer, to pass sentence upon whom is the proper business of
the recognized tribunals. But I say unto you that it is broken even by
causeless anger, which is but hatred in the bud, as hatred is incipient
murder ([Jo1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015).md); and if by the
feelings, much more by those words in which all ill feeling, from the
slightest to the most envenomed, are wont to be cast upon a brother: and
just as there are gradations in human courts of judicature, and in the
sentences which they pronounce according to the degrees of criminality,
so will the judicial treatment of all the breakers of this commandment
at the divine tribunal be according to their real criminality before the
heart-searching Judge." Oh, what holy teaching is this!

[Matthew 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mat 5:23</span></span>

Therefore--to apply the foregoing, and show its paramount importance.

if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy
brother hath aught--of just complaint "against thee."

[Matthew 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mat 5:24</span></span>

Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be
reconciled to thy brother--The meaning evidently is--not, "dismiss from
thine own breast all ill feeling, "but" get thy brother to dismiss from
his mind all grudge against thee."

and then come and offer thy gift--"The picture," says THOLUCK," is drawn
from life. It transports us to the moment when the Israelite, having
brought his sacrifice to the court of the Israelites, awaited the
instant when the priest would approach to receive it at his hands. He
waits with his gift at the rails which separate the place where he
stands from the court of the priests, into which his offering will
presently be taken, there to be slain by the priest, and by him
presented upon the altar of sacrifice." It is at this solemn moment,
when about to cast himself upon divine mercy, and seek in his offering a
seal of divine forgiveness, that the offerer is supposed, all at once,
to remember that some brother has a just cause of complaint against him
through breach of this commandment in one or other of the ways just
indicated. What then? Is he to say, As soon as I have offered this gift
I will go straight to my brother, and make it up with him? Nay; but
before another step is taken--even before the offering is
presented--this reconciliation is to be sought, though the gift have to
be left unoffered before the altar. The converse of the truth here
taught is very strikingly expressed in [Mar
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025.md) : "And when ye stand praying
(in the very act), forgive, if ye have aught (of just complaint) against
any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is
in heaven forgive you," &c. Hence the beautiful practice of the early
Church, to see that all differences amongst brethren and sisters in
Christ were made up, in the spirit of love, before going to the Holy
Communion; and the Church of England has a rubrical direction to this
effect in her Communion service. Certainly, if this be the highest act
of worship on earth, such reconciliation though obligatory on all other
occasions of worship--must be peculiarly so then.

[Matthew 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 5:25</span></span>

Agree with thine adversary--thine opponent in a matter cognizable by
law.

quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him--"to the magistrate," as in
[Luk 12:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#058.md).

lest at any time--here, rather, "lest at all," or simply "lest."

the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge--having
pronounced thee in the wrong.

the sentence carried into effect.

[Matthew 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 5:26</span></span>

Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, fill
thou hast paid the uttermost farthing--a fractional Roman coin, to which
our "farthing" answers sufficiently well. That our Lord meant here
merely to give a piece of prudential advice to his hearers, to keep out
of the hands of the law and its officials by settling all disputes with
one another privately, is not for a moment to be supposed, though there
are critics of a school low enough to suggest this. The concluding
words--"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out,"
&c.--manifestly show that though the language is drawn from human
disputes and legal procedure, He is dealing with a higher than any human
quarrel, a higher than any human tribunal, a higher than any human and
temporal sentence. In this view of the words--in which nearly all
critics worthy of the name agree--the spirit of them may be thus
expressed: "In expounding the sixth commandment, I have spoken of
offenses between man and man; reminding you that the offender has
another party to deal with besides him whom he has wronged on earth, and
assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of hearts by one
who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint against him, and
yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain: But I cannot pass from this
subject without reminding you of One whose cause of complaint against
you is far more deadly than any that man can have against man: and since
with that Adversary you are already on the way to judgment, it will be
your wisdom to make up the quarrel without delay, lest sentence of
condemnation be pronounced upon you, and then will execution straightway
follow, from the effects of which you shall never escape as long as any
remnant of the offense remains unexpiated." It will be observed that as
the principle on which we are to "agree" with this "Adversary" is not
here specified, and the precise nature of the retribution that is to
light upon the despisers of this warning is not to be gathered from the
mere use of the word "prison"; so, the remedilessness of the punishment
is not in so many words expressed, and still less is its actual
cessation taught. The language on all these points is designedly
general; but it may safely be said that the unending duration of future
punishment--elsewhere so clearly and awfully expressed by our Lord
Himself, as in [Mat 5:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md), and [Mar
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md), [Mar
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md) --is the only doctrine with which
His language here quite naturally and fully accords. (Compare [Mat
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#030.md), [Mat
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#034).md).

The Same Subject Illustrated from the Seventh Commandment ([Mat
5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027).md).

[Matthew 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 5:27</span></span>

Ye have heard that it was said--The words "by," or "to them of old
time," in this verse are insufficiently supported, and probably were not
in the original text.

Thou shall not commit adultery--Interpreting this seventh, as they did
the sixth commandment, the traditional perverters of the law restricted
the breach of it to acts of criminal intercourse between, or with,
married persons exclusively. Our Lord now dissipates such delusions.

[Matthew 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mat 5:28</span></span>

But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
her--with the intent to do so, as the same expression is used in [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md); or, with the full consent of his
will, to feed thereby his unholy desires.

hath committed adultery with her already in his heart--We are not to
suppose, from the word here used--"adultery"--that our Lord means to
restrict the breach of this commandment to married persons, or to
criminal intercourse with such. The expressions, "whosoever looketh,"
and "looketh upon a woman," seem clearly to extend the range of this
commandment to all forms of impurity, and the counsels which follow--as
they most certainly were intended for all, whether married or
unmarried--seem to confirm this. As in dealing with the sixth
commandment our Lord first expounds it, and then in the four following
verses applies His exposition ([Mat
5:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021).md), so here He first expounds
the seventh commandment, and then in the four following verses applies
His exposition ([Mat 5:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028).md).

[Matthew 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mat 5:29</span></span>

And if thy right eye--the readier and the dearer of the two.

offend thee--be a "trap spring," or as in the New Testament, be "an
occasion of stumbling" to thee.

pluck it out and cast it from thee--implying a certain indignant
promptitude, heedless of whatever cost to feeling the act may involve.
Of course, it is not the eye simply of which our Lord speaks--as if
execution were to be done upon the bodily organ--though there have been
fanatical ascetics who have both advocated and practiced this, showing a
very low apprehension of spiritual things--but the offending eye, or the
eye considered as the occasion of sin; and consequently, only the sinful
exercise of the organ which is meant. For as one might put out his eyes
without in the least quenching the lust to which they ministered, so,
"if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light," and,
when directed by a holy mind, becomes an "instrument of righteousness
unto God." At the same time, just as by cutting off a hand, or plucking
out an eye, the power of acting and of seeing would be destroyed, our
Lord certainly means that we are to strike at the root of such unholy
dispositions, as well as cut off the occasions which tend to stimulate
them.

for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and
not that thy whole body should be cast into hell--He who despises the
warning to cast from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending
member, will find his whole body "cast," with a retributive promptitude
of indignation, "into hell." Sharp language, this, from the lips of Love
incarnate!

[Matthew 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mat 5:30</span></span>

And if thy right hand--the organ of action, to which the eye excites.

offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is profitable,
&c.--See on [Mat 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md). The repetition,
in identical terms, of such stern truths and awful lessons seems
characteristic of our Lord's manner of teaching. Compare [Mar
9:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043.md).

[Matthew 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mat 5:31</span></span>

It hath been said--This shortened form was perhaps intentional, to mark
a transition from the commandments of the Decalogue to a civil enactment
on the subject of divorce, quoted from [Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001.md). The law of divorce--according to
its strictness or laxity--has so intimate a bearing upon purity in the
married life, that nothing could be more natural than to pass from the
seventh commandment to the loose views on that subject then current.

Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of
divorcement--a legal check upon reckless and tyrannical separation. The
one legitimate ground of divorce allowed by the enactment just quoted
was "some uncleanness"--in other words, conjugal infidelity. But while
one school of interpreters (that of Shammai) explained this quite
correctly, as prohibiting divorce in every case save that of adultery,
another school (that of HILLEL) stretched the expression so far as to
include everything in the wife offensive or disagreeable to the
husband--a view of the law too well fitted to minister to caprice and
depraved inclination not to find extensive favor. And, indeed, to this
day the Jews allow divorces on the most frivolous pretexts. It was to
meet this that our Lord uttered what follows:

[Matthew 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mat 5:32</span></span>

But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for
the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery--that is,
drives her into it in case she marries again.

and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced--for anything short of
conjugal infidelity.

committeth adultery--for if the commandment is broken by the one party,
it must be by the other also. But see on [Mat
19:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md). Whether the innocent party,
after a just divorce, may lawfully marry again, is not treated of here.
The Church of Rome says, No; but the Greek and Protestant Churches allow
it.

Same Subject Illustrated from the Third Commandment ([Mat
5:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033).md).

[Matthew 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mat 5:33</span></span>

Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not forswear thyself--These are not the precise words of [Exo
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md); but they express all that it was
currently understood to condemn, namely, false swearing ([Lev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012), &c..md). This is plain from what
follows.

But I say unto you, Swear not at all--That this was meant to condemn
swearing of every kind and on every occasion--as the Society of Friends
and some other ultra-moralists allege--is not for a moment to be
thought. For even Jehovah is said once and again to have sworn by
Himself; and our Lord certainly answered upon oath to a question put to
Him by the high priest; and the apostle several times, and in the most
solemn language, takes God to witness that he spoke and wrote the truth;
and it is inconceivable that our Lord should here have quoted the
precept about not forswearing ourselves, but performing to the Lord our
oaths, only to give a precept of His own directly in the teeth of it.
Evidently, it is swearing in common intercourse and on frivolous
occasions that is here meant. Frivolous oaths were indeed severely
condemned in the teaching of the times. But so narrow was the circle of
them that a man might swear, says LIGHTFOOT, a hundred thousand times
and yet not be guilty of vain swearing. Hardly anything was regarded as
an oath if only the name of God were not in it; just as among ourselves,
as TRENCH well remarks, a certain lingering reverence for the name of
God leads to cutting off portions of His name, or uttering sounds nearly
resembling it, or substituting the name of some heathen deity, in
profane exclamations or asseverations. Against all this our Lord now
speaks decisively; teaching His audience that every oath carries an
appeal to God, whether named or not.

neither by heaven; for it is God's throne--(quoting [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001).md);

[Matthew 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mat 5:35</span></span>

Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool--(quoting [Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001).md);

neither by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King--(quoting [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md).

[Matthew 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mat 5:36</span></span>

Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one
hair white or black--In the other oaths specified, God's name was
profaned quite as really as if His name had been uttered, because it was
instantly suggested by the mention of His "throne," His "footstool," His
"city." But in swearing by our own head and the like, the objection lies
in their being "beyond our control," and therefore profanely assumed to
have a stability which they have not.

[Matthew 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mat 5:37</span></span>

But let your communication--"your word," in ordinary intercourse, be,

Yea, yea; Nay, nay--Let a simple Yes and No suffice in affirming the
truth or the untruth of anything. (See [Jam
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#012.md); [Co2
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017).md).

for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil--not "of the evil one";
though an equally correct rendering of the words, and one which some
expositors prefer. It is true that all evil in our world is originally
of the devil, that it forms a kingdom at the head of which he sits, and
that, in every manifestation of it he has an active part. But any
reference to this here seems unnatural, and the allusion to this passage
in the Epistle of James ([Jam 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#012).md)
seems to show that this is not the sense of it: "Let your yea be yea;
and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation." The untruthfulness
of our corrupt nature shows itself not only in the tendency to deviate
from the strict truth, but in the disposition to suspect others of doing
the same; and as this is not diminished, but rather aggravated, by the
habit of confirming what we say by an oath, we thus run the risk of
having all reverence for God's holy name, and even for strict truth,
destroyed in our hearts, and so "fall into condemnation." The practice
of going beyond Yes and No in affirmations and denials--as if our word
for it were not enough, and we expected others to question it--springs
from that vicious root of untruthfulness which is only aggravated by the
very effort to clear ourselves of the suspicion of it. And just as
swearing to the truth of what we say begets the disposition it is
designed to remove, so the love and reign of truth in the breasts of
Christ's disciples reveals itself so plainly even to those who
themselves cannot be trusted, that their simple Yes and No come soon to
be more relied on than the most solemn asseverations of others. Thus
does the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, like a tree cast into the
bitter waters of human corruption, heal and sweeten them.

Same Subject--Retaliation ([Mat
5:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038).md). We have here the converse of
the preceding lessons. They were negative: these are positive.

[Matthew 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mat 5:38</span></span>

Ye have heard that it hath been said-- ([Exo
21:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#023.md); [Lev
24:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#019.md); [Deu
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021).md).

An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth--that is, whatever penalty
was regarded as a proper equivalent for these. This law of
retribution--designed to take vengeance out of the hands of private
persons, and commit it to the magistrate--was abused in the opposite way
to the commandments of the Decalogue. While they were reduced to the
level of civil enactments, this judicial regulation was held to be a
warrant for taking redress into their own hands, contrary to the
injunctions of the Old Testament itself ([Pro
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#022.md); [Pro
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#029).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mat 5:39</span></span>

But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite
thee on thy right check, turn to him the other also--Our Lord's own
meek, yet dignified bearing, when smitten rudely on the cheek ([Joh
18:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022).md), and not literally
presenting the other, is the best comment on these words. It is the
preparedness, after one indignity, not to invite but to submit meekly to
another, without retaliation, which this strong language is meant to
convey.

[Matthew 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mat 5:40</span></span>

And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take way thy coat--the
inner garment; in pledge for a debt ([Exo
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026).md).

let him have thy cloak also--the outer and more costly garment. This
overcoat was not allowed to be retained over night as a pledge from the
poor because they used it for a bed covering.

[Matthew 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mat 5:41</span></span>

And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain--an
allusion, probably, to the practice of the Romans and some Eastern
nations, who, when government despatches had to be forwarded, obliged
the people not only to furnish horses and carriages, but to give
personal attendance, often at great inconvenience, when required. But
the thing here demanded is a readiness to submit to unreasonable demands
of whatever kind, rather than raise quarrels, with all the evils
resulting from them. What follows is a beautiful extension of this
precept.

[Matthew 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mat 5:42</span></span>

Give to him that asketh thee--The sense of unreasonable asking is here
implied (compare [Luk 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030).md).

and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away--Though the
word signifies classically "to have money lent to one on security," or
"with interest," yet as this was not the original sense of the word, and
as usury was forbidden among the Jews ([Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025), &c..md), it is doubtless simple
borrowing which our Lord here means, as indeed the whole strain of the
exhortation implies. This shows that such counsels as "Owe no man
anything" ([Rom 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008).md), are not to be
taken absolutely; else the Scripture commendations of the righteous for
"lending" to his necessitous brother ([Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036.md); [Psa
112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005.md); [Luk
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#037).md) would have no application.

turn not thou away--a graphic expression of unfeeling refusal to relieve
a brother in extremity.

Same Subject--Love to Enemies ([Mat
5:43-48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043).md).

[Matthew 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mat 5:43</span></span>

Ye have heard that it hath been said-- ([Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).md).

Thou shalt love thy neighbour--To this the corrupt teachers added,

and hate thine enemy--as if the one were a legitimate inference from the
other, instead of being a detestable gloss, as BENGEL indignantly calls
it. LIGHTFOOT quotes some of the cursed maxims inculcated by those
traditionists regarding the proper treatment of all Gentiles. No wonder
that the Romans charged the Jews with hatred of the human race.

[Matthew 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mat 5:44</span></span>

But I say unto you, Love your enemies--The word here used denotes moral
love, as distinguished from the other word, which expresses personal
affection. Usually, the former denotes "complacency in the character" of
the person loved; but here it denotes the benignant, compassionate
outgoings of desire for another's good.

bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you--The best commentary
on these matchless counsels is the bright example of Him who gave them.
(See [Pe1 2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md); and compare [Rom
12:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md); [Co1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012.md); [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009).md). But though such precepts were
never before expressed--perhaps not even conceived--with such breadth,
precision, and sharpness as here, our Lord is here only the incomparable
Interpreter of the law in force from the beginning; and this is the only
satisfactory view of the entire strain of this discourse.

[Matthew 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mat 5:45</span></span>

That ye may be the children--sons.

of your Father which is in heaven--The meaning is, "that ye may show
yourselves to be such by resembling Him" (compare [Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009.md); [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001).md).

for he maketh his sun--"your Father's sun." Well might BENGEL exclaim,
"Magnificent appellation!"

to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
the unjust--rather, (without the article) "on evil and good, and on just
and unjust." When we find God's own procedure held up for imitation in
the law, and much more in the prophets ([Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md); [Lev
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#026.md); and compare [Pe1
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md), we may see that the
principle of this surprising verse was nothing new: but the form of it
certainly is that of One who spake as never man spake.

[Matthew 5:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">mat 5:46</span></span>

For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the
publicans the same?--The publicans, as collectors of taxes due to the
Roman government, were ever on this account obnoxious to the Jews, who
sat uneasy under a foreign yoke, and disliked whatever brought this
unpleasantly before them. But the extortion practiced by this class made
them hateful to the community, who in their current speech ranked them
with "harlots." Nor does our Lord scruple to speak of them as others
did, which we may be sure He never would have done if it had been
calumnious. The meaning, then, is, "In loving those who love you, there
is no evidence of superior principle; the worst of men will do this:
even a publican will go that length."

[Matthew 5:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#047.md)

And if ye salute your brethren only--of the same nation and religion
with yourselves.

what do ye more than others?--what do ye uncommon or extraordinary? that
is, wherein do ye excel?

do not even the publicans so?--The true reading here appears to be, "Do
not even the heathens the same?" Compare [Mat
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017.md), where the excommunicated person
is said to be "as an heathen man and a publican."

[Matthew 5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">mat 5:48</span></span>

Be ye therefore--rather, "Ye shall therefore be," or "Ye are therefore
to be," as My disciples and in My kingdom.

perfect--or complete. Manifestly, our Lord here speaks, not of degrees
of excellence, but of the kind of excellence which was to distinguish
His disciples and characterize His kingdom. When therefore He adds,

even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect--He refers to that
fullorbed glorious completeness which is in the great Divine Model,
"their Father which is in heaven."
