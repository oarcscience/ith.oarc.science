### [Hosea Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 6:1</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES' EXHORTATION TO ONE ANOTHER TO SEEK THE LORD. ([Hos
6:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001).md)

At [Hos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md) a new discourse,
complaining of them, begins; for [Hos
6:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md) evidently belong to [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md), and form the happy termination
of Israel's punishment: primarily, the return from Babylon; ultimately,
the return from their present long dispersion. [Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md) perhaps refers to the murder of
Pekahiah; the discourse cannot be later than Pekah's reign, for it was
under it that Gilead was carried into captivity ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md).

let us return--in order that God who has "returned to His place" may
return to us ([Hos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).md).

torn, and . . . heal-- ([Deu 32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039.md);
[Jer 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017).md). They ascribe their
punishment not to fortune, or man, but to God, and acknowledge that none
(not the Assyrian, as they once vainly thought, [Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md) but God can heal their wound.
They are at the same time persuaded of the mercy of God, which
persuasion is the starting-point of true repentance, and without which
men would not seek, but hate and flee from God. Though our wound be
severe, it is not past hope of recovery; there is room for grace, and a
hope of pardon. He hath smitten us, but not so badly that He cannot heal
us ([Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004).md).

[Hosea 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 6:2</span></span>

Primarily, in type, Israel's national revival, in a short period ("two
or three" being used to denote a few days, [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md); [Luk
13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032).md); antitypically the language
is so framed as to refer in its full accuracy only to Messiah, the ideal
Israel ([Isa 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md); compare [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md), with [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md), raised on the third day ([Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md); [Co1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#004.md); compare [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). "He shall prolong His days."
Compare the similar use of Israel's political resurrection as the type
of the general resurrection of which "Christ is the first-fruits" ([Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); [Eze
37:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md); [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002).md).

live in his sight--enjoy His countenance shining on us, as of old; in
contrast to [Hos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md), [Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md), "Withdrawn Himself from them."

[Hosea 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 6:3</span></span>

know, if we follow on to know the Lord--The result of His recovered
favor ([Hos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002).md) will be onward growth
in saving knowledge of God, as the result of perseverance in following
after Him ([Psa 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#008.md); [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013).md). "Then" implies the consequence
of the revival in [Hos 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md). The "if"
is not so much conditional, as expressive of the means which God's grace
will sanctify to the full enlightenment of Israel in the knowledge of
Him. As want of "knowledge of God" has been the source of all evils
([Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md); [Hos
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#004).md), so the knowledge of Him will
bring with it all blessings; yea, it is "life" ([Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003).md). This knowledge is practice, not
mere theory ([Jer 22:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015).md). Theology
is life, not science; realities, not words. This onward progress is
illustrated by the light of "morning" increasing more and more "unto the
perfect day" ([Pro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018).md).

prepared--"is sure," literally, "fixed," ordered in His everlasting
purposes of love to His covenant-people. Compare "prepared of God" ([Gen
41:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#032.md), Margin; [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md). Jehovah shall surely come to
the relief of His people after their dark night of calamity.

as the morning-- ([Sa2 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004).md).

as the rain . . . latter . . . former-- ([Job
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023.md); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md). First, "the rain" generally is
mentioned; then the two rains ([Deu
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#014).md) which caused the fertility of
Palestine, and the absence of which was accounted the greatest calamity:
"the latter rain" which falls in the latter half of February, and during
March and April, just before the harvest whence it takes its name, from
a root meaning " to gather"; and "the former rain," literally, "the
darting rain," from the middle of October to the middle of December. As
the rain fertilizes the otherwise barren land, so God's favor will
restore Israel long nationally lifeless.

[Hosea 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 6:4</span></span>

what shall I do unto thee--to bring thee back to piety. What more could
be done that I have not done, both in mercies and chastenings ([Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004).md)? At this verse a new discourse
begins, resuming the threats ([Hos
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014).md). See opening remarks on this
chapter.

goodness--godliness.

morning cloud--soon dispersed by the sun ([Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003).md). There is a tacit contrast here
to the promise of God's grace to Israel hereafter, in [Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md). His going forth is "as the
morning," shining more and more unto the perfect day; your goodness is
"as a morning cloud," soon vanishing. His coming to His people is "as
the (fertilizing) latter and former rains"; your coming to Him "as the
early dew goeth away."

[Hosea 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 6:5</span></span>

I hewed them by the prophets--that is, I announced by the prophets that
they should be hewn asunder, like trees of the forest. God identifies
His act with that of His prophets; the word being His instrument for
executing His will ([Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md); [Eze
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003).md).

by . . . words of my mouth-- ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012).md).

thy judgments--the judgments which I will inflict on thee, Ephraim and
Judah ([Hos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004).md). So "thy judgments,"
that is, those inflicted on thee ([Zep
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015).md).

are as the light, &c.--like the light, palpable to the eyes of all, as
coming from God, the punisher of sin. HENDERSON translates, "lightning"
(compare [Job 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#003.md), Margin; [Job
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#015).md).

[Hosea 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 6:6</span></span>

mercy--put for piety in general, of which mercy or charity is a branch.

not sacrifice--that is, "rather than sacrifice." So "not" is merely
comparative ([Exo 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md); [Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md); [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014).md). As God Himself instituted
sacrifices, it cannot mean that He desired them not absolutely, but that
even in the Old Testament, He valued moral obedience as the only end for
which positive ordinances, such as sacrifices, were instituted--as of
more importance than a mere external ritual obedience ([Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md); [Psa
50:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md); [Psa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md); [Isa
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md); [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md); [Mat
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007).md).

knowledge of God--experimental and practical, not merely theoretical
([Hos 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003.md); [Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016.md); [Jo1
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003).md). "Mercy" refers to the second
table of the law, our duty to our fellow man; "the knowledge of God" to
the first table, our duty to God, including inward spiritual worship.
The second table is put first, not as superior in dignity, for it is
secondary, but in the order of our understanding.

[Hosea 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 6:7</span></span>

like men--the common sort of men ([Psa
82:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#007).md). Not as Margin, "like Adam,"
[Job 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033.md). For the expression
"covenant" is not found elsewhere applied to Adam's relation to God;
though the thing seems implied ([Rom
5:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).md). Israel "transgressed the
covenant" of God as lightly as men break everyday compacts with their
fellow men.

there--in the northern kingdom, Israel.

[Hosea 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 6:8</span></span>

Gilead . . . city--probably Ramoth-gilead, metropolis of the hilly
region beyond Jordan, south of the Jabbok, known as "Gilead" ([Kg1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#013.md); compare [Gen
31:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#021).md).

work iniquity-- ([Hos 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011).md).

polluted with blood--"marked with blood-traces" \[MAURER\]. Referring to
Gilead's complicity in the regicidal conspiracy of Pekah against
Pekahiah ([Kg2 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025).md). See on [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001.md). Many homicides were there, for
there were beyond Jordan more cities of refuge, in proportion to the
extent of territory, than on this side of Jordan ([Num
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#014.md); [Deu
4:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041.md); [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008).md). Ramoth-gilead was one.

[Hosea 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 6:9</span></span>

company--"association" or guild of priests.

murder by consent--literally, "with one shoulder" (compare [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009), Margin.md). The image is from oxen
putting their shoulders together to pull the same yoke \[RIVETUS\].
MAURER translates, "in the way towards Shechem." It was a city of refuge
between Ebal and Gerizim; on Mount Ephraim ([Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007.md); [Jos
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021).md), long the civil capital of
Ephraim, as Shiloh was the religious capital; now called Naploos; for a
time the residence of Jeroboam ([Kg1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#025).md). The priests there became so
corrupted that they waylaid and murdered persons fleeing to the asylum
for refuge \[HENDERSON\]; the sanctity of the place enhanced the guilt
of the priests who abused their priestly privileges, and the right of
asylum to perpetrate murders themselves, or to screen those committed by
others \[MAURER\].

commit lewdness--deliberate crime, presumptuous wickedness, from an
Arabic root, "to form a deliberate purpose."

[Hosea 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 6:10</span></span>

horrible thing-- ([Jer 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#030.md); [Jer
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013.md); [Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014).md).

whoredom--idolatry.

[Hosea 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 6:11</span></span>

an harvest--namely, of judgments (as in [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md); [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md); [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015).md). Called a "harvest" because it
is the fruit of the seed which Judah herself had sown ([Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007.md); [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); [Job
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008).md). Judah, under Ahaz, lost a
hundred twenty thousand "slain in one day (by Israel under Pekah),
because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers."

when I returned the captivity of my people--when I, by Oded My prophet,
caused two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, of Judah to be
restored from captivity by Israel ([Ch2
28:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#006).md). This prophecy was delivered
under Pekah \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. MAURER explains, When Israel shall
have been exiled for its sins, and has been subsequently restored by Me,
thou, Judah, also shalt be exiled for thine. But as Judah's punishment
was not at the time when God restored Israel, LUDOVICUS DE DIEU'S'S
explanation must be taken. GROTIUS translates, "When I shall have
returned to make captive (that is, when I shall have again made captive)
My people." The first captivity of Israel under Tiglath-pileser was
followed by a second under Shalmaneser. Then came the siege of
Jerusalem, and the capture of the fenced cities of Judah, by
Sennacherib, the forerunner of other attacks, ending in Judah's
captivity. But the Hebrew is elsewhere used of restoration, not renewed
punishment ([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003.md); [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007).md).
