### [2 Chronicles Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 13:2</span></span>

ABIJAH, SUCCEEDING, MAKES WAR AGAINST JEROBOAM, AND OVERCOMES HIM. (2Ch.
13:1-20)

His mother's name also was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel--the same as
Maachah (see on [Kg1 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002).md). She was
"the daughter," that is, granddaughter of Absalom ([Kg1
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#002); compare 2Sa. 14:1-33.md), mother of
Abijah, "mother," that is, grandmother ([Kg1
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#010), Margin.md) of Asa.

of Gibeah--probably implies that Uriel was connected with the house of
Saul.

there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam--The occasion of this war is
not recorded (see [Kg1 15:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#006).md), but it
may be inferred from the tenor of Abijah's address that it arose from
his youthful ambition to recover the full hereditary dominion of his
ancestors. No prophet now forbade a war with Israel ([Ch2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#023).md) for Jeroboam had forfeited all
claim to protection.

[2 Chronicles 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 13:3</span></span>

Abijah set the battle in array--that is, took the field and opened the
campaign.

with . . . four hundred thousand chosen men . . . Jeroboam with eight
hundred thousand--These are, doubtless, large numbers, considering the
smallness of the two kingdoms. It must be borne in mind, however, that
Oriental armies are mere mobs--vast numbers accompanying the camp in
hope of plunder, so that the gross numbers described as going upon an
Asiatic expedition are often far from denoting the exact number of
fighting men. But in accounting for the large number of soldiers
enlisted in the respective armies of Abijah and Jeroboam, there is no
need of resorting to this mode of explanation; for we know by the census
of David the immense number of the population that was capable of
bearing arms ([Ch1 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#005.md); compare [Ch2
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#008.md); [Ch2
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#014).md).

[2 Chronicles 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 13:4</span></span>

Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim--He had entered the enemy's
territory and was encamped on an eminence near Beth-el ([Jos
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#022).md). Jeroboam's army lay at the
foot of the hill, and as a pitched battle was expected, Abijah,
according to the singular usage of ancient times, harangued the enemy.
The speakers in such circumstances, while always extolling their own
merits, poured out torrents of invective and virulent abuse upon the
adversary. So did Abijah. He dwelt on the divine right of the house of
David to the throne; and sinking all reference to the heaven-condemned
offenses of Solomon and the divine appointment of Jeroboam, as well as
the divine sanction of the separation, he upbraided Jeroboam as a
usurper, and his subjects as rebels, who took advantage of the youth and
inexperience of Rehoboam. Then contrasting the religious state of the
two kingdoms, he drew a black picture of the impious innovations and
gross idolatry introduced by Jeroboam, with his expulsion and
impoverishment ([Ch2 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#014).md) of the
Levites. He dwelt with reasonable pride on the pure and regular
observance of the ancient institutions of Moses in his own dominion
\[[Ch2 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#011.md)\] and concluded with this
emphatic appeal: "O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah,
the God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper."

[2 Chronicles 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 13:13</span></span>

But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them--The oration
of Abijah, however animating an effect it might have produced on his own
troops, was unheeded by the party to whom it was addressed; for while he
was wasting time in useless words, Jeroboam had ordered a detachment of
his men to move quietly round the base of the hill, so that when Abijah
stopped speaking, he and his followers found themselves surprised in the
rear, while the main body of the Israelitish forces remained in front. A
panic might have ensued, had not the leaders "cried unto the Lord," and
the priests "sounded with the trumpets"--the pledge of victory ([Num
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#009.md); [Num
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#006).md). Reassured by the well-known
signal, the men of Judah responded with a war shout, which, echoed by
the whole army, was followed by an impetuous rush against the foe. The
shock was resistless. The ranks of the Israelites were broken, for "God
smote Jeroboam and all Israel." They took to flight, and the merciless
slaughter that ensued can be accounted for only by tracing it to the
rancorous passions enkindled by a civil war.

[2 Chronicles 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 13:19</span></span>

Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him--This sanguinary
action widened the breach between the people of the two kingdoms. Abijah
abandoned his original design of attempting the subjugation of the ten
tribes, contenting himself with the recovery of a few border towns,
which, though lying within Judah or Benjamin, had been alienated to the
new or northern kingdom. Among these was Beth-el, which, with its sacred
associations, he might be strongly desirous to wrest from profanation.

[2 Chronicles 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 13:20</span></span>

Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah--The
disastrous action at Zemaraim, which caused the loss of the flower and
chivalry of his army, broke his spirits and crippled his power.

the Lord struck him, and he died--that is, Jeroboam. He lived, indeed,
two years after the death of Abijah ([Kg1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#020.md); [Kg1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#009).md). But he had been threatened with
great calamities upon himself and his house, and it is apparently to the
execution of these threatenings, which issued in his death, that an
anticipatory reference is here made.
