PROPHECY IN THE REIGN OF JEHOIAKIM, WHEN THE CHALDEANS, IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THE SYRIANS AND MOABITES, INVADED JUDEA. (Jer. 35:1-19)

Rechabites--a nomadic tribe belonging to the Kenites of Hemath ([Ch1
2:55](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#055).md), of the family of Jethro, or
Hobab, Moses' father-in-law ([Exo
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#009.md), &c.; [Num
10:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#029.md); [Jdg
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016).md). They came into Canaan with the
Israelites, but, in order to preserve their independence, chose a life
in tents without a fixed habitation ([Sa1
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#006).md). Besides the branch of them
associated with Judah and extending to Amalek, there was another section
at Kadesh, in Naphtali ([Jdg 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#011.md),
[Jdg 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017).md). They seem to have been
proselytes of the gate, Jonadab, son of Rechab, whose charge not to
drink wine they so strictly obeyed, was zealous for God ([Kg2
10:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md). The Nabatheans of Arabia
observed the same rules \[DIODORUS SICULUS, 19.94\].

bring . . . into . . . house of . . . Lord--because there were suitable
witnesses at hand there from among the priests and chief men, as also
because he had the power immediately to address the people assembled
there ([Jer 35:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#013).md). It may have been
also as a reproof of the priests, who drank wine freely, though
commanded to refrain from it when in the discharge of their duties
\[CALVIN\].

chambers--which were round about the temple, applied to various uses,
for example, to contain the vestments, sacred vessels, &c.

[Jeremiah 35:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 35:3</span></span>

Jaazaniah--the elder and chief of the clan.

[Jeremiah 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 35:4</span></span>

man of God--a prophet ([Deu 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#001.md); [Sa1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md); [Kg1
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#022.md); [Kg2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#007).md), also "a servant of God" in
general ([Ti1 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011).md), one not his own,
but God's; one who has parted with all right in himself to give himself
wholly to God ([Ti2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017).md). He was so
reverenced that none would call in question what was transacted in his
chamber.

keeper of the door--Hebrew, "of the vessel." Probably the office meant
is that of the priest who kept in charge the capitation money paid for
the use of the temple and the votive offerings, such as silver vessels,
&c. There were seven such keepers \[GROTIUS\]. Compare [Kg2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#009.md); [Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md); [Ch1
9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#018.md), which support English
Version.

I said . . . Drink--Jeremiah does not say, The Lord saith, Drink: for
then they would have been bound to obey. Contrast the case in 1Ki.
13:7-26.

[Jeremiah 35:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 35:6</span></span>

Jonadab . . . our father--that is, forefather and director, three
hundred years before ([Kg2 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md).
They were called Rechabites, not Jonadabites, having received their name
from Rechab the father, previously to their adopting the injunctions of
Jonadab his son. This case affords no justification for slavish
deference to the religious opinions of the Christian fathers: for
Jonadab's injunction only affected matters of the present life;
moreover, it was not binding on their consciences, for they deemed it
not unlawful to go to Jerusalem in the invasion ([Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011).md). What is praised here is not
the father's injunction, but the obedience of the sons \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 35:7</span></span>

tents-- ([Jdg 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017).md).

live many days--according to the promise connected with the fifth
commandment ([Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md); [Eph
6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002).md).

strangers--They were not of the stock of Jacob, but sojourners in
Israel. Types of the children of God, pilgrims on earth, looking for
heaven as their home: having little to lose, so that losing times cost
them little alarm; sitting loose to what they have ([Heb
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034.md); [Heb
11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md), [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 35:8</span></span>

all that he . . . charged us . . . all our days, we . . . wives . . .
sons . . . daughters--unreserved obedience in all particulars, at all
times, and on the part of all, without exception: in these respects
Israel's obedience to God was wanting. Contrast [Sa1
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#020.md); [Psa
78:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034.md), [Psa
78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041.md), [Psa
78:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056.md).

[Jeremiah 35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 35:11</span></span>

Chaldeans . . . Syrians--when Jehoiakim revolted from Nebuchadnezzar
([Kg2 24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001).md). Necessity sets aside
all other laws. This is the Rechabites' excuse for their seeming
disobedience to Jonadab in temporarily settling in a city. Herein was
seen the prescient wisdom of Jonadab's commands; they could at a
moment's notice migrate, having no land possessions to tie them.

[Jeremiah 35:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 35:14</span></span>

obey . . . father's commandment: notwithstanding I-- ([Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006).md).

rising early and speaking--God Himself speaking late and early by His
various ways of providence and grace.

[Jeremiah 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 35:15</span></span>

In [Jer 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#015.md) and in [Ch2
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015.md), a distinct mode of address is
alluded to, namely, God sending His servants. ([Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md); [Jer
25:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#005).md). I enjoined nothing
unreasonable, but simply to serve Me, and I attached to the command a
gracious promise, but in vain. If Jonadab's commands, which were
arbitrary and not moral obligations in themselves, were obeyed, much
more ought Mine, which are in themselves right.

[Jeremiah 35:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 35:17</span></span>

because I have spoken . . . not heard . . . I . . . called . . . not
answered-- ([Pro 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024.md); [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 35:19</span></span>

not want a man to stand before me--There shall always be left
representatives of the clan to worship Me ([Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md), [Jer
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019).md); or, "before Me" means simple
existence, for all things in existence are in God's sight ([Psa
89:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#036).md). The Rechabites returned from
the captivity. WOLFF found traces of them in Arabia.
