### [Jeremiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 43:2</span></span>

THE JEWS CARRY JEREMIAH AND BARUCH INTO EGYPT. JEREMIAH FORETELLS BY A
TYPE THE CONQUEST OF EGYPT BY NEBUCHADNEZZAR, AND THE FATE OF THE
FUGITIVES. ([Jer 43:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#001))

Azariah--the author of the project of going into Egypt; a very different
man from the Azariah in Babylon ([Dan
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007); [Dan
3:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012)).

proud--Pride is the parent of disobedience and contempt of God.

[Jeremiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 43:3</span></span>

Baruch--He being the younger spake out the revelations which he received
from Jeremiah more vehemently. From this cause, and from their knowing
that he was in favor with the Chaldeans, arose their suspicion of him.
Their perverse fickleness was astonishing. In the forty-second chapter
they acknowledged the trustworthiness of Jeremiah, of which they had for
so long so many proofs; yet here they accuse him of a lie. The mind of
the unregenerate man is full of deceits.

[Jeremiah 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 43:5</span></span>

remnant . . . returned from all nations-- ([Jer
40:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 43:6</span></span>

the king's daughters--Zedekiah's ([Jer
41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 43:7</span></span>

Tahpanhes--(See on [Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016)); Daphne
on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, near Pelusium. They naturally came to
it first, being on the frontier of Egypt, towards Palestine.

[Jeremiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 43:9</span></span>

stones--to be laid as the foundation beneath Nebuchadnezzar's throne
([Jer 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010)).

clay--mortar.

brick-kiln--Bricks in that hot country are generally dried in the sun,
not burned. The palace of Pharaoh was being built or repaired at this
time; hence arose the mortar and brick-kiln at the entry. Of the same
materials as that of which Pharaoh's house was built, the substructure
of Nebuchadnezzar's throne should be constructed. By a visible symbol
implying that the throne of the latter shall be raised on the downfall
of the former. Egypt at that time contended with Babylon for the empire
of the East.

[Jeremiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 43:10</span></span>

my servant--God often makes one wicked man or nation a scourge to
another ([Eze 29:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#018)).

royal pavilion--the rich tapestry (literally, "ornament") which hung
round the throne from above.

[Jeremiah 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 43:11</span></span>

such as are for death to death--that is, the deadly plague. Some he
shall cause to die by the plague arising from insufficient or bad food;
others, by the sword; others he shall lead captive, according as God
shall order it (see on [Jer 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 43:12</span></span>

houses of . . . gods--He shall not spare even the temple, such will be
His fury. A reproof to the Jews that they betook themselves to Egypt, a
land whose own safety depended on helpless idols.

burn . . . carry . . . captives--burn the Egyptian idols of wood, carry
to Babylon those of gold and other metals.

array himself with the land, &c.-- [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018) has the same metaphor.

as a shepherd, &c.--He shall become master of Egypt as speedily and
easily as a shepherd, about to pass on with his flock to another place,
puts on his garment.

[Jeremiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 43:13</span></span>

images--statues or obelisks.

Beth-shemesh--that is, "the house of the sun," in Hebrew; called by the
Greeks "Heliopolis"; by the Egyptians, "On" ([Gen
41:45](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#045)); east of the Nile, and a few
miles north of Memphis. Ephraim Syrus says, the statue rose to the
height of sixty cubits; the base was ten cubits. Above there was a miter
of a thousand pounds weight. Hieroglyphics are traced around the only
obelisk remaining in the present day, sixty or seventy feet high. On the
fifth year after the overthrow of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar, leaving the
siege of Tyre, undertook his expedition to Egypt \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 10.9,7\]. The Egyptians, according to the Arabs, have a
tradition that their land was devastated by Nebuchadnezzar in
consequence of their king having received the Jews under his protection,
and that it lay desolate forty years. But see on [Eze
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#002); [Eze
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#013).

shall he burn--Here the act is attributed to Nebuchadnezzar, the
instrument, which in [Jer 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012) is
attributed to God. If even the temples be not spared, much less private
houses.
