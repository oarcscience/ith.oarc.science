[1 Chronicles](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#001.md)

THE FIRST AND SECOND BOOKS OF CHRONICLES were also considered as one by
the ancient Jews, who called them "words of days," that is, diaries or
journals, being probably compiled from those registers that were kept by
the king's historiographers of passing occurrences. In the Septuagint
the title given them is Paraleipomenon, "of things omitted," that is,
the books are supplementary because many things unnoticed in the former
books are here recorded; and not only the omissions are supplied, but
some narratives extended while others are added. The authorship is
commonly ascribed to Ezra, whose leading object seems to have been to
show the division of families, possessions, &c., before the captivity,
with a view to the exact restoration of the same order after the return
from Babylon. Although many things are restated and others are exact
repetitions of what is contained in Kings, there is so much new and
important information that, as JEROME has well said, the Chronicles
furnish the means of comprehending parts of the New Testament, which
must have been unintelligible without them. They are frequently referred
to by Christ and the Apostles as forming part of "the Word of God" (see
the genealogies in Mat. 1:1-16; Luk. 3:23-38; compare [Ch2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md) with [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); [Ch2
24:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#019.md) with [Mat
23:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032).md).
