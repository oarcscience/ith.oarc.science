### [Ezekiel Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 41:1</span></span>

THE CHAMBERS AND ORNAMENTS OF THE TEMPLE. (Eze. 41:1-26)

tabernacle--As in the measurement of the outer porch he had pointed to
Solomon's temple, so here in the edifice itself, he points to the old
tabernacle, which being eight boards in breadth (each one and a half
cubits broad) would make in all twelve cubits, as here. On the interior
it was only ten cubits.

[Ezekiel 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 41:2</span></span>

length thereof--namely, of the holy place \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 41:3</span></span>

inward--towards the most holy place.

[Ezekiel 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 41:4</span></span>

thereof--of the holy of holies.

before the temple--that is, before, or in front of the most holy place
(so "temple" is used in [Kg1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003).md). The
angel went in and measured it, while Ezekiel stood in front, in the only
part of the temple accessible to him. The dimensions of the two
apartments are the same as in Solomon's temple, since being fixed
originally by God, they are regarded as finally determined.

[Ezekiel 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 41:5</span></span>

side chamber--the singular used collectively for the plural. These
chambers were appendages attached to the outside of the temple, on the
west, north, and south; for on the east side, the principal entrance,
there were no chambers. The narrowness of the chambers was in order that
the beams could be supported without needing pillars.

[Ezekiel 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 41:6</span></span>

might . . . hold, but . . . not hold in . . . wall of the house-- [Kg1
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#006.md) tells us there were rests made in
the walls of the temple for supports to the side chambers; but the
temple walls did not thereby become part of this side building; they
stood separate from it. "They entered," namely, the beams of the
chambers, which were three-storied and thirty in consecutive order,
entered into the wall, that is, were made to lean on rests projecting
from the wall.

[Ezekiel 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 41:7</span></span>

the breadth . . . so increased from the lowest . . . to the
highest--that is, the breadth of the interior space above was greater
than that below.

[Ezekiel 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 41:8</span></span>

foundations . . . six . . . cubits--the substructure, on which the
foundations rested, was a full reed of six cubits.

great--literally, "to the extremity" or root, namely, of the hand
\[HENDERSON\]. "To the joining," or point, where the foundation of one
chamber ceased and another began \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 41:9</span></span>

that which was left--There was an unoccupied place within chambers that
belonged to the house. The buildings in this unoccupied place, west of
the temple, and so much resembling it in size, imply that no place was
to be left which was to be held, as of old, not sacred. Manasseh ([Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md) had abused these "suburbs of
the temple" to keeping horses sacred to the sun. All excuse for such
abominations was henceforth to be taken away, the Lord claiming every
space, and filling up this also with sacred erections \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 41:10</span></span>

the chambers--that is, of the priests in the court: between these and
the side chambers was the wideness, &c. While long details are given as
to the chambers, &c., no mention is made of the ark of the covenant.
FAIRBAIRN thus interprets this: In future there was to be a perfect
conformity to the divine idea, such as there had not been before. The
dwellings of His people should all become true sanctuaries of piety.
Jehovah Himself, in the full display of the divine Shekinah, shall come
in the room of the ark of the covenant ([Jer
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016).md). The interior of the temple
stands empty, waiting for His entrance to fill it with His glory ([Eze
43:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001).md). It is the same temple, but
the courts of it have become different to accommodate a more numerous
people. The entire compass of the temple mount has become a holy of
holies ([Eze 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 41:12</span></span>

Sum of the measures of the temple, and of the buildings behind and on
the side of it.

[Ezekiel 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 41:15</span></span>

galleries--terrace buildings. On the west or back of the temple, there
was a separate place occupied by buildings of the same external
dimensions as the temple, that is, one hundred cubits square in the
entire compass \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 41:16</span></span>

covered--being the highest windows they were "covered" from the view
below. Or else "covered with lattice-work."

[Ezekiel 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 41:17</span></span>

by measure--Measurements were taken \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 41:21</span></span>

appearance of the one as the appearance of the other--The appearance of
the sanctuary or holy of holies was similar to that of the temple. They
differed only in magnitude.

[Ezekiel 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 41:22</span></span>

table . . . before the Lord--the altar of incense ([Eze
44:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#016).md). At it, not at the table of
showbread, the priests daily ministered. It stood in front of the veil,
and is therefore said to be "before the Lord." It is called a table, as
being that at which the Lord will take delight in His people, as at a
feast. Hence its dimensions are larger than that of old--three cubits
high, two broad, instead of two and one.

[Ezekiel 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 41:25</span></span>

thick planks--a thick-plank work at the threshold.
