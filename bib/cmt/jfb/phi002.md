### [Philippians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 2:1</span></span>

CONTINUED EXHORTATION: TO UNITY: TO HUMILITY AFTER CHRIST'S EXAMPLE,
WHOSE GLORY FOLLOWED HIS HUMILIATION: TO EARNESTNESS IN SEEKING
PERFECTION, THAT THEY MAY BE HIS JOY IN THE DAY OF CHRIST: HIS JOYFUL
READINESS TO BE OFFERED NOW BY DEATH, SO AS TO PROMOTE THEIR FAITH. HIS
INTENTION TO SEND TIMOTHY: HIS SENDING EPAPHRODITUS MEANTIME. (Phi.
2:1-30)

The "therefore" implies that he is here expanding on the exhortation
([Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md), "In one Spirit, with one
mind (soul)." He urges four influencing motives in this verse, to
inculcate the four Christian duties corresponding respectively to them
([Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002).md). "That ye be like-minded,
having the same love, of one accord, of one mind"; (1) "If there be
(with you) any consolation in Christ," that is, any consolation of which
Christ is the source, leading you to wish to console me in my
afflictions borne for Christ's sake, ye owe it to me to grant my request
"that ye be like-minded" \[CHRYSOSTOM and ESTIUS\]: (2) "If there be any
comfort of (that is, flowing from) love," the adjunct of "consolation in
Christ"; (3) "If any fellowship of (communion together as Christians,
flowing from joint participation in) the Spirit" ([Co2
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014).md). As Pagans meant literally
those who were of one village, and drank of one fountain, how much
greater is the union which conjoins those who drink of the same Spirit!
([Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004.md), [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013)) \[GROTIUS\]: (4.md) "If any bowels
(tender emotions) and mercies (compassions)," the adjuncts of
"fellowship of the Spirit." The opposites of the two pairs, into which
the four fall, are reprobated, [Phi
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md).

[Philippians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 2:2</span></span>

Fulfil--that is, Make full. I have joy in you, complete it by that which
is still wanting, namely, unity ([Phi
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009).md).

likeminded--literally, "that ye be of the same mind"; more general than
the following "of one mind."

having the same love--equally disposed to love and be loved.

being of one accord--literally, "with united souls." This pairs with the
following clause, thus, "With united souls, being of one mind"; as the
former two also pair together, "That ye be likeminded, having the same
love."

[Philippians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 2:3</span></span>

Let nothing be done--The italicized words are not in the Greek. Perhaps
the ellipsis had better be supplied from the Greek ([Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002).md), "Thinking nothing in the way of
strife" (or rather, "factious intrigue," "self-seeking," see on [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016).md). It is the thought which
characterizes the action as good or bad before God.

lowliness of mind--The direct relation of this grace is to God alone; it
is the sense of dependence of the creature on the Creator as such, and
it places all created beings in this respect on a level. The man "lowly
of mind" as to his spiritual life is independent of men, and free from
all slavish feeling, while sensible of his continual dependence on God.
Still it INDIRECTLY affects his behavior toward his fellow men; for,
conscious of his entire dependence on God for all his abilities, even as
they are dependent on God for theirs, he will not pride himself on his
abilities, or exalt self in his conduct toward others ([Eph
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012).md) \[NEANDER\].

let each esteem--Translate as Greek, "esteeming each other superior to
yourselves." Instead of fixing your eyes on those points in which you
excel, fix them on those in which your neighbor excels you: this is true
"humility."

[Philippians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 2:4</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read, "Not looking each of you (plural, Greek) on
his own things (that is, not having regard solely to them), but each of
you on the things of others" also. Compare [Phi
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021.md); also Paul's own example ([Phi
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024).md).

[Philippians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 2:5</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read, "Have this mind in you," &c. He does not
put forward himself (see on [Phi 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md),
and [Phi 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024).md) as an example, but
Christ, THE ONE pre-eminently who sought not His own, but "humbled
Himself" ([Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008).md), first in taking
on Him our nature, secondly, in humbling Himself further in that nature
([Rom 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003).md).

[Philippians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 2:6</span></span>

Translate, "Who subsisting (or existing, namely, originally: the Greek
is not the simple substantive verb, 'to be') in the form of God (the
divine essence is not meant: but the external self-manifesting
characteristics of God, the form shining forth from His glorious
essence). The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without
any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of
God'; as 'the form of a servant' ([Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md), which is in contrasted
opposition to it, takes for granted the existence of His human nature,
so 'the form of God' takes for granted His divine nature \[BENGEL\],
Compare [Joh 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), 'Who is the IMAGE of the
invisible God' at a time before 'every creature,' [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md), esteemed (the same Greek verb as
in [Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003).md) His being on an equality
with God no (act of) robbery" or self-arrogation; claiming to one's self
what does not belong to him. ELLICOTT, WAHL, and others have translated,
"A thing to be grasped at," which would require the Greek to be
harpagma, whereas harpagmos means the act of seizing. So harpagmos means
in the only other passage where it occurs, PLUTARCH \[On the Education
of Children, 120\]. The same insuperable objection lies against ALFORD'S
translation, "He regarded not as self-enrichment (that is, an
opportunity for self-exaltation) His equality with God." His argument is
that the antithesis ([Phi 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md)
requires it, "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for
self-exaltation, but for self-abasement, or emptying Himself." But the
antithesis is not between His being on an equality with God, and His
emptying Himself; for He never emptied Himself of the fulness of His
Godhead, or His "BEING on an equality with God"; but between His being
"in the FORM (that is, the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God,"
and His "taking on Him the form of a servant," whereby He in a great
measure emptied Himself of His precedent "form," or outward
self-manifesting glory as God. Not "looking on His own things" ([Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004).md), He, though existing in the form
of God, He esteemed it no robbery to be on an equality with God, yet
made Himself of no reputation. "Being on an equality with God, is not
identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the
external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He
emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant"; the former, "HIS
BEING," or NATURE, His already existing STATE OF EQUALITY with God, both
the Father and the Son having the same ESSENCE. A glimpse of Him "in the
form of God," previous to His incarnation, was given to Moses ([Exo
24:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010).md), Aaron, &c.

[Philippians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 2:7</span></span>

made himself of no reputation, and . . . and--rather as the Greek,
"emptied Himself, taking upon him the form of a servant, being made in
the likeness of men." The two latter clauses (there being no
conjunctions, "and . . . and," in the Greek) expresses in what Christ's
"emptying of Himself" consists, namely, in "taking the form of a
servant" (see on [Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md); compare
[Exo 21:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#005.md), and [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), proving that it was at the time
when He assumed a body, He took "the form of a servant"), and in order
to explain how He took "the form of a servant," there is added, by
"being made in the likeness of men." His subjection to the law ([Luk
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021.md); [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md) and to His parents ([Luk
2:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051).md), His low state as a carpenter,
and carpenter's reputed son ([Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055.md); [Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003).md), His betrayal for the price of a
bond-servant ([Exo 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032).md), and
slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death,
finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while
His divinity was not outwardly manifested ([Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md), [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007).md), are all marks of His "form as a
servant." This proves: (1) He was in the form of a servant as soon as He
was made man. (2) He was "in the form of God" before He was "in the form
of a servant." (3) He did as really subsist in the divine nature, as in
the form of a servant, or in the nature of man. For He was as much "in
the form of God" as "in the form of a servant"; and was so in the form
of God as "to be on an equality with God"; He therefore could have been
none other than God; for God saith, "To whom will ye liken Me and make
Me equal?" ([Isa 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005).md), \[BISHOP
PEARSON\]. His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of
Godhead ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md). He remained full of this; yet He
bore Himself as if He were empty.

[Philippians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 2:8</span></span>

being found in fashion as a man--being already, by His "emptying
Himself," in the form of a servant, or likeness of man ([Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md), "He humbled Himself (still
further by) becoming obedient even unto death (not as English Version,
'He humbled Himself and became,'&c.; the Greek has no 'and,' and has the
participle, not the verb), and that the death of the cross." "Fashion"
expresses that He had the outward guise, speech, and look. In [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md), in the Greek, the emphasis is on
Himself (which stands before the Greek verb), "He emptied Himself," His
divine self, viewed in respect to what He had heretofore been; in [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008.md) the emphasis is on "humbled"
(which stands before the Greek "Himself"); He not only "emptied Himself"
of His previous "form of God," but submitted to positive HUMILIATION. He
"became obedient," namely, to God, as His "servant" ([Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019.md); [Heb
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008).md). Therefore "God" is said to
"exalt" Him ([Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009).md), even as it was
God to whom He became voluntarily "obedient." "Even unto death"
expresses the climax of His obedience ([Joh
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018).md).

[Philippians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 2:9</span></span>

Wherefore--as the just consequence of His self-humiliation and obedience
([Psa 8:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md); [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), [Psa
110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md); [Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md); [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md); [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md); [Joh
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017.md); [Rom
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md); [Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009).md). An intimation, that if we would
hereafter be exalted, we too must, after His example, now humble
ourselves ([Phi 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003.md), [Phi
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md); [Phi
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md); [Pe1
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005).md). Christ emptied Christ; God
exalted Christ as man to equality with God \[BENGEL\].

highly exalted--Greek, "super-eminently exalted" ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010).md).

given him--Greek, "bestowed on Him."

a name--along with the corresponding reality, glory and majesty.

which--Translate, namely, "that which is above every name." The name
"JESUS" ([Phi 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md), which is even now
in glory His name of honor ([Act 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005).md).
"Above" not only men, but angels ([Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021).md).

[Philippians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 2:10</span></span>

at the name--rather as Greek, "in the name."

bow--rather, "bend," in token of worship. Referring to [Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); quoted also in [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md). To worship "in the name of
Jesus," is to worship Jesus Himself (compare [Phi
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011.md); [Pro
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010).md), or God in Christ ([Joh
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#023.md); [Eph
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014).md). Compare "Whosoever shall call
upon the name of the Lord (that is, whosoever shall call on the Lord in
His revealed character) shall be saved" ([Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002).md); "all that call upon the name of
Jesus Christ our Lord" (compare [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022).md); "call on the Lord"; [Act
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md), "calling upon . . . and saying,
Lord Jesus" ([Act 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md), [Act
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021.md); [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016).md).

of things in heaven--angels. They worship Him not only as God, but as
the ascended God-man, "Jesus" ([Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022).md).

in earth--men; among whom He tabernacled for a time.

under the earth--the dead; among whom He was numbered once ([Rom
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009.md), [Rom
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011.md); [Eph
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009.md); [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013).md). The demons and the lost may be
included indirectly, as even they give homage, though one of fear, not
love, to Jesus ([Mar 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011.md); [Luk
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#031.md); [Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019.md), see on [Phi
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011).md).

[Philippians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 2:11</span></span>

every tongue--Compare "every knee" ([Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md). In every way He shall be
acknowledged as Lord (no longer as "servant," [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007).md). As none can fully do so "but by
the Holy Ghost" ([Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003).md), the
spirits of good men who are dead, must be the class directly meant, [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md), "under the earth."

to the glory of God the Father--the grand end of Christ's mediatorial
office and kingdom, which shall cease when this end shall have been
fully realized ([Joh 5:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md), [Joh
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md); [Joh
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001.md), [Joh
17:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md); [Co1
15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md).

[Philippians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 2:12</span></span>

Wherefore--Seeing that we have in Christ such a specimen of glory
resulting from "obedience" ([Phi 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008).md)
and humiliation, see that ye also be "obedient," and so "your salvation"
shall follow your obedience.

as ye have . . . obeyed--"even as ye have been obedient," namely, to
God, as Jesus was "obedient" unto God (see on [Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008).md).

not as, &c.--"not as if" it were a matter to be done "in my presence
only, but now (as things are) much more (with more earnestness) in my
absence (because my help is withdrawn from you)" \[ALFORD\].

work out--carry out to its full perfection. "Salvation" is "worked in"
([Phi 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md); [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md) believers by the Spirit, who
enables them through faith to be justified once for all; but it needs,
as a progressive work, to be "worked out" by obedience, through the help
of the same Spirit, unto perfection ([Pe2
1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005).md). The sound Christian neither,
like the formalist, rests in the means, without looking to the end, and
to the Holy Spirit who alone can make the means effectual; nor, like the
fanatic, hopes to attain the end without the means.

your own--The emphasis is on this. Now that I am not present to further
the work of your salvation, "work out your own salvation" yourselves the
more carefully. Do not think this work cannot go on because I am absent;
"for ([Phi 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013).md) it is God that
worketh in you," &c. In this case adopt a rule different from the former
([Phi 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004).md), but resting on the same
principle of "lowliness of mind" ([Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003).md), namely, "look each on his own
things," instead of "disputings" with others ([Phi
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014).md).

salvation--which is in "Jesus" ([Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md), as His name (meaning
God-Saviour) implies.

with fear and trembling--the very feeling enjoined on "servants," as to
what ought to accompany their "obedience" ([Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005).md). So here: See that, as "servants"
to God, after the example of Christ, ye be so "with the fear and
trembling" which becomes servants; not slavish fear, but trembling
anxiety not to fall short of the goal ([Co1
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026.md); [Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001.md), "Let us fear, lest a promise
being left us of entering into His rest, any should come short of it"),
resulting from a sense of our human insufficiency, and from the
consciousness that all depends on the power of God, "who worketh both to
will and to do" ([Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020).md). "Paul,
though joyous, writes seriously" \[J. J. WOLF\].

[Philippians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 2:13</span></span>

For--encouragement to work: "For it is God who worketh in you," always
present with you, though I be absent. It is not said, "Work out your own
salvation, though it is God," &c., but, "because it is God who," &c. The
will, and the power to work, being first instalments of His grace,
encourage us to make full proof of, and carry out to the end, the
"salvation" which He has first "worked," and is still "working in" us,
enabling us to "work it out." "Our will does nothing thereunto without
grace; but grace is inactive without our will" \[ST. BERNARD\]. Man is,
in different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God
producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own acts. It
is not that God does some, and we the rest. God does all, and we do all.
God is the only proper author, we the only proper actors. Thus the same
things in Scripture are represented as from God, and from us. God makes
a new heart, and we are commanded to make us a new heart; not merely
because we must use the means in order to the effect, but the effect
itself is our act and our duty ([Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026).md) \[EDWARDS\].

worketh--rather as Greek, "worketh effectually." We cannot of ourselves
embrace the Gospel of grace: "the will" ([Psa
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md); [Co2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005).md) comes solely of God's gift to
whom He will ([Joh 6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044.md), [Joh
6:65](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#065).md); so also the power "to do"
(rather, "to work effectually," as the Greek is the same as that for
"worketh in"), that is, effectual perseverance to the end, is wholly of
God's gift ([Phi 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md); [Heb
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021).md).

of his good pleasure--rather as Greek, "FOR His good pleasure"; in order
to carry out His sovereign gracious purpose towards you ([Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009).md).

[Philippians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 2:14</span></span>

murmurings--secret murmurings and complaints against your fellow men
arising from selfishness: opposed to the example of Jesus just mentioned
(compare the use of the word, [Joh
7:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#012.md); [Act
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md); [Pe1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md); [Jde
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#016).md).

disputings--The Greek is translated "doubting" in [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md). But here referring to profitless
"disputings" with our fellow men, in relation to whom we are called on
to be "blameless and harmless" ([Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015).md): so the Greek is translated,
[Mar 9:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033.md). These disputings flow
from "vain glory" reprobated ([Phi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003).md); and abounded among the
Aristotelian philosophers in Macedon, where Philippi was.

[Philippians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 2:15</span></span>

blameless and harmless--without either the repute of mischief, or the
inclination to do it \[ALFORD\].

sons--rather as Greek, "the children of God" ([Rom
8:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014).md). Imitation of our heavenly
Father is the instinctive guide to our duty as His children, more than
any external law ([Mat 5:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md), [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048).md).

without rebuke--"without (giving handle for) reproach." The whole verse
tacitly refers by contrast to [Deu
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#005.md), "Their spot . . . not . . . of
His children . . . a perverse and crooked generation" (compare [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).md).

ye shine--literally, "appear" \[TRENCH\]. "Show yourselves" (compare
[Mat 5:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014.md); [Eph
5:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008).md).

as lights in the world--The Greek expresses "as luminaries in the
world," as the sun and moon, "the lights," or "great lights," in the
material world or in the firmament. The Septuagint uses the very same
Greek word in the passage, [Gen 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014.md),
[Gen 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#016.md); compare Note,, see on [Rev
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011.md).

[Philippians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 2:16</span></span>

Holding forth--to them, and so applying it (the common meaning of the
Greek; perhaps here including also the other meaning, "holding fast").
The image of light-bearers or luminaries is carried on from [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md). As the heavenly luminaries'
light is closely connected with the life of animals, so ye hold forth
the light of Christ's "word" (received from me) which is the "life" of
the Gentiles ([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md), [Jo1
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).md). Christ is "the Light of the
world" ([Joh 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012).md); believers are only
"light-bearers" reflecting His light.

that I may rejoice in--literally, "with a view to (your being) a subject
of rejoicing to me against the day of Christ" ([Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md); [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Th1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019).md).

that I have not run in vain--that it was not in vain that I labored for
your spiritual good.

[Philippians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 2:17</span></span>

Yea, and if--rather as Greek, "Yea, if even"; implying that he regarded
the contingency as not unlikely: He had assumed the possibility of his
being found alive at Christ's coming (for in every age Christ designed
Christians to stand in preparedness for His coming as at hand): he here
puts a supposition which he regards as more likely, namely, his own
death before Christ's coming.

I be offered--rather as Greek, "I am poured out." "I am made a
libation." Present, not future, as the danger is threatening him now. As
in sacrifices libations of wine were "poured upon" the offerings, so he
represents his Philippian converts, offered through faith (or else their
faith itself), as the sacrifice, and his blood as the libation "poured
upon" it (compare [Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md); [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006).md).

service--Greek, "priest's ministration"; carrying out the image of a
sacrifice.

I joy--for myself ([Phi 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md), [Phi
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023).md). His expectation of release from
prison is much fainter, than in the Epistles to Ephesians, Colossians,
and Philemon, written somewhat earlier from Rome. The appointment of
Tigellinus to be PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect was probably the cause of this
change. See Introduction.

rejoice with you all--ALFORD translates, "I congratulate you all,"
namely on the honor occurring to you by my blood being poured out on the
sacrifice of your faith. If they rejoiced already (as English Version
represents), what need of his urging them, "Do ye also joy."

[Philippians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 2:18</span></span>

"Do ye also rejoice" at this honor to you, "and congratulate me" on my
blessed "gain" ([Phi 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021).md).

[Philippians 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 2:19</span></span>

[Phi 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md), "ye know the proof of him .
. . that . . . he hath served with me," implies that Timothy had been
long with Paul at Philippi; Accordingly, in the history ([Act
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Act
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010.md), [Act
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014).md), we find them setting out
together from Derbe in Lycaonia, and together again at Berea in
Macedonia, near the conclusion of Paul's missionary journey: an
undesigned coincidence between the Epistle and history, a mark of
genuineness \[PALEY\]. From [Phi
2:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019.md), it appears Epaphroditus was
to set out at once to allay the anxiety of the Philippians on his
account, and at the same time bearing the Epistle; Timothy was to follow
after the apostle's liberation was decided, when they could arrange
their plans more definitely as to where Timothy should, on his return
with tidings from Philippi, meet Paul, who was designing by a wider
circuit, and slower progress, to reach that city. Paul's reason for
sending Timothy so soon after having heard of the Philippians from
Epaphroditus was that they were now suffering persecutions ([Phi
1:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028).md); and besides, Epaphroditus'
delay through sickness on his journey to Rome from Philippi, made the
tidings he brought to be of less recent date than Paul desired. Paul
himself also hoped to visit them shortly.

But I trust--Yet my death is by no means certain; yea, "I hope (Greek)
in the Lord (that is, by the Lord's help)"

unto you--literally, "for you," that is, to your satisfaction, not
merely motion, to you.

I also--that not only you "may be of good courage" (so Greek) on hearing
of me ([Phi 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023).md), but "I also, when I
know your state."

[Philippians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 2:20</span></span>

His reason for sending Timothy above all others: I have none so
"like-minded," literally, "like-souled," with myself as is Timothy.
Compare [Deu 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md), "Thy friend which
is as thine own soul" ([Psa 55:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014).md).
Paul's second self.

naturally--Greek, "genuinely"; "with sincere solicitude." A case wherein
the Spirit of God so changed man's nature, that to be natural was with
him to be spiritual: the great point to be aimed at.

[Philippians 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 2:21</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "They all" (namely, who are now with me, [Phi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md), [Phi
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017.md); [Phi
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#021.md) : such Demas, then with him,
proved to be, [Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md); compare [Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md); [Plm
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024).md).

seek their own--opposed to Paul's precept ([Phi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004.md); [Co1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#024.md), [Co1
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#033.md); [Co1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005).md). This is spoken, by comparison
with Timothy; for [Phi 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md) implies
that some of those with Paul at Rome were genuine Christians, though not
so self-sacrificing as Timothy. Few come to the help of the Lord's
cause, where ease, fame, and gain have to be sacrificed. Most help only
when Christ's gain is compatible with their own ([Jdg
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#017.md), [Jdg
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023).md).

[Philippians 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">phi 2:22</span></span>

Rare praise ([Neh 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#002).md).

as a son with the father--Translate, "as a child (serveth) a father."

served with me--When we might expect the sentence to run thus. "As a
child serveth a father, so he served me"; he changes it to "served with
me" in modesty; as Christians are not servants TO one another," but
servants of God WITH one another (compare [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017).md).

in the gospel--Greek, "unto," or "for the Gospel."

[Philippians 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">phi 2:23</span></span>

so soon as I shall see--that is, so soon as I shall have known for
certain.

[Philippians 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">phi 2:24</span></span>

also myself--as well as Timothy.

[Philippians 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">phi 2:25</span></span>

I supposed--"I thought it necessary."

to send--It was properly a sending Epaphroditus back ([Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018).md). But as he had come intending to
stay some time with Paul, the latter uses the word "send" (compare [Phi
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030).md).

fellow soldier--in the "good fight" of faith ([Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md), [Phi
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030.md); [Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007).md).

your messenger--literally, "apostle." The "apostles" or "messengers of
the churches" ([Rom 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007.md); [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023).md), were distinct from the
"apostles" specially commissioned by Christ, as the Twelve and Paul.

ministered to my wants--by conveying the contributions from Philippi.
The Greek "leitourgon," literally, implies ministering in the
ministerial office. Probably Epaphroditus was a presbyter or else a
deacon.

[Philippians 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">phi 2:26</span></span>

For--reason for thinking it "necessary to send" "Epaphroditus. Translate
as Greek, "Inasmuch as he was longing after you all."

full of heaviness--The Greek expresses the being worn out and
overpowered with heavy grief.

because that ye had heard that he had been sick--rather, "that he was
sick." He felt how exceedingly saddened you would be in hearing it; and
he now is hastening to relieve your minds of the anxiety.

[Philippians 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">phi 2:27</span></span>

Epaphroditus' sickness proves that the apostles had not ordinarily the
permanent gift of miracles, any more than of inspiration: both were
vouchsafed to them only for each particular occasion, as the Spirit
thought fit.

lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow--namely, the sorrow of losing him
by death, in addition to the sorrow of my imprisonment. Here only occurs
anything of a sorrowful tone in this Epistle, which generally is most
joyous.

[Philippians 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">phi 2:29</span></span>

Receive him--There seems to be something behind respecting him. If
extreme affection had been the sole ground of his "heaviness," no such
exhortation would have been needed \[ALFORD\].

in reputation--"in honor."

[Philippians 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">phi 2:30</span></span>

for the work of Christ--namely, the bringing of a supply to me, the
minister of Christ. He was probably in a delicate state of health in
setting out from Philippi; but at all hazards he undertook this service
of Christian love, which cost him a serious sickness.

not regarding his life--Most of the oldest manuscripts read,
"hazarding," &c.

to supply your lack of service--Not that Paul would imply, they lacked
the will: what they "lacked" was the "opportunity" by which to send
their accustomed bounty ([Phi 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010).md).
"That which ye would have done if you could (but which you could not
through absence), he did for you; therefore receive him with all joy"
\[ALFORD\].
