### [Ezekiel Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 43:2</span></span>

JEHOVAH'S RETURN TO THE TEMPLE. (Eze. 43:1-27)

the way of the east--the way whereby the glory had departed ([Eze
11:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#022).md), and rested on Mount Olivet
(compare [Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md).

his voice . . . like . . . many waters--So English Version rightly, as
in [Eze 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#024.md), "voice of the Almighty";
[Rev 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#015.md); [Rev
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md), prove this. Not as FAIRBAIRN
translates, "its noise."

earth his glory-- ([Rev 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#001).md).

[Ezekiel 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 43:3</span></span>

when I came to destroy the city--that is, to pronounce God's word for
its destruction. So completely did the prophets identify themselves with
Him in whose name they spake.

[Ezekiel 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 43:6</span></span>

the man--who had been measuring the buildings ([Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 43:7</span></span>

the place--that is, "behold the place of My throne"--the place on which
your thoughts have so much dwelt ([Isa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md); [Zac
14:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md). God from the first claimed to be
their King politically as well as religiously: and He had resisted their
wish to have a human king, as implying a rejection of Him as the proper
Head of the state. Even when He yielded to their wish, it was with a
protest against their king ruling except as His vicegerent. When Messiah
shall reign at Jerusalem, He shall then first realize the original idea
of the theocracy, with its at once divine and human king reigning in
righteousness over a people all righteous ([Eze
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012.md); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md); [Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021).md).

[Ezekiel 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 43:9</span></span>

carcasses of their kings--It is supposed that some of their idolatrous
kings were buried within the bounds of Solomon's temple \[HENDERSON\].
Rather, "the carcasses of their idols," here called "kings," as having
had lordship over them in past times ([Isa
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#013).md); but henceforth Jehovah, alone
their rightful lord, shall be their king, and the idols that had been
their "king" would appear but as "carcasses." Hence these defunct kings
are associated with the "high places" in [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md) \[FAIRBAIRN\] [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md) and [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md), confirm this. Manasseh had
built altars in the courts of the temple to the host of heaven ([Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md); [Kg2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#006).md).

I will dwell in the midst . . . for ever-- ([Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 43:10</span></span>

show the house . . . that they may be ashamed of their iniquities--When
the spirituality of the Christian scheme is shown to men by the Holy
Ghost, it makes them "ashamed of their iniquities."

[Ezekiel 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 43:12</span></span>

whole . . . most holy--This superlative, which had been used exclusively
of the holy of holies ([Exo 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#034).md),
was now to characterize the entire building. This all-pervading sanctity
was to be "the law of the (whole) house," as distinguished from the
Levitical law, which confined the peculiar sanctity to a single
apartment of it.

[Ezekiel 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 43:13</span></span>

As to the altar of burnt offering, which was the appointed means of
access to God.

[Ezekiel 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 43:15</span></span>

altar--Hebrew, Harel, that is, "mount of God"; denoting the high
security to be imparted by it to the restored Israel. It was a high
place, but a high place of God, not of idols.

from the altar--literally, "the lion of God," Ariel (in [Isa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md), "Ariel" is applied to
Jerusalem). MENOCHIUS supposes that on it four animals were carved; the
lion perhaps was the uppermost, whence the horns were made to issue.
GESENIUS regards the two words as expressing the "hearth" or fireplace
of the altar.

[Ezekiel 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 43:16</span></span>

square in the four squares--square on the four sides of its squares
\[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 43:17</span></span>

settle--ledge \[FAIRBAIRN\].

stairs--rather, "the ascent," as "steps" up to God's altar were
forbidden in [Exo 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026.md).

[Ezekiel 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 43:18</span></span>

The sacrifices here are not mere commemorative, but propitiatory ones.
The expressions, "blood" ([Eze 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#018).md),
and "for a sin offering ([Eze 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#019.md),
[Eze 43:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#021).md), prove this. In the
literal sense they can only apply to the second temple. Under the
Christian dispensation they would directly oppose the doctrine taught in
Heb. 10:1-18, namely, that Christ has by one offering for ever atoned
for sin. However, it is possible that they might exist with a
retrospective reference to Christ's sufferings, as the Levitical
sacrifices had a prospective reference to them; not propitiatory in
themselves, but memorials to keep up the remembrance of His propitiatory
sufferings, which form the foundation of His kingdom, lest they should
be lost sight of in the glory of that kingdom \[DE BURGH\]. The
particularity of the directions make it unlikely that they are to be
understood in a merely vague spiritual sense.

[Ezekiel 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 43:20</span></span>

cleanse--literally, "make expiation for."

[Ezekiel 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 43:21</span></span>

burn it . . . without the sanctuary-- ([Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 43:26</span></span>

Seven days--referring to the original directions of Moses for seven
days' purification services of the altar ([Exo
29:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#037).md).

consecrate themselves--literally, "fill their hands," namely, with
offerings; referring to the mode of consecrating a priest ([Exo
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#024.md), [Exo
29:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#035).md).

[Ezekiel 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 43:27</span></span>

I will accept you-- ([Eze 20:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040.md);
[Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005).md).
