### [Psalms Chapter 149](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001)

[Psalms 149:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 149:1</span></span>

This Psalm sustains a close connection with the foregoing. The chosen
people are exhorted to praise God, in view of past favors, and also
future victories over enemies, of which they are impliedly assured.
([Psa 149:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#001))

(Compare [Psa 96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001)).

[Psalms 149:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 149:2</span></span>

God had signalized His relation as a sovereign, in restoring them to
their land.

[Psalms 149:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 149:3</span></span>

in the dance-- ([Psa 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011)). The dance
is connected with other terms, expressive of the great joy of the
occasion. The word may be rendered "lute," to which the other
instruments are joined.

sing praises--or, sing and play.

[Psalms 149:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 149:4</span></span>

taketh pleasure--literally, "accepts," alluding to acceptance of
propitiatory offerings (compare [Psa
147:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#011)).

beautify, &c.--adorn the humble with faith, hope, joy, and peace.

[Psalms 149:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 149:5</span></span>

in glory--the honorable condition to which they are raised.

upon their beds--once a place of mourning ([Psa
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006)).

[Psalms 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 149:6</span></span>

high praises--or, "deeds." They shall go forth as religious warriors, as
once religious laborers ([Neh 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#017)).

[Psalms 149:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 149:7</span></span>

The destruction of the incorrigibly wicked attends the propagation of
God's truth, so that the military successes of the Jews, after the
captivity, typified the triumphs of the Gospel.

[Psalms 149:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 149:9</span></span>

the judgment written--either in God's decrees, or perhaps as in [Deu
32:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041).

this honour--that is, to be thus employed, will be an honorable service,
to be assigned

his saints--or, godly ones ([Psa
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003)).
