### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 29:1</span></span>

DAVID MARCHING WITH THE PHILISTINES TO FIGHT WITH ISRAEL. ([Sa1
29:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md)

Aphek-- ([Jos 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#008).md), in the tribe of
Issachar, and in the plain of Esdraelon. A person who compares the Bible
account of Saul's last battle with the Philistines, with the region
around Gilboa, has the same sort of evidence that the account relates
what is true, that a person would have that such a battle as Waterloo
really took place. Gilboa, Jezreel, Shunem, En-dor, are all found, still
bearing the same names. They lie within sight of each other. Aphek is
the only one of the cluster not yet identified. Jezreel on the northern
slope of Gilboa, and at the distance of twenty minutes to the east, is a
large fountain, and a smaller one still nearer; just the position which
a chieftain would select, both on account of its elevation and the
supply of water needed for his troops \[HACKETT, Scripture
Illustrated\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 29:2</span></span>

David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish--as the
commander of the lifeguards of Achish, who was general of this invading
army of the Philistines.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 29:3</span></span>

these days, or these years--He had now been with the Philistines a full
year and four months ([Sa1 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#007).md), and
also some years before. It has been thought that David kept up a private
correspondence with this Philistine prince, either on account of his
native generosity, or in the anticipation that an asylum in his
territories would sooner or later be needed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 29:4</span></span>

the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him--It must be
considered a happy circumstance in the overruling providence of God to
rescue David out of the dangerous dilemma in which he was now placed.
But David is not free from censure in his professions to Achish ([Sa1
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#008).md), to do what he probably had not
the smallest purpose of doing--of fighting with Achish against his
enemies. It is just an instance of the unhappy consequences into which a
false step--a departure from the straight course of duty--will betray
everyone who commits it.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 29:9</span></span>

notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said--The Philistine
government had constitutional checks--or at least the king was not an
absolute sovereign; but his authority was limited--his proceedings
liable to be controlled by "the powerful barons of that rude and early
period--much as the kings of Europe in the Middle Ages were by the proud
and lawless aristocracy which surrounded them" \[CHALMERS\].
