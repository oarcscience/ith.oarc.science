### [2 Chronicles Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 22:1</span></span>

AHAZIAH SUCCEEDING JEHORAM, REIGNS WICKEDLY. ([Ch2
22:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001).md)

the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah . . . king--or Jehoahaz ([Ch2
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017).md). All his older brothers having
been slaughtered by the Arab marauders, the throne of Judah rightfully
belonged to him as the only legitimate heir.

[2 Chronicles 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 22:2</span></span>

Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign--(Compare
[Kg2 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#026).md). According to that passage,
the commencement of his reign is dated in the twenty-second year of his
age, and, according to this, in the forty-second year of the kingdom of
his mother's family \[LIGHTFOOT\]. "If Ahaziah ascended the throne in
the twenty-second year of his life, he must have been born in his
father's nineteenth year. Hence, it may seem strange that he had older
brothers; but in the East they marry early, and royal princes had,
besides the wife of the first rank, usually concubines, as Jehoram had
([Ch2 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#017).md); he might, therefore, in
the nineteenth year of his age, very well have several sons" \[KEIL\]
(compare [Ch2 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020.md); [Kg2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#017).md).

Athaliah the daughter of Omri--more properly, "granddaughter." The
expression is used loosely, as the statement was made simply for the
purpose of intimating that she belonged to that idolatrous race.

[2 Chronicles 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 22:3</span></span>

his mother was his counsellor . . . they were his counsellors--The
facile king surrendered himself wholly to the influence of his mother
and her relatives. Athaliah and her son introduced a universal
corruption of morals and made idolatry the religion of the court and the
nation. By them he was induced not only to conform to the religion of
the northern kingdom, but to join a new expedition against Ramoth-gilead
(see [Kg2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#010).md).

[2 Chronicles 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 22:5</span></span>

went . . . to war against Hazael, king of Syria--It may be mentioned as
a very minute and therefore important confirmation of this part of the
sacred history that the names of Jehu and Hazael, his contemporary, have
both been found on Assyrian sculptures; and there is also a notice of
Ithbaal, king of Sidon, who was the father of Jezebel.

[2 Chronicles 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 22:6</span></span>

Azariah went down--that is, from Ramoth-gilead, to visit the king of
Israel, who was lying ill of his wounds at Jezreel, and who had fled
there on the alarm of Jehu's rebellion.

[2 Chronicles 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 22:9</span></span>

he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (for he was hid in
Samaria)--(compare [Kg2 9:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#027).md). The
two accounts are easily reconciled. "Ahaziah fled first to the garden
house and escaped to Samaria; but was here, where he had hid himself,
taken by Jehu's men who pursued him, brought to Jehu, who was still near
or in Jezreel, and at his command slain at the hill Gur, beside Ibleam,
in his chariot; that is, mortally wounded with an arrow, so that he,
again fleeing, expired at Megiddo" \[KEIL\]. Jehu left the corpse at the
disposal of the king of Judah's attendants, who conveyed it to
Jerusalem, and out of respect to his grandfather Jehoshaphat's memory,
gave him an honorable interment in the tombs of the kings.

So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom--His
children were too young to assume the reins of government, and all the
other royal princes had been massacred by Jehu ([Ch2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#008).md).

[2 Chronicles 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 22:10</span></span>

ATHALIAH, DESTROYING THE SEED ROYAL SAVE JOASH, USURPS THE KINGDOM.
([Ch2 22:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#010).md)

Athaliah . . . arose and destroyed all the seed royal--(See on [Kg2
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001).md). Maddened by the massacre of
the royal family of Ahab, she resolved that the royal house of David
should have the same fate. Knowing the commission which Jehu had
received to extirpate the whole of Ahab's posterity, she expected that
he would extend his sword to her. Anticipating his movements, she
resolved, as her only defense and security, to usurp the throne and
destroy "the seed royal," both because they were hostile to the
PhÅ“nician worship of Baal, which she was determined to uphold, and
because, if one of the young princes became king, his mother would
supersede Athaliah in the dignity of queen mother.

[2 Chronicles 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 22:12</span></span>

he was with them hid in the house of God--Certain persons connected with
the priesthood had a right to occupy the buildings in the outer wall,
and all within the outer wall was often called the temple. Jehoiada and
his family resided in one of these apartments.
