### [Psalms Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001)

[Psalms 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 6:1</span></span>

On Neginoth (See on [Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001), title)
upon Sheminith--the eighth--an instrument for the eighth key; or, more
probably, the bass, as it is contrasted with Alamoth (the treble, [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)) in [Ch1
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020). In deep affliction the
Psalmist appeals to God's mercy for relief from chastisement, which
otherwise must destroy him, and thus disable him for God's service. Sure
of a gracious answer, he triumphantly rebukes his foes. ([Psa
6:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001))

He owns his ill desert in begging a relief from chastisement.

[Psalms 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 6:2</span></span>

I am weak--as a culled plant ([Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004)).

my bones--the very frame.

are vexed-- ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005)) --shaken with
fear.

[Psalms 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 6:3</span></span>

how long?--shall this be so (compare [Psa
79:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#005)).

but--or, "and."

thou--The sentence is incomplete as expressive of strong emotion.

[Psalms 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 6:4</span></span>

Return--that is, to my relief; or, "turn," as now having His face
averted.

for thy mercies' sake--to illustrate Thy mercy.

[Psalms 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 6:5</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 115:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017); [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018)). There is no incredulity as to
a future state. The contrast is between this scene of life, and the
grave or Sheol, the unseen world of the dead.

give . . . thanks--or, "praise for mercies."

[Psalms 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 6:6</span></span>

By a strong figure the abundance as well as intensity of grief is
depicted.

[Psalms 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 6:7</span></span>

consumed--or, "has failed," denoting general debility ([Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003); [Psa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010)).

waxeth old--or, "dim."

grief--mingled with indignation.

[Psalms 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 6:8</span></span>

Assured of God's hearing, he suddenly defies his enemies by an address
indicating that he no longer fears them.

[Psalms 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 6:10</span></span>

and knows they will be disappointed and in their turn (compare [Psa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#003)) be terror-stricken or confounded.
