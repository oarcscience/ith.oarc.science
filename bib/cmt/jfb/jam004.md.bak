### [James Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

[James 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jam 4:1</span></span>

AGAINST FIGHTINGS AND THEIR SOURCE; WORLDLY LUSTS; UNCHARITABLE
JUDGMENTS, AND PRESUMPTUOUS RECKONING ON THE FUTURE. (Jam. 4:1-17)

whence--The cause of quarrels is often sought in external circumstances,
whereas internal lusts are the true origin.

wars, &c.--contrasted with the "peace" of heavenly wisdom. "Fightings"
are the active carrying on of "wars." The best authorities have a second
"whence" before "fightings." Tumults marked the era before the
destruction of Jerusalem when James wrote. He indirectly alludes to
these. The members are the first seat of war; thence it passes to
conflict between man and man, nation and nation.

come they not, &c.--an appeal to their consciences.

lusts--literally, "pleasures," that is, the lusts which prompt you to
"desire" (see on [Jam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002).md) pleasures;
whence you seek self at the cost of your neighbor, and hence flow
"fightings."

that war--"campaign, as an army of soldiers encamped within" \[ALFORD\]
the soul; tumultuously war against the interests of your fellow men,
while lusting to advance self. But while warring thus against others
they (without his knowledge) war against the soul of the man himself,
and against the Spirit; therefore they must be "mortified" by the
Christian.

[James 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jam 4:2</span></span>

Ye lust--A different Greek word from that in [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md). "Ye desire"; literally, "ye set
your mind (or heart) on" an object.

have not--The lust of desire does not ensure the actual possession.
Hence "ye kill" (not as Margin, without any old authority, "envy") to
ensure possession. Not probably in the case of professing Christians of
that day in a literal sense, but "kill and envy" (as the Greek for
"desire to have" should be translated), that is, harass and oppress
through envy \[DRUSIUS\]. Compare [Zac
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005.md), "slay"; through envy, hate, and
desire to get out of your way, and so are "murderers" in God's eyes
\[ESTIUS\]. If literal murder \[ALFORD\] were meant, I do not think it
would occur so early in the series; nor had Christians then as yet
reached so open criminality. In the Spirit's application of the passage
to all ages, literal killing is included, flowing from the desire to
possess so David and Ahab. There is a climax: "Ye desire," the
individual lust for an object; "ye kill and envy," the feeling and
action of individuals against individuals; "ye fight and war," the
action of many against many.

ye have not, because ye ask not--God promises to those who pray, not to
those who fight. The petition of the lustful, murderous, and contentious
is not recognized by God as prayer. If ye prayed, there would be no
"wars and fightings." Thus this last clause is an answer to the
question, [Jam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md), "Whence come wars
and fightings?"

[James 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jam 4:3</span></span>

Some of them are supposed to say in objection, But we do "ask" (pray);
compare [Jam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md). James replies, It is
not enough to ask for good things, but we must ask with a good spirit
and intention. "Ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it (your object of
prayer) upon (literally, 'in') your lusts (literally, 'pleasures')"; not
that ye may have the things you need for the service of God. Contrast
[Jam 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md) with [Mat
6:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#031.md). If ye prayed aright, all your
proper wants would be supplied; the improper cravings which produce
"wars and fightings" would then cease. Even believers' prayers are often
best answered when their desires are most opposed.

[James 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jam 4:4</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts omit "adulterers and," and read simply, "Ye
adulteresses." God is the rightful husband; the men of the world are
regarded collectively as one adulteress, and individually as
adulteresses.

the world--in so far as the men of it and their motives and acts are
aliens to God, for example, its selfish "lusts" ([Jam
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#003).md), and covetous and ambitious "wars
and fightings" ([Jam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001).md).

enmity--not merely "inimical"; a state of enmity, and that enmity
itself. Compare [Jo1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md), "love . . .
the world . . . the love of the Father."

whosoever . . . will be--The Greek is emphatic, "shall be resolved to
be." Whether he succeed or not, if his wish be to be the friend of the
world, he renders himself, becomes (so the Greek for "is") by the very
fact, "the enemy of God." Contrast "Abraham the friend of God."

[James 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jam 4:5</span></span>

in vain--No word of Scripture can be so. The quotation here, as in [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md), seems to be not so much from a
particular passage as one gathered by James under inspiration from the
general tenor of such passages in both the Old and New Testaments, as
[Num 14:29](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#029.md); [Pro
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#020.md); [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md).

spirit that dwelleth in us--Other manuscripts read, "that God hath made
to dwell in us" (namely, at Pentecost). If so translated, "Does the
(Holy) Spirit that God hath placed in us lust to (towards) envy"
(namely, as ye do in your worldly "wars and fightings")? Certainly not;
ye are therefore walking in the flesh, not in the Spirit, while ye thus
lust towards, that is, with envy against one another. The friendship of
the world tends to breed envy; the Spirit produces very different fruit.
ALFORD attributes the epithet "with envy," in the unwarrantable sense of
jealously, to the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit jealously desires us for His
own." In English Version the sense is, "the (natural) spirit that hath
its dwelling in us lusts with (literally, 'to,' or 'towards') envy." Ye
lust, and because ye have not what ye lust after ([Jam
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001).md), ye envy your neighbor who has,
and so the spirit of envy leads you on to "fight." James also here
refers to [Jam 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#014.md), [Jam
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#016.md).

[James 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jam 4:6</span></span>

But--"Nay, rather."

he--God.

giveth more grace--ever increasing grace; the farther ye depart from
"envy" \[BENGEL\].

he saith--The same God who causes His spirit to dwell in believers ([Jam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005).md), by the Spirit also speaks in
Scripture. The quotation here is probably from [Pro
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md); as probably [Pro
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#010.md) was generally referred to in
[Jam 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005.md). In Hebrew it is "scorneth
the scorners," namely, those who think "Scripture speaketh in vain."

resisteth--literally, "setteth Himself in array against"; even as they,
like Pharaoh, set themselves against Him. God repays sinners in their
own coin. "Pride" is the mother of "envy" ([Jam
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#005).md); it is peculiarly satanic, for by
it Satan fell.

the proud--The Greek means in derivation one who shows himself above his
fellows, and so lifts himself against God.

the humble--the unenvious, uncovetous, and unambitious as to the world.
Contrast [Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md).

[James 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jam 4:7</span></span>

Submit to . . . God--so ye shall be among "the humble," [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md); also [Jam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md); [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md).

Resist . . . devil--Under his banner pride and envy are enlisted in the
world; resist his temptations to these. Faith, humble prayers, and
heavenly wisdom, are the weapons of resistance. The language is taken
from warfare. "Submit" as a good soldier puts himself in complete
subjection to his captain. "Resist," stand bravely against.

he will flee--Translate, "he shall flee." For it is a promise of God,
not a mere assurance from man to man \[ALFORD\]. He shall flee worsted
as he did from Christ.

[James 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jam 4:8</span></span>

Draw nigh to God--So "cleave unto Him," [Deu
30:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#020.md), namely, by prayerfully ([Jam
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002).md) "resisting Satan," who would
oppose our access to God.

he will draw nigh--propitious.

Cleanse . . . hands--the outward instruments of action. None but the
clean-handed can ascend into the hill of the Lord (justified through
Christ, who alone was perfectly so, and as such "ascended" thither).

purify . . . hearts--literally "make chaste" of your spiritual adultery
([Jam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004), that is, worldliness.md) "your
hearts": the inward source of all impurity.

double-minded--divided between God and the world. The "double-minded" is
at fault in heart; the sinner in his hands likewise.

[James 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jam 4:9</span></span>

Be afflicted--literally, "Endure misery," that is, mourn over your
wretchedness through sin. Repent with deep sorrow instead of your
present laughter. A blessed mourning. Contrast [Isa
22:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md); [Luk
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025.md). James does not add here, as in
[Jam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md), "howl," where he foretells
the doom of the impenitent at the coming destruction of Jerusalem.

heaviness--literally, "falling of the countenance," casting down of the
eyes.

[James 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jam 4:10</span></span>

in the sight of the Lord--as continually in the presence of Him who
alone is worthy to be exalted: recognizing His presence in all your
ways, the truest incentive to humility. The tree, to grow upwards, must
strike its roots deep downwards; so man, to be exalted, must have his
mind deep-rooted in humility. In [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md), it is, Humble yourselves under
the mighty hand of God, namely, in His dealings of Providence: a
distinct thought from that here.

lift you up--in part in this world, fully in the world to come.

[James 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jam 4:11</span></span>

Having mentioned sins of the tongue ([Jam
3:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005).md), he shows here that
evil-speaking flows from the same spirit of exalting self at the expense
of one's neighbor as caused the "fightings" reprobated in this chapter
([Jam 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001).md).

Speak not evil--literally, "Speak not against" one another.

brethren--implying the inconsistency of such depreciatory speaking of
one another in brethren.

speaketh evil of the law--for the law in commanding, "Love thy neighbor
as thyself" ([Jam 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008).md), virtually
condemns evil-speaking and judging \[ESTIUS\]. Those who superciliously
condemn the acts and words of others which do not please themselves,
thus aiming at the reputation of sanctity, put their own moroseness in
the place of the law, and claim to themselves a power of censuring above
the law of God, condemning what the law permits \[CALVIN\]. Such a one
acts as though the law could not perform its own office of judging, but
he must fly upon the office \[BENGEL\]. This is the last mention of the
law in the New Testament. ALFORD rightly takes the "law" to be the old
moral law applied in its comprehensive spiritual fulness by Christ: "the
law of liberty."

if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer . . . but a judge--Setting
aside the Christian brotherhood as all alike called to be doers of the
law, in subjection to it, such a one arrogates the office of a judge.

[James 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jam 4:12</span></span>

There is one lawgiver--The best authorities read in addition, "and
judge." Translate, "There is One (alone) who is (at once) Lawgiver and
Judge, (namely) He who is able to save and destroy." Implying, God alone
is Lawgiver and therefore Judge, since it is He alone who can execute
His judgments; our inability in this respect shows our presumption in
trying to act as judges, as though we were God.

who art thou, &c.--The order in the Greek is emphatic, "But (inserted in
oldest manuscripts) thou, who art thou that judgest another?" How rashly
arrogant in judging thy fellows, and wresting from God the office which
belongs to Him over thee and THEM alike!

another--The oldest authorities read, "thy neighbor."

[James 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jam 4:13</span></span>

Go to now--"Come now"; said to excite attention.

ye that say--boasting of the morrow.

To-day or to-morrow--as if ye had the free choice of either day as a
certainty. Others read, "To-day and to-morrow."

such a city--literally, "this the city" (namely, the one present to the
mind of the speaker). This city here.

continue . . . a year--rather, "spend one year." Their language implies
that when this one year is out, they purpose similarly settling plans
for to come \[BENGEL\].

buy and sell--Their plans for the future are all worldly.

[James 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jam 4:14</span></span>

what--literally, "of what nature" is your life? that is, how evanescent
it is.

It is even--Some oldest authorities read, "For ye are." BENGEL, with
other old authorities, reads, "For it shall be," the future referring to
the "morrow" ([Jam 4:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md). The
former expresses, "Ye yourselves are transitory"; so everything of
yours, even your life, must partake of the same transitoriness. Received
text has no old authority.

and then vanisheth away--"afterwards vanishing as it came"; literally,
"afterwards (as it appeared), so vanishing" \[ALFORD\].

[James 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jam 4:15</span></span>

Literally, "instead of your saying," &c. This refers to "ye that say"
([Jam 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md).

we shall live--The best manuscripts read, "We shall both live and do,"
&c. The boasters spoke as if life, action, and the particular kind of
action were in their power, whereas all three depend entirely on the
will of the Lord.

[James 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jam 4:16</span></span>

now--as it is.

rejoice in . . . boastings--"ye boast in arrogant presumptions," namely,
vain confident fancies that the future is certain to you ([Jam
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#013).md).

rejoicing--boasting \[BENGEL\].

[James 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jam 4:17</span></span>

The general principle illustrated by the particular example just
discussed is here stated: knowledge without practice is imputed to a man
as great and presumptuous sin. James reverts to the principle with which
he started. Nothing more injures the soul than wasted impressions.
Feelings exhaust themselves and evaporate, if not embodied in practice.
As we will not act except we feel, so if we will not act out our
feelings, we shall soon cease to feel.
