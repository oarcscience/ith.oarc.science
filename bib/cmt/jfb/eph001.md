### [Ephesians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 1:1</span></span>

INSCRIPTION: ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH IN THE FATHER'S ETERNAL COUNSEL, AND
THE SON'S BLOODSHEDDING: THE SEALING OF IT BY THE SPIRIT. THANKSGIVING
AND PRAYER THAT THEY MAY FULLY KNOW GOD'S GRACIOUS POWER IN CHRIST
TOWARDS THE SAINTS. (Eph. 1:1-23)

by--rather, "through the will of God": called to the apostleship through
that same "will" which originated the Church ([Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md); compare [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004).md).

which are at Ephesus--(See Introduction.)

to the saints . . . and to the faithful--The same persons are referred
to by both designations, as the Greek proves: "to those who are saints,
and faithful in Christ Jesus." The sanctification by God is here put
before man's faith. The twofold aspect of salvation is thus presented,
God's grace in the first instance sanctifying us, (that is, setting us
apart in His eternal purposes as holy unto Himself); and our faith, by
God's gift, laying hold of salvation ([Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md).

[Ephesians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 1:2</span></span>

([Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md); [Co1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003.md); [Co2
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#002.md); [Gal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#003).md).

[Ephesians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 1:3</span></span>

The doxologies in almost all the Epistles imply the real sense of grace
experienced by the writers and their readers ([Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md). [Eph
1:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md) sets forth summarily the Gospel
of the grace of God: the FATHER'S work of love, [Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md) (choosing us to holiness, [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md); to sonship, [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md); to acceptance, [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006).md): the SON'S, [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md) (redemption, [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md); knowledge of the mystery of His
will, [Eph 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); an inheritance, [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md); the HOLY SPIRIT'S, [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md) (sealing, [Eph
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md); giving an earnest of the
inheritance, [Eph 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md).

the God and Father of . . . Christ--and so the God and Father of us who
are in Him ([Joh 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017).md). God is "the
God" of the man Jesus, and "the Father" of the Divine Word. The Greek
is, "Blessed us," not "hath blessed us"; referring to the past original
counsel of God. As in creation ([Gen
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#022).md) so in redemption ([Gen
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md); [Mat
5:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md); [Mat
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034).md) God "blesses" His children; and
that not in mere words, but in acts.

us--all Christians.

blessings--Greek, "blessing." "All," that is, "every possible blessing
for time and eternity, which the Spirit has to bestow" (so "spiritual"
means; not "spiritual," as the term is now used, as opposed to bodily).

in heavenly places--a phrase five times found in this Epistle, and not
elsewhere ([Eph 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).md); Greek, "in the heavenly
places." Christ's ascension is the means of introducing us into the
heavenly places, which by our sin were barred against us. Compare the
change made by Christ ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md). While Christ in the flesh was
in the form of a servant, God's people could not realize fully their
heavenly privileges as sons. Now "our citizenship (Greek) is in heaven"
([Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md), where our High Priest is
ever "blessing" us. Our "treasures" are there ([Mat
6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020).md); our aims and affections
([Col 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001).md); our hope ([Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).md); our inheritance ([Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).md). The gift of the Spirit itself,
the source of the "spiritual blessing," is by virtue of Jesus having
ascended thither ([Eph 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008).md).

in Christ--the center and source of all blessing to us.

[Ephesians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 1:4</span></span>

hath chosen us--Greek, "chose us out for Himself" (namely, out of the
world, [Gal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004).md): referring to His
original choice, spoken of as past.

in him--The repetition of the idea, "in Christ" ([Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).md), implies the paramount importance
of the truth that it is in Him, and by virtue of union to Him, the
Second Adam, the Restorer ordained for us from everlasting, the Head of
redeemed humanity, believers have all their blessings ([Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011).md).

before the foundation of the world--This assumes the eternity of the Son
of God ([Joh 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md), as of the election of
believers in Him ([Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md).

that we should be holy--positively ([Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002).md).

without blame--negatively ([Eph 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027.md);
[Th1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013).md).

before him--It is to Him the believer looks, walking as in His presence,
before whom he looks to be accepted in the judgment ([Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md); compare [Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015).md).

in love--joined by BENGEL and others with [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md), "in love having predestinated
us," &c. But English Version is better. The words qualify the whole
clause, "that we should be holy . . . before Him." Love, lost to man by
the fall, but restored by redemption, is the root and fruit and sum of
all holiness ([Eph 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Th1
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012).md).

[Ephesians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 1:5</span></span>

predestinated--more special in respect to the end and precise means,
than "chosen" or elected. We are "chosen" out of the rest of the world;
"predestinated" to all things that secure the inheritance for us ([Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md); [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md). "Foreordained."

by Jesus--Greek, "through Jesus."

to himself--the Father ([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md).
ALFORD explains, "adoption . . . into Himself," that is, so that we
should be partakers of the divine nature ([Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md). LACHMANN reads, "unto Him." The
context favors the explanation of CALVIN: God has regard to Himself and
the glory of His grace ([Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), [Eph
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md), [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md) as His ultimate end. He had one
only-begotten Son, and He was pleased for His own glory, to choose out
of a lost world many to become His adopted sons. Translate, "unto
Himself."

the good pleasure of his will--So the Greek ([Mat
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#026.md); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021).md). We cannot go beyond "the good
pleasure of His will" in searching into the causes of our salvation, or
of any of His works ([Eph 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009).md). ([Job
33:13](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#013)..md) Why needest thou philosophize
about an imaginary world of optimism? Thy concern is to take heed that
thou be not bad. There was nothing in us which deserved His love ([Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md), [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md), [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md) \[BENGEL\].

[Ephesians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 1:6</span></span>

([Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md), [Eph
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017).md). The end aimed at ([Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023).md), that is, that the glory of His
grace may be praised by all His creatures, men and angels.

wherein--Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "which." Then translate,
"which He graciously bestowed on us." But English Version is supported
by good manuscripts and the oldest versions.

us accepted--a kindred Greek word to "grace": charitos, echaritosen:
translate, "graciously accepted"; "made us subjects of His grace";
"embraced us in the arms of His grace" ([Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md); [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015).md).

in the beloved--pre-eminently so called ([Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md); [Joh
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md); [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013).md). Greek, "Son of His love." It is
only "IN HIS BELOVED" that He loves us ([Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md); [Jo1
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#009).md).

[Ephesians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 1:7</span></span>

In whom--"the Beloved" ([Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md); [Rom
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md).

we have--as a present possession.

redemption--Greek, "our (literally, 'the') redemption"; THE redemption
which is the grand subject of all revelation, and especially of the New
Testament ([Rom 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024).md), namely, from
the power, guilt, and penal consequences of sin ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md). If a man were unable to redeem
himself from being a bond-servant, his kinsman might redeem him ([Lev
25:48](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#048).md). Hence, antitypically the Son
of God became the Son of man, that as our kinsman He might redeem us
([Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028).md). Another "redemption"
follows, namely, that "of the purchased possession" hereafter ([Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md).

through his blood-- ([Eph 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013).md); as
the instrument; the propitiation, that is, the consideration (devised by
His own love) for which He, who was justly angry ([Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md), becomes propitious to us; the
expiation, the price paid to divine justice for our sin ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md); [Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); [Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md); [Pe1
1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md).

the forgiveness of sins--Greek, "the remission of our transgressions":
not merely "pretermission," as the Greek ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md) ought to be translated. This
"remission," being the explanation of "redemption," includes not only
deliverance from sin's penalty, but from its pollution and enslaving
power, negatively; and the reconciliation of an offended God, and a
satisfaction unto a just God, positively.

riches of his grace-- ([Eph 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007).md); "the
exceeding riches of His grace." Compare [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016.md), "according to the riches of His
glory": so that "grace" is His "glory."

[Ephesians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 1:8</span></span>

Rather, "which He made to abound towards us."

all wisdom and prudence--"wisdom" in devising the plan of redeeming
mankind; "prudence" in executing it by the means, and in making all the
necessary arrangements of Providence for that purpose. Paul attributes
to the Gospel of God's grace "all" possible "wisdom and prudence," in
opposition to the boasts of wisdom and prudence which the unbelieving
Jews and heathen philosophers and false apostles arrogated for their
teachings. Christ crucified, though esteemed "foolishness" by the world,
is "the wisdom of God" ([Co1 1:18-30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018).md).
Compare [Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md), "the manifold
wisdom of God."

[Ephesians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 1:9</span></span>

"He hath abounded," or "made (grace) to abound toward us" ([Eph
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008).md), in that He made known to us,
namely, experimentally, in our hearts.

the mystery--God's purpose of redemption hidden heretofore in His
counsels, but now revealed ([Eph 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md);
[Rom 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Col
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).md). This "mystery" is not like
the heathen mysteries, which were imparted only to the initiated few.
All Christians are the initiated. Only unbelievers are the uninitiated.

according to his good pleasure--showing the cause why "He hath made
known to us the mystery," namely, His own loving "good pleasure" toward
us; also the time and manner of His doing so, are according to His good
pleasure.

purposed-- ([Eph 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md).

in himself--God the Father. BENGEL takes it, "in Him," that is, Christ,
as in [Eph 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md). But the proper name,
"in Christ," [Eph 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md), immediately
after, is inconsistent with His being here meant by the pronoun.

[Ephesians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 1:10</span></span>

Translate, "Unto the dispensation of the fulness of the times," that is,
"which He purposed in Himself" ([Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009).md) with a view to the economy of
(the gracious administration belonging to) the fulness of the times
(Greek, "fit times," "seasons"). More comprehensive than "the fulness of
the time" ([Gal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md). The whole of the
Gospel times (plural) is meant, with the benefits to the Church
dispensed in them severally and successively. Compare "the ages to come"
([Eph 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007).md). "The ends of the ages"
(Greek, [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011).md); "the times (same
Greek as here, 'the seasons,' or 'fitly appointed times') of the
Gentiles" ([Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md); "the seasons
which the Father hath put in His own power" ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007).md); "the times of restitution of all
things which God hath spoken by the prophets since the world began"
([Act 3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020).md). The coming of Jesus at
the first advent, "in the fulness of time," was one of these "times."
The descent of the Holy Ghost, "when Pentecost was fully come" ([Act
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001).md), was another. The testimony given
by the apostles to Him "in due time" ("in its own seasons," Greek) ([Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006).md) was another. The conversion of
the Jews "when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled," the second
coming of Christ, the "restitution of all things," the millennial
kingdom, the new heaven and earth, shall be severally instances of "the
dispensation of the fulness of the times," that is, "the dispensation
of" the Gospel events and benefits belonging to their respective
"times," when severally filled up or completed. God the Father,
according to His own good pleasure and purpose, is the Dispenser both of
the Gospel benefits and of their several fitting times ([Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007).md).

gather together in one--Greek, "sum up under one head"; "recapitulate."
The "good pleasure which He purposed," was "to sum up all things (Greek,
'THE whole range of things') in Christ (Greek, 'the Christ,' that is,
His Christ)" \[ALFORD\]. God's purpose is to sum up the whole creation
in Christ, the Head of angels, with whom He is linked by His invisible
nature, and of men with whom He is linked by His humanity; of Jews and
Gentiles; of the living and the dead ([Eph
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015).md); of animate and inanimate
creation. Sin has disarranged the creature's relation of subordination
to God. God means to gather up all together in Christ; or as [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md) says, "By Him to reconcile all
things unto Himself, whether things in earth or things in heaven."
ALFORD well says, "The Church of which the apostle here mainly treats,
is subordinated to Him in the highest degree of conscious and joyful
union; those who are not His spiritually, in mere subjugation, yet
consciously; the inferior tribes of creation unconsciously; but
objectively, all are summed up in Him."

[Ephesians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 1:11</span></span>

In whom--by virtue of union to whom.

obtained an inheritance--literally, "We were made to have an
inheritance" \[WAHL\]. Compare [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md), "His inheritance in the saints":
as His inheritance is there said to be in them, so theirs is here said
to be in Him ([Act 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md). However,
[Eph 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md), "That we should BE TO . . .
His glory" (not "that we should have"), favors the translation of
BENGEL, ELLICOTT, and others, "We were made an inheritance." So the
literal Israel ([Deu 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029.md); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md). "Also" does not mean "we also,"
nor as English Version, "in whom also"; but, besides His having "made
known to us His will," we were also "made His inheritance," or "we have
also obtained an inheritance."

predestinated-- ([Eph 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005).md). The
foreordination of Israel, as the elect nation, answers to that of the
spiritual Israelites, believers, to an eternal inheritance, which is the
thing meant here. The "we" here and in [Eph
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md), means Jewish believers (whence
the reference to the election of Israel nationally arises), as
contrasted with "you" ([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md)
Gentile believers.

purpose--repeated from "purposed" ([Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011).md). The Church existed in the mind
of God eternally, before it existed in creation.

counsel of his . . . will-- ([Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005).md), "the good pleasure of His will."
Not arbitrary caprice, but infinite wisdom ("counsel") joined with
sovereign will. Compare his address to the same Ephesians in [Act
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027.md), "All the counsel of God" ([Isa
28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029).md). Alike in the natural and
spiritual creations, God is not an agent constrained by necessity.
"Wheresoever counsel is, there is election, or else it is vain; where a
will, there must be freedom, or else it is weak" \[PEARSON\].

[Ephesians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 1:12</span></span>

([Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014).md).

who first trusted in Christ--rather (we Jewish Christians), "who have
before hoped in the Christ": who before the Christ came, looked forward
to His coming, waiting for the consolation of Israel. Compare [Act
26:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md), "I am judged for the hope of
the promise made of God unto our fathers: unto which our twelve tribes,
instantly serving God day and night, hope to come." [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md), "the hope of Israel"
\[ALFORD\]. Compare [Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md); [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md); [Eph
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md).

[Ephesians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 1:13</span></span>

In whom ye also--Ye Gentiles. Supply as English Version, "trusted," from
[Eph 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012.md); or "are." The priority of
us Jews does not exclude you Gentiles from sharing in Christ (compare
[Act 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046).md).

the word of truth--the instrument of sanctification, and of the new
birth ([Joh 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md); [Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018).md). Compare [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), where also, as here, it is
connected with "hope." Also [Eph 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021.md).

sealed--as God's confirmed children, by the Holy Spirit as the seal
([Act 19:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md); [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md), [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md); see on [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022).md). A seal impressed on a document
gives undoubted validity to the contract in it ([Joh
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md); compare [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003).md). So the sense of "the love of God
shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost" ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005).md), and the sense of adoption given
through the Spirit at regeneration ([Rom
8:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015).md), assure believers of God's
good will to them. The Spirit, like a seal, impresses on the soul at
regeneration the image of our Father. The "sealing" by the Holy Spirit
is spoken of as past once for all. The witnessing to our hearts that we
are the children of God, and heirs ([Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011).md), is the Spirit's present
testimony, the "earnest of the (coming) inheritance" ([Rom
8:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016).md).

that Holy Spirit of promise--rather, as the Greek, "The Spirit of
promise, even the Holy Spirit": The Spirit promised both in the Old and
New Testaments ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Joh
7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md). "The word" promised the Holy
Spirit. Those who "believed the word of truth" were sealed by the Spirit
accordingly.

[Ephesians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 1:14</span></span>

earnest--the first instalment paid as a pledge that the rest will follow
([Rom 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md); [Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022).md).

until--rather, "Unto the redemption," &c.; joined thus, "ye were sealed
([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md) unto," that is, for the
purpose of and against, the accomplishment of "the redemption," namely,
not the redemption in its first stage, made by the blood of Christ,
which secures our title, but, in its final completion, when the actual
possession shall be ours, the full "redemption of the body" ([Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).md), as well as of the soul, from
every infirmity ([Eph 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030).md). The
deliverance of the creature (the body, and the whole visible creation)
from the bondage of corruption, and from the usurping prince of this
world, into the glorious liberty of the children of God ([Rom
8:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md).

of the purchased possession--God's people purchased ("acquired," Greek)
as His peculiar (Greek) possession by the blood of Christ ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md). We value highly that which we
pay a high price for; so God, His Church ([Eph
5:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md); [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); "my special treasure," [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017), Margin.md).

[Ephesians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 1:15</span></span>

Wherefore--because ye are in Christ and sealed by His Spirit ([Eph
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md).

I also--on my part, in return for God's so great benefits to you.

after I heard--ever since I have heard. Not implying that he had only
heard of their conversion: an erroneous argument used by some against
the address of this Epistle to the Ephesians (see on [Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001).md); but referring to the report he
had heard since he was with them, as to their Christian graces. So in
the case of Philemon, his "beloved fellow laborer" ([Plm
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001).md), he uses the same words ([Plm
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#004).md).

your faith--rather, as Greek, "the faith among you," that is, which many
(not all) of you have.

love unto all the saints--of whatever name, simply because they are
saints. A distinguishing characteristic of true Christianity ([Eph
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024).md). "Faith and love he often joins
together. A wondrous pair" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Hope is added, [Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md).

[Ephesians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 1:16</span></span>

([Col 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009).md).

of you--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Then the translation may be
as English Version still, or as ALFORD, "making mention of them" (your
"faith and love").

[Ephesians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 1:17</span></span>

A fit prayer for all Christians.

the God of our Lord Jesus--appropriate title here; as in [Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md) he treats of God's raising
Jesus to be Head over all things to the Church. Jesus Himself called the
Father "My God" ([Mat 27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046).md).

the Father of glory--(Compare [Act
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002).md). The Father of that infinite
glory which shines in the face of Christ, who is "the glory" (the true
Shekinah); through whom also "the glory of the inheritance" ([Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018).md) shall be ours ([Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024); 2Co. 3:7-4:6.md).

the spirit of wisdom--whose attribute is infinite wisdom and who works
wisdom in believers ([Isa 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md).

and revelation--whose function it is to reveal to believers spiritual
mysteries ([Joh 16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014.md); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010).md).

in the knowledge--rather, as Greek (see on [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md), "in the full knowledge of
Him," namely, God.

[Ephesians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 1:18</span></span>

understanding--The oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, read
"heart." Compare the contrary state of unbelieving, the heart being in
fault ([Eph 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md); [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015).md). Translate, "Having the eyes of
your heart enlightened" ([Eph 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014.md);
[Mat 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016).md). The first effect of the
Spirit moving in the new creation, as in the original physical creation
([Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006).md). So THEOPHILUS to AUTOLYCUS
(1.3), "the ears of the heart." Where spiritual light is, there is life
([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).md). The heart is "the core of
life" \[HARLESS\], and the fountain of the thoughts; whence "the heart"
in Scripture includes the mind, as well as the inclination. Its "eye,"
or inward vision, both receives and contemplates the light ([Mat
6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022).md). The eye is the symbol of
intelligence ([Eze 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018).md).

the hope of his calling--the hope appertaining to His having called you;
or, to the calling wherewith He has called you.

and--omitted in the oldest manuscripts and versions.

riches of the glory-- ([Col 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027).md).

his inheritance in the saints--The inheritance which he has in store in
the case of the saints. I prefer explaining, "The inheritance which He
has in his saints." (See on [Eph 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011.md);
[Deu 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md).

[Ephesians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 1:19</span></span>

exceeding--"surpassing."

power to us-ward who believe--The whole of the working of His grace,
which He is carrying on, and will carry on, in us who believe. By the
term "saints" ([Eph 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018).md), believers
are regarded as absolutely perfected, and so as being God's inheritance;
in this verse, as in the course of fighting the good fight of faith.

according to--in accordance wit,h, what might be expected from.

working--Greek, "the energizing"; translate, "the effectual working"
([Eph 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007).md). The same superhuman power
was needed and exerted to make us believe, as was needed and exerted to
raise Christ from the dead ([Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md). Compare [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md), "the power of His resurrection"
([Col 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md).

of his mighty power--Greek, "of the strength of His might."

[Ephesians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 1:20</span></span>

in Christ--as our "first-fruits" of the resurrection, and Head, in
virtue of God's mighty working in whom His power to us-ward is made
possible and actual \[ALFORD\].

when he raised him--"in that He raised Him." The raising of Christ is
not only an earnest of our bodies being hereafter raised, but has a
spiritual power in it involving (by virtue of our living union with Him,
as members with the Head) the resurrection, spiritually of the
believer's soul now, and, consequently, of his body hereafter ([Rom
6:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md). The Son, too, as God (though
not as man), had a share in raising His own human body ([Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md); [Joh
10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#017).md). Also the Holy Spirit ([Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018).md).

set him--Greek, "made Him sit." The glorious spirits stand about the
throne of God, but they do not sit at God's right hand ([Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013).md).

at his own right hand-- ([Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md).
Where He remains till all His enemies have been put under His feet ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md). Being appointed to "rule in
the midst of His enemies" during their rebellion ([Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002).md), He shall resign His commission
after their subjection \[PEARSON\] ([Mar
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md); [Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md); [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md).

in the heavenly places-- ([Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).md).
As Christ has a literal body, heaven is not merely a state, but a place;
and where He is, there His people shall be ([Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).md).

[Ephesians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 1:21</span></span>

Greek, "Far (or high) above all ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010).md) principality (or rule, [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md), and authority, and power ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018)), and dominion (or lordship.md)."
Compare [Phi 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md). Evil spirits (who are similarly
divided into various ranks, [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012).md), as well as angels of light, and
earthly potentates, are included (compare [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038).md). Jesus is "King of kings, and
Lord of lords" ([Rev 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016).md). The
higher is His honor, the greater is that of His people, who are His
members joined to Him, the Head. Some philosophizing teachers of the
school of Simon Magus, in Western Asia Minor, had, according to IRENÃ†US
and EPIPHANIUS, taught their hearers these names of various ranks of
angels. Paul shows that the truest wisdom is to know Christ as reigning
above them all.

every name--every being whatever. "Any other creature" ([Rom
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039).md).

in this world--Greek, "age," that is, the present order of things.
"Things present . . . things to come" ([Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038).md).

that . . . to come--"Names which now we know not, but shall know
hereafter in heaven. We know that the emperor goes before all, though we
cannot enumerate all the satraps and ministers of his court; so we know
that Christ is set above all, although we cannot name them all"
\[BENGEL\].

[Ephesians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 1:22</span></span>

put . . . under--Greek, "put in subjection under" ([Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md); [Co1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027).md).

gave . . . to the church--for her special advantage. The Greek order is
emphatic: "HIM He gave as Head over all things to the Church." Had it
been anyone save HIM, her Head, it would not have been the boon it is to
the Church. But as He is Head over all things who is also her Head (and
she the body), all things are hers ([Co1
3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)). He is OVER ("far above".md) all
things; in contrast to the words, "TO the Church," namely, for her
advantage. The former are subject; the latter is joined with Him in His
dominion over them. "Head" implies not only His dominion, but our union;
therefore, while we look upon Him at the right hand of God, we see
ourselves in heaven ([Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).md). For
the Head and body are not severed by anything intervening, else the body
would cease to be the body, and the Head cease to be the Head \[PEARSON
from CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Ephesians 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 1:23</span></span>

his body--His mystical and spiritual, not literal, body. Not, however,
merely figurative, or metaphorical. He is really, though spiritually,
the Church's Head. His life is her life. She shares His crucifixion and
His consequent glory. He possesses everything, His fellowship with the
Father, His fulness of the Spirit, and His glorified manhood, not merely
for Himself, but for her, who has a membership of His body, of His
flesh, and of His bones ([Eph 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030).md).

fulness--"the filled-up receptacle" \[EADIE\]. The Church is dwelt in
and filled by Christ. She is the receptacle, not of His inherent, but of
His communicated, plenitude of gifts and graces. As His is the "fulness"
([Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md) inherently, so she is His
"fulness" by His impartation of it to her, in virtue of her union to Him
([Eph 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018.md); [Col
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010).md). "The full manifestation of His
being, because penetrated by His life" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\]. She is
the continued revelation of His divine life in human form; the fullest
representative of His plenitude. Not the angelic hierarchy, as false
teachers taught ([Col 2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md), [Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md), but Christ Himself is the
"fulness of the Godhead," and she represents Him. KOPPE translates less
probably, "the whole universal multitude."

filleth all in all--Christ as the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of
the world, constituted by God ([Col
1:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md), fills all the universe of
things with all things. "Fills all creation with whatever it possesses"
\[ALFORD\]. The Greek is, "filleth for Himself."
