### [1 Chronicles Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 23:1</span></span>

DAVID MAKES SOLOMON KING. ([Ch1 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#001).md)

when David was old . . . he made Solomon . . . king--This brief
statement, which comprises the substance of 1Ki. 1:32-48, is made here
solely to introduce an account of the preparations carried on by David
during the latter years of his life for providing a national place of
worship.

[1 Chronicles 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 23:2</span></span>

NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE LEVITES. ([Ch1
23:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#002).md)

he gathered together all the princes of Israel--All important measures
relating to the public interest were submitted for consideration to a
general assembly of the representatives of the tribes ([Ch1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001.md); [Ch1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025.md); [Ch1
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#017); 1Ch. 26:1-32.md).

[1 Chronicles 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 23:3</span></span>

the Levites were numbered . . . thirty and eight thousand--Four times
their number at the early census taken by Moses (see on Num. 4:1-49;
Num. 26:1-51). It was, in all likelihood, this vast increase that
suggested and rendered expedient that classification, made in the last
year of David's reign, which the present and three subsequent chapters
describe.

by their polls, man by man--Women and children were not included.

[1 Chronicles 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 23:4</span></span>

twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of
the Lord--They were not to preside over all the services of the temple.
The Levites were subject to the priests, and they were superior to the
Nethinim and other servants, who were not of the race of Levi. But they
had certain departments of duty assigned, some of which are here
specified.

[1 Chronicles 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 23:5</span></span>

praised the Lord with the instruments which I made--David seems to have
been an inventor of many of the musical instruments used in the temple
([Amo 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005).md).

[1 Chronicles 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 23:6</span></span>

David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi--These are
enumerated according to their fathers' houses, but no more of these are
mentioned here than the twenty-four thousand who were engaged in the
work connected with the Lord's house. The fathers' houses of those
Levites corresponded with the classes into which they \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities\] as well as the priests were divided (see on [Ch1
24:20-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#020.md); [Ch1
26:20-28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#020).md).

[1 Chronicles 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 23:7</span></span>

SONS OF GERSHON. ([Ch1 23:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#007).md)

the Gershonites--They had nine fathers' houses, six descended from
Laadan, and three from Shimei.

[1 Chronicles 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 23:12</span></span>

OF KOHATH. ([Ch1 23:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#012).md)

The sons of Kohath--He was the founder of nine Levitical fathers'
houses.

[1 Chronicles 23:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 23:13</span></span>

Aaron was separated--as high priest (see on 1Ch. 25:1-19).

[1 Chronicles 23:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 23:14</span></span>

concerning Moses--His sons were ranked with the Levites generally, but
not introduced into the distinctive portion of the descendants of Levi,
who were appointed to the special functions of the priesthood.

[1 Chronicles 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 23:21</span></span>

OF MERARI. ([Ch1 23:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#021).md)

The sons of Merari--They comprised six fathers' houses. Summing them
together, Gershon founded nine fathers houses, Kohath nine, and Merari
six: total, twenty-four.

[1 Chronicles 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 23:24</span></span>

OFFICE OF THE LEVITES. ([Ch1 23:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#024).md)

These were the sons of Levi . . . that did the work . . . from the age
of twenty years and upward--The enumeration of the Levites was made by
David ([Ch1 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#003).md) on the same rule as
that followed by Moses ([Num 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#003).md),
namely, from thirty years. But he saw afterwards that this rule might be
beneficially relaxed, and that the enrolment of Levites for their proper
duties might be made from twenty years of age. The ark and tabernacle
being now stationary at Jerusalem, the labor of the Levites was greatly
diminished, as they were no longer obliged to transport its heavy
furniture from place to place. The number of thirty-eight thousand
Levites, exclusive of priests, was doubtless more than sufficient for
the ordinary service of the tabernacle. But this pious king thought that
it would contribute to the glory of the Lord to employ as many officers
in his divine service as possible. These first rules, however, which
David instituted, were temporary, as very different arrangements were
made after the ark had been deposited in the tabernacle of Zion.
