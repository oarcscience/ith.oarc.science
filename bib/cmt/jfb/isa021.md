### [Isaiah Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001)

[Isaiah 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 21:1</span></span>

REPETITION OF THE ASSURANCE GIVEN IN THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH
CHAPTERS TO THE JEWS ABOUT TO BE CAPTIVES IN BABYLON, THAT THEIR ENEMY
SHOULD BE DESTROYED AND THEY BE DELIVERED. ([Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001))

desert--the champaign between Babylon and Persia; it was once a desert,
and it was to become so again.

of the sea--The plain was covered with the water of the Euphrates like a
"sea" ([Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013), [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036); so [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015), the Nile), until Semiramis
raised great dams against it. Cyrus removed these dykes, and so
converted the whole country again into a vast desert marsh.

whirlwinds in the south-- ([Job 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#009);
[Zac 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#014)). The south wind comes upon
Babylon from the deserts of Arabia, and its violence is the greater from
its course being unbroken along the plain ([Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019)).

desert--the plain between Babylon and Persia.

terrible land--Media; to guard against which was the object of Nitocris'
great works \[HERODOTUS, 1.185\]. Compare as to "terrible" applied to a
wilderness, as being full of unknown dangers, [Deu
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#029).

[Isaiah 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 21:2</span></span>

dealeth treacherously--referring to the military stratagem employed by
Cyrus in taking Babylon. It may be translated, "is repaid with
treachery"; then the subject of the verb is Babylon. She is repaid in
her own coin; [Isa 33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001); [Hab
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#008), favor this.

Go up--Isaiah abruptly recites the order which he hears God giving to
the Persians, the instruments of His vengeance ([Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003), [Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017)).

Elam--a province of Persia, the original place of their settlement ([Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022)), east of the Euphrates. The
name "Persia" was not in use until the captivity; it means a "horseman";
Cyrus first trained the Persians in horsemanship. It is a mark of
authenticity that the name is not found before Daniel and Ezekiel
\[BOCHART\].

thereof--the "sighing" caused by Babylon ([Isa
14:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 21:3</span></span>

Isaiah imagines himself among the exiles in Babylon and cannot help
feeling moved by the calamities which come on it. So for Moab ([Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005); [Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011)).

pain--(Compare [Isa 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008); [Eze
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#004), [Eze
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#019); [Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010)).

at the hearing--The Hebrew may mean, "I was so bowed down that I could
not hear; I was so dismayed that I could not see" ([Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002); [Psa
69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023)) \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 21:4</span></span>

panted--"is bewildered" \[BARNES\].

night of my pleasure--The prophet supposes himself one of the banqueters
at Belshazzar's feast, on the night that Babylon was about to be taken
by surprise; hence his expression, "my pleasure" ([Isa
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011); [Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039); Dan. 5:1-31).

[Isaiah 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 21:5</span></span>

Prepare the table--namely, the feast in Babylon; during which Cyrus
opened the dykes made by Semiramis to confine the Euphrates to one
channel and suffered them to overflow the country, so that he could
enter Babylon by the channel of the river. Isaiah first represents the
king ordering the feast to be got ready. The suddenness of the irruption
of the foe is graphically expressed by the rapid turn in the language to
an alarm addressed to the Babylonian princes, "Arise," &c. (compare [Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)). MAURER translates, "They
prepare the table," &c. But see [Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009).

watch in . . . watchtower--rather, "set the watch." This done, they
thought they might feast in entire security. Babylon had many
watchtowers on its walls.

anoint . . . shield--This was done to prevent the leather of the shield
becoming hard and liable to crack. "Make ready for defense"; the mention
of the "shield" alone implies that it is the Babylonian revellers who
are called on to prepare for instant self-defense. HORSLEY translates,
"Grip the oiled shield."

[Isaiah 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 21:6</span></span>

Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth--God's direction to
Isaiah to set a watchman to "declare" what he sees. But as in [Isa
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010), Isaiah himself is represented
as the one who "declared." HORSLEY makes him the "watchman," and
translates, "Come, let him who standeth on the watchtower report what he
seeth."

[Isaiah 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 21:7</span></span>

chariot, &c.--rather, "a body of riders," namely, some riding in pairs
on horses (literally, "pairs of horsemen," that is, two abreast), others
on asses, others on camels (compare [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009); [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006)). "Chariot" is not appropriate to
be joined, as English Version translates, with "asses"; the Hebrew means
plainly in [Isa 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007), as in [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009), "a body of men riding." The
Persians used asses and camels for war \[MAURER\]. HORSLEY translates,
"One drawn in a car, with a pair of riders, drawn by an ass, drawn by a
camel"; Cyrus is the man; the car drawn by a camel and ass yoked
together and driven by two postilions, one on each, is the joint army of
Medes and Persians under their respective leaders. He thinks the more
ancient military cars were driven by men riding on the beasts that drew
them; [Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009) favors this.

[Isaiah 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 21:8</span></span>

A lion--rather, "(The watchman) cried, I am as a lion"; so as is
understood ([Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Psa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001)). The point of comparison to "a
lion" is in [Rev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003), the loudness of
the cry. But here it is rather his vigilance. The lion's eyelids are
short, so that, even when asleep, he seems to be on the watch, awake;
hence he was painted on doors of temples as the symbol of watchfulness,
guarding the place (Hor. Apollo) \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 21:9</span></span>

chariot of men--chariots with men in them; or rather, the same body of
riders, horsemen two abreast, as in [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007) \[MAURER\]. But HORSLEY, "The man
drawn in a car with a pair of riders." The first half of this verse
describes what the watchman sees; the second half, what the watchman
says, in consequence of what he sees. In the interval between [Isa
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#007) and [Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009), the overthrow of Babylon by the
horsemen, or man in the car, is accomplished. The overthrow needed to be
announced to the prophet by the watchman, owing to the great extent of
the city. HERODOTUS (1.131) says that one part of the city was captured
some time before the other received the tidings of it.

answered--not to something said previously, but in reference to the
subject in the mind of the writer, to be collected from the preceding
discourse: proclaimeth ([Job 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#002),
Margin; [Dan 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#026); [Act
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008)).

fallen . . . fallen--The repetition expresses emphasis and certainty
([Psa 92:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#009); [Psa
93:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#003); compare [Jer
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008); [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002)).

images--Bel, Merodach, &c. ([Jer 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002);
[Jer 51:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#044), [Jer
51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052)). The Persians had no images,
temples, or altars, and charged the makers of such with madness
\[HERODOTUS 1.131\]; therefore they dashed the Babylonian "images broken
unto the ground."

[Isaiah 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 21:10</span></span>

my threshing--that is, my people (the Jews) trodden down by Babylon.

corn of my floor--Hebrew, "my son of the floor," that is, my people,
treated as corn laid on the floor for threshing; implying, too, that by
affliction, a remnant (grain) would be separated from the ungodly
(chaff) \[MAURER\]. HORSLEY translates, "O thou object of my unremitting
prophetic pains." See [Isa 28:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027).
Some, from [Jer 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033), make Babylon
the object of the threshing; but Isaiah is plainly addressing his
countrymen, as the next words show, not the Babylonians.

One out of Seir asks, What of the night? Is there a hope of the dawn of
deliverance? Isaiah replies, The morning is beginning to dawn (to us);
but night is also coming (to you). Compare [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007). The Hebrew captives would be
delivered, and taunting Edom punished. If the Idumean wish to ask again,
he may do so; if he wishes an answer of peace for his country, then let
him "return (repent), come" \[BARNES\].

[Isaiah 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 21:11</span></span>

A PROPHECY TO THE IDUMEANS WHO TAUNTED THE AFFLICTED JEWS IN THE
BABYLONISH CAPTIVITY. ([Isa 21:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011))

Dumah--a tribe and region of Ishmael in Arabia ([Gen
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#014); [Ch1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#030)); now called Dumah the Stony,
situated on the confines of Arabia and the Syrian desert; a part put for
the whole of Edom. VITRINGA thinks "Dumah," Hebrew, "silence," is here
used for Idumea, to imply that it was soon to be reduced to silence or
destruction.

Seir--the principal mountain in Idumea, south of the Dead Sea, in
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a. "He calleth" ought to be rather, "There is a call
from Seir."

to me--Isaiah. So the heathen Balak and Ahaziah received oracles from a
Hebrew prophet.

Watchman--the prophet ([Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Jer
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017)), so called, because, like a
watchman on the lookout from a tower, he announces future events which
he sees in prophetic vision ([Hab
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001)).

what of the night--What tidings have you to give as to the state of the
night? Rather, "What remains of the night?" How much of it is past?
\[MAURER\]. "Night" means calamity ([Job
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#010); [Mic
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#006)), which, then, in the wars between
Egypt and Assyria, pressed sore on Edom; or on Judah (if, as BARNES
thinks, the question is asked in mockery of the suffering Jews in
Babylon). The repetition of the question marks, in the former view, the
anxiety of the Idumeans.

[Isaiah 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 21:12</span></span>

Reply of the prophet, The morning (prosperity) cometh, and (soon after
follows) the night (adversity). Though you, Idumeans, may have a gleam
of prosperity, it will soon be followed by adversity again. Otherwise,
as BARNES, "Prosperity cometh (to the Jews) to be quickly followed by
adversity (to you, Idumeans, who exult in the fall of Jerusalem, have
seized on the southern part of their land in their absence during the
captivity, and now deride them by your question)" ([Isa
34:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005)). This view is favored by [Oba
1:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010).

if ye will inquire, inquire--If ye choose to consult me again, do so
(similar phrases occur in [Gen 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014);
[Kg2 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#004); [Est
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016)).

return, come--"Be converted to God (and then), come" \[GESENIUS\]; you
will then receive a more favorable answer.

Probably in the wars between Assyria and Egypt; Idumea and Arabia lay
somewhat on the intermediate line of march.

[Isaiah 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 21:13</span></span>

PROPHECY THAT ARABIA WOULD BE OVERRUN BY A FOREIGN FOE WITHIN A YEAR.
([Isa 21:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#013))

upon--that is, respecting.

forest--not a grove of trees, but a region of thick underwood, rugged
and inaccessible; for Arabia has no forest of trees.

travelling companies--caravans: ye shall be driven through fear of the
foe to unfrequented routes ([Isa 33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008);
[Jdg 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#006); [Jer
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#008) is parallel to this passage).

Dedanim--In North Arabia ([Gen 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003);
[Jer 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023); [Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013); [Eze
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#020); a different "Dedan" occurs [Gen
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 21:14</span></span>

Tema--a kindred tribe: an oasis in that region ([Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023)). The Temeans give water to the
faint and thirsting Dedanites; the greatest act of hospitality in the
burning lands of the East, where water is so scarce.

prevented--that is, anticipated the wants of the fugitive Dedanites by
supplying bread ([Gen 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018)).

their bread--rather, "his (the fugitive's) bread"; the bread due to him,
necessary for his support; so "thy grave" ([Isa
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019)), \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 21:15</span></span>

they--the fugitive Dedanites and other Arabs.

[Isaiah 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 21:16</span></span>

years of . . . hireling--(See on [Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014)).

Kedar--a wandering tribe ([Psa 120:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005)).
North of Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, and south of Arabia-Deserta; put for
Arabia in general.

[Isaiah 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 21:17</span></span>

residue . . . diminished--The remnant of Arab warriors, famous in the
bow, left after the invasion, shall be small.

That by Sennacherib, in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah; [Isa
22:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008), the preparations for defense
and securing of water exactly answer to those in [Ch2
32:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004), [Ch2
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030). "Shebna," too ([Isa
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#015)), was scribe at this time ([Isa
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#003)) \[MAURER\]. The language of [Isa
22:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012), as to the infidelity and
consequent utter ruin of the Jews, seems rather to foreshadow the
destruction by Nebuchadnezzar in Zedekiah's reign, and cannot be
restricted to Hezekiah's time \[LOWTH\].
