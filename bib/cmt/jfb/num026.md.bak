### [Numbers Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

[Numbers 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 26:1</span></span>

ISRAEL NUMBERED. (Num. 26:1-51)

after the plague--That terrible visitation had swept away the remnant of
the old generation, to whom God sware in His wrath that they should not
enter Canaan ([Psa 95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011).md).

[Numbers 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">num 26:2</span></span>

Take the sum of all the congregation--The design of this new census,
after a lapse of thirty-eight years, was primarily to establish the vast
multiplication of the posterity of Abraham in spite of the severe
judgments inflicted upon them; secondarily, it was to preserve the
distinction of families and to make arrangements, preparatory to an
entrance into the promised land, for the distribution of the country
according to the relative population of the tribes.

[Numbers 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">num 26:7</span></span>

These are the families of the Reubenites--the principal households,
which were subdivided into numerous smaller families. Reuben had
suffered great diminution by Korah's conspiracy and other outbreaks
\[[Num 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#001.md)\].

[Numbers 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 26:10</span></span>

the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with
Korah--rather, "the things of Korah." (See on [Num
16:35](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#035.md); compare [Psa
106:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#017).md).

[Numbers 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 26:11</span></span>

Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not--Either they were not
parties to their father's crime, or they withdrew from it by timely
repentance. His descendants became famous in the time of David, and are
often mentioned in the Psalms \[[Psa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md); [Psa
44:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#001.md); [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001.md); [Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001.md); [Psa
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md); [Psa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md); [Psa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md); [Psa
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md); [Psa
85:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#001.md); [Psa
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md); [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md)\], also in [Ch1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#022.md), [Ch1
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#038.md).

[Numbers 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 26:12</span></span>

The sons of Simeon--It is supposed that this tribe had been pre-eminent
in the guilt of Baal-peor and had consequently been greatly reduced in
numbers.

Thus God's justice and holiness, as well as His truth and faithfulness,
were strikingly displayed: His justice and holiness in the sweeping
judgments that reduced the ranks of some tribes; and His truth and
faithfulness in the extraordinary increase of others so that the
posterity of Israel continued a numerous people.

[Numbers 26:53](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">num 26:53</span></span>

the land shall be divided according to the number of names--The portion
of each tribe was to be greater or less, according to its populousness.

[Numbers 26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">num 26:54</span></span>

To many thou shalt give the more inheritance--that is, to the more
numerous tribes a larger allotment shall be granted.

according to those that were numbered--the number of persons twenty
years old at the time of the census being made, without taking into
account either the increase of those who might have attained that age,
when the land should be actually distributed, or the diminution from
that amount, occasioned during the war of invasion.

[Numbers 26:55](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">num 26:55</span></span>

the land shall be divided by lot--The appeal to the lot did not place
the matter beyond the control of God; for it is at His disposal ([Pro
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033).md), and He has fixed to all the
bounds of their habitation. The manner in which the lot was taken has
not been recorded. But it is evident that the lot was cast for
determining the section of the country in which each tribe should be
located--not the quantity of their possessions. In other words, when the
lot had decided that a particular tribe was to be settled in the north
or the south, the east or the west, the extent of territory was
allocated according to the rule ([Num
26:54](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#054).md).

[Numbers 26:58](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">num 26:58</span></span>

families of the Levites--The census of this tribe was taken separately,
and on a different principle from the rest. (See [Exo
6:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#016).md).

[Numbers 26:62](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">num 26:62</span></span>

twenty and three thousand--so that there was an increase of a thousand
([Num 3:39](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#039).md).

males from a month old and upward--(See on [Num
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#014).md).

[Numbers 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">num 26:64</span></span>

among these there was not a man . . . numbered . . . in the wilderness
of Sinai--The statement in this verse must not be considered absolute.
For, besides Caleb and Joshua, there were alive at this time Eleazar and
Ithamar, and in all probability a considerable number of Levites, who
had no participation in the popular defections in the wilderness. The
tribe of Levi, having neither sent a spy into Canaan, nor being included
in the enumeration at Sinai, must be regarded as not coming within the
range of the fatal sentence; and therefore it would exhibit a spectacle
not to be witnessed in the other tribes of many in their ranks above
sixty years of age.
