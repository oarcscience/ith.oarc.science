### [Psalms Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 30:1</span></span>

Literally, "A Psalm-Song"--a composition to be sung with musical
instruments, or without them--or, "Song of the dedication," &c.
specifying the particular character of the Psalm. Some suppose that of
David should be connected with the name of the composition, and not with
"house"; and refer for the occasion to the selection of a site for the
temple ([Ch1 21:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#026.md); [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001).md). But "house" is never used
absolutely for the temple, and "dedication" does not well apply to such
an occasion. Though the phrase in the Hebrew, "dedication of the house
of David," is an unusual form, yet it is equally unusual to disconnect
the name of the author and the composition. As a "dedication of David's
house" (as provided, [Deu 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#005).md), the
scope of the Psalm well corresponds with the state of repose and
meditation on his past trials suited to such an occasion ([Sa2
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#011.md); [Sa2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#002).md). For beginning with a celebration
of God's delivering favor, in which he invites others to join, he
relates his prayer in distress, and God's gracious and prompt answer.
([Psa 30:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001).md)

lifted me up--as one is drawn from a well ([Psa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 30:2</span></span>

healed me--Affliction is often described as disease ([Psa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002.md); [Psa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md); [Psa
107:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#020).md), and so relief by healing.

[Psalms 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 30:3</span></span>

The terms describe extreme danger.

soul--or, "myself."

grave--literally, "hell," as in [Psa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md).

hast kept me . . . pit--quickened or revived me from the state of dying
(compare [Psa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 30:4</span></span>

remembrance--the thing remembered or memorial.

holiness--as the sum of God's perfections (compare [Psa
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003).md), used as name ([Exo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#015.md); [Psa
135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 30:5</span></span>

Relatively, the longest experience of divine anger by the pious is
momentary. These precious words have consoled millions.

[Psalms 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 30:6</span></span>

What particular prosperity is meant we do not know; perhaps his
accession to the throne. In his self-complacent elation he was checked
by God's hiding His face (compare [Psa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md); [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 30:7</span></span>

troubled--confounded with fear ([Psa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 30:8</span></span>

As in [Psa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md); [Psa
88:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#010.md); [Isa
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#018.md), the appeal for mercy is based
on the destruction of his agency in praising God here, which death would
produce. The terms expressing relief are poetical, and not to be
pressed, though "dancing" is the translation of a word which means a
lute, whose cheerful notes are contrasted with mourning, or ([Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016).md) wailing.

[Psalms 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 30:11</span></span>

sackcloth--was used, even by kings, in distress ([Ch1
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#016.md); [Isa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#001).md) but "gladness," used for a
garment, shows the language to be figurative.

[Psalms 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 30:12</span></span>

Though "my" is supplied before "glory" it is better as in [Psa
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md), to receive it as used for
tongue, the organ of praise. The ultimate end of God's mercies to us is
our praise to Him.
