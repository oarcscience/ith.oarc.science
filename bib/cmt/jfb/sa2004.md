### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa2 4:4</span></span>

BAANAH AND RECHAB SLAY ISH-BOSHETH, AND BRING HIS HEAD TO HEBRON. ([Sa2
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#001))

Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet--This is
mentioned as a reason why, according to Oriental notions, he was
considered unfit for exercising the duties of sovereignty.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 4:5</span></span>

Rechab and Baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house
of Ish-bosheth, &c.--It is still a custom in the East to allow their
soldiers a certain quantity of corn, together with some pay; and these
two captains very naturally went to the palace the day before to fetch
wheat, in order to distribute it to the soldiers, that it might be sent
to the mill at the accustomed hour in the morning.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 4:7</span></span>

when they came into the house, he lay on his bed--Rechab and Baanah came
in the heat of the day, when they knew that Ish-bosheth, their master,
would be resting on his divan; and as it was necessary, for the reason
just given, to have the corn the day before it was needed, their coming
at that time, though it might be a little earlier than usual, created no
suspicion, and attracted no notice \[HARMER\].

gat them away through the plain--that is, the valley of the Jordan,
through which their way lay from Mahanaim to Hebron.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 4:8</span></span>

They brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David . . . and said, Behold
the head of Ish-bosheth--Such bloody trophies of rebels and conspirators
have always been acceptable to princes in the East, and the carriers
have been liberally rewarded. Ish-bosheth being a usurper, the two
assassins thought they were doing a meritorious service to David by
removing the only existing obstacle to the union of the two kingdoms.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 4:12</span></span>

DAVID CAUSES THEM TO BE PUT TO DEATH. ([Sa2
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010))

slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet--as the instruments in
perpetrating their crime. The exposure of the mutilated remains was
intended as not only a punishment of their crime, but also the
attestation of David's abhorrence.
