### [Matthew Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 3:1</span></span>

PREACHING AND MINISTRY OF JOHN. ( = [Mar
1:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001); Luke 3:1-18.md). ([Mat
3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001).md)

In those days--of Christ's secluded life at Nazareth, where the last
chapter left Him.

came John the Baptist, preaching--about six months before his Master.

in the wilderness of Judea--the desert valley of the Jordan, thinly
peopled and bare in pasture, a little north of Jerusalem.

[Matthew 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 3:2</span></span>

And saying, Repent ye--Though the word strictly denotes a change of
mind, it has respect here (and wherever it is used in connection with
salvation) primarily to that sense of sin which leads the sinner to flee
from the wrath to come, to look for relief only from above, and eagerly
to fall in with the provided remedy.

for the kingdom of heaven is at hand--This sublime phrase, used in none
of the other Gospels, occurs in this peculiarly Jewish Gospel nearly
thirty times; and being suggested by Daniel's grand vision of the Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven to the Ancient of days, to receive
His investiture in a world-wide kingdom ([Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md), it was fitted at once both
to meet the national expectations and to turn them into the right
channel. A kingdom for which repentance was the proper preparation
behooved to be essentially spiritual. Deliverance from sin, the great
blessing of Christ's kingdom ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021).md), can be valued by those only to
whom sin is a burden ([Mat 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012).md).
John's great work, accordingly, was to awaken this feeling and hold out
the hope of a speedy and precious remedy.

[Matthew 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 3:3</span></span>

For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying-- ([Mat
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003).md).

The voice of one crying in the wilderness--(See on [Luk
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002).md); the scene of his ministry
corresponding to its rough nature.

Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight--This prediction
is quoted in all the four Gospels, showing that it was regarded as a
great outstanding one, and the predicted forerunner as the connecting
link between the old and the new economies. Like the great ones of the
earth, the Prince of peace was to have His immediate approach proclaimed
and His way prepared; and the call here--taking it generally--is a call
to put out of the way whatever would obstruct His progress and hinder
His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were public or personal,
outward or inward. In Luke ([Luk
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005).md) the quotation is thus
continued: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation
of God." Levelling and smoothing are here the obvious figures whose
sense is conveyed in the first words of the proclamation--"Prepare ye
the way of the Lord." The idea is that every obstruction shall be so
removed as to reveal to the whole world the salvation of God in Him
whose name is the "Saviour." (Compare [Psa
98:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#003.md); [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006.md); [Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md); [Luk
2:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#031.md); [Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047).md).

[Matthew 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 3:4</span></span>

And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair--woven of it.

and a leathern girdle about his loins--the prophetic dress of Elijah
([Kg2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#008.md); and see [Zac
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004).md).

and his meat was locusts--the great, well-known Eastern locust, a food
of the poor ([Lev 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#022).md).

and wild honey--made by wild bees ([Sa1
14:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025).md). This dress and diet, with
the shrill cry in the wilderness, would recall the stern days of Elijah.

[Matthew 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 3:5</span></span>

Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round
about Jordan--From the metropolitan center to the extremities of the
Judean province the cry of this great preacher of repentance and herald
of the approaching Messiah brought trooping penitents and eager
expectants.

[Matthew 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 3:6</span></span>

And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins--probably
confessing aloud. This baptism was at once a public seal of their felt
need of deliverance from sin, of their expectation of the coming
Deliverer, and of their readiness to welcome Him when He appeared. The
baptism itself startled, and was intended to startle, them. They were
familiar enough with the baptism of proselytes from heathenism; but this
baptism of Jews themselves was quite new and strange to them.

[Matthew 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 3:7</span></span>

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism,
he said unto them--astonished at such a spectacle.

O generation of vipers--"Viper brood," expressing the deadly influence
of both sects alike upon the community. Mutually and entirely
antagonistic as were their religious principles and spirit, the stem
prophet charges both alike with being the poisoners of the nation's
religious principles. In [Mat 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034.md);
[Mat 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033.md), this strong language of
the Baptist is anew applied by the faithful and true Witness to the
Pharisees specifically--the only party that had zeal enough actively to
diffuse this poison.

who hath warned you--given you the hint, as the idea is.

to flee from the wrath to come?--"What can have brought you hither?"
John more than suspected it was not so much their own spiritual
anxieties as the popularity of his movement that had drawn them thither.
What an expression is this, "The wrath to come!" God's "wrath," in
Scripture, is His righteous displeasure against sin, and consequently
against all in whose skirts sin is found, arising out of the essential
and eternal opposition of His nature to all moral evil. This is called
"the coming wrath," not as being wholly future--for as a merited
sentence it lies on the sinner already, and its effects, both inward and
outward, are to some extent experienced even now--but because the
impenitent sinner will not, until "the judgment of the great day," be
concluded under it, will not have sentence publicly and irrevocably
passed upon him, will not have it discharged upon him and experience its
effects without mixture and without hope. In this view of it, it is a
wrath wholly to come, as is implied in the noticeably different form of
the expression employed by the apostle in [Th1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#010.md). Not that even true penitents
came to John's baptism with all these views of "the wrath to come." But
what he says is that this was the real import of the step itself. In
this view of it, how striking is the word he employs to express that
step--fleeing from it--as of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath
rolling rapidly towards him, sees in instant flight his only escape!

[Matthew 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 3:8</span></span>

Bring forth therefore fruits--the true reading clearly is "fruit";

meet for repentance--that is, such fruit as befits a true penitent. John
now being gifted with a knowledge of the human heart, like a true
minister of righteousness and lover of souls here directs them how to
evidence and carry out their repentance, supposing it genuine; and in
the following verses warns them of their danger in case it were not.

[Matthew 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 3:9</span></span>

And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
father--that pillow on which the nation so fatally reposed, that rock on
which at length it split.

for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham--that is, "Flatter not yourselves with the fond
delusion that God stands in need of you, to make good His promise of a
seed to Abraham; for I tell you that, though you were all to perish, God
is as able to raise up a seed to Abraham out of those stones as He was
to take Abraham himself out of the rock whence he was hewn, out of the
hole of the pit whence he was digged" ([Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001).md). Though the stem speaker may
have pointed as he spoke to the pebbles of the bare clay hills that lay
around (so STANLEY'S Sinai and Palestine), it was clearly the calling of
the Gentiles at that time stone-dead in their sins, and quite as
unconscious of it--into the room of unbelieving and disinherited Israel
that he meant thus to indicate (see [Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md); [Rom
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md), [Rom
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030).md).

[Matthew 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 3:10</span></span>

And now also--And even already.

the axe is laid unto--"lieth at."

the root of the trees--as it were ready to strike: an expressive figure
of impending judgment, only to be averted in the way next described.

therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
and cast into the fire--Language so personal and individual as this can
scarcely be understood of any national judgment like the approaching
destruction of Jerusalem, with the breaking up of the Jewish polity and
the extrusion of the chosen people from their peculiar privileges which
followed it; though this would serve as the dark shadow, cast before, of
a more terrible retribution to come. The "fire," which in another verse
is called "unquenchable," can be no other than that future "torment" of
the impenitent whose "smoke ascendeth up for ever and ever," and which
by the Judge Himself is styled "everlasting punishment" ([Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046).md). What a strength, too, of just
indignation is in that word "cast" or "flung into the fire!"

The third Gospel here adds the following important particulars in [Luk
3:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md).

[Luk 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#010.md) :

And the people--the multitudes.

asked him, saying, What shall we do then?--that is, to show the
sincerity of our repentance.

[Luk 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#011.md) :

He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart
to him that hath none; and he that hath meat--provisions, victuals.

let him do likewise--This is directed against the reigning avarice and
selfishness. (Compare the corresponding precepts of the Sermon on the
Mount, [Mat 5:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#040).md).

[Luk 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#012.md) :

Then came also the publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
Master--Teacher.

what shall we do?--In what special way is the genuineness of our
repentance to be manifested?

[Luk 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#013.md) :

And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
you--This is directed against that extortion which made the publicans a
byword. (See on [Mat 5:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md); [Luk
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001).md).

[Luk 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014.md) :

And the soldiers--rather, "And soldiers"--the word means "soldiers on
active duty."

likewise demanded--asked.

of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence
to no man--Intimidate. The word signifies to "shake thoroughly," and
refers probably to the extorting of money or other property.

neither accuse any falsely--by acting as informers vexatiously on
frivolous or false pretexts.

and be content with your wages--or "rations." We may take this, say
WEBSTER and WILKINSON, as a warning against mutiny, which the officers
attempted to suppress by largesses and donations. And thus the "fruits"
which would evidence their repentance were just resistance to the
reigning sins--particularly of the class to which the penitent
belonged--and the manifestation of an opposite spirit.

[Luk 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#015.md) :

And as the people were in expectation--in a state of excitement, looking
for something new

and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ,
or not--rather, "whether he himself might be the Christ." The structure
of this clause implies that they could hardly think it, but yet could
not help asking themselves whether it might not be; showing both how
successful he had been in awakening the expectation of Messiah's
immediate appearing, and the high estimation and even reverence, which
his own character commanded.

[Luk 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016.md) :

John answered--either to that deputation from Jerusalem, of which we
read in [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md), &c., or on some
other occasion, to remove impressions derogatory to his blessed Master,
which he knew to be taking hold of the popular mind.

saying unto them all--in solemn protestation.

(We now return to the first Gospel.)

[Matthew 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 3:11</span></span>

I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance--(See on [Mat
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006).md);

but he that cometh after me is mightier than I--In Mark and Luke this is
more emphatic--"But there cometh the Mightier than I" ([Mar
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#007.md); [Luk
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016).md).

whose shoes--sandals.

I am not worthy to bear--The sandals were tied and untied, and borne
about by the meanest servants.

he shall baptize you--the emphatic "He": "He it is," to the exclusion of
all others, "that shall baptize you."

with the Holy Ghost--"So far from entertaining such a thought as laying
claim to the honors of Messiahship, the meanest services I can render to
that "Mightier than I that is coming after me" are too high an honor for
me; I am but the servant, but the Master is coming; I administer but the
outward symbol of purification; His it is, as His sole prerogative, to
dispense the inward reality. Beautiful spirit, distinguishing this
servant of Christ throughout!

and with fire--To take this as a distinct baptism from that of the
Spirit--a baptism of the impenitent with hell-fire--is exceedingly
unnatural. Yet this was the view of ORIGEN among the Fathers; and among
moderns, of NEANDER, MEYER, DE WETTE, and LANGE. Nor is it much better
to refer it to the fire of the great day, by which the earth and the
works that are therein shall be burned up. Clearly, as we think, it is
but the fiery character of the Spirit's operations upon the
soul-searching, consuming, refining, sublimating--as nearly all good
interpreters understand the words. And thus, in two successive clauses,
the two most familiar emblems--water and fire--are employed to set forth
the same purifying operations of the Holy Ghost upon the soul.

[Matthew 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 3:12</span></span>

Whose fan--winnowing fan.

is in his hand--ready for use. This is no other than the preaching of
the Gospel, even now beginning, the effect of which would be to separate
the solid from the spiritually worthless, as wheat, by the winnowing
fan, from the chaff. (Compare the similar representation in [Mal
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

and he will throughly purge his floor--threshing-floor; that is, the
visible Church.

and gather his wheat--His true-hearted saints; so called for their solid
worth (compare [Amo 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md); [Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031).md).

into the garner--"the kingdom of their Father," as this "garner" or
"barn" is beautifully explained by our Lord in the parable of the wheat
and the tares ([Mat 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#030.md), [Mat
13:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043).md).

but he will burn up the chaff--empty, worthless professors of religion,
void of all solid religious principle and character (see [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004).md).

with unquenchable fire--Singular is the strength of this apparent
contradiction of figures:--to be burnt up, but with a fire that is
unquenchable; the one expressing the utter destruction of all that
constitutes one's true life, the other the continued consciousness of
existence in that awful condition.

Luke adds the following important particulars ([Luk
3:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#018).md) :

[Luk 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#018.md) :

And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people--showing that we have here but an abstract of his teaching.
Besides what we read in [Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md),
[Joh 1:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md); [Joh
3:27-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027.md), the incidental allusion to
his having taught his disciples to pray ([Luk
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#001).md) --of which not a word is said
elsewhere--shows how varied his teaching was.

[Luk 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#019.md) :

But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother
Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done--In this last
clause we have an important fact, here only mentioned, showing how
thoroughgoing was the fidelity of the Baptist to his royal hearer, and
how strong must have been the workings of conscience in that slave of
passion when, notwithstanding such plainness, he "did many things, and
heard John gladly" ([Mar 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020).md).

[Luk 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#020.md) :

Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison--This
imprisonment of John, however, did not take place for some time after
this; and it is here recorded merely because the Evangelist did not
intend to recur to his history till he had occasion to relate the
message which he sent to Christ from his prison at MachÃ&brvbr;rus ([Luk
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#018), &c..md).

[Matthew 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 3:13</span></span>

BAPTISM OF CHRIST AND DESCENT OF THE SPIRIT UPON HIM IMMEDIATELY
THEREAFTER. ( = [Mar 1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#009.md); [Luk
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021.md); [Joh
1:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031).md). ([Mat
3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#013).md)

Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of
him--Moses rashly anticipated the divine call to deliver his people, and
for this was fain to flee the house of bondage, and wait in obscurity
for forty years more ([Exo 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#011), &c..md).
Not so this greater than Moses. All but thirty years had He now spent in
privacy at Nazareth, gradually ripening for His public work, and calmly
awaiting the time appointed of the Father. Now it had arrived; and this
movement from Galilee to Jordan is the step, doubtless, of deepest
interest to all heaven since that first one which brought Him into the
world. Luke ([Luk 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021).md) has this
important addition--"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to
pass, that Jesus being baptized," &c.--implying that Jesus waited till
all other applicants for baptism that day had been disposed of, ere He
stepped forward, that He might not seem to be merely one of the crowd.
Thus, as He rode into Jerusalem upon an ass "whereon yet never man sat"
([Luk 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#030).md), and lay in a sepulchre
"wherein was never man yet laid" ([Joh
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#041).md), so in His baptism, too. He
would be "separate from sinners."

[Matthew 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mat 3:14</span></span>

But John forbade him--rather, "was (in the act of) hindering him," or
"attempting to hinder him."

saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?--(How
John came to recognize Him, when he says he knew Him not, see [Joh
1:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#031).md). The emphasis of this most
remarkable speech lies all in the pronouns: "What! Shall the Master come
for baptism to the servant--the sinless Saviour to a sinner?" That thus
much is in the Baptist's words will be clearly seen if it be observed
that he evidently regarded Jesus as Himself needing no purification but
rather qualified to impart it to those who did. And do not all his other
testimonies to Christ fully bear out this sense of the words? But it
were a pity if, in the glory of this testimony to Christ, we should miss
the beautiful spirit in which it was borne--"Lord, must I baptize Thee?
Can I bring myself to do such a thing?"--reminding us of Peter's
exclamation at the supper table, "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?" while
it has nothing of the false humility and presumption which dictated
Peter's next speech. "Thou shall never wash my feet" ([Joh
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#006.md), [Joh
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008).md).

[Matthew 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 3:15</span></span>

And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now--"Let it pass
for the present"; that is, "Thou recoilest, and no wonder, for the
seeming incongruity is startling; but in the present case do as thou art
bidden."

for thus it becometh us--"us," not in the sense of me and thee," or "men
in general," but as in [Joh 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md).

to fulfil all righteousness--If this be rendered, with SCRIVENER, "every
ordinance," or, with CAMPBELL, "every institution," the meaning is
obvious enough; and the same sense is brought out by "all
righteousness," or compliance with everything enjoined, baptism
included. Indeed, if this be the meaning, our version perhaps best
brings out the force of the opening word "Thus." But we incline to think
that our Lord meant more than this. The import of circumcision and of
baptism seems to be radically the same. And if our remarks on the
circumcision of our Lord (see on [Luk
2:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021).md) are well founded, He would
seem to have said, "Thus do I impledge Myself to the whole righteousness
of the Law--thus symbolically do enter on and engage to fulfil it all."
Let the thoughtful reader weigh this.

Then he suffered him--with true humility, yielding to higher authority
than his own impressions of propriety.

Descent of the Spirit upon the Baptized Redeemer ([Mat
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016).md).

[Matthew 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 3:16</span></span>

And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
water--rather, "from the water." Mark has "out of the water" ([Mar
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010).md). "and"--adds Luke ([Luk
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#021).md), "while He was praying"; a grand
piece of information. Can there be a doubt about the burden of that
prayer; a prayer sent up, probably, while yet in the water--His blessed
head suffused with the baptismal element; a prayer continued likely as
He stepped out of the stream, and again stood upon the dry ground; the
work before Him, the needed and expected Spirit to rest upon Him for it,
and the glory He would then put upon the Father that sent Him--would not
these fill His breast, and find silent vent in such form as this?--"Lo,
I come; I delight to do Thy will, O God. Father, glorify Thy name. Show
Me a token for good. Let the Spirit of the Lord God come upon Me, and I
will preach the Gospel to the poor, and heal the broken-hearted, and
send forth judgment unto victory." While He was yet speaking--

lo, the heavens were opened--Mark says, sublimely, "He saw the heavens
cleaving" ([Mar 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010).md).

and he saw the Spirit of God descending--that is, He only, with the
exception of His honored servant, as he tells us himself ([Joh
1:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032).md); the by-standers apparently

like a dove, and lighting upon him--Luke says, "in a bodily shape" ([Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022).md); that is, the blessed Spirit,
assuming the corporeal form of a dove, descended thus upon His sacred
head. But why in this form? The Scripture use of this emblem will be our
best guide here. "My dove, my undefiled is one," says the Song of
Solomon ([Sol 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#009).md). This is chaste
purity. Again, "Be ye harmless as doves," says Christ Himself ([Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016).md). This is the same thing, in the
form of inoffensiveness towards men. "A conscience void of offense
toward God and toward men" ([Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016).md) expresses both. Further, when
we read in the Song of Solomon ([Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014).md), "O my dove, that art in the
clefts of the rocks, in the secret places of the stairs (see [Isa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008).md), let me see thy countenance, let
me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
comely"--it is shrinking modesty, meekness, gentleness, that is thus
charmingly depicted. In a word--not to allude to the historical emblem
of the dove that flew back to the ark, bearing in its mouth the olive
leaf of peace ([Gen 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011).md) --when we
read ([Psa 68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013).md), "Ye shall be as the
wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold,"
it is beauteousness that is thus held forth. And was not such that
"holy, harmless, undefiled One," the "separate from sinners?" "Thou art
fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips;
therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever!" But the fourth Gospel gives
us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw
and testified of it: "John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit
descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM." And lest we
should think that this was an accidental thing, he adds that this last
particular was expressly given him as part of the sign by which he was
to recognize and identify Him as the Son of God: "And I knew Him not:
but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending AND REMAINING ON HIM, the same
is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw and bare record
that this is the Son of God" ([Joh
1:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032).md). And when with this we
compare the predicted descent of the Spirit upon Messiah ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md), "And the Spirit of the Lord
shall rest upon Him," we cannot doubt that it was this permanent and
perfect resting of the Holy Ghost upon the Son of God--now and
henceforward in His official capacity--that was here visibly manifested.

And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is--Mark and Luke give it in
the direct form, "Thou art." ([Mar
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#011.md); [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022).md).

my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased--The verb is put in the aorist
to express absolute complacency, once and for ever felt towards Him. The
English here, at least to modern ears, is scarcely strong enough. "I
delight" comes the nearest, perhaps, to that ineffable complacency which
is manifestly intended; and this is the rather to be preferred, as it
would immediately carry the thoughts back to that august Messianic
prophecy to which the voice from heaven plainly alluded ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md), "Behold My Servant, whom I
uphold; Mine Elect, IN WHOM MY SOUL DELIGHTETH." Nor are the words which
follow to be overlooked, "I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring
forth judgment to the Gentiles." (The Septuagint perverts this, as it
does most of the Messianic predictions, interpolating the word "Jacob,"
and applying it to the Jews). Was this voice heard by the by-standers?
From Matthew's form of it, one might suppose it so designed; but it
would appear that it was not, and probably John only heard and saw
anything peculiar about that great baptism. Accordingly, the words,
"Hear ye Him," are not added, as at the Transfiguration.
