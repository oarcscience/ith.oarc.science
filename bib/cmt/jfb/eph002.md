### [Ephesians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

[Ephesians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 2:1</span></span>

GOD'S LOVE AND GRACE IN QUICKENING US, ONCE DEAD, THROUGH CHRIST. HIS
PURPOSE IN DOING SO: EXHORTATION BASED ON OUR PRIVILEGES AS BUILT
TOGETHER, AN HOLY TEMPLE, IN CHRIST, THROUGH THE SPIRIT. (Eph. 2:1-22)

And you--"You also," among those who have experienced His mighty power
in enabling them to believe ([Eph
1:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019).md).

hath he quickened--supplied from the Greek ([Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md).

dead--spiritually. ([Col 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013).md). A
living corpse: without the gracious presence of God's Spirit in the
soul, and so unable to think, will, or do aught that is holy.

in trespasses . . . sins--in them, as the element in which the
unbeliever is, and through which he is dead to the true life. Sin is the
death of the soul. [Isa 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md); [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025), "dead" (spiritually.md), [Ti1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md). "Alienated from the life of God"
([Eph 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018).md). Translate, as Greek, "in
your trespasses," &c. "Trespass" in Greek, expresses a FALL or LAPSE,
such as the transgression of Adam whereby he fell. "Sin." (Greek,
"hamartia") implies innate corruption and ALIENATION from God
(literally, erring of the mind from the rule of truth), exhibited in
acts of sin (Greek, "hamartemata"). BENGEL, refers "trespasses" to the
Jews who had the law, and yet revolted from it; "sins," to the Gentiles
who know not God.

[Ephesians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 2:2</span></span>

the course of this world--the career (literally, "the age," compare [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004).md), or present system of this world
([Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md); [Co1
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md), as opposed to "the world to
come"): alien from God, and lying in the wicked one ([Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md). "The age" (which is something
more external and ethical) regulates "the world" (which is something
more external).

the prince of the power of the air--the unseen God who lies underneath
guiding "the course of this world" ([Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).md); ranging through the air around
us: compare [Mar 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#004.md), "fowls of the
air" (Greek, "heaven") that is, ([Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).md), "Satan" and his demons. Compare
[Eph 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md). Christ's ascension seems to
have cast Satan out of heaven ([Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md), [Rev
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md), [Rev
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012).md), where he had been
heretofore the accuser of the brethren ([Job
1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006).md). No longer able to accuse in
heaven those justified by Christ, the ascended Saviour ([Rom
8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md), he assails them on earth
with all trials and temptations; and "we live in an atmosphere poisonous
and impregnated with deadly elements. But a mighty purification of the
air will be effected by Christ's coming" \[AUBERLEN\], for Satan shall
be bound ([Rev 12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md), [Rev
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015.md), [Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md); [Rev
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002).md). "The power" is here used
collectively for the "powers of the air"; in apposition with which
"powers" stand the "spirits," comprehended in the singular, "the
spirit," taken also collectively: the aggregate of the "seducing
spirits" ([Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001).md) which "work now
(still; not merely, as in your case, 'in time past') in the sons of
disobedience" (a Hebraism: men who are not merely by accident
disobedient, but who are essentially sons of disobedience itself:
compare [Mat 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007).md), and of which Satan
is here declared to be "the prince." The Greek does not allow "the
spirit" to refer to Satan, "the prince" himself, but to "the powers of
the air" of which he is prince. The powers of the air are the embodiment
of that evil "spirit" which is the ruling principle of unbelievers,
especially the heathen ([Act 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md),
as opposed to the spirit of the children of God ([Luk
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#033).md). The potency of that "spirit" is
shown in the "disobedience" of the former. Compare [Deu
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#020.md), "children in whom is no faith"
([Isa 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#009.md); [Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md). They disobey the Gospel both in
faith and practice ([Th2 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md); [Co2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012).md).

[Ephesians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 2:3</span></span>

also we--that is, we also. Paul here joins himself in the same category
with them, passing from the second person ([Eph
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001).md) to the first person here.

all--Jews and Gentiles.

our conversation--"our way of life" ([Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md). This expression implies an
outwardly more decorous course, than the open "walk" in gross sins on
the part of the majority of Ephesians in times past, the Gentile portion
of whom may be specially referred to in [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md). Paul and his Jewish countrymen,
though outwardly more seemly than the Gentiles ([Act
26:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md), [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018).md), had been essentially like them
in living to the unrenewed flesh, without the Spirit of God.

fulfilling--Greek, doing.

mind--Greek, "our thoughts." Mental suggestions and purposes
(independent of God), as distinguished from the blind impulses of "the
flesh."

and were by nature--He intentionally breaks off the construction,
substituting "and we were" for "and being," to mark emphatically his and
their past state by nature, as contrasted with their present state by
grace. Not merely is it, we had our way of life fulfilling our fleshly
desires, and so being children of wrath; but we were by nature
originally "children of wrath," and so consequently had our way of life
fulfilling our fleshly desires. "Nature," in Greek, implies that which
has grown in us as the peculiarity of our being, growing with our
growth, and strengthening with our strength, as distinguished from that
which has been wrought on us by mere external influences: what is
inherent, not acquired ([Job 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004.md);
[Psa 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005).md). An incidental proof of the
doctrine of original sin.

children of wrath--not merely "sons," as in the Greek, "sons of
disobedience" ([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).md), but
"children" by generation; not merely by adoption, as "sons" might be.
The Greek order more emphatically marks this innate corruption: "Those
who in their (very) nature are children of wrath"; [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md), "grace" is opposed to "nature"
here; and salvation (implied in [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md), [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008), "saved".md) to "wrath." Compare
Article IX, Church of England Common Prayer Book. "Original sin
(birth-sin), standeth not in the following of Adam, but is the fault and
corruption of the nature of every man, naturally engendered of Adam
\[Christ was supernaturally conceived by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin\],
whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his
own nature inclined to evil; and therefore, in every person born into
this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation." Paul shows that
even the Jews, who boasted of their birth from Abraham, were by natural
birth equally children of wrath as the Gentiles, whom the Jews despised
on account of their birth from idolaters ([Rom
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md); [Rom
5:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).md). "Wrath abideth" on all who
disobey the Gospel in faith and practice ([Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036).md). The phrase, "children of
wrath," is a Hebraism, that is, objects of God's wrath from childhood,
in our natural state, as being born in the sin which God hates. So "son
of death" ([Sa2 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#005), Margin.md); "son of
perdition" ([Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012.md); [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003).md).

as others--Greek, "as the rest" of mankind are ([Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).md).

[Ephesians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 2:4</span></span>

God, who is rich--Greek "(as) being rich in mercy."

for--that is, "because of His great love." This was the special ground
of God's saving us; as "rich in mercy" (compare [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md); [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md); [Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md); [Rom
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012).md) was the general ground. "Mercy
takes away misery; love confers salvation" \[BENGEL\].

[Ephesians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 2:5</span></span>

dead in sins--The best reading is in the Greek, "dead in our (literally,
'the') trespasses."

quickened--"vivified" spiritually, and consequences hereafter,
corporally. There must be a spiritual resurrection of the soul before
there can be a comfortable resurrection of the body \[PEARSON\] ([Joh
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md).

together with Christ--The Head being seated at God's right hand, the
body also sits there with Him \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. We are already seated
there IN Him ("in Christ Jesus," [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006).md), and hereafter shall be seated by
Him; IN Him already as in our Head, which is the ground of our hope; by
Him hereafter, as by the conferring cause, when hope shall be swallowed
up in fruition \[PEARSON\]. What God wrought in Christ, He wrought (by
the very fact) in all united to Christ, and one with Him.

by grace ye are saved--Greek, "Ye are in a saved state." Not merely "ye
are being saved," but ye "are passed from death unto life" ([Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024).md). Salvation is to the Christian
not a thing to be waited for hereafter, but already realized ([Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014).md). The parenthetic introduction of
this clause here (compare [Eph 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md) is
a burst of Paul's feeling, and in order to make the Ephesians feel that
grace from first to last is the sole source of salvation; hence, too, he
says "ye," not "we."

[Ephesians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 2:6</span></span>

raised us up together--with Christ. The "raising up" presupposes
previous quickening of Jesus in the tomb, and of us in the grave of our
sins.

made us sit together--with Christ, namely, in His ascension. Believers
are bodily in heaven in point of right, and virtually so in spirit, and
have each their own place assigned there, which in due time they shall
take possession of ([Phi 3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). He
does not say, "on the right hand of God"; a prerogative reserved to
Christ peculiarly; though they shall share His throne ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).md).

in Christ Jesus--Our union with Him is the ground of our present
spiritual, and future bodily, resurrection and ascension. "Christ Jesus"
is the phrase mostly used in this Epistle, in which the office of the
Christ, the Anointed Prophet, Priest and King, is the prominent thought;
when the Person is prominent, "Jesus Christ" is the phrase used.

[Ephesians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 2:7</span></span>

Greek, "That He might show forth (middle reflexive voice; for His own
glory, [Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), [Eph
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#012).md) in the ages which are coming
on," that is, the blessed ages of the Gospel which supersede "the age
(Greek, for 'course') of this world" ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).md), and the past "ages" from which
the mystery was hidden ([Col 1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026).md).
These good ages, though beginning with the first preaching of the
Gospel, and thenceforth continually succeeding one another, are not
consummated till the Lord's coming again (compare [Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md); [Heb
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005).md). The words, "coming on," do not
exclude the time then present, but imply simply the ages following upon
Christ's "raising them up together" spiritually ([Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006).md).

kindness--"benignity."

through Christ--rather, as Greek, "in Christ"; the same expression as is
so often repeated, to mark that all our blessings center "IN HIM."

[Ephesians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 2:8</span></span>

For--illustrating "the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness."
Translate as in [Eph 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005.md), "Ye are in a
saved state."

through faith--the effect of the power of Christ's resurrection ([Eph
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019.md); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010).md) whereby we are "raised together"
with Him ([Eph 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012).md). Some of the oldest manuscripts
read, "through your (literally, 'the') faith." The instrument or mean of
salvation on the part of the person saved; Christ alone is the
meritorious agent.

and that--namely, the act of believing, or "faith." "Of yourselves"
stands in opposition to, "it is the gift of God" ([Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029).md). "That which I have said,
'through faith,' I do not wish to be understood so as if I excepted
faith itself from grace" \[ESTIUS\]. "God justifies the believing man,
not for the worthiness of his belief, but for the worthiness of Him in
whom he believes" \[HOOKER\]. The initiation, as well as the increase,
of faith, is from the Spirit of God, not only by an external proposal of
the word, but by internal illumination in the soul \[PEARSON\]. Yet
"faith" cometh by the means which man must avail himself of, namely,
"hearing the word of God" ([Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017).md), and prayer ([Luk
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#013).md), though the blessing is wholly
of God ([Co1 3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006).md).

[Ephesians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 2:9</span></span>

Not of works--This clause stands in contrast to "by grace," as is
confirmed by [Rom 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md); [Rom
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006.md).

lest--rather, as Greek, "that no man should boast" ([Rom
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md); [Rom
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002).md).

[Ephesians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 2:10</span></span>

workmanship--literally, "a thing of His making"; "handiwork." Here the
spiritual creation, not the physical, is referred to ([Eph
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md).

created--having been created ([Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024.md); [Psa
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md); [Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md); [Co2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md), [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017).md).

unto good works--"for good works." "Good works" cannot be performed
until we are new "created unto" them. Paul never calls the works of the
law "good works." We are not saved by, but created unto, good works.

before ordained--Greek, "before made ready" (compare [Joh
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036).md). God marks out for each in His
purposes beforehand, the particular good works, and the time and way
which tie sees best. God both makes ready by His providence the
opportunities for the works, and makes us ready for their performance
([Joh 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md); [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021).md).

that we should walk in them--not "be saved" by them. Works do not
justify, but the justified man works ([Gal
5:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022).md).

[Ephesians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 2:11</span></span>

The Greek order in the oldest manuscripts is, "That in time past
(literally, once) ye," &c. Such remembrance sharpens gratitude and
strengthens faith ([Eph 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019).md)
\[BENGEL\].

Gentiles in the flesh--that is, Gentiles in respect to circumcision.

called Uncircumcision--The Gentiles were called (in contempt), and were,
the Uncircumcision; the Jews were called, but were not truly, the
Circumcision \[ELLICOTT\].

in the flesh made by hands--as opposed to the true "circumcision of the
heart in the Spirit, and not the letter" ([Rom
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029).md), "made without the hands in
putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ" ([Col 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md).

[Ephesians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 2:12</span></span>

without Christ--Greek, "separate from Christ"; having no part in Him;
far from Him. A different Greek word (aneu) would be required to
express, "Christ was not present with you" \[TITTMANN\].

aliens--Greek, "alienated from," not merely "separated from." The
Israelites were cut off from the commonwealth of God, but it was as
being self-righteous, indolent, and unworthy, not as aliens and
strangers \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. The expression, "alienated from," takes it for
granted that the Gentiles, before they had apostatized from the
primitive truth, had been sharers in light and life (compare [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md), [Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023).md). The hope of redemption through
the Messiah, on their subsequent apostasy, was embodied into a definite
"commonwealth" or polity, namely, that "of Israel," from which the
Gentiles were alienated. Contrast [Eph
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md); [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md); [Eph
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#004.md), with [Psa
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md).

covenants of promise--rather, ". . . of the promise," namely, "to thee
and thy seed will I give this land" ([Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md); [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016).md). The plural implies the several
renewals of the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and with the
whole people at Sinai \[ALFORD\]. "The promise" is singular, to signify
that the covenant, in reality, and substantially, is one and the same at
all times, but only different in its accidents and external
circumstances (compare [Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md), "at
sundry times and in divers manners").

having no . . . hope--beyond this life ([Co1
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#019).md). The CONJECTURES of heathen
philosophers as to a future life were at best vague and utterly
unsatisfactory. They had no divine "promise," and therefore no sure
ground of "hope." Epicurus and Aristotle did not believe in it at all.
The Platonists believed the soul passed through perpetual changes, now
happy, and then again miserable; the Stoics, that it existed no longer
than till the time of the general burning up of all things.

without God--Greek, "atheists," that is, they had not "God" in the sense
we use the word, the Eternal Being who made and governs all things
(compare [Act 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md), "Turn from these
vanities unto the living God who made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
and all things therein"), whereas the Jews had distinct ideas of God and
immortality. Compare also [Gal 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md),
"Ye knew not God . . . ye did service unto them which are no gods" ([Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005).md). So also pantheists are atheists,
for an impersonal God is NO GOD, and an ideal immortality no immortality
\[THOLUCK\].

in the world--in contrast to belonging to "the commonwealth of Israel."
Having their portion and their all in this godless vain world ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014).md), from which Christ delivers His
people ([Joh 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md); [Joh
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014.md); [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004).md).

[Ephesians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 2:13</span></span>

now--in contrast to "at that time" ([Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md).

in Christ Jesus--"Jesus" is here added, whereas the expression before
([Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md) had been merely "Christ,"
to mark that they know Christ as the personal Saviour, "Jesus."

sometimes--Greek, "aforetime."

far off--the Jewish description of the Gentiles. Far off from God and
from the people of God ([Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md);
[Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md); [Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039).md).

are--Greek, "have been."

by--Greek, "in." Thus "the blood of Christ" is made the seal of a
covenant IN which their nearness to God consists. In [Eph
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007.md), where the blood is more directly
spoken of as the instrument, it is "through His blood" \[ALFORD\].

[Ephesians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 2:14</span></span>

he--Greek, "Himself" alone, pre-eminently, and none else. Emphatical.

our peace--not merely "Peacemaker," but "Himself" the price of our
(Jews' and Gentiles' alike) peace with God, and so the bond of union
between "both" in God. He took both into Himself, and reconciled them,
united, to God, by His assuming our nature and our penal and legal
liabilities ([Eph 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md); [Isa
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md); [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md); [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md). His title, "Shiloh," means the
same ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md).

the middle wall of partition--Greek, ". . . of the partition" or
"fence"; the middle wall which parted Jew and Gentile. There was a
balustrade of stone which separated the court of the Gentiles from the
holy place, which it was death for a Gentile to pass. But this, though
incidentally alluded to, was but a symbol of the partition itself,
namely, "the enmity" between "both" and God ([Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015).md), the real cause of separation
from God, and so the mediate cause of their separation from one another.
Hence there was a twofold wall of partition, one the inner wall,
severing the Jewish people from entrance to the holy part of the temple
where the priests officiated, the other the outer wall, separating the
Gentile proselytes from access to the court of the Jews (compare [Eze
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md); [Act
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028).md). Thus this twofold wall
represented the Sinaitic law, which both severed all men, even the Jews,
from access to God (through sin, which is the violation of the law), and
also separated the Gentiles from the Jews. As the term "wall" implies
the strength of the partition, so "fence" implies that it was easily
removed by God when the due time came.

[Ephesians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 2:15</span></span>

Rather, make "enmity" an apposition to "the middle wall of partition";
"Hath broken down the middle wall of partition (not merely as English
Version, 'between us,' but also between all men and God), to wit, the
enmity ([Rom 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007).md) by His flesh"
(compare [Eph 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md); [Rom
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003).md).

the law of commandments contained in--Greek, "the law of the
commandments (consisting) in ordinances." This law was "the partition"
or "fence," which embodied the expression of the "enmity" (the "wrath"
of God against our sin, and our enmity to Him, [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003).md) ([Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md); [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md); [Rom
7:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#010.md); [Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007).md). Christ has in, or by, His
crucified flesh, abolished it, so far as its condemning and
enmity-creating power is concerned ([Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014).md), substituting for it the law of
love, which is the everlasting spirit of the law, and which flows from
the realization in the soul of His love in His death for us. Translate
what follows, "that He might make the two (Jews and Gentiles) into one
new man." Not that He might merely reconcile the two to each other, but
incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one new man; the old
man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His
flesh on the cross. Observe, too, ONE new man; we are all in God's sight
but one in Christ, as we are but one in Adam \[ALFORD\].

making peace--primarily between all and God, secondarily between Jews
and Gentiles; He being "our peace." This "peace-making" precedes its
publication ([Eph 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017).md).

[Ephesians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 2:16</span></span>

Translate, "might altogether reconcile them both in one body (the
Church, [Col 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015).md) unto God through
His cross." The Greek for "reconcile" (apocatalaxe), found only here and
in [Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md), expresses not only a
return to favor with one (catallage), but so to lay aside enmity that
complete amity follows; to pass from enmity to complete reconciliation
\[TITTMANN\].

slain the enmity--namely, that had been between man and God; and so that
between Jew and Gentile which had resulted from it. By His being slain,
He slew it (compare [Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).md).

thereby--Greek, "therein"; "in" or "by the cross," that is, His
crucifixion ([Col 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md).

[Ephesians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 2:17</span></span>

Translate, "He came and announced glad tidings of peace." "He came" of
His own free love, and "announced peace" with His own mouth to the
apostles ([Luk 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md); [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md), [Joh
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#021.md), [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026).md); and by them to others, through
His Spirit present in His Church ([Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018).md). [Act
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023.md) is strictly parallel; after His
resurrection "He showed light to the people ('them that were nigh') and
to the Gentiles ('you that were afar off')," by His Spirit in His
ministers (compare [Pe1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#019).md).

and to them--The oldest manuscripts insert "peace" again: "And peace to
them." The repetition implies the joy with which both alike would dwell
again and again upon the welcome word "peace." So [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md).

[Ephesians 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 2:18</span></span>

Translate, "For it is through Him ([Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md); [Heb
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md) that we have our access ([Eph
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md); [Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002).md), both of us, in (that is, united
in, that is, "by," [Co1 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013), Greek.md)
one Spirit to the Father," namely, as our common Father, reconciled to
both alike; whence flows the removal of all separation between Jew and
Gentile. The oneness of "the Spirit," through which we both have our
access, is necessarily followed by oneness of the body, the Church ([Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016).md). The distinctness of persons in
the Divine Trinity appears in this verse. It is also fatal to the theory
of sacerdotal priests in the Gospel through whom alone the people can
approach God. All alike, people and ministers, can draw nigh to God
through Christ, their ever living Priest.

foreigners--rather, "sojourners"; opposed to "members of the household,"
as "strangers" is to "fellow citizens." [Phi

"citizenship."

with the saints--"the commonwealth of (spiritual) Israel" ([Eph

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 2:20</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "Built up upon," &c. (participle; having been built
up upon; omit, therefore, "and are"). Compare [Co1
3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md). The same image in [Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md), recurs in his address to the
Ephesian elders ([Act 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#032).md), and in
his Epistle to Timothy at Ephesus ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019).md), naturally suggested by the
splendid architecture of Diana's temple; the glory of the Christian
temple is eternal and real, not mere idolatrous gaud. The image of a
building is appropriate also to the Jew-Christians; as the temple at
Jerusalem was the stronghold of Judaism; as Diana's temple, of paganism.

foundation of the apostles, &c.--that is, upon their ministry and living
example (compare [Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018).md). Christ
Himself, the only true Foundation, was the grand subject of their
ministry, and spring of their life. As one with Him and His fellow
workers, they, too, in a secondary sense, are called "foundations" ([Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014).md). The "prophets" are joined with
them closely; for the expression is here not "foundations of the
apostles and the prophets," but "foundations of the apostles and
prophets." For the doctrine of both was essentially one ([Pe1
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md); [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010).md). The apostles take the
precedency ([Luk 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024).md). Thus he
appropriately shows regard to the claims of the Jews and Gentiles: "the
prophets" representing the old Jewish dispensation, "the apostles" the
new. The "prophets" of the new also are included. BENGEL and ALFORD
refer the meaning solely to these ([Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005.md); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011).md). These passages imply, I think,
that the New Testament prophets are not excluded; but the apostle's
plain reference to [Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md), "the
head stone of the corner," proves that the Old Testament prophets are a
prominent thought. David is called a "prophet" in [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md). Compare also [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); another prophet present to the
mind of Paul, which prophecy leans on the earlier one of Jacob ([Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024).md). The sense of the context, too,
suits this: Ye were once aliens from the commonwealth of Israel (in the
time of her Old Testament prophets), but now ye are members of the true
Israel, built upon the foundation of her New Testament apostles and Old
Testament prophets. Paul continually identifies his teaching with that
of Israel's old prophets ([Act 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022.md);
[Act 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023).md). The costly
foundation-stones of the temple ([Kg1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017).md) typified the same truth (compare
[Jer 51:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#026).md). The same stone is at once
the corner-stone and the foundation-stone on which the whole building
rests. Paul supposes a stone or rock so large and so fashioned as to be
both at once; supporting the whole as the foundation, and in part rising
up at the extremities, so as to admit of the side walls meeting in it,
and being united in it as the corner-stone \[ZANCHIUS\]. As the
corner-stone, it is conspicuous, as was Christ ([Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md), and coming in men's way may be
stumbled over, as the Jews did at Christ ([Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md); [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007).md).

groweth--"is growing" continually. Here an additional thought is added
to the image; the Church has the growth of a living organism, not the
mere increase of a building. Compare [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md); "lively stones . . . built up a
spiritual house." Compare [Eph 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016.md);

temple of the Lord," where similarly the growth of a branch, and the
building of a temple, are joined.
