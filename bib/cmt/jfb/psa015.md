### [Psalms Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001)

[Psalms 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 15:1</span></span>

Those who are fit for communion with God may be known by a conformity to
His law, which is illustrated in various important particulars. ([Psa
15:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001))

abide--or, "sojourn" (compare [Psa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#004)), where it means under God's
protection here, as ([Psa 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006), [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004), [Psa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006)) communion.

tabernacle--seat of the ark ([Sa2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017)), the symbol of God's presence.

holy hill--(Compare [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)).

[Psalms 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 15:2</span></span>

walketh--(Compare [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)).

uprightly--in a complete manner, as to all parts of conduct ([Gen
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)), not as to degree.

worketh--or, "does."

righteousness--what is right.

in his heart--sincerely ([Pro 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#007)).

[Psalms 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 15:3</span></span>

He neither slanders nor spreads slander.

[Psalms 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 15:4</span></span>

Love and hate are regulated by a regard to God.

sweareth . . . hurt--or what so results (compare [Lev
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#004)).

[Psalms 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 15:5</span></span>

(Compare [Lev 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#037); [Deu
23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019)).

usury is derived from a verb meaning "to bite." All gains made by the
wrongful loss of others are forbidden.

taketh reward, &c.--The innocent would not otherwise be condemned
(compare [Exo 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#008); [Deu
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#019)). Bribery of all sorts is
denounced.

doeth these, &c.--Such persons admitted to God's presence and favor
shall never be moved ([Psa 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006); [Psa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#005)).
