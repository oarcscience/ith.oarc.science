### [Daniel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001)

[Daniel 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 6:1</span></span>

DARIUS' DECREE: DANIEL'S DISOBEDIENCE, AND CONSEQUENT EXPOSURE TO THE
LION'S: HIS DELIVERANCE BY GOD, AND DARIUS' DECREE. (Dan. 6:1-28)

Darius--GROTEFEND has read it in the cuneiform inscriptions at
Persepolis, as Darheush, that is, "Lord-King," a name applied to many of
the Medo-Persian kings in common. Three of that name occur: Darius
Hystaspes, 521 B.C., in whose reign the decree was carried into effect
for rebuilding the temple ([Ezr 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#005);
[Hag 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#001)); Darius Codomanus, 336 B.C.,
whom Alexander overcame, called "the Persian" ([Neh
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#022)), an expression used after the
rule of Macedon was set up; and Darius Cyaxares II, between Astyages and
Cyrus \[AESCHYLUS, The Persians, 762, 763\].

hundred and twenty--satraps; set over the conquered provinces (including
Babylon) by Cyrus \[XENOPHON, CyropÃ&brvbr;dia, 8.6.1\]. No doubt Cyrus
acted under Darius, as in the capture of Babylon; so that Daniel rightly
attributes the appointment to Darius.

[Daniel 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 6:3</span></span>

Daniel was preferred--probably because of his having so wonderfully
foretold the fall of Babylon. Hence the very expression used by the
queen mother on that occasion ([Dan
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#012)) is here used, "because an
excellent spirit was in him."

king thought to set him over the whole realm--Agreeing with Darius
character, weak and averse to business, which he preferred to delegate
to favorites. God overruled this to the good both of Daniel, and,
through him, of His people.

[Daniel 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 6:4</span></span>

occasion . . . concerning the kingdom--pretext for accusation in his
administration ([Ecc 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#004)).

[Daniel 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 6:5</span></span>

It is the highest testimony to a godly man's walk, when his most
watchful enemies can find no ground of censure save in that he walks
according to the law of God even where it opposes the ways of the world.

[Daniel 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 6:6</span></span>

assembled together--literally, "assembled hastily and tumultuously." Had
they come more deliberately, the king might have refused their grant;
but they gave him no time for reflection, representing that their
test-decree was necessary for the safety of the king.

live for ever--ARRIAN \[Alexander, 4\] records that Cyrus was the first
before whom prostration was practised. It is an undesigned mark of
genuineness that Daniel should mention no prostration before
Nebuchadnezzar or Darius (see on [Dan
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#009)).

[Daniel 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 6:7</span></span>

The Persian king was regarded as representative of the chief god,
Ormuzd; the seven princes near him represented the seven Amshaspands
before the throne of Ormuzd; hence Mordecai ([Est
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#004)) refused such homage to Haman, the
king's prime minister, as inconsistent with what is due to God alone. A
weak despot, like Darius, much under the control of his princes, might
easily be persuaded that such a decree would test the obedience of the
Chaldeans just conquered, and tame their proud spirits. So absolute is
the king in the East, that he is regarded not merely as the ruler, but
the owner, of the people.

All . . . governors . . . counsellors, &c.--Several functionaries are
here specified, not mentioned in [Dan
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#004), [Dan
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#006). They evidently exaggerated the
case of the weak king, as if their request was that of all the officers
in the empire.

den of lions--an underground cave or pit, covered with a stone. It is an
undesigned proof of genuineness, that the "fiery furnace" is not made
the means of punishment here, as in [Dan
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#020); for the Persians were
fire-worshippers, which the Babylonians were not.

[Daniel 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 6:8</span></span>

decree--or, "interdict."

that it be not changed-- ([Est 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#019);
[Est 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008)). This immutability of the
king's commands was peculiar to the Medes and Persians: it was due to
their regarding him infallible as the representative of Ormuzd; it was
not so among the Babylonians.

Medes and Persians--The order of the names is an undesigned mark of
genuineness. Cyrus the Persian reigned subordinate to Darius the Mede as
to dignity, though exercising more real power. After Darius' death, the
order is "the Persians and Medes" ([Est
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#014), [Est
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#019), &c.).

[Daniel 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 6:9</span></span>

Such a despotic decree is quite explicable by remembering that the king,
as the incarnation of Ormuzd, might demand such an act of religious
obedience as a test of loyalty. Persecuting laws are always made on
false pretenses. Instead of bitter complaints against men, Daniel prays
to God. Though having vast business as a ruler of the empire, he finds
time to pray thrice a day. Daniel's three companions ([Dan
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012)), are not alluded to here, nor
any other Jew who conscientiously may have disregarded the edict, as the
conspirators aimed at Daniel alone ([Dan
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#005)).

[Daniel 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 6:10</span></span>

when Daniel knew . . . writing . . . signed--and that, therefore, the
power of advising the king against it was taken from him.

went into his house--withdrawing from the God-dishonoring court.

windows . . . open--not in vainglory, but that there might be no
obstruction to his view of the direction in which Jerusalem, the earthly
seat of Jehovah under the Old Testament, lay; and that the sight of
heaven might draw his mind off from earthly thoughts. To Christ in the
heavenly temple let us turn our eyes in prayer, from this land of our
captivity ([Kg1 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#044), [Kg1
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#048); [Ch2
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#029), [Ch2
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#034), [Ch2
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#038); [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007)).

chamber--the upper room, where prayer was generally offered by the Jews
([Act 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)). Not on the housetop ([Act
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009)), where he would be conspicuous.

upon his knees--Humble attitudes in prayer become humble suppliants.

three times a day-- ([Psa 55:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#017)). The
third, sixth, and ninth hour; our nine, twelve, and three o'clock ([Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015); [Act
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#009); [Act
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001); [Act
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030); compare [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021)).

as . . . aforetime--not from contempt of the king's command.

[Daniel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 6:11</span></span>

assembled--as in [Dan 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#006), "assembled"
or "ran hastily," so as to come upon Daniel suddenly and detect him in
the act.

[Daniel 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 6:12</span></span>

They preface their attack by alleging the king's edict, so as to get him
again to confirm it unalterably, before they mention Daniel's name. Not
to break a wicked promise, is not firmness, but guilty obstinacy ([Mat
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#009); [Mar
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#026)).

[Daniel 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 6:13</span></span>

That Daniel--contemptuously.

of . . . captivity of Judah--recently a captive among thy servants, the
Babylonians--one whom humble obedience most becomes. Thus they aggravate
his guilt, omitting mention of his being prime minister, which might
only remind Darius of Daniel's state services.

regardeth not thee--because he regarded God ([Act
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019); [Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029)).

[Daniel 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 6:14</span></span>

displeased with himself--for having suffered himself to be entrapped
into such a hasty decree ([Pro 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#020)).
On the one hand he was pressed by the immutability of the law, fear that
the princes might conspire against him, and desire to consult for his
own reputation, not to seem fickle; on the other, by regard for Daniel,
and a desire to save him from the effects of his own rash decree.

till . . . going down of . . . sun--The king took this time to
deliberate, thinking that after sunset Daniel would be spared till
morning, and that meanwhile some way of escape would turn up. But ([Dan
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#015)) the conspirators "assembled
tumultuously" (literally) to prevent this delay in the execution, lest
the king should meantime change his decree.

[Daniel 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 6:16</span></span>

Thy God . . . will deliver thee--The heathen believed in the
interposition of the gods at times in favor of their worshippers. Darius
recognized Daniel's God as a god, but not the only true God. He had
heard of the deliverance of the three youths in [Dan
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#026) and hence augurs Daniel's
deliverance. I am not my own master, and cannot deliver thee, however
much I wish it. "Thy God will." Kings are the slaves of their
flatterers. Men admire piety to God in others, however disregarding Him
themselves.

[Daniel 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 6:17</span></span>

stone . . . sealed--typical of Christ's entombment under a seal ([Mat
27:66](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#066)). Divinely ordered, that the
deliverance might be the more striking.

his own signet, and . . . of his lords--The concurrence of the lords was
required for making laws. In this kingly power had fallen since it was
in Nebuchadnezzar's hands. The Median king is a puppet in his lords'
hands; they take the security of their own seal as well as his, that he
should not release Daniel. The king's seal guaranteed Daniel from being
killed by them, should he escape the lions.

[Daniel 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 6:18</span></span>

neither were instruments of music, &c.--GESENIUS translates,
"concubines." Daniel's mentioning to us as an extraordinary thing of
Darius, that he neither approached his table nor his harem, agrees with
XENOPHON'S picture of him as devoted to wine and women, vain, and
without self-control. He is sorry for the evil which he himself had
caused, yet takes no steps to remedy it. There are many such halters
between good and bad, who are ill at ease in their sins, yet go forward
in them, and are drawn on by others.

[Daniel 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 6:19</span></span>

His grief overcame his fear of the nobles.

[Daniel 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 6:20</span></span>

living God--having life Himself, and able to preserve thy life;
contrasted with the lifeless idols. Darius borrowed the phrase from
Daniel; God extorting from an idolater a confession of the truth.

thou servest continually--in times of persecution, as well as in times
of peace.

is thy God . . . able--the language of doubt, yet hope.

[Daniel 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 6:21</span></span>

Daniel might have indulged in anger at the king, but does not; his sole
thought is, God's glory has been set forth in his deliverance.

[Daniel 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 6:22</span></span>

his angel--the instrument, not the author, of his deliverance ([Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011); [Psa
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007)).

shut . . . lions' mouths-- ([Heb
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033)). So spiritually, God will shut
the roaring lion's mouth ([Pe1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008))
for His servants.

forasmuch as before him innocency--not absolutely (in [Dan
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007), [Dan
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018) he disclaims such a plea), but
relatively to this case. God has attested the justice of my cause in
standing up for His worship, by delivering me. Therefore, the
"forasmuch" does not justify Rome's doctrine of works meriting
salvation.

before thee--Obedience to God is in strictest compatibility with loyalty
to the king ([Mat 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#021); [Pe1
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017)). Daniel's disobedience to the
king was seeming, not real, because it was not from contempt of the
king, but from regard to the King of kings (compare [Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016)).

[Daniel 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 6:23</span></span>

because he believed--"Faith" is stated in [Heb
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033) to have been his actuating
principle: a prelude to the Gospel. His belief was not with a view to a
miraculous deliverance. He shut his eyes to the event, committing the
keeping of his soul to God, in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator
([Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019)), sure of deliverance in a
better life, if not in this.

[Daniel 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 6:24</span></span>

([Deu 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019); [Pro
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#005)).

accused--literally, "devoured the bones and flesh." It was just that
they who had torn Daniel's character, and sought the tearing of his
person, should be themselves given to be torn in pieces ([Pro
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#008)).

their children--Among the Persians, all the kindred were involved in the
guilt of one culprit. The Mosaic law expressly forbade this ([Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016); [Kg2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006)).

or ever--that is, "before ever." The lions sparing Daniel could not have
been because they were full, as they showed the keenness of their hunger
on the accusers.

[Daniel 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 6:26</span></span>

Stronger than the decree ([Dan 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#029)).
That was negative; this, positive; not merely men must say "nothing
amiss of," but must "fear before God."

[Daniel 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">dan 6:28</span></span>

It was in the third year of Cyrus that Daniel's visions (Dan.
10:1-12:13) were given. Daniel "prospered" because of his prophecies
([Ezr 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001)).

This chapter treats of the same subject as the second chapter. But there
the four kingdoms, and Messiah's final kingdom, were regarded according
to their external political aspect, but here according to the mind of
God concerning them, and their moral features. The outward political
history had been shown in its general features to the world ruler, whose
position fitted him for receiving such a revelation. But God's prophet
here receives disclosures as to the characters of the powers of the
world, in a religious point of view, suited to his position and
receptivity. Hence in the second chapter the images are taken from the
inanimate sphere; in the seventh chapter they are taken from the
animate. Nebuchadnezzar saw superficially the world power as a splendid
human figure, and the kingdom of God as a mere stone at the first.
Daniel sees the world kingdoms in their inner essence as of an animal
nature lower than human, being estranged from God; and that only in the
kingdom of God ("the Son of man," the representative man) is the true
dignity of man realized. So, as contrasted with Nebuchadnezzar's vision,
the kingdom of God appears to Daniel, from the very first, superior to
the world kingdom. For though in physical force the beasts excel man,
man has essentially spiritual powers. Nebuchadnezzar's colossal image
represents mankind in its own strength, but only the outward man. Daniel
sees man spiritually degraded to the beast level, led by blind impulses,
through his alienation from God. It is only from above that the perfect
Son of man comes, and in His kingdom man attains his true destiny.
Compare [Psa 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001) with [Gen
1:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026). Humanity is impossible
without divinity: it sinks to bestiality ([Psa
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009); [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020); [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022)). Obstinate heathen nations are
compared to "bulls" ([Psa 68:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#030));
Egypt to the dragon in the Nile ([Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001); [Isa
51:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009); [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)). The animal with all its
sagacity looks always to the ground, without consciousness of relation
to God. What elevates man is communion with God, in willing subjection
to Him. The moment he tries to exalt himself to independence of God, as
did Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030)), he
sinks to the beast's level. Daniel's acquaintance with the animal
colossal figures in Babylon and Nineveh was a psychological preparation
for his animal visions. [Hos 13:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#007)
would occur to him while viewing those ensigns of the world power.
Compare [Jer 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015); [Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006).
