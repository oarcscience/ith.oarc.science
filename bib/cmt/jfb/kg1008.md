[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002.md)

THE DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE. ([Kg1
8:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001).md)

at the feast in the month Ethanim--The public and formal inauguration of
this national place of worship did not take place till eleven months
after the completion of the edifice. The delay, most probably,
originated in Solomon's wish to choose the most fitting opportunity when
there should be a general rendezvous of the people in Jerusalem ([Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md); and that was not till the next
year. That was a jubilee year, and he resolved on commencing the solemn
ceremonial a few days before the feast of tabernacles, which was the
most appropriate of all seasons. That annual festival had been
instituted in commemoration of the Israelites dwelling in booths during
their stay in the wilderness, as well as of the tabernacle, which was
then erected, in which God promised to meet and dwell with His people,
sanctifying it with His glory. As the tabernacle was to be superseded by
the temple, there was admirable propriety in choosing the feast of
tabernacles as the period for dedicating the new place of worship, and
praying that the same distinguished privileges might be continued to it
in the manifestation of the divine presence and glory. At the time
appointed for the inauguration, the king issued orders for all the heads
and representatives of the nation to repair to Jerusalem and take part
in the august procession \[[Kg1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md)\].
The lead was taken by the king and elders of the people, whose march
must have been slow, as priests were stationed to offer an immense
number of sacrifices at various points in the line of road through which
the procession was to go. Then came the priests bearing the ark and the
tabernacle--the old Mosaic tabernacle which was brought from Gibeon.
Lastly, the Levites followed, carrying the vessels and ornaments
belonging to the old, for lodgment in the new, house of the Lord. There
was a slight deviation in this procedure from the order of march
established in the wilderness ([Num
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#031.md); [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015).md); but the spirit of the
arrangement was duly observed. The ark was deposited in the oracle; that
is, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim--not the Mosaic
cherubim, which were firmly attached to the ark ([Exo
37:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#007).md), but those made by Solomon,
which were far larger and more expanded.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 8:8</span></span>

they drew out the staves--a little way, so as to project (see on [Exo
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015.md); [Num
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#006).md); and they were left in that
position. The object was, that these projecting staves might serve as a
guide to the high priest, in conducting him to that place where, once a
year, he went to officiate before the ark; otherwise he might miss his
way in the dark, the ark being wholly overshadowed by the wings of the
cherubim.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 8:9</span></span>

There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone--Nothing else
was ever in the ark, the articles mentioned ([Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md) being not in, but by it, being
laid in the most holy place before the testimony ([Exo
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#033.md); [Num
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 8:10</span></span>

the cloud filled the house of the Lord--The cloud was the visible symbol
of the divine presence, and its occupation of the sanctuary was a
testimony of God's gracious acceptance of the temple as of the
tabernacle ([Exo 40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034).md). The dazzling
brightness, or rather, perhaps, the dense portentous darkness of the
cloud, struck the minds of the priests, as it formerly had done Moses,
which such astonishment and terror ([Lev
16:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002.md); [Deu
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md); [Exo
40:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#035).md) that they could not remain.
Thus the temple became the place where the divine glory was revealed,
and the king of Israel established his royal residence.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 8:12</span></span>

SOLOMON'S BLESSING. ([Kg1 8:12-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#012).md)

Then spake Solomon--For the reassurance of the priests and people, the
king reminded them that the cloud, instead of being a sign ominous of
evil, was a token of approval.

The Lord said--not in express terms, but by a continuous course of
action ([Exo 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md); [Exo
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#016.md); [Num
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#015).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 8:13</span></span>

I have surely built thee an house--This is an apostrophe to God, as
perceiving His approach by the cloud, and welcoming Him to enter as
guest or inhabitant of the fixed and permanent dwelling-place, which, at
His command, had been prepared for His reception.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 8:14</span></span>

the king turned his face about--From the temple, where he had been
watching the movement of the mystic cloud, and while the people were
standing, partly as the attitude of devotion, partly out of respect to
royalty, the king gave a fervent expression of praise to God for the
fulfilment of His promise ([Sa2
7:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#006).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 8:22</span></span>

HIS PRAYER. (1Ki. 8:22-61)

Solomon stood before the altar--This position was in the court of the
people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion ([Ch2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#013).md), fronting the altar of burnt
offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the
attitude of a suppliant, kneeling ([Kg1
8:54](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#054.md); compare [Ch2
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#024).md) and with uplifted hands, he
performed the solemn act of consecration--an act remarkable, among other
circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any
member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might
minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer \[1Ki.
8:22-35\], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with
the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national
blessing and curse contained in the law--and the burden of it--after an
ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was
an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies
seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be
required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people
praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at
the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding
prayer \[[Kg1 8:56-61](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#056.md)\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:62](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">kg1 8:62</span></span>

HIS SACRIFICE OF PEACE OFFERING. ([Kg1
8:62-64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#062).md)

the king, and all Israel . . . offered sacrifice before the Lord--This
was a burnt offering with its accompaniments, and being the first laid
on the altar of the temple, was, as in the analogous case of the
tabernacle, consumed by miraculous fire from heaven (see [Ch2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001).md). On remarkable occasions, the
heathens sacrificed hecatombs (a hundred animals), and even chiliombs (a
thousand animals), but the public sacrifices offered by Solomon on this
occasion surpassed all the other oblations on record, without taking
into account those presented by private individuals, which, doubtless,
amounted to a large additional number. The large proportion of the
sacrifices were peace offerings, which afforded the people an
opportunity of festive enjoyment.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:63](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">kg1 8:63</span></span>

So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the
Lord--The dedication was not a ceremony ordained by the law, but it was
done in accordance with the sentiments of reverence naturally associated
with edifices appropriated to divine worship. \[See on [Ch2
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#005.md).\]

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">kg1 8:64</span></span>

The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court--that is, the
whole extent of the priests' court--the altar of burnt offerings, though
large ([Ch2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#001).md), being totally
inadequate for the vast number of sacrifices that distinguished this
occasion. It was only a temporary erection to meet the demands of an
extraordinary season, in aid of the established altar, and removed at
the conclusion of the sacred festival. \[See on [Ch2
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#007.md).\]

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">kg1 8:65</span></span>

THE PEOPLE JOYFUL. ([Kg1 8:65](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#065).md)

from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt--that is, from
one extremity of the kingdom to the other. The people flocked from all
quarters.

seven days and seven days, even fourteen days--The first seven were
occupied with the dedication, and the other seven devoted to the feast
of tabernacles ([Ch2 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#009).md). The
particular form of expression indicates that the fourteen days were not
continuous. Some interval occurred in consequence of the great day of
atonement falling on the tenth of the seventh month ([Kg1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#002).md), and the last day of the feast of
tabernacles was on the twenty-third ([Ch2
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#010).md), when the people returned to
their homes with feelings of the greatest joy and gratitude "for all the
goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel
his people."
