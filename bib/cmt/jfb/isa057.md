Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 57](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)

[Isaiah 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 57:1</span></span>

THE PEACEFUL DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS FEW: THE UNGODLINESS OF THE MANY: A
BELIEVING REMNANT SHALL SURVIVE THE GENERAL JUDGMENTS OF THE NATION, AND
BE RESTORED BY HIM WHO CREATES PEACE. (Isa. 57:1-21)

no man layeth it to heart--as a public calamity.

merciful men--rather, godly men; the subjects of mercy.

none considering--namely, what was the design of Providence in removing
the godly.

from the evil--Hebrew, from the face of the evil, that is, both from the
moral evil on every side ([Isa
56:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010)), and from the evils about to
come in punishment of the national sins, foreign invasions, &c. ([Isa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009); [Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013)). So Ahijah's death is
represented as a blessing conferred on him by God for his piety ([Kg1
14:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010); see also [Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 57:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 57:2</span></span>

Or, "he entereth into peace"; in contrast to the persecutions which he
suffered in this world ([Job 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013),
[Job 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017)). The Margin not so well
translates, "he shall go in peace" ([Psa
37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037); [Luk
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029)).

rest--the calm rest of their bodies in their graves (called "beds," [Ch2
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014); compare [Isa
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018); because they "sleep" in them,
with the certainty of awakening at the resurrection, [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014)) is the emblem of the eternal
"rest" ([Heb 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009); [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013)).

each one walking in . . . uprightness--This clause defines the character
of those who at death "rest in their beds," namely, all who walk
uprightly.

[Isaiah 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 57:3</span></span>

But . . . ye--In contrast to "the righteous" and their end, he announces
to the unbelieving Jews their doom.

sons of the sorceress--that is, ye that are addicted to sorcery: this
was connected with the worship of false gods ([Kg2
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#006)). No insult is greater to an
Oriental than any slur cast on his mother ([Sa1
20:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#030); [Job
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008)).

seed of the adulterer--Spiritual adultery is meant: idolatry and
apostasy ([Mat 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 57:4</span></span>

sport yourselves--make a mock ([Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005)). Are ye aware of the glory of
Him whom you mock, by mocking His servants ("the righteous," [Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001))? ([Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016)).

make . . . wide month-- ([Psa 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007),
[Psa 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013); [Psa
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021); [Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016)).

children of transgression, &c.--not merely children of transgressors,
and a seed of false parents, but of transgression and falsehood itself,
utterly unfaithful to God.

[Isaiah 57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 57:5</span></span>

Enflaming yourselves--burning with lust towards idols \[GESENIUS\]; or
else (compare Margin), in the terebinth groves, which the Hebrew and the
parallelism favor (see on [Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029))
\[MAURER\].

under . . . tree-- ([Kg2 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#010)). The
tree, as in the Assyrian sculptures, was probably made an idolatrous
symbol of the heavenly hosts.

slaying . . . children--as a sacrifice to Molech, &c. ([Kg2
17:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#031); [Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003); [Ch2
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006)).

in . . . valleys--the valley of the son of Hinnom. Fire was put within a
hollow brazen statue, and the child was put in his heated arms; kettle
drums (Hebrew, toph) were beaten to drown the child's cries; whence the
valley was called Tophet ([Ch2 33:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#006);
[Jer 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003)).

under . . . clifts--the gloom of caverns suiting their dark
superstitions.

[Isaiah 57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 57:6</span></span>

The smooth stones, shaped as idols, are the gods chosen by thee as thy
portion ([Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005)).

meat offering--not a bloody sacrifice, but one of meal and flour mingled
with oil. "Meat" in Old English meant food, not flesh, as it means now
([Lev 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#010)).

Should I receive comfort--rather, "Shall I bear these things with
patience?" \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 57:7</span></span>

Upon . . . high mountain . . . bed--image from adultery, open and
shameless ([Eze 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#007)); the "bed"
answers to the idolatrous altar, the scene of their spiritual
unfaithfulness to their divine husband ([Eze
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#016), [Eze
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#025); [Eze
23:41](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#041)).

[Isaiah 57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 57:8</span></span>

"Remembrance," that is, memorials of thy idolatry: the objects which
thou holdest in remembrance. They hung up household tutelary gods
"behind the doors"; the very place where God has directed them to write
His laws "on the posts and gates" ([Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009); [Deu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#020)); a curse, too, was pronounced
on putting up an image "in a secret place" ([Deu
27:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015)).

discovered thyself--image from an adulteress.

enlarged . . . bed--so as to receive the more paramours.

made . . . covenant--with idols: in open violation of thy "covenant"
with God ([Exo 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005); [Exo
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032)). Or, "hast made assignations
with them for thyself" \[HORSLEY\].

thy bed . . . their bed--The Jews' sin was twofold; they resorted to
places of idolatry ("their bed"), and they received idols into the
temple of God ("thy bed").

where--rather, "ever since that" \[HORSLEY\]. The Hebrew for "where"
means "room" (Margin), a place; therefore, translate, "thou hast
provided a place for it" (for "their bed"), namely, by admitting
idolatrous altars in thy land \[BARNES\]; or "thou choosest a
(convenient) place for thyself" in their bed \[MAURER\] ([Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 57:9</span></span>

the king--the idol which they came to worship, perfumed with oil, like
harlots ([Jer 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#030); [Eze
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016), [Eze
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040)). So "king" means idol ([Amo
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#026); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005)); (malcham meaning "king")
\[ROSENMULLER\]. Rather, the king of Assyria or Egypt, and other foreign
princes, on whom Israel relied, instead of on God; the "ointment" will
thus refer to the presents ([Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001)), and perhaps the compliances
with foreigners idolatries, whereby Israel sought to gain their favor
\[LOWTH\] ([Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006); [Eze
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033); [Eze
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#016); [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011)).

send . . . messengers far off--not merely to neighboring nations, but to
those "far off," in search of new idols, or else alliances.

even unto hell--the lowest possible degradation.

[Isaiah 57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 57:10</span></span>

greatness of . . . way--the length of thy journey in seeking strange
gods, or else foreign aid ([Jer
2:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)). Notwithstanding thy deriving
no good from these long journeys (so, "send . . . far off," [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009)), thou dost not still give up
hope ([Jer 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025); [Jer
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012)).

hast found . . . life of . . . hand--for "thou still findest life (that
is, vigor) enough in thy hand" to make new idols \[MAURER\], or to seek
new alliance ("hand" being then taken for strength in general).

grieved--rather, "therefore thou art not weak" \[MAURER\]; inasmuch as
having "life in thy hand," thou art still strong in hope.

[Isaiah 57:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 57:11</span></span>

Israel wished not to seem altogether to have denied God. Therefore they
"lied" to Him. God asks, Why dost thou do so? "Whom dost thou fear?
Certainly not Me; for thou hast not remembered Me." Translate, "seeing
that thou hast not remembered Me."

laid it to . . . heart--rather, "nor hast Me at heart"; hast no regard
for Me; and that, because I have been long silent and have not punished
thee. Literally, "Have I not held My peace, and that for long? and so
thou fearest Me not" ([Psa 50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021); [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)). It would be better openly to
renounce God, than to "flatter Him" with lies of false professions ([Psa
78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036)) \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. However,
[Isa 51:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#012) favors English Version
of the whole verse; God's "silent" long-suffering, which was intended to
lead them to repentance, caused them "not to fear Him" ([Rom
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 57:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 57:12</span></span>

declare--I will expose publicly thy (hypocritical) righteousness. I will
show openly how vain thy works, in having recourse to idols, or foreign
alliances, shall prove ([Isa 57:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 57:13</span></span>

When thou criest--In the time of thy trouble.

companies--namely, of idols, collected by thee from every quarter; or
else, of foreigners, summoned to thy aid.

wind . . . carry . . . away-- ([Job
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018); [Mat
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#027)).

vanity--rather, "a breath" \[LOWTH\].

possess . . . land . . . inherit--that is, the literal land of Judea and
Mount Zion; the believing remnant of Israel shall return and inherit the
land. Secondarily, the heavenly inheritance, and the spiritual Zion
([Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008); [Psa
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009), [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011); [Psa
69:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#035); [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)). "He that putteth his trust in
Me," of whatever extraction, shall succeed to the spiritual patrimony of
the apostate Jew \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 57:14</span></span>

shall say--The nominative is, "He that trusteth in Me" ([Isa
57:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#013)). The believing remnant shall
have every obstacle to their return cleared out of the way, at the
coming restoration of Israel, the antitype to the return from Babylon
([Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008); [Isa
40:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003); [Isa
62:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010)).

Cast . . . up--a high road before the returning Jews.

stumbling-block--Jesus had been so to the Jews, but will not be so then
any longer ([Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)); their
prejudices shall then be taken out of the way.

[Isaiah 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 57:15</span></span>

The pride and self-righteousness of the Jews were the stumbling block in
the way of their acknowledging Christ. The contrition of Israel in the
last days shall be attended with God's interposition in their behalf. So
their self-humiliation, in [Isa 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002),
[Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005), [Isa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010), &c., precedes their final
prosperity ([Zac 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006), [Zac
12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)); there will, probably, be a
previous period of unbelief even after their return ([Zac
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 57:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 57:16</span></span>

For--referring to the promise in [Isa
57:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014), of restoring Israel when
"contrite" ([Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003); [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021); [Psa
78:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038); [Psa
85:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#005); [Psa
103:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#009), [Psa
103:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018)). God "will not contend for ever"
with His people, for their human spirit would thereby be utterly
crushed, whereas God's object is to chasten, not to destroy them ([Lam
3:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#033); [Mic
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008)). With the ungodly He is "angry
every day" ([Psa 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011); [Rev
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011)).

spirit . . . before me--that is, the human spirit which went forth from
Me ([Num 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022)), answering to "which I
have made" in the parallel clause.

[Isaiah 57:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 57:17</span></span>

covetousness--akin to idolatry; and, like it, having drawn off Israel's
heart from God ([Isa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007); [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011); [Isa
58:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#003); [Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)).

hid me-- ([Isa 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017); [Isa
45:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#015)).

went on frowardly--the result of God's hiding His face ([Psa
81:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#012); [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 57:18</span></span>

Rather, "I have seen his ways (in sin), yet will I heal him," that is,
restore Israel spiritually and temporally ([Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006); [Jer
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#022); [Hos
14:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#004)) \[HORSLEY\].

I will . . . restore comforts unto him and to his mourners--However, the
phrase, "his mourners," favors English Version; "his ways" will thus be
his ways of repentance; and God's pardon on "seeing" them answers to the
like promise ([Isa 61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002); [Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018), [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 57:19</span></span>

fruit of . . . lips--that is, thanksgivings which flow from the lips. I
make men to return thanks to Me ([Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)).

Peace, peace--"perfect peace" (see [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003), Margin; [Joh
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#027)). Primarily, the cessation of
the trouble s now afflicting the Jews, as formerly, under the Babylonian
exile. More generally, the peace which the Gospel proclaims both to
Israel "that is near," and to the Gentiles who are "far off" ([Act
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#039); [Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 57:20</span></span>

when it cannot rest--rather, "for it can have no rest" ([Job
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020), &c.; [Pro
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016)). English Version represents
the sea as occasionally agitated; but the Hebrew expresses that it can
never be at rest.

[Isaiah 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 57:21</span></span>

([Isa 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022); [Kg2
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#022)).

my God--The prophet, having God as his God, speaks in the person of
Israel, prophetically regarded as having now appropriated God and His
"peace" ([Isa 11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)), warning the
impenitent that, while they continue so, they can have no peace.
