<p>
<p>Uzzi--It is supposed that, in his days, the high priesthood was, for unrecorded reasons, transferred from Eleazar's family to Ithamar's, in which it continued for several generations.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010">1 Chronicles 6:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">ch1 6:10</A></FONT></span></p>he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem--It is doubtful whether the person in favor of whom this testimony is borne be Johanan or Azariah. If the former, he is the same as Jehoiada, who rendered important public services (2Ki. 11:1-20); if the latter, it refers to the worthy and independent part he acted in resisting the unwarrantable encroachments of Uzziah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017">Ch2 26:17</A>). 
<p>
<p>in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem--described in this particular manner to distinguish it from the second temple, which was in existence at the time when this history was written.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014">1 Chronicles 6:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">ch1 6:14</A></FONT></span></p>Azariah begat Seraiah--He filled the supreme pontifical office at the destruction of Jerusalem, and, along with his deputy and others, he was executed by Nebuchadnezzar's orders at Riblah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018">Kg2 25:18</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021">Kg2 25:21</A>). The line of high priests, under the first temple, which from Zadok amounted to twelve, terminated with him.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016">1 Chronicles 6:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">ch1 6:16</A></FONT></span></p>The sons of Levi; Gershom, &amp;c.--This repetition (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001">Ch1 6:1</A>) is made, as the historian here begins to trace the genealogy of the Levitical families who were not priests. The list is a long one, comprising the chiefs or heads of their several families until David's reign, who made a new and different classification of them by courses.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020">1 Chronicles 6:20</A></p>

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028">1 Chronicles 6:28</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_028">ch1 6:28</A></FONT></span></p>the sons of Samuel--The sons of Samuel are here named Vashni and Abiah. The first-born is called Joel (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002">Sa1 8:2</A>); and this name is given to him in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033">Ch1 6:33</A>. It is now generally thought by the best critics that, through an error of the copyists, an omission has been made of the oldest son's name, and that Vashni, which is not the name of a person, merely signifies "and the second." This critical emendation of the text makes all clear, as well as consistent with other passages relating to the family of Samuel.

This was a considerable time before the temple was built. 
<p>
<p>they waited on their office according to their order--which David, doubtless by the direction of the Holy Spirit, had instituted for the better regulation of divine worship.

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061">1 Chronicles 6:61</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_061">ch1 6:61</A></FONT></span></p>unto the sons of Kohath, which were left--that is, in addition to the priests belonging to the same family and tribe of Levi. 
<p>
<p>by lot, ten cities-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#026">Jos 21:26</A>). The sacred historian gives an explanation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066">Ch1 6:66</A>). Eight of these are mentioned, but only two of them are taken out of the half tribe of Manasseh (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070">Ch1 6:70</A>). The names of the other two are given (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021">Jos 21:21</A>), where full and detailed notices of these arrangements may be found.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_067">ch1 6:67</A></FONT></span></p>they gave unto them of the cities of refuge--The names of the cities given here are considerably different from those applied to them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013">Jos 21:13-19</A>). In the lapse of centuries, and from the revolutions of society, changes might have been expected to take place in the form or dialectic pronunciation of the names of those cities; and this will sufficiently account for the variations that are found in the lists as enumerated here and in an earlier book. As to these cities themselves that were assigned to the Levites, they were widely remote and separated--partly in fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007">Gen 49:7</A>), and partly that the various districts of the country might obtain a competent supply of teachers who might instruct the people in the knowledge, and animate them to the observance, of a law which had so important a bearing on the promotion both of their private happiness and their national prosperity.
