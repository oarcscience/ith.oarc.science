### [Exodus Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001)

[Exodus 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 22:1</span></span>

LAWS CONCERNING THEFT. (Exo. 22:1-31)

If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep--The law respects the theft of
cattle which constituted the chief part of their property. The penalty
for the theft of a sheep which was slain or sold, was fourfold; for an
ox fivefold, because of its greater utility in labor; but, should the
stolen animal have been recovered alive, a double compensation was all
that was required, because it was presumable he (the thief) was not a
practised adept in dishonesty. A robber breaking into a house at
midnight might, in self-defense, be slain with impunity; but if he was
slain after sunrise, it would be considered murder, for it was not
thought likely an assault would then be made upon the lives of the
occupants. In every case where a thief could not make restitution, he
was sold as a slave for the usual term.

[Exodus 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 22:6</span></span>

If fire break out, and catch in thorns--This refers to the common
practice in the East of setting fire to the dry grass before the fall of
the autumnal rains, which prevents the ravages of vermin, and is
considered a good preparation of the ground for the next crop. The very
parched state of the herbage and the long droughts of summer, make the
kindling of a fire an operation often dangerous, and always requiring
caution from its liability to spread rapidly.

stacks--or as it is rendered "shocks" ([Jdg
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#005); [Job
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026)), means simply a bundle of loose
sheaves.

[Exodus 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">exo 22:26</span></span>

If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, &c.--From the
nature of the case, this is the description of a poor man. No Orientals
undress, but, merely throwing off their turbans and some of their heavy
outer garments, they sleep in the clothes which they wear during the
day. The bed of the poor is usually nothing else than a mat; and, in
winter, they cover themselves with a cloak--a practice which forms the
ground or reason of the humane and merciful law respecting the pawned
coat.

[Exodus 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 22:28</span></span>

gods--a word which is several times in this chapter rendered "judges" or
magistrates.

the ruler of thy people--and the chief magistrate who was also the high
priest, at least in the time of Paul ([Act
23:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001)).
