### [Ezekiel Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 44:2</span></span>

ORDINANCES FOR THE PRINCE AND THE PRIESTS. (Eze. 44:1-31)

shut . . . not be opened-- ([Job
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#014.md); [Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022.md); [Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).md). "Shut" to the people ([Exo
19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#021).md), but open to "the prince"
([Eze 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003).md), he holding the place of
God in political concerns, as the priests do in spiritual. As a mark of
respect to an Eastern monarch, the gate by which he enters is
thenceforth shut to all other persons (compare [Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024).md).

[Ezekiel 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 44:3</span></span>

the prince--not King Messiah, as He never would offer a burnt offering
for Himself, as the prince is to do ([Eze
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze046.htm#004).md). The prince must mean the civil
ruler under Messiah. His connection with the east gate (by which the
Lord had returned to His temple) implies, that, as ruling under God, he
is to stand in a place of peculiar nearness to God. He represents
Messiah, who entered heaven, the true sanctuary, by a way that none
other could, namely, by His own holiness; all others must enter as
sinners by faith in His blood, through grace.

eat bread before the Lord--a custom connected with sacrifices ([Gen
31:54](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#054.md); [Exo
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#012.md); [Exo
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011.md); [Co1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 44:4</span></span>

Directions as to the priests. Their acts of desecration are attributed
to "the house of Israel" ([Eze
44:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#006).md), as the sins of the priesthood
and of the people acted and reacted on one another; "like people, like
priest" ([Jer 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md); [Hos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 44:7</span></span>

uncircumcised in heart--Israelites circumcised outwardly, but wanting
the true circumcision of the heart ([Deu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

uncircumcised in flesh--not having even the outward badge of the
covenant-people.

[Ezekiel 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 44:8</span></span>

keepers . . . for yourselves--such as you yourselves thought fit, not
such as I approve of. Or else, "Ye have not yourselves kept the charge
of My holy things, but have set others as keepers of My charge in My
sanctuary for yourselves" \[MAURER\].

[Ezekiel 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 44:10</span></span>

Levites . . . shall . . . bear--namely, the punishment of

their iniquity . . . Yet they shall be ministers--So Mark, a Levite,
nephew of Barnabas ([Act 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036).md), was
punished by Paul for losing an opportunity of bearing the cross of
Christ, and yet was afterwards admitted into his friendship again, and
showed his zeal ([Act 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#013.md); [Act
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#037.md); [Col
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md); [Ti2
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011).md). One may be a believer, and that
too in a distinguished place, and yet lose some special honor--be
acknowledged as pious, yet be excluded from some dignity \[BENGEL\].

charge at the gates--Better to be "a doorkeeper in the house of God,
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness" ([Psa
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010).md). Though standing as a mere
doorkeeper, it is in the house of God, which hath foundations: whereas
he who dwells with the wicked, dwells in but shifting tents.

[Ezekiel 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 44:15</span></span>

Zadok--The priests of the line of Ithamar were to be discharged from
ministrations in the temple, because of their corruptions, following in
the steps of Eli's sons, against whom the same denunciation was uttered
([Sa1 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#032.md), [Sa1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#035).md). Zadok, according to his name
(which means "righteous") and his line, were to succeed ([Kg1
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#035.md); [Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003).md), as they did not take part in
the general apostasy to the same degree, and perhaps \[FAIRBAIRN\] the
prophet, referring to their original state, speaks of them as they
appeared when first chosen to the office.

[Ezekiel 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 44:17</span></span>

linen--symbolical of purity. Wool soon induces perspiration in the
sultry East and so becomes uncleanly.

[Ezekiel 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 44:18</span></span>

bonnets--turbans.

[Ezekiel 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 44:19</span></span>

not sanctify the people with their garments--namely, those peculiarly
priestly vestments in which they ministered in the sanctuary.

[Ezekiel 44:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 44:20</span></span>

Neither . . . shave . . . heads--as mourners do ([Lev
21:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001).md). The worshippers of the
Egyptian idols Serapis and Isis shaved their heads; another reason why
Jehovah's priests are not to do so.

nor suffer . . . locks to grow long--as the luxurious, barbarians, and
soldiers in warfare did \[JEROME\].

[Ezekiel 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 44:21</span></span>

Neither . . . wine--lest the holy enthusiasm of their devotion should be
mistaken for inebriation, as in Peter's case ([Act
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md), [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md), [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 44:28</span></span>

I am their inheritance-- ([Num 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020.md);
[Deu 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#009.md); [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md); [Jos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014.md), [Jos
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#032).md).

[Ezekiel 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 44:30</span></span>

give . . . priest the first . . . that he may cause the blessing to
rest-- ([Pro 3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#009.md); [Mal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#010).md).
