### [Hebrews Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 5:1</span></span>

CHRIST'S HIGH PRIESTHOOD; NEEDED QUALIFICATIONS; MUST BE A MAN; MUST NOT
HAVE ASSUMED THE DIGNITY HIMSELF, BUT HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY GOD; THEIR
LOW SPIRITUAL PERCEPTIONS A BAR TO PAUL'S SAYING ALL HE MIGHT ON
CHRIST'S MELCHISEDEC-LIKE PRIESTHOOD. ([Heb
5:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001).md)

For--substantiating [Heb 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015.md).

every--that is, every legitimate high priest; for instance, the
Levitical, as he is addressing Hebrews, among whom the Levitical
priesthood was established as the legitimate one. Whatever, reasons
Paul, is excellent in the Levitical priests, is also in Christ, and
besides excellencies which are not in the Levitical priests.

taken from among men--not from among angels, who could not have a fellow
feeling with us men. This qualification Christ has, as being, like the
Levitical priest, a man ([Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md),
[Heb 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016).md). Being "from men," He can
be "for (that is, in behalf of, for the good of) men."

ordained--Greek, "constituted," "appointed."

both gifts--to be joined with "for sins," as "sacrifices" is (the "both
. . . and" requires this); therefore not the Hebrew, "mincha," "unbloody
offerings," but animal whole burnt offerings, spontaneously given.
"Sacrifices" are the animal sacrifices due according to the legal
ordinance \[ESTIUS\].

[Hebrews 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 5:2</span></span>

Who can--Greek, "being able"; not pleasing himself ([Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003).md).

have compassion--Greek, "estimate mildly," "feel leniently," or
"moderately towards"; "to make allowance for"; not showing stern rigor
save to the obstinate ([Heb 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028).md).

ignorant--sins not committed in resistance of light and knowledge, but
as Paul's past sin ([Ti1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md). No
sacrifice was appointed for wilful sin committed with a high hand; for
such were to be punished with death; all other sins, namely, ignorances
and errors, were confessed and expiated with sacrifices by the high
priest.

out of the way--not deliberately and altogether wilfully erring, but
deluded through the fraud of Satan and their own carnal frailty and
thoughtlessness.

infirmity--moral weakness which is sinful, and makes men capable of sin,
and so requires to be expiated by sacrifices. This kind of "infirmity"
Christ had not; He had the "infirmity" of body whereby He was capable of
suffering and death.

[Hebrews 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 5:3</span></span>

by reason hereof--"on account of this" infirmity.

he ought . . . also for himself, to offer for sins--the Levitical priest
ought; in this our High Priest is superior to the Levitical. The second
"for" is a different Greek term from the first; "in behalf of the people
. . . on account of sins."

[Hebrews 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 5:4</span></span>

no man--of any other family but Aaron's, according to the Mosaic law,
can take to himself the office of high priest. This verse is quoted by
some to prove the need of an apostolic succession of ordination in the
Christian ministry; but the reference here is to the priesthood, not the
Christian ministry. The analogy in our Christian dispensation would warn
ministers, seeing that God has separated them from the congregation of
His people to bring them near Himself, and to do the service of His
house, and to minister (as He separated the Levites, Korah with his
company), that content with this, they should beware of assuming the
sacrificial priesthood also, which belongs to Christ alone. The sin of
Korah was, not content with the ministry as a Levite, he took the
sacerdotal priesthood also. No Christian minister, as such, is ever
called Hiereus, that is, sacrificing priest. All Christians, without
distinction, whether ministers or people, have a metaphorical, not a
literal, priesthood. The sacrifices which they offer are spiritual, not
literal, their bodies and the fruit of their lips, praises continually
([Heb 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md). Christ alone had a
proper and true sacrifice to offer. The law sacrifices were typical, not
metaphorical, as the Christian's, nor proper and true, as Christ's. In
Roman times the Mosaic restriction of the priesthood to Aaron's family
was violated.

[Hebrews 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 5:5</span></span>

glorified not himself--did not assume the glory of the priestly office
of Himself without the call of God ([Joh
8:54](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#054).md).

but he that said--that is, the Father glorified Him or appointed Him to
the priesthood. This appointment was involved in, and was the result of,
the Sonship of Christ, which qualified Him for it. None but the divine
Son could have fulfilled such an office ([Heb
10:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md). The connection of Sonship and
priesthood is typified in the Hebrew title for priests being given to
David's sons ([Sa2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#018).md). Christ did
not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from everlasting the
only-begotten of the Father. On His Sonship depended His glorification,
and His being called of God ([Heb
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010).md), as Priest.

[Hebrews 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 5:6</span></span>

He is here called simply "Priest"; in [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), "High Priest." He is a Priest
absolutely, because He stands alone in that character without an equal.
He is "High Priest" in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect
to us, whom He has made priests by throwing open to us access to God
\[BENGEL\]. "The order of Melchisedec" is explained in [Heb
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015.md), "the similitude of Melchisedec."
The priesthood is similarly combined with His kingly office in [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013.md). Melchisedec was at once man,
priest, and king. Paul's selecting as the type of Christ one not of the
stock of Abraham, on which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation
of Messianic universalism.

[Hebrews 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 5:7</span></span>

in the days of his flesh-- ([Heb 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md);
[Heb 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020).md). [Heb
5:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md) state summarily the subject
about to be handled more fully in the seventh and eighth chapters.

when he had offered--rather, "in that He offered." His crying and tears
were part of the experimental lesson of obedience which He submitted to
learn from the Father (when God was qualifying Him for the high
priesthood). "Who" is to be construed with "learned obedience" (or
rather as Greek, "His obedience"; "the obedience" which we all know
about). This all shows that "Christ glorified not Himself to be made an
High Priest" ([Heb 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005).md), but was
appointed thereto by the Father.

prayers and supplications--Greek, "both prayers and supplications." In
Gethsemane, where He prayed thrice, and on the cross, where He cried, My
God, my God . . . probably repeating inwardly all the twenty-second
Psalm. "Prayers" refer to the mind: "supplications" also to the body
(namely, the suppliant attitude) ([Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039).md) \[BENGEL\].

with strong crying and tears--The "tears" are an additional fact here
communicated to us by the inspired apostle, not recorded in the Gospels,
though implied. [Mat 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037.md), "sorrowful
and very heavy." [Mar 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033.md); [Luk
22:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#044.md), "in an agony He prayed more
earnestly . . . His sweat . . . great drops of blood falling down to the
ground." [Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001.md) ("roaring . . .
cry"), [Psa 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002.md), [Psa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019.md), [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md), [Psa
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024.md); [Psa
69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003.md), [Psa
69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010.md), "I wept."

able to save him from death-- [Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036.md), "All things are possible unto
Thee" ([Joh 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027).md). His cry showed His
entire participation of man's infirmity: His reference of His wish to
the will of God, His sinless faith and obedience.

heard in that he feared--There is no intimation in the twenty-second
Psalm, or the Gospels that Christ prayed to be saved from the mere act
of dying. What He feared was the hiding of the Father's countenance. His
holy filial love must rightly have shrunk from this strange and
bitterest of trials without the imputation of impatience. To have been
passively content at the approach of such a cloud would have been, not
faith, but sin. The cup of death He prayed to be freed from was, not
corporal, but spiritual death, that is, the (temporary) separation of
His human soul from the light of God's countenance. His prayer was
"heard" in His Father's strengthening Him so as to hold fast His
unwavering faith under the trial (My God, my God, was still His filial
cry under it, still claiming God as His, though God hid His face), and
soon removing it in answer to His cry during the darkness on the cross,
"My God, my God," &c. But see below a further explanation of how He was
heard. The Greek literally, is, "Was heard from His fear," that is, so
as to be saved from His fear. Compare [Psa
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021.md), which well accords with this,
"Save me from the lion's mouth (His prayer): thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns." Or what better accords with the strict meaning
of the Greek noun, "in consequence of His REVERENTIAL FEAR," that is, in
that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence
of the Father, yet was reverentially cautious by no thought or word of
impatience to give way to a shadow of distrust or want of perfect filial
love. In the same sense [Heb 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md)
uses the noun, and [Heb 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007.md) the verb.
ALFORD somewhat similarly translates, "By reason of His reverent
submission." I prefer "reverent fear." The word in derivation means the
cautious handling of some precious, yet delicate vessel, which with
ruder handling might easily be broken \[TRENCH\]. This fully agrees with
Jesus' spirit, "If it be possible . . . nevertheless not My will, but
Thy will be done"; and with the context, [Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md), "Glorified not Himself to be made
an High Priest," implying reverent fear: wherein it appears He had the
requisite for the office specified [Heb
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md), "No man taketh this honor unto
himself." ALFORD well says, What is true in the Christian's life, that
what we ask from God, though He may not grant in the form we wish, yet
He grants in His own, and that a better form, does not hold good in
Christ's case; for Christ's real prayer, "not My will, but Thine be
done," in consistency with His reverent fear towards the Father, was
granted in the very form in which it was expressed, not in another.

[Hebrews 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 5:8</span></span>

Though He WAS (so it ought to be translated: a positive admitted fact:
not a mere supposition as were would imply) God's divine Son (whence,
even in His agony, He so lovingly and often cried, Father, [Mat
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039).md), yet He learned His (so the
Greek) obedience, not from His Sonship, but from His sufferings. As the
Son, He was always obedient to the Father's will; but the special
obedience needed to qualify Him as our High Priest, He learned
experimentally in practical suffering. Compare [Phi
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md), "equal with God, but . . . took
upon Him the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death," &c. He
was obedient already before His passion, but He stooped to a still more
humiliating and trying form of obedience then. The Greek adage is,
"Pathemata mathemata," "sufferings, disciplinings." Praying and obeying,
as in Christ's case, ought to go hand in hand.

[Hebrews 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 5:9</span></span>

made perfect--completed, brought to His goal of learning and suffering
through death ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md) \[ALFORD\],
namely, at His glorious resurrection and ascension.

author--Greek, "cause."

eternal salvation--obtained for us in the short "days of Jesus' flesh"
([Heb 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007.md); compare [Heb
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#006.md), "for ever," [Isa
45:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#017).md).

unto all . . . that obey him--As Christ obeyed the Father, so must we
obey Him by faith.

[Hebrews 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 5:10</span></span>

Greek, rather, "Addressed by God (by the appellation) High Priest."
Being formally recognized by God as High Priest at the time of His being
"made perfect" ([Heb 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009).md). He was High
Priest already in the purpose of God before His passion; but after it,
when perfected, He was formally addressed so.

[Hebrews 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 5:11</span></span>

Here he digresses to complain of the low spiritual attainments of the
Palestinian Christians and to warn them of the danger of falling from
light once enjoyed; at the same time encouraging them by God's
faithfulness to persevere. At [Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020.md) he resumes the comparison of
Christ to Melchisedec.

hard to be uttered--rather as Greek, "hard of interpretation to speak."
Hard for me to state intelligibly to you owing to your dulness about
spiritual things. Hence, instead of saying many things, he writes in
comparatively few words ([Heb 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022).md).
In the "we," Paul, as usual, includes Timothy with himself in addressing
them.

ye are--Greek, "ye have become dull" (the Greek, by derivation, means
hard to move): this implies that once, when first "enlightened," they
were earnest and zealous, but had become dull. That the Hebrew believers
AT JERUSALEM were dull in spiritual things, and legal in spirit, appears
from [Act 21:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md), where James and
the elders expressly say of the "thousands of Jews which believe," that
"they are all zealous of the law"; this was at Paul's last visit to
Jerusalem, after which this Epistle seems to have been written (see on
[Heb 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012), on "for the time".md).

[Hebrews 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 5:12</span></span>

for the time--considering the long time that you have been Christians.
Therefore this Epistle was not one of those written early.

which be the first principles--Greek, "the rudiments of the beginning
of." A Pauline phrase (see on [Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md); [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009).md). Ye need not only to be taught
the first elements, but also "which they be." They are therefore
enumerated [Heb 6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md) \[BENGEL\].
ALFORD translates, "That someone teach you the rudiments"; but the
position of the Greek, "tina," inclines me to take it interrogatively,
"which," as English Version, Syriac, Vulgate, &c.

of the oracles of God--namely, of the Old Testament: instead of seeing
Christ as the end of the Old Testament Scripture, they were relapsing
towards Judaism, so as not only not to be capable of understanding the
typical reference to Christ of such an Old Testament personage as
Melchisedec, but even much more elementary references.

are become--through indolence.

milk . . . not . . . strong meat--"Milk" refers to such fundamental
first principles as he enumerates in [Heb
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001.md). The solid meat, or food, is not
absolutely necessary for preserving life, but is so for acquiring
greater strength. Especially in the case of the Hebrews, who were much
given to allegorical interpretations of their law, which they so much
venerated, the application of the Old Testament types, to Christ and His
High Priesthood, was calculated much to strengthen them in the Christian
faith \[LIMBORCH\].

[Hebrews 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 5:13</span></span>

useth--Greek, "partaketh," that is, taketh as his portion. Even strong
men partake of milk, but do not make milk their chief, much less their
sole, diet.

the word of righteousness--the Gospel wherein "the righteousness of God
is revealed from faith to faith" ([Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md), and which is called "the
ministration of righteousness" ([Co2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#009).md). This includes the doctrine of
justification and sanctification: the first principles, as well as the
perfection, of the doctrine of Christ: the nature of the offices and
person of Christ as the true Melchisedec, that is, "King of
righteousness" (compare [Mat 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015).md).

[Hebrews 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 5:14</span></span>

strong meat--"solid food."

them . . . of full age--literally, "perfect": akin to "perfection" ([Heb
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md).

by reason of use--Greek, "habit."

senses--organs of sense.

exercised--similarly connected with "righteousness" in [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md).

to discern both good and evil--as a child no longer an infant ([Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016).md): so able to distinguish between
sound and unsound doctrine. The mere child puts into its mouth things
hurtful and things nutritious, without discrimination: but not so the
adult. Paul again alludes to their tendency not to discriminate, but to
be carried about by strange doctrines, in [Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009.md).
