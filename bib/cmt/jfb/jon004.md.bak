[Jonah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#001.md)

JONAH FRETS AT GOD'S MERCY TO NINEVEH: IS REPROVED BY THE TYPE OF A
GOURD. ()

angry--literally, "hot," probably, with grief or vexation, rather than
anger \[FAIRBAIRN\]. How sad the contrast between God's feeling on the
repentance of Nineveh towards Him, and Jonah's feeling on the repentance
of God towards Nineveh. Strange in one who was himself a monument of
mercy on his repentance! We all, like him, need the lesson taught in the
parable of the unforgiving, though forgiven, debtor (). Jonah was
grieved because Nineveh's preservation, after his denunciation, made him
seem a false prophet \[CALVIN\]. But it would make Jonah a demon, not a
man, to have preferred the destruction of six hundred thousand men
rather than that his prophecy should be set aside through God's mercy
triumphing over judgment. And God in that case would have severely
chastised, whereas he only expostulates mildly with him, and by a mode
of dealing, at once gentle and condescending, tries to show him his
error. Moreover, Jonah himself, in apologizing for his vexation, does
not mention the failure of his prediction as the cause: but solely the
thought of God's slowness to anger. This was what led him to flee to
Tarshish at his first commission; not the likelihood then of his
prediction being falsified; for in fact his commission then was not to
foretell Nineveh's downfall, but simply to "cry against" Nineveh's
"wickedness" as having "come up before God." Jonah could hardly have
been so vexed for the letter of his prediction failing, when the end of
his commission had virtually been gained in leading Nineveh to
repentance. This then cannot have been regarded by Jonah as the ultimate
end of his commission. If Nineveh had been the prominent object with
him, he would have rejoiced at the result of his mission. But Israel was
the prominent aim of Jonah, as a prophet of the elect people. Probably
then he regarded the destruction of Nineveh as fitted to be an example
of God's judgment at last suspending His long forbearance so as to
startle Israel from its desperate degeneracy, heightened by its new
prosperity under Jeroboam II at that very time, in a way that all other
means had failed to do. Jonah, despairing of anything effectual being
done for God in Israel, unless there were first given a striking example
of severity, thought when he proclaimed the downfall of Nineveh in forty
days, that now at last God is about to give such an example; so when
this means of awakening Israel was set aside by God's mercy on Nineveh's
repentance, he was bitterly disappointed, not from pride or
mercilessness, but from hopelessness as to anything being possible for
the reformation of Israel, now that his cherished hope is baffled. But
GOD'S plan was to teach Israel, by the example of Nineveh, how
inexcusable is their own impenitence, and how inevitable their ruin if
they persevere. Repenting Nineveh has proved herself more worthy of
God's favor than apostate Israel; the children of the covenant have not
only fallen down to, but actually below, the level of a heathen people;
Israel, therefore, must go down, and the heathen rise above her. Jonah
did not know the important lessons of hope to the penitent, and
condemnation to those amidst outward privileges impenitent, which
Nineveh's preservation on repentance was to have for aftertimes, and to
all ages. He could not foresee that Messiah Himself was thus to apply
that history. A lesson to us that if we could in any particular alter
the plan of Providence, it would not be for the better, but for the
worse \[FAIRBAIRN\].

fled before--I anticipated by fleeing, the disappointment of my design
through Thy long-suffering mercy.

gracious . . . and merciful, &c.--Jonah here has before his mind ; as
Joel () in his turn quotes from Jonah.

[Jonah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 4:3</span></span>

Jonah's impatience of life under disappointed hopes of Israel's
reformation through the destruction of Nineveh, is like that of Elijah
at his plan for reforming Israel (1Ki. 18:1-46) failing through Jezebel
().

[Jonah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 4:4</span></span>

Doest thou well to be angry?--or grieved; rather as the Margin, "Art
thou much angry," or "grieved?" \[FAIRBAIRN with the Septuagint and
Syriac\]. But English Version suits the spirit of the passage, and is
quite tenable in the Hebrew \[GESENIUS\].

[Jonah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#005.md)

made him a booth--that is, a temporary hut of branches and leaves, so
slightly formed as to be open to the wind and sun's heat.

see what would become of the city--The term of forty days had not yet
elapsed, and Jonah did not know that anything more than a suspension, or
mitigation, of judgment had been granted to Nineveh. Therefore, not from
sullennesss, but in order to watch the event from a neighboring station,
he lodged in the booth. As a stranger, he did not know the depth of
Nineveh's repentance; besides, from the Old Testament standpoint he knew
that chastening judgments often followed, as in David's case (, ), even
where sin had been repented of. To show him what he knew not, the
largeness and completeness of God's mercy to penitent Nineveh, and the
reasonableness of it, God made his booth a school of discipline to give
him more enlightened views.

[Jonah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#006.md)

gourd--Hebrew, kikaion; the Egyptian kiki, the "ricinus" or castor-oil
plant, commonly called "palm-christ" (palma-christi). It grows from
eight to ten feet high. Only one leaf grows on a branch, but that leaf
being often more than a foot large, the collective leaves give good
shelter from the heat. It grows rapidly, and fades as suddenly when
injured.

to deliver him from his grief--It was therefore grief, not selfish
anger, which Jonah felt (see on ). Some external comforts will often
turn the mind away from its sorrowful bent.

[Jonah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 4:7</span></span>

a worm--of a particular kind, deadly to the ricinus. A small worm at the
root destroys a large gourd. So it takes but little to make our creature
comforts wither. It should silence discontent to remember, that when our
gourd is gone, our God is not gone.

the next day--after Jonah was so "exceeding glad" (compare ).

[Jonah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 4:8</span></span>

vehement--rather, "scorching"; the Margin, "silent," expressing sultry
stillness, not vehemence.

[Jonah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 4:9</span></span>

(See on ).

I do well to be angry, even unto death--"I am very much grieved, even to
death" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. So the Antitype ().

[Jonah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 4:10</span></span>

The main lesson of the book. If Jonah so pities a plant which cost him
no toil to rear, and which is so short lived and valueless, much more
must Jehovah pity those hundreds of thousands of immortal men and women
in great Nineveh whom He has made with such a display of creative power,
especially when many of them repent, and seeing that, if all in it were
destroyed, "more than six score thousand" of unoffending children,
besides "much cattle," would be involved in the common destruction:
Compare the same argument drawn from God's justice and mercy in . A
similar illustration from the insignificance of a plant, which "to-day
is and to-morrow is cast into the oven," and which, nevertheless, is
clothed by God with surpassing beauty, is given by Christ to prove that
God will care for the infinitely more precious bodies and souls of men
who are to live for ever (). One soul is of more value than the whole
world; surely, then, one soul is of more value than many gourds. The
point of comparison spiritually is the need which Jonah, for the time
being, had of the foliage of the gourd. However he might dispense with
it at other times, now it was necessary for his comfort, and almost for
his life. So now that Nineveh, as a city, fears God and turns to Him,
God's cause needs it, and would suffer by its overthrow, just as Jonah's
material well-being suffered by the withering of the gourd. If there
were any hope of Israel's being awakened by Nineveh's destruction to
fulfil her high destination of being a light to surrounding heathenism,
then there would not have been the same need to God's cause of Nineveh's
preservation, (though there would have always been need of saving the
penitent). But as Israel, after judgments, now with returning prosperity
turns back to apostasy, the means needed to vindicate God's cause, and
provoke Israel, if possible, to jealousy, is the example of the great
capital of heathendom suddenly repenting at the first warning, and
consequently being spared. Thus Israel would see the kingdom of heaven
transplanted from its ancient seat to another which would willingly
yield its spiritual fruits. The tidings which Jonah brought back to his
countrymen of Nineveh's repentance and rescue, would, if believingly
understood, be far more fitted than the news of its overthrow to recall
Israel to the service of God. Israel failed to learn the lesson, and so
was cast out of her land. But even this was not an unmitigated evil.
Jonah was a type, as of Christ, so also of Israel. Jonah, though an
outcast, was highly honored of God in Nineveh; so Israel's outcast
condition would prove no impediment to her serving God's cause still, if
only she was faithful to God. Ezekiel and Daniel were so at Babylon; and
the Jews, scattered in all lands as witnesses for the one true God,
pioneered the way for Christianity, so that it spread with a rapidity
which otherwise was not likely to have attended it \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Jonah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011.md)

that cannot discern between their right hand and their left--children
under three of four years old (). Six score thousand of these, allowing
them to be a fifth of the whole, would give a total population of six
hundred thousand.

much cattle--God cares even for the brute creatures, of which man takes
little account. These in wonderful powers and in utility are far above
the shrub which Jonah is so concerned about. Yet Jonah is reckless as to
their destruction and that of innocent children. The abruptness of the
close of the book is more strikingly suggestive than if the thought had
been followed out in detail.
