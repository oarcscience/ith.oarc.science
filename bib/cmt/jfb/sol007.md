### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 7:1</span></span>

thy feet--rather, "thy goings" ([Psa
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005)). Evident allusion to [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007) : "How beautiful . . . are the
feet of him . . . that publisheth peace" (Shulamite, [Sol
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#013)).

shoes--Sandals are richly jewelled in the East ([Luk
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#022); [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015)). She is evidently "on the
mountains," whither she was wafted ([Sol
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#012)), above the daughters of
Jerusalem, who therefore portray her feet first.

daughter--of God the Father, with whom Jesus Christ is one ([Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009)), "children of (the) God" (of
peace), equivalent to Shulamite ([Psa
45:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010); [Co2
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#018)), as well as bride of Jesus
Christ.

prince's--therefore princely herself, freely giving the word of life to
others, not sparing her "feet," as in [Sol
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#003); [Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011). To act on the offensive is
defensive to ourselves.

joints--rather, "the rounding"; the full graceful curve of the hips in
the female figure; like the rounding of a necklace (as the Hebrew for
"jewels" means). Compare with the English Version, [Eph
4:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013); [Col
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#019). Or, applying it to the girdle
binding together the robes round the hips ([Eph
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014)).

cunning workman-- ([Psa 139:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#014);
[Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010), [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022); [Eph
5:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#029), [Eph
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 7:2</span></span>

navel--rather, "girdle-clasp," called from the part of the person
underneath. The "shoes" ([Sol 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001))
prove that dress is throughout presupposed on all parts where it is
usually worn. She is "a bride adorned for her husband"; the "uncomely
parts," being most adorned ([Co1
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#023)). The girdle-clasp was adorned
with red rubies resembling the "round goblet" (crater or mixer) of
spice-mixed wine (not "liquor," [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002); [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022)). The wine of the "New Testament
in His blood" ([Luk 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020)). The
spiritual exhilaration by it was mistaken for that caused by new wine
([Act 2:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013); [Eph
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#018)).

belly--that is, the vesture on it. As in [Psa
45:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#013), gold and needlework compose
the bride's attire, so golden-colored "wheat" and white "lilies" here.
The ripe grain, in token of harvest joy, used to be decorated with
lilies; so the accumulated spiritual food ([Joh
6:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035); [Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)), free from chaff, not fenced
with thorns, but made attractive by lilies ("believers," [Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002); [Act
2:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046); [Act
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013), in common partaking of it).
Associated with the exhilarating wine cup ([Zac
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017)), as here.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 7:3</span></span>

The daughters of Jerusalem describe her in the same terms as Jesus
Christ in [Sol 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#005). The testimonies of
heaven and earth coincide.

twins--faith and love.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 7:4</span></span>

tower of ivory--In [Sol 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004), Jesus
Christ saith, "a tower of David builded for an armory." Strength and
conquest are the main thought in His description; here, beauty and
polished whiteness; contrast [Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005).

fishpools--seen by BURCKHARDT, clear ([Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)), deep, quiet, and full ([Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010), [Co1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015)).

Heshbon--east of Jordan, residence of the Amorite king, Sihon ([Num
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#025), &c.), afterwards held by Gad.

Bath-rabbim--"daughter of a multitude"; a crowded thoroughfare. Her eyes
([Sol 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)) are called by Jesus Christ,
"doves' eyes," waiting on Him. But here, looked on by the daughters or
Jerusalem, they are compared to a placid lake. She is calm even amidst
the crowd ([Pro 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#002); [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033)).

nose--or, face.

tower of Lebanon--a border-fortress, watching the hostile Damascus.
Towards Jesus Christ her face was full of holy shame (see on [Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001); [Sol
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003)); towards spiritual foes, like a
watchtower ([Hab 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001); [Mar
13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037); [Act
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013)), elevated, so that she looks not
up from earth to heaven, but down from heaven to earth. If we retain
"nose," discernment of spiritual fragrance is meant.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 7:5</span></span>

upon thee--the headdress "upon" her.

Carmel--signifying a well-cultivated field ([Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002)). In [Sol
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015) He is compared to majestic
Lebanon; she here, to fruitful Carmel. Her headdress, or crown ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)). Also the souls won by her ([Th1
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)), a token of her fruitfulness.

purple--royalty ([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006)). As applied
to hair, it expresses the glossy splendor of black hair (literally,
"pendulous hair") so much admired in the East ([Sol
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#001)). While the King compares her hair
to the flowering hair of goats (the token of her subjection), the
daughters of Jerusalem compare it to royal purple.

galleries--(so [Sol 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#017), Margin; [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)). But MAURER translates here,
"flowing ringlets"; with these, as with "thongs" (so LEE, from the
Arabic translates it) "the King is held" bound ([Sol
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#005); [Pro
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025)). Her purple crowns of martyrdom
especially captivated the King, appearing from His galleries ([Act
7:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055)). As Samson's strength was in
his locks ([Jdg 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017)). Here first the
daughters see the King themselves.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 7:6</span></span>

Nearer advance of the daughters to the Church ([Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047); [Act
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013), end). Love to her is the first
token of love to Him ([Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001), end).

delights--fascinating charms to them and to the King ([Sol
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#005); [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004), Hephzi-bah). Hereafter, too
([Zep 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017); [Mal
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#012); [Rev
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 7:7</span></span>

palm tree-- ([Psa 92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012)). The sure
sign of water near ([Exo 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#027); [Joh
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038)).

clusters--not of dates, as MOODY STUART thinks. The parallelism ([Sol
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008)), "clusters of the vine," shows it
is here clusters of grapes. Vines were often trained (termed "wedded")
on other trees.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 7:8</span></span>

The daughters are no longer content to admire, but resolve to lay hold
of her fruits, high though these be. The palm stem is bare for a great
height, and has its crown of fruit-laden boughs at the summit. It is the
symbol of triumphant joy ([Joh 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#013));
so hereafter ([Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009)).

breasts-- ([Isa 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011)).

the vine--Jesus Christ ([Hos 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#007),
end; [Joh 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)).

nose--that is, breath; the Holy Ghost breathed into her nostrils by Him,
whose "mouth is most sweet" ([Sol
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016)).

apples--citrons, off the tree to which He is likened ([Sol
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 7:9</span></span>

roof of thy mouth--thy voice ([Pro
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023)).

best wine--the new wine of the gospel kingdom ([Mar
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#025)), poured out at Pentecost ([Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004), [Act
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013), [Act
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017)).

for my beloved-- ([Sol 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010)). Here
first the daughters call Him theirs, and become one with the bride. The
steps successively are ([Sol 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#005))
where they misjudge her ([Sol 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#011));
[Sol 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#008), where the possibility of
their finding Him, before she regained Him, is expressed; [Sol
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#009) ([Sol
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#001); [Sol
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006), [Sol
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#009); [Joh
4:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#042)).

causing . . . asleep to speak-- ([Isa
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006); [Mar
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019); [Act
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)). Jesus Christ's first miracle
turned water into "good wine kept until now" ([Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010)); just as the Gospel revives
those asleep and dying under the law ([Pro
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#006); [Rom
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009), [Rom
7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024); [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 7:10</span></span>

Words of the daughters of Jerusalem and the bride, now united into one
([Act 4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032)). They are mentioned again
distinctly ([Sol 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#004)), as fresh
converts were being added from among enquirers, and these needed to be
charged not to grieve the Spirit.

his desire is toward me--strong assurance. He so desires us, as to give
us sense of His desire toward us ([Psa
139:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#017); [Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020); [Jo1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#016)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 7:11</span></span>

field--the country. "The tender grape (MAURER translates, flowers) and
vines" occurred before ([Sol 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013)).
But here she prepares for Him all kinds of fruit old and new; also, she
anticipates, in going forth to seek them, communion with Him in "loves."
"Early" implies immediate earnestness. "The villages" imply distance
from Jerusalem. At Stephen's death the disciples were scattered from it
through Judea and Samaria, preaching the word (Acts 8:4-25). Jesus
Christ was with them, confirming the word with miracles. They gathered
the old fruits, of which Jesus Christ had sown the seed ([Joh
4:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039)), as well as new fruits.

lodge--forsaking home for Jesus Christ's sake ([Mat
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 7:12</span></span>

([Mar 1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035); [Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004); [Gal
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)). Assurance fosters diligence,
not indolence.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 7:13</span></span>

mandrakes--Hebrew, dudaim, from a root meaning "to love"; love apples,
supposed to exhilarate the spirits and excite love. Only here and [Gen
30:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#014). Atropa mandragora of
LINNÃ†US; its leaves like lettuce, but dark green, flowers purple, root
forked, fruit of the size of an apple, ruddy and sweet-smelling,
gathered in wheat harvest, that is, in May (Mariti, ii. 195).

gates--the entrance to the kiosk or summer house. Love "lays up" the
best of everything for the person beloved ([Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031); [Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011)), thereby really, though
unconsciously, laying up for itself ([Ti1
6:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#018)).
