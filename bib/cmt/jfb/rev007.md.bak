### [Revelation Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 7:1</span></span>

SEALING OF THE ELECT OF ISRAEL. THE COUNTLESS MULTITUDE OF THE GENTILE
ELECT. (Rev. 7:1-17)

And--so B and Syriac. But A, C, Vulgate, and Coptic omit "and."

after these things--A, B, C, and Coptic read, "after this." The two
visions in this chapter come in as an episode after the sixth seal, and
before the seventh seal. It is clear that, though "Israel" may elsewhere
designate the spiritual Israel, "the elect (Church) on earth"
\[ALFORD\], here, where the names of the tribes one by one are
specified, these names cannot have any but the literal meaning. The
second advent will be the time of the restoration of the kingdom to
Israel, when the times of the Gentiles shall have been fulfilled, and
the Jews shall at last say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of
the Lord." The period of the Lord's absence has been a blank in the
history of the Jews as a nation. As then Revelation is the Book of the
Second Advent \[DE BURGH\], naturally mention of God's restored favor to
Israel occurs among the events that usher in Christ's advent.

earth . . . sea . . . tree--The judgments to descend on these are in
answer to the martyrs' prayer under the fifth seal. Compare the same
judgments under the fifth trumpet, the sealed being exempt ([Rev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004).md).

on any tree--Greek, "against any tree" (Greek, "epi ti dendron": but "on
the earth," Greek, "epi tees gees").

[Revelation 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 7:2</span></span>

from the east--Greek, "the rising of the sun." The quarter from which
God's glory oftenest manifests itself.

[Revelation 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 7:3</span></span>

Hurt not--by letting loose the destructive winds.

till we have sealed the servants of our God--parallel to [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031.md), "His angels . . . shall gather
together His elect from the four winds." God's love is such, that He
cannot do anything in the way of judgment, till His people are secured
from hurt ([Gen 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022).md). Israel, at the
eve of the Lord's coming, shall be found re-embodied as a nation; for
its tribes are distinctly specified (Joseph, however, being substituted
for Dan; whether because Antichrist is to come from Dan, or because Dan
is to be Antichrist's especial tool \[ARETAS, tenth century\], compare
[Gen 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md); [Jer
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#016.md); [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md); just as there was a Judas among
the Twelve). Out of these tribes a believing remnant will be preserved
from the judgments which shall destroy all the Antichristian confederacy
([Rev 6:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012).md), and shall be
transfigured with the elect Church of all nations, namely, 144,000 (or
whatever number is meant by this symbolical number), who shall
faithfully resist the seductions of Antichrist, while the rest of the
nation, restored to Palestine in unbelief, are his dupes, and at last
his victims. Previously to the Lord's judgments on Antichrist and his
hosts, these latter shall destroy two-thirds of the nation, one-third
escaping, and, by the Spirit's operation through affliction, turning to
the Lord, which remnant shall form the nucleus on earth of the Israelite
nation that is from this time to stand at the head of the millennial
nations of the world. Israel's spiritual resurrection shall be "as life
from the dead" to all the nations. As now a regeneration goes on here
and there of individuals, so there shall then be a regeneration of
nations universally, and this in connection with Christ's coming. [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md); "this generation (the Jewish
nation) shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled," which
implies that Israel can no more pass away before Christ's advent, than
Christ's own words can pass away (the same Greek), [Mat
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035.md). So exactly [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md); [Zac
14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), [Zac
14:9-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md); compare [Zac
12:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md); [Zac
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md). So also [Eze
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#017.md); [Eze
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md), especially [Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md). Compare also [Eze
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md) with [Rev
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005.md), where the final judgments
actually fall on the earth, with the same accompaniment, the fire of the
altar cast into the earth, including the fire scattered over the city.
So again, [Rev 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), the same 144,000
appear on Zion with the Father's name in their forehead, at the close of
the section, the twelfth through fourteenth chapters, concerning the
Church and her foes. Not that the saints are exempt from trial: [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md) proves the contrary; but their
trials are distinct from the destroying judgments that fall on the
world; from these they are exempted, as Israel was from the plagues of
Egypt, especially from the last, the Israelite doors having the
protecting seal of the blood-mark.

foreheads--the most conspicuous and noblest part of man's body; on which
the helmet, "the hope of salvation," is worn.

[Revelation 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 7:4</span></span>

Twelve is the number of the tribes, and appropriate to the Church: three
by four: three, the divine number, multiplied by four, the number for
world-wide extension. Twelve by twelve implies fixity and completeness,
which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000. A thousand implies the world
perfectly pervaded by the divine; for it is ten, the world number,
raised to the power of three, the number of God.

of all the tribes--literally, "out of every tribe"; not 144,000 of each
tribe, but the aggregate of the twelve thousand from every tribe.

children--Greek, "sons of Israel." [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); [Rev
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md), are no objection, as ALFORD
thinks, to the literal Israel being meant; for, in consummated glory,
still the Church will be that "built on the foundation of the (Twelve)
apostles (Israelites), Jesus Christ (an Israelite) being the chief
corner-stone." Gentile believers shall have the name of Jerusalem
written on them, in that they shall share the citizenship antitypical to
that of the literal Jerusalem.

[Revelation 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 7:5</span></span>

Judah (meaning praise) stands first, as Jesus' tribe. Benjamin, the
youngest, is last; and with him is associated second last, Joseph.
Reuben, as originally first-born, comes next after Judah, to whom it
gave place, having by sin lost its primogeniture right. Besides the
reason given above (see on [Rev 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002).md),
another akin for the omission of Dan, is, its having been the first to
lapse into idolatry (Jdg. 18:1-31); for which same reason the name
Ephraim, also (compare [Jdg 17:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#001.md);
[Hos 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017).md), is omitted, and Joseph
substituted. Also, it had been now for long almost extinct. Long before,
the Hebrews say \[GROTIUS\], it was reduced to the one family of Hussim,
which perished subsequently in the wars before Ezra's time. Hence it is
omitted in the fourth through eighth chapters of First Chronicles. Dan's
small numbers are joined here to Naphtali's, whose brother he was by the
same mother \[BENGEL\]. The twelve times twelve thousand sealed ones of
Israel are the nucleus of transfigured humanity \[AUBERLEN\], to which
the elect Gentiles are joined, "a multitude which no man could number,"
[Rev 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md) (that is, the Church of Jews
and Gentiles indiscriminately, in which the Gentiles are the predominant
element, [Luk 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024.md). The word
"tribes," Greek, implies that believing Israelites are in this countless
multitude). Both are in heaven, yet ruling over the earth, as ministers
of blessing to its inhabitants: while upon earth the world of nations is
added to the kingdom of Israel. The twelve apostles stand at the head of
the whole. The upper and the lower congregation, though distinct, are
intimately associated.

[Revelation 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 7:9</span></span>

no man--Greek, "no one."

of all nations--Greek, "OUT OF every nation." The human race is "one
nation" by origin, but afterwards separated itself into tribes, peoples,
and tongues; hence, the one singular stands first, followed by the three
plurals.

kindreds--Greek, "tribes."

people--Greek, "peoples." The "first-fruits unto the Lamb," the 144,000
([Rev 14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001).md) of Israel, are followed
by a copious harvest of all nations, an election out of the Gentiles, as
the 144,000 are an election out of Israel (see on [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003).md).

white robes--(See on [Rev 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#011.md); also
[Rev 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md), [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md); [Rev
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004).md).

palms in . . . hands--the antitype to Christ's entry into Jerusalem
amidst the palm-bearing multitude. This shall be just when He is about
to come visibly and take possession of His kingdom. The palm branch is
the symbol of joy and triumph. It was used at the feast of tabernacles,
on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when they kept feast to God
in thanksgiving for the ingathered fruits. The antitype shall be the
completed gathering in of the harvest of the elect redeemed here
described. Compare [Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md), whence
it appears that the earthly feast of tabernacles will be renewed, in
commemoration of Israel's preservation in her long wilderness-like
sojourn among the nations from which she shall now be delivered, just as
the original typical feast was to commemorate her dwelling for forty
years in booths or tabernacles in the literal wilderness.

[Revelation 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 7:10</span></span>

cried--Greek, "cry," in the three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, Vulgate,
Syriac, and Coptic. It is their continuing, ceaseless employment.

Salvation--literally, "THE salvation"; all the praise of our salvation
be ascribed to our God. At the Lord's entry into Jerusalem, the type,
similarly "salvation" is the cry of the palm-bearing multitudes. Hosanna
means "save us now"; taken from [Psa
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md), in which Psalm ([Psa
118:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md), [Psa
118:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#021.md), [Psa
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026).md) the same connection occurs
between salvation, the tabernacles of the righteous, and the Jews' cry
to be repeated by the whole nation at Christ's coming, "Blessed be He
that cometh in the name of the Lord."

[Revelation 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 7:11</span></span>

The angels, as in [Rev 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md), in their
turn take up the anthem of praise. There it was "many angels," here it
is "all the angels."

stood--"were standing" \[ALFORD\].

[Revelation 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 7:12</span></span>

Greek, "The blessing, the glory, the wisdom, the thanksgiving, the
honor, the power, the might \[the doxology is sevenfold, implying its
totality and completeness\], unto the ages of the ages."

[Revelation 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 7:13</span></span>

answered--namely, to my thoughts; spoke, asking the question which might
have been expected to arise in John's mind from what has gone before.
One of the twenty-four elders, representing the Old and New Testament
ministry, appropriately acts as interpreter of this vision of the
glorified Church.

What, &c.--Greek order, "These which are arrayed in white robes, WHO are
they?"

[Revelation 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 7:14</span></span>

Sir--Greek, "Lord." B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic versions, and CYPRIAN
read, "My Lord." A omits "My," as English Version.

thou knowest--taken from [Eze 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003.md).
Comparatively ignorant ourselves of divine things, it is well for us to
look upward for divinely communicated knowledge.

came--rather as Greek, "come"; implying that they are just come.

great tribulation--Greek, "THE great tribulation"; "the tribulation, the
great one," namely, the tribulation to which the martyrs were exposed
under the fifth seal, the same which Christ foretells as about to
precede His coming ([Mat 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#021.md), great
tribulation), and followed by the same signs as the sixth seal ([Mat
24:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md), compare [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); including also retrospectively
all the tribulation which the saints of all ages have had to pass
through. Thus this seventh chapter is a recapitulation of the vision of
the six seals, Rev. 6:1-17, to fill up the outline there given in that
part of it which affects the faithful of that day. There, however, their
number was waiting to be completed, but here it is completed, and they
are seen taken out of the earth before the judgments on the
Antichristian apostasy; with their Lord, they, and all His faithful
witnesses and disciples of past ages, wait for His coming and their
coming to be glorified and reign together with Him. Meanwhile, in
contrast with their previous sufferings, they are exempt from the
hunger, thirst, and scorching heats of their life on earth ([Rev
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#016).md), and are fed and refreshed by
the Lamb of God Himself ([Rev 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md);
[Rev 14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013).md); an earnest of their future
perfect blessedness in both body and soul united ([Rev
21:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001).md).

washed . . . robes . . . white in the blood of . . . Lamb-- ([Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md); [Jo1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md); compare [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); [Zac
3:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003).md). Faith applies to the heart the
purifying blood; once for all for justification, continually throughout
the life for sanctification.

[Revelation 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 7:15</span></span>

Therefore--because they are so washed white; for without it they could
never have entered God's holy heaven; [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014.md), "Blessed are those who wash
their robes (the oldest manuscripts reading), that they may have right
to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city";
[Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Eph
5:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md).

before--Greek, "in the presence of." [Mat
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md), "face to face."

throne . . . temple--These are connected because we can approach the
heavenly King only through priestly mediation; therefore, Christ is at
once King and Priest on His throne.

day and night--that is, perpetually; as those approved of as priests by
the Sanhedrim were clothed in white, and kept by turns a perpetual watch
in the temple at Jerusalem; compare as to the singers, [Ch1
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#033.md), "day and night"; [Psa
134:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md). Strictly "there is no night" in
the heavenly sanctuary ([Rev 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#005).md).

in his temple--in what is the heavenly analogue to His temple on earth,
for strictly there is "no temple therein" ([Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md), "God and the Lamb are the
temple" filling the whole, so that there is no distinction of sacred and
secular places; the city is the temple, and the temple the city. Compare
[Rev 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md), "the four living creatures
rest not day and night, saying, Holy," &c.

shall dwell among them--rather (Greek, "scenosei ep' autous"), "shall be
the tabernacle over them" (compare [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md); [Lev
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#011.md), especially [Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027).md). His dwelling among them is to
be understood as a secondary truth, besides what is expressed, namely,
His being their covert. When once He tabernacled among us as the Word
made flesh, He was in great lowliness; then He shall be in great glory.

[Revelation 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 7:16</span></span>

([Isa 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#010).md).

hunger no more--as they did here.

thirst any more-- ([Joh 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013).md).

the sun--literally, scorching in the East. Also, symbolically, the sun
of persecution.

neither . . . light--Greek, "by no means at all . . . light" (fall).

heat--as the sirocco.

[Revelation 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 7:17</span></span>

in the midst of the throne--that is, in the middle point in front of the
throne ([Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006).md).

feed--Greek, "tend as a shepherd."

living fountains of water--A, B, Vulgate, and CYPRIAN read, (eternal)
"life's fountains of waters." "Living" is not supported by the old
authorities.
