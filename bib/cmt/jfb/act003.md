### [Acts Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001)

[Acts 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 3:1</span></span>

PETER HEALS A LAME MAN AT THE TEMPLE GATE--HS ADDRESS TO THE WONDERING
MULTITUDE. (Acts 3:1-26)

Peter and John--already associated by their Master, first with James
([Mar 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029); [Mar
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037); [Mar
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002)), then by themselves ([Luk
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#008); and see [Joh
13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#023)). Now we find them constantly
together, but John (yet young) only as a silent actor.

went up--were going up, were on their way.

[Acts 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 3:2</span></span>

a certain man lame from his mother's womb--and now "above forty years
old" ([Act 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#022)).

was carried--was wont to be carried.

[Acts 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 3:4</span></span>

Peter fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us. And he gave
heed--that, through the eye, faith might be aided in its birth.

[Acts 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 3:6</span></span>

Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee--What a
lofty superiority breathes in these words!

In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk--These words,
uttered with supernatural power, doubtless begat in this poor man the
faith that sent healing virtue through his diseased members.

[Acts 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 3:7</span></span>

And he took . . . and lifted him up--precisely what his Lord had done to
his own mother-in-law ([Mar 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#031)).

his feet--"soles."

and ankle bones, &c.--the technical language of a physician ([Col
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)).

[Acts 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 3:8</span></span>

leaping up, stood . . . walked . . . entered the temple walking,
leaping, and praising God--Every word here is emphatic, expressing the
perfection of the cure, as [Act 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#007)
its immediateness.

[Acts 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 3:9</span></span>

all the people saw him, &c.--as they assembled at the hour of public
prayer, in the temple courts; so that the miracle had the utmost
publicity.

[Acts 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 3:10</span></span>

they knew that it was he which sat for alms, &c.--(Compare [Joh
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008)).

[Acts 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 3:11</span></span>

the lame man . . . held, &c.--This is human nature.

all the people ran together unto them in the porch, &c.--How vividly do
these graphic details bring the whole scene before us! Thus was Peter
again furnished with a vast audience, whose wonder at the spectacle of
the healed beggar clinging to his benefactors prepared them to listen
with reverence to his words.

[Acts 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 3:12</span></span>

why marvel at this?--For miracles are marvels only in relation to the
limited powers of man.

as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to
walk--Neither the might nor the merit of the cure are due to us, mere
agents of Him whom we preach.

[Acts 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 3:13</span></span>

The God of Abraham, &c.--(See on [Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022); [Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)).

hath glorified his Son Jesus--rather, "his Servant Jesus," as the same
word is rendered in [Mat 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018), but in
that high sense in which Isaiah applies it always to Messiah ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006); [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)). When "Son" is intended a
different word is used.

whom ye delivered up, &c.--With what heroic courage does Peter here
charge his auditors with the heaviest of all conceivable crimes, and
with what terrific strength of language are these charges clothed!

[Acts 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 3:15</span></span>

killed the Prince of life--Glorious paradox, but how piercing to the
conscience of the auditors.

[Acts 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 3:16</span></span>

his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong,
&c.--With what skill does the apostle use the miracle both to glorify
his ascended Lord and bring the guilt of His blood more resistlessly
home to his audience!

[Acts 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 3:17</span></span>

And now, brethren--Our preacher, like his Master, "will not break the
bruised reed." His heaviest charges are prompted by love, which now
hastens to assuage the wounds it was necessary to inflict.

I wot--"know."

through ignorance ye did it--(See marginal references, [Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034); [Act
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#027); [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009)).

[Acts 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 3:18</span></span>

that Christ--The best manuscripts read, "that His Christ."

should suffer--The doctrine of a SUFFERING MESSIAH was totally at
variance with the current views of the Jewish Church, and hard to digest
even by the Twelve, up to the day of their Lord's resurrection. Our
preacher himself revolted at it, and protested against it, when first
nakedly announced, for which he received a terrible rebuke. Here he
affirms it to be the fundamental truth of ancient prophecy realized
unwittingly by the Jews themselves, yet by a glorious divine ordination.
How great a change had the Pentecostal illumination wrought upon his
views!

[Acts 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 3:19</span></span>

when the times of refreshing shall come--rather, "in order that the
times of refreshing may come"; that long period of repose, prosperity
and joy, which all the prophets hold forth to the distracted Church and
this miserable world, as eventually to come, and which is here, as in
all the prophets, made to turn upon the national conversion of Israel.

[Acts 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 3:20</span></span>

he shall send Jesus Christ--The true reading is, "He shall send your
predestinated (or foreordained) Messiah, Jesus."

[Acts 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 3:21</span></span>

until the times--embracing the whole period between the ascension and
the second advent of Christ.

restitution of all things--comprehending, probably, the rectification of
all the disorders of the fall.

[Acts 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 3:22</span></span>

a prophet . . . like unto me--particularly in intimacy of communication
with God ([Num 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006)), and as the
mediatorial Head of a new order of things ([Heb
3:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002)). Peter takes it for granted
that, in the light of all he had just said, it would be seen at once
that One only had any claim to be that Prophet.

him shall ye hear in all things, &c.--This part of the prediction is
emphatically added, in order to shut up the audience to the obedience of
faith, on pain of being finally "cut off" from the congregation of the
righteous ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001)).

[Acts 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 3:24</span></span>

foretold of these days--of Messiah; all pointing to "the time of
reformation" ([Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010)), though with
more or less distinctness.

[Acts 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 3:25</span></span>

Ye are the children . . . of the covenant--and so the natural heirs of
its promises.

in thy seed, &c.--(See on [Gal 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008),
&c.).

[Acts 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 3:26</span></span>

God, having raised up--not from the dead, but having provided, prepared,
and given.

his Son Jesus--"His Servant Jesus" (see on [Act
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013)).

sent him to bless you--literally, "sent Him blessing you," as if laden
with blessing.

in turning away every one of you from his iniquities--that is, "Hitherto
we have all been looking too much for a Messiah who should shed outward
blessings upon the nation generally, and through it upon the world. But
we have learned other things, and now announce to you that the great
blessing with which Messiah has come laden is the turning away of every
one of you from his iniquities." With what divine skill does the
apostle, founding on resistless facts, here drive home to the conscience
of his auditors their guilt in crucifying the Lord of Glory; then soothe
their awakened minds by assurances of forgiveness on turning to the
Lord, and a glorious future as soon as this shall come to pass, to
terminate with the Personal Return of Christ from the heavens whither He
has ascended; ending all with warnings, from their own Scriptures, to
submit to Him if they would not perish, and calls to receive from Him
the blessings of salvation.
