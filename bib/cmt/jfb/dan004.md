### [Daniel Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001)

[Daniel 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 4:1</span></span>

EDICT OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR CONTAINING HIS SECOND DREAM, RELATING TO
HIMSELF. (Dan. 4:1-37)

Peace--the usual salutation in the East, shalom, whence "salaam." The
primitive revelation of the fall, and man's alienation from God, made
"peace" to be felt as the first and deepest want of man. The Orientals
(as the East was the cradle of revelation) retained the word by
tradition.

[Daniel 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 4:2</span></span>

I thought it good--"It was seemly before me" ([Psa
107:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#002)).

signs--tokens significant of God's omnipotent agency. The plural is
used, as it comprises the marvellous dream, the marvellous
interpretation of it, and its marvellous issue.

[Daniel 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 4:4</span></span>

I was . . . at rest--my wars over, my kingdom at peace.

flourishing--"green." Image from a tree ([Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008)). Prosperous ([Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032)).

[Daniel 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 4:6</span></span>

It may seem strange that Daniel was not first summoned. But it was
ordered by God's providence that he should be reserved to the last, in
order that all mere human means should be proved vain, before God
manifested His power through His servant; thus the haughty king was
stripped of all fleshly confidences. The Chaldees were the king's
recognized interpreters of dreams; whereas Daniel's interpretation of
the one in Dan. 2:24-45 had been a peculiar case, and very many years
before; nor had he been consulted on such matters since.

[Daniel 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">dan 4:8</span></span>

Belteshazzar--called so from the god Bel or Belus (see on [Dan
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007)).

[Daniel 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 4:9</span></span>

spirit of the holy gods--Nebuchadnezzar speaks as a heathen, who yet has
imbibed some notions of the true God. Hence he speaks of "gods" in the
plural but gives the epithet "holy," which applies to Jehovah alone, the
heathen gods making no pretension to purity, even in the opinion of
their votaries ([Deu 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031); compare
[Isa 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011)). "I know" refers to his
knowledge of Daniel's skill many years before ([Dan
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008)); hence he calls him "master of
the magicians."

troubleth--gives thee difficulty in explaining it.

[Daniel 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 4:10</span></span>

tree--So the Assyrian is compared to a "cedar" ([Eze
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003); compare [Eze
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024)).

in the midst of the earth--denoting its conspicuous position as the
center whence the imperial authority radiated in all directions.

[Daniel 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 4:12</span></span>

beasts . . . shadow under it--implying that God's purpose in
establishing empires in the world is that they may be as trees affording
men "fruits" for "meat," and a "shadow" for "rest" (compare [Lam
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020)). But the world powers abuse
their trust for self; therefore Messiah comes to plant the tree of His
gospel kingdom, which alone shall realize God's purpose ([Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023); [Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032)). HERODOTUS \[7.19\] mentions a
dream (probably suggested by the tradition of this dream of
Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel) which Xerxes had; namely, that he was crowned
with olive, and that the branches of the olive filled the whole earth,
but that afterwards the crown vanished from his head: signifying his
universal dominion soon to come to an end.

[Daniel 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 4:13</span></span>

watcher and an holy one--rather, "even an holy one." Only one angel is
intended, and he not one of the bad, but of the holy angels. Called a
"watcher," because ever on the watch to execute God's will \[JEROME\],
([Psa 103:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020)). Compare as to their
watchfulness, [Rev 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008), "full of eyes
within . . . they rest not day and night." Also they watch good men
committed to their charge ([Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007);
[Heb 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014)); and watch over the evil to
record their sins, and at God's bidding at last punish them ([Jer
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016)), "watchers" applied to human
instruments of God's vengeance. As to GOD ([Dan
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014); [Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012); [Job
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016); [Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027)). In a good sense ([Gen
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#049); [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028)). The idea of heavenly
"watchers" under the supreme God (called in the Zendavesta of the
Persian Zoroaster, Ormuzd) was founded on the primeval revelation as to
evil angels having watched for an opportunity until they succeeded in
tempting man to his ruin, and good angels ministering to God's servants
(as Jacob, [Gen 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015); [Gen
32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001)). Compare the watching over
Abraham for good, and over Sodom for wrath after long watching in vain
for good men it it, for whose sake He would spare it, [Gen
18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023); and over Lot for good, Gen.
19:1-38 Daniel fitly puts in Nebuchadnezzar's mouth the expression,
though not found elsewhere in Scripture, yet substantially sanctioned by
it ([Ch2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009); [Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003); [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019)), and natural to him according
to Oriental modes of thought.

[Daniel 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 4:14</span></span>

Hew down-- ([Mat 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#010); [Luk
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007)). The holy ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014)) one incites his fellow angels to
God's appointed work (compare [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015), [Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018)).

beasts get away from under it--It shall no longer afford them shelter
([Eze 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#012)).

[Daniel 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 4:15</span></span>

stump--The kingdom is still reserved secure for him at last, as a tree
stump secured by a hoop of brass and iron from being split by the sun's
heat, in the hope of its growing again ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001); compare [Job
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007)). BARNES refers it to the
chaining of the royal maniac.

[Daniel 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 4:16</span></span>

heart--understanding ([Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010)).

times--that is, "years" ([Dan 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)).
"Seven" is the perfect number: a week of years: a complete revolution of
time accompanying a complete revolution in his state of mind.

[Daniel 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 4:17</span></span>

demand--that is, determination; namely, as to the change to which
Nebuchadnezzar is to be doomed. A solemn council of the heavenly ones is
supposed (compare [Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001)), over which God presides supreme.
His "decree" and "word" are therefore said to be theirs (compare [Dan
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#024), "decree of the Most High"); "the
decree of the watchers," "the word of the holy ones." For He has placed
particular kingdoms under the administration of angelic beings, subject
to Him ([Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013), [Dan
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)). The word "demand," in the
second clause, expresses a distinct idea from the first clause. Not only
as members of God's council ([Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010); [Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019); [Psa
103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021); [Zac
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010)) do they subscribe to His
"decree," but that decree is in answer to their prayers, wherein they
demand that every mortal who tries to obscure the glory of God shall be
humbled \[CALVIN\]. Angels are grieved when God's prerogative is in the
least infringed. How awful to Nebuchadnezzar to know that angels plead
against him for his pride, and that the decree has been passed in the
high court of heaven for his humiliation in answer to angels' demands!
The conceptions are moulded in a form peculiarly adapted to
Nebuchadnezzar's modes of thought.

the living--not as distinguished from the dead, but from the inhabitants
of heaven, who "know" that which the men of the world need to the taught
([Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016)); the ungodly confess there
is a God, but would gladly confine Him to heaven. But, saith Daniel, God
ruleth not merely there, but "in the kingdom of men."

basest--the lowest in condition ([Sa1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008); [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052)). It is not one's talents,
excellency, or noble birth, but God's will, which elevates to the
throne. Nebuchadnezzar abased to the dunghill, and then restored, was to
have in himself an experimental proof of this ([Dan
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037)).

[Daniel 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 4:19</span></span>

Daniel . . . Belteshazzar--The use of the Hebrew as well as the Chaldee
name, so far from being an objection, as some have made it, is an
undesigned mark of genuineness. In a proclamation to "all people," and
one designed to honor the God of the Hebrews, Nebuchadnezzar would
naturally use the Hebrew name (derived from El, "God," the name by which
the prophet was best known among his countrymen), as well as the Gentile
name by which he was known in the Chaldean empire.

astonied--overwhelmed with awe at the terrible import of the dream.

one hour--the original means often "a moment," or "short time," as in
[Dan 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006), [Dan
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#015).

let not the dream . . . trouble thee--Many despots would have punished a
prophet who dared to foretell his overthrow. Nebuchadnezzar assures
Daniel he may freely speak out.

the dream be to them that hate thee--We are to desire the prosperity of
those under whose authority God's providence has placed us ([Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007)). The wish here is not so much
against others, as for the king: a common formula ([Sa2
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#032)). It is not the language of
uncharitable hatred.

[Daniel 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 4:20</span></span>

The tree is the king. The branches, the princes. The leaves, the
soldiers. The fruits, the revenues. The shadow, the protection afforded
to dependent states.

[Daniel 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 4:22</span></span>

It is thou--He speaks pointedly, and without circumlocution ([Sa2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#007)). While pitying the king, he
uncompromisingly pronounces his sentence of punishment. Let ministers
steer the mean between, on the one hand, fulminations against sinners
under the pretext of zeal, without any symptom of compassion; and, on
the other, flattery of sinners under the pretext of moderation.

to the end of the earth-- ([Jer
27:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006)). To the Caspian, Euxine, and
Atlantic seas.

[Daniel 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 4:24</span></span>

decree of the Most High--What was termed in [Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017) by Nebuchadnezzar, "the decree of
the watchers," is here more accurately termed by Daniel, "the decree of
the Most High." They are but His ministers.

[Daniel 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 4:25</span></span>

they shall drive thee--a Chaldee idiom for "thou shalt be driven."
Hypochondriacal madness was his malady, which "drove" him under the
fancy that he was a beast, to "dwell with the beasts"; [Dan
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034) proves this, "mine understanding
returned." The regency would leave him to roam in the large
beast-abounding parks attached to the palace.

eat grass--that is, vegetables, or herbs in general ([Gen
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018)).

they shall wet thee--that is, thou shalt be wet.

till thou know, &c.-- ([Psa 83:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#017);
[Jer 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005)).

[Daniel 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 4:26</span></span>

thou shalt have known, &c.--a promise of spiritual grace to him, causing
the judgment to humble, not harden, his heart.

heavens do rule--The plural is used, as addressed to Nebuchadnezzar, the
head of an organized earthly kingdom, with various principalities under
the supreme ruler. So "the kingdom of heaven" ([Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017); Greek, "kingdom of the heavens")
is a manifold organization, composed of various orders of angels, under
the Most High ([Eph 1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016)).

[Daniel 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 4:27</span></span>

break off--as a galling yoke ([Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040)); sin is a heavy load ([Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)). The Septuagint and Vulgate
translate not so well, "redeem," which is made an argument for Rome's
doctrine of the expiation of sins by meritorious works. Even translate
it so, it can only mean; Repent and show the reality of thy repentance
by works of justice and charity (compare [Luk
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)); so God will remit thy
punishment. The trouble will be longer before it comes, or shorter when
it does come. Compare the cases of Hezekiah, [Isa
38:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#001); Nineveh, [Jon
3:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005); [Jer
18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007). The change is not in God, but
in the sinner who repents. As the king who had provoked God's judgments
by sin, so he might avert it by a return to righteousness (compare [Psa
41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001); [Act
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022)). Probably, like most Oriental
despots, Nebuchadnezzar had oppressed the poor by forcing them to labor
in his great public works without adequate remuneration.

if . . . lengthening of . . . tranquillity--if haply thy present
prosperity shall be prolonged.

[Daniel 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">dan 4:29</span></span>

twelve months--This respite was granted to him to leave him without
excuse. So the hundred twenty years granted before the flood ([Gen
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003)). At the first announcement of the
coming judgment he was alarmed, as Ahab ([Kg1
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#027)), but did not thoroughly repent;
so when judgment was not executed at once, he thought it would never
come, and so returned to his former pride ([Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)).

in the palace--rather, upon the (flat) palace roof, whence he could
contemplate the splendor of Babylon. So the heathen historian, ABYDENUS,
records. The palace roof was the scene of the fall of another king ([Sa2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#002)). The outer wall of
Nebuchadnezzar's new palace embraced six miles; there were two other
embattled walls within, and a great tower, and three brazen gates.

[Daniel 4:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">dan 4:30</span></span>

Babylon, that I have built--HERODOTUS ascribes the building of Babylon
to Semiramis and Nitocris, his informant under the Persian dynasty
giving him the Assyrian and Persian account. BEROSUS and ABYDENUS give
the Babylonian account, namely, that Nebuchadnezzar added much to the
old city, built a splendid palace and city walls. HERODOTUS, the
so-called "father of history," does not even mention Nebuchadnezzar.
(Nitocris, to whom he attributes the beautifying of Babylon, seems to
have been Nebuchadnezzar's wife). Hence infidels have doubted the
Scripture account. But the latter is proved by thousands of bricks on
the plain, the inscriptions of which have been deciphered, each marked
"Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar." "Built," that is, restored
and enlarged ([Ch2 11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#005)). It is
curious, all the bricks have been found with the stamped face downwards.
Scarcely a figure in stone, or tablet, has been dug out of the rubbish
heaps of Babylon, whereas Nineveh abounds in them; fulfilling [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037), "Babylon shall become heaps."
The "I" is emphatic, by which he puts himself in the place of God; so
the "my . . . my." He impiously opposes his might to God's, as though
God's threat, uttered a year before, could never come to pass. He would
be more than man; God, therefore, justly, makes him less than man. An
acting over again of the fall; Adam, once lord of the world and the very
beasts ([Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028); so Nebuchadnezzar
[Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038)), would be a god ([Gen
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005)); therefore he must die like the
beasts ([Psa 82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006); [Psa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012)). The second Adam restores the
forfeited inheritance ([Psa 8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004)).

[Daniel 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">dan 4:31</span></span>

While, &c.--in the very act of speaking, so that there could be no doubt
as to the connection between the crime and the punishment. So [Luk
12:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019).

O king . . . to thee it is spoken--Notwithstanding thy kingly power, to
thee thy doom is now spoken, there is to be no further respite.

[Daniel 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">dan 4:33</span></span>

driven from men--as a maniac fancying himself a wild beast. It is
possible, a conspiracy of his nobles may have co-operated towards his
having been "driven" forth as an outcast.

hairs . . . eagles' feathers--matted together, as the hair-like, thick
plumage of the ossifraga eagle. The "nails," by being left uncut for
years, would become like "claws."

[Daniel 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">dan 4:34</span></span>

lifted up mine eyes unto heaven--whence the "voice" had issued ([Dan
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031)) at the beginning of his
visitation. Sudden mental derangement often has the effect of
annihilating the whole interval, so that, when reason returns, the
patient remembers only the event that immediately preceded his insanity.
Nebuchadnezzar's looking up towards heaven was the first symptom of his
"understanding" having "returned." Before, like the beasts, his eyes had
been downward to the earth. Now, like Jonah's ([Jon
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#001), [Jon
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#004)) out of the fish's belly, they are
lifted up to heaven in prayer. He turns to Him that smiteth him ([Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013)), with the faint glimmer of
reason left to him, and owns God's justice in punishing him.

praised . . . him--Praise is a sure sign of a soul spiritually healed
([Psa 116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012), [Psa
116:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#014); [Mar
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015), [Mar
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#018)).

I . . . honoured him--implying that the cause of his chastisement was
that he had before robbed God of His honor.

everlasting dominion--not temporary or mutable, as a human king's
dominion.

[Daniel 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">dan 4:35</span></span>

all . . . as nothing-- ([Isa 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#015),
[Isa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017)).

according to his will in . . . heaven-- ([Psa
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003); [Psa
135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006); [Mat
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#010); [Eph
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#011)).

army--the heavenly hosts, angels and starry orbs (compare [Isa
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#021)).

none . . . stay his hand--literally, "strike His hand." Image from
striking the hand of another, to check him in doing anything ([Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013); [Isa

What doest thou-- ([Job 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012); [Rom

An inscription in the East India Company's Museum is read as describing
the period of Nebuchadnezzar's insanity \[G. V. SMITH\]. In the
so-called standard inscription read by SIR H. RAWLINSON, Nebuchadnezzar
relates that during four (?) years he ceased to lay out buildings, or to
furnish with victims Merodach's altar, or to clear out the canals for
irrigation. No other instance in the cuneiform inscriptions occurs of a
king recording his own inaction.

my counsellors . . . sought unto me--desired to have me, as formerly, to
be their head, wearied with the anarchy which prevailed in my absence
(compare Note, see on [Dan 4:33](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#033)); the
likelihood of a conspiracy of the nobles is confirmed by this verse.

majesty was added--My authority was greater than ever before ([Job
42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012); [Pro
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004); "added," [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)).

[Daniel 4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037)

praise . . . extol . . . honour--He heaps word on word, as if he cannot
say enough in praise of God.

all whose works . . . truth . . . judgment--that is, are true and just
([Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003); [Rev
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007)). God has not dealt unjustly or
too severely with me; whatever I have suffered, I deserved it all. It is
a mark of true contrition to condemn one's self, and justify God ([Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)).

those that walk in pride . . . abase--exemplified in me. He condemns
himself before the whole world, in order to glorify God.
