*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Luke Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

[Luke 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 18:1</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE IMPORTUNATE WIDOW. ([Luk
18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001))

always--Compare [Luk 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007), "night and
day."

faint--lose heart, or slacken.

[Luke 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 18:2</span></span>

feared not . . . neither regarded--defying the vengeance of God and
despising the opinion of men.

widow--weak, desolate, defenseless ([Ti1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005), which is taken from this).

[Luke 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 18:3</span></span>

came--kept coming. See [Luk 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005), "her
continual coming."

Avenge me--that is, rid me of the oppression of.

[Luke 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 18:5</span></span>

continual coming--coming for ever.

[Luke 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 18:6</span></span>

the Lord--a name expressive of the authoritative style in which He
interprets His own parable.

[Luke 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 18:7</span></span>

shall not God--not unjust, but the infinitely righteous Judge.

avenge--redeem from oppression.

his own elect--not like this widow, the object of indifference and
contempt, but dear to Him as the apple of the eye ([Zac
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)).

cry day and night--whose every cry enters into the ears of the Lord of
Sabaoth ([Jam 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#004)), and how much more
their incessant and persevering cries!

bear long with them--rather, "in their case," or "on their account" (as)
[Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007), "for it"), \[GROTIUS, DE
WETTE, &c.\].

[Luke 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 18:8</span></span>

speedily--as if pained at the long delay, impatient for the destined
moment to interpose. (Compare [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001).)

Nevertheless, &c.--that is, Yet ere the Son of man comes to redress the
wrongs of His Church, so low will the hope of relief sink, through the
length of the delay, that one will be fain to ask, Will He find any
faith of a coming avenger left on the earth? From this we learn: (1)
That the primary and historical reference of this parable is to the
Church in its widowed, desolate, oppressed, defenseless condition during
the present absence of her Lord in the heavens; (2) That in these
circumstances importunate, persevering prayer for deliverance is the
Church's fitting exercise; (3) That notwithstanding every encouragement
to this, so long will the answer be delayed, while the need of relief
continues the same, and all hope of deliverance will have nearly died
out, and "faith" of Christ's coming scarcely to be found. But the
application of the parable to prayer in general is so obvious as to have
nearly hidden its more direct reference, and so precious that one cannot
allow it to disappear in any public and historical interpretation.

[Luke 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 18:11</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN. ([Luk
18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#009))

stood--as the Jews in prayer ([Mar
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)).

God, &c.--To have been kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a just
cause of thankfulness to God; but instead of the devoutly humble,
admiring frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs
himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them, and, with a
contemptuous look at the poor publican, thanks God that he has not to
stand afar off like him, to hang down his head like a bulrush and beat
his breast like him. But these are only his moral excellencies. His
religious merits complete his grounds for congratulation. Not confining
himself to the one divinely prescribed annual fast ([Lev
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029)), he was not behind the most
rigid, who fasted on the second and fifth days of every week
\[LIGHTFOOT\], and gave the tenth not only of what the law laid under
tithing, but of "all his gains." Thus, besides doing all his duty, he
did works of supererogation; while sins to confess and spiritual wants
to be supplied he seems to have felt none. What a picture of the
Pharisaic character and religion!

[Luke 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 18:13</span></span>

standing afar off--as unworthy to draw near; but that was the way to get
near ([Psa 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018); [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015)).

would not lift up--blushing and ashamed to do so ([Ezr
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#006)).

smote, &c.--kept smiting; for anguish ([Luk
23:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#048)), and self-reproach ([Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019)).

be merciful--"be propitiated," a very unusual word in such a sense, only
once else used in the New Testament, in the sense of "making
reconciliation" by sacrifice ([Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)). There may therefore, be some
allusion to this here, though not likely.

a sinner--literally, "the sinner"; that is, "If ever there was one, I am
he."

[Luke 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 18:14</span></span>

rather than the other--The meaning is, "and not the other"; for the
Pharisee was not seeking justification, and felt no need of it. This
great law of the Kingdom of God is, in the teaching of Christ,
inscribed, as in letters of gold, over its entrance gate. And in how
many different forms is it repeated ([Psa
138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006); [Psa
147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006); [Luk
1:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053)). To be self-emptied, or, "poor
in spirit," is the fundamental and indispensable preparation for the
reception of the "grace which bringeth salvation": wherever this exists,
the "mourning" for it which precedes "comfort" and the earnest
"hungerings and thirstings after righteousness" which are rewarded by
the "fulness" of it, will, as we see here, be surely found. Such,
therefore, and such only, are the justified ones ([Job
33:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#027); [Psa
34:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#018); [Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015)).

[Luke 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 18:15</span></span>

LITTLE CHILDREN BROUGHT TO CHRIST. ([Luk
18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#015))

infants--showing that some, at least, of those called in Matthew ([Mat
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013)) and Mark ([Mar
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#013)) simply "little" or "young
children," were literally "babes."

touch them--or, as more fully in Matthew ([Mat
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#013)), "put His hands on them and
pray," or invoke a "blessing" on them ([Mar
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#016)), according to venerable custom
([Gen 48:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#014)).

rebuked them--Repeatedly the disciples thus interposed to save annoyance
and interruption to their Master; but, as the result showed, always
against the mind of Christ ([Mat
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023); [Luk
18:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#039)). Here, it is plain from our
Lord's reply, that they thought the intrusion a useless one, as infants
were not capable of receiving anything from Him. His ministrations were
for grown people.

[Luke 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 18:16</span></span>

But Jesus--"much displeased," says Mark ([Mar
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#014)); and invaluable addition.

said--"SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME"--"AND FORBID THEM
NOT," is the important addition of Matthew ([Mat
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014)) and Mark ([Mar
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#014)). What words are these from the
lips of Christ! The price of them is above rubies. But the reason
assigned, "FOR OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF GOD," or "of heaven," as in
[Mat 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#014), completes the previous
information here conveyed; especially as interpreted by what immediately
follows: "AND HE TOOK THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, PUT HIS HANDS UPON THEM, AND
BLESSED THEM" ([Mar 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#016)). It is
surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform us,
that seeing grown people must become childlike in order to be capable of
the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder infants from coming
to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed the infants themselves. Was
it not just the grave mistake of the disciples that infants should not
be brought to Christ, because only grown people could profit by Him,
which "much displeased" our Lord? And though He took the irresistible
opportunity of lowering their pride of reason, by informing them that,
in order to enter the Kingdom, "instead of the children first becoming
like them, they must themselves become like the children" \[RICHTER in
STIER\], this was but by the way; and, returning to the children
themselves, He took them up in His gracious arms, put His hands upon
them and blessed them, for no conceivable reason but to show that they
were thereby made capable, AS INFANTS, of the Kingdom of God. And if so,
then "Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which
have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?" ([Act
10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047)). But such application of the
baptismal water can have no warrant here, save where the infants have
been previously brought to Christ Himself for His benediction, and only
as the sign and seal of that benediction.

[Luke 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 18:19</span></span>

THE RICH YOUNG RULER AND DISCOURSE THEREON. ([Luk
18:18-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#018))

Why, &c.--Did our Lord mean then to teach that God only ought to be
called "good?" Impossible, for that had been to contradict all Scripture
teaching, and His own, too ([Psa
112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005); [Mat
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021); [Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008)). Unless therefore we are to
ascribe captiousness to our Lord, He could have had but one object--to
raise the youth's ideas of Himself, as not to be classed merely with
other "good masters," and declining to receive this title apart from the
"One" who is essentially and only "good." This indeed is but distantly
hinted; but unless this is seen in the background of our Lord's words,
nothing worthy of Him can be made out of them. (Hence, Socinianism,
instead of having any support here, is only baffled by it).

[Luke 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 18:20</span></span>

Thou knowest, &c.--Matthew ([Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017)) is more complete here: "but if
thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him,
Which--as if he had said, Point me out one of them which I have not
kept?--"Jesus said, Thou shalt," &c. ([Mat
19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017)). Our Lord purposely confines
Himself to the second table, which He would consider easy to keep,
enumerating them all--for in Mark ([Mar
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#019)), "Defraud not" stands for the
tenth (else the eighth is twice repeated). In Matthew ([Mat
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019)) the sum of this second table of
the law is added, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," as if to
see if he would venture to say he had kept that.

[Luke 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 18:21</span></span>

All these, &c.--"what lack I yet?" adds Matthew ([Mat
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#020)). Ah! this gives us a glimpse of
his heart. Doubtless he was perfectly sincere; but something within
whispered to him that his keeping of the commandments was too easy a way
of getting to heaven. He felt something beyond this to be necessary;
after keeping all the commandments he was at a loss to know what that
could be; and he came to Jesus just upon that point. "Then," says Mark
([Mar 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021)), "Jesus beholding him
loved him," or "looked lovingly upon him." His sincerity, frankness, and
nearness to the kingdom of God, in themselves most winning qualities,
won our Lord's regard even though he turned his back upon Him--a lesson
to those who can see nothing lovable save in the regenerate.

[Luke 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 18:22</span></span>

lackest . . . one thing--Ah! but that a fundamental, fatal lack.

sell, &c.--As riches were his idol, our Lord, who knew if from the
first, lays His great authoritative grasp at once upon it, saying, "Now
give Me up that, and all is right." No general direction about the
disposal of riches, then, is here given, save that we are to sit loose
to them and lay them at the feet of Him who gave them. He who does this
with all he has, whether rich or poor, is a true heir of the kingdom of
heaven.

[Luke 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 18:23</span></span>

was very sorrowful--Matthew ([Mat
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022)) more fully, "went away
sorrowful"; Mark still more, "was sad" or "sullen" at that saying, and
"went away grieved." Sorry he was, very sorry, to part with Christ; but
to part with his riches would have cost him a pang more. When Riches or
Heaven, on Christ's terms, were the alternative, the result showed to
which side the balance inclined. Thus was he shown to lack the one
all-comprehensive requirement of the law--the absolute subjection of the
heart to God, and this want vitiated all his other obediences.

[Luke 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 18:24</span></span>

when Jesus saw--Mark says ([Mar 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#034)),
He "looked round about"--as if first following the departing youth with
His eye--"and saith unto His disciples."

How hardly, &c.--with what difficulty. In Mark ([Mar
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#024)) an explanation is added, "How
hard is it for them that trust in riches," &c.--that is, with what
difficulty is this idolatrous trust conquered, without which they cannot
enter; and this is introduced by the word "children"--sweet diminutive
of affection and pity ([Joh 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#005)).

[Luke 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 18:25</span></span>

easier for a camel, &c.--a proverbial expression denoting literally a
thing impossible, but figuratively, very difficult.

[Luke 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 18:26</span></span>

For, &c.--"At that rate none can be saved": "Well, it does pass human
power, but not divine."

[Luke 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 18:28</span></span>

Lo, &c.--in the simplicity of his heart (as is evident from the reply),
conscious that the required surrender had been made, and generously
taking in his brethren with him--"we"; not in the spirit of the young
ruler. "All these have I kept,"

left all--"The workmen's little is as much his "all" as the prince's
much" \[BENGEL\]. In Matthew ([Mat
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027)) he adds, "What shall we have
therefore?" How shall it fare with us?

[Luke 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 18:29</span></span>

There is no man, &c.--graciously acknowledging at once the completeness
and the acceptableness of the surrender as a thing already made.

house, &c.--The specification is still more minute in Matthew and Mark,
([Mat 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027); [Mar
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#029)) to take in every form of
self-sacrifice.

for the kingdom of God's sake--in Mark ([Mar
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#029)), "for MY sake and the
Gospel's." See on [Luk 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#022).

[Luke 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 18:30</span></span>

manifold more in this present time--in Matthew ([Mat
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029)) "an hundredfold," to which Mark
([Mar 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030)) gives this most
interesting addition, "Now in this present time, houses, and brethren,
and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions."
We have here the blessed promise of a reconstruction of all human
relationships and affections on a Christian basis and in a Christian
state, after being sacrificed, in their natural form, on the altar of
love to Christ. This He calls "manifold more"--"an hundredfold
more"--than what they sacrificed. Our Lord was Himself the first to
exemplify this new adjustment of His own relationships. (See on [Mat
12:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#049); and [Co2
6:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014).) But this "with
persecutions"; for how could such a transfer take place without the most
cruel wrenches to flesh and blood? but the persecution would haply
follow them into their new and higher circle, breaking that up too! But
best of all, "in the world to come life everlasting." And

When the shore is won at last

Who will count the billows past?

KEBLE

These promises are for every one who forsakes his all for Christ. But in
Matthew ([Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)) this is prefaced
by a special promise to the Twelve: "Verily I say unto you, That ye
which have followed Me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man shall
sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Ye who have now adhered to Me
shall, in the new kingdom, rule, or give law to, the great Christian
world, here set forth in Jewish dress as the twelve tribes, presided
over by the twelve apostles on so many judicial thrones. In this sense
certainly the promise has been illustriously fulfilled \[CALVIN,
GROTIUS, LIGHTFOOT, &c.\]. But if the promise refers to the yet future
glory (as may be thought from [Luk
22:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#028), and as most take it), it
points to the highest personal distinction of the first founders of the
Christian Church.

[Luke 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 18:31</span></span>

FULLER ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH AND RESURRECTION. ([Luk
18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031))

all written by the prophets concerning the Son of man . . . be
accomplished--showing how Christ Himself read, and would have us to
read, the Old Testament, in which some otherwise evangelical
interpreters find no prophecies, or virtually none, of the sufferings of
the Son of man.

[Luke 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 18:34</span></span>

understood none, &c.--The Evangelist seems unable to say strongly enough
how entirely hidden from them at that time was the sense of these
exceeding plain statements: no doubt to add weight to their subsequent
testimony, which from this very circumstance was prodigious, and with
all the simple-hearted irresistible.

so much the more--that importunity so commended in the Syrophenician
woman, and so often enjoined ([Luk
11:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005); [Luk

[Luke 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 18:40</span></span>

commanded, &c.--Mark ([Mar 10:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#049)) has
this interesting addition: "And they call the blind man, saying unto
him, Be of good comfort, rise, He calleth thee"--just as one earnestly
desiring an interview with some exalted person, but told by one official
after another that it is vain to wait, as he will not succeed (they know
it), yet persists in waiting for some answer to his suit, and at length
the door opens, and a servant appears, saying, "You will be admitted--he
has called you." And are there no other suitors to Jesus who sometimes
fare thus? "And he, casting away his garment"--how lively is this touch,
evidently of an eye-witness, expressive of his earnestness and
joy--"came to Jesus" ([Mar 10:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#049)).

What wilt thou, &c.--to try them; to deepen their present consciousness
of need; and to draw out their faith in Him. Lord "Rabboni" ([Mar
10:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#051)); an emphatic and confiding
exclamation. (See on [Joh 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#016).)
