### [Hosea Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 12:1</span></span>

REPROOF OF EPHRAIM AND JUDAH: THEIR FATHER JACOB OUGHT TO BE A PATTERN
TO THEM. ([Hos 12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md)

This prophecy was delivered about the time of Israel's seeking the aid
of the Egyptian king So, in violation of their covenant with Assyria
(see [Hos 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md). He exhorts them to
follow their father Jacob's persevering prayerfulness, which brought
God's favor upon him. As God is unchangeable, He will show the same
favor to Jacob's posterity as He did to Jacob, if, like him, they seek
God.

feedeth on wind-- ([Pro 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#014.md); [Isa
44:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#020).md). Followeth after vain objects,
such as alliances with idolaters and their idols (compare [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007).md).

east wind--the simoon, blowing from the desert east of Palestine, which
not only does not benefit, but does injury. Israel follows not only
things vain, but things pernicious (compare [Job
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#002).md).

increaseth lies--accumulates lie upon lie, that is, impostures wherewith
they deceive themselves, forsaking the truth of God.

desolation--violent oppressions practised by Israel \[MAURER\]. Acts
which would prove the cause of Israel's own desolation \[CALVIN\].

covenant with . . . Assyrians-- ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md); [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011).md).

oil . . . into Egypt--as a present from Israel to secure Egypt's
alliance ([Isa 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#006.md); [Isa
57:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#009.md); compare [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md). Palestine was famed for oil
([Eze 27:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#017).md).

[Hosea 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 12:2</span></span>

controversy with Judah-- ([Hos 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md);
[Mic 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002).md). Judah, under Ahaz, had
fallen into idolatry ([Kg2 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003), &c..md).

Jacob--that is, the ten tribes. If Judah, the favored portion of the
nation, shall not be spared, much less degenerate Israel.

[Hosea 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 12:3</span></span>

He--Jacob, contrasted with his degenerate descendants, called by his
name, Jacob ([Hos 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md); compare [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007).md). He took Esau by the heel in the
womb in order to obtain, if possible, the privileges of the first-born
([Gen 25:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022).md), whence he took his
name, Jacob, meaning "supplanter"; and again, by his strength, prevailed
in wrestling with God for a blessing ([Gen
32:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).md); whereas ye disregard My
promises, putting your confidence in idols and foreign alliances. He
conquered God, ye are the slaves of idols. Only have Jehovah on your
side, and ye are stronger than Edom, or even Assyria. So the spiritual
Israel lays hold of the heel of Jesus, "the First-born of many
brethren," being born again of the Holy Spirit. Having no right in
themselves to the inheritance, they lay hold of the bruised heel, the
humanity of Christ crucified, and let not go their hold of Him who is
not, as Esau, a curse ([Heb 12:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md),
but, by becoming a curse for us, is a blessing to us.

power with God--referring to his name, "Israel," prince of God, acquired
on that occasion (compare [Mat 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012).md).
As the promised Canaan had to be gained forcibly by Israel, so heaven by
the faithful ([Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); compare [Luk
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#024).md). "Strive," literally, "as in
the agony of a contest." So the Canaanitess ([Mat
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022).md).

his strength--which lay in his conscious weakness, whence, when his
thigh was put out of joint by God, he hung upon Him. To seek strength
was his object; to grant it, God's. Yet God's mode of procedure was
strange. In human form He tries as it were to throw Jacob down. When
simple wrestling was not enough, He does what seems to ensure Jacob's
fall, dislocating his thigh joint, so that he could no longer stand. Yet
it was then that Jacob prevailed. Thus God teaches us the irresistible
might of conscious weakness. For when weak in ourselves, we are strong
by His strength put in us ([Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006.md);
[Isa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005.md); [Co2
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009).md).

[Hosea 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 12:4</span></span>

the angel--the uncreated Angel of the Covenant, as God the Son appears
in the Old Testament ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

made supplication-- [Gen 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md); I will
not let thee go, except thou bless me."

he found him--The angel found Jacob, when he was fleeing from Esau into
Syria: the Lord appearing to him "in Beth-el" ([Gen
28:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011.md); [Gen
35:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#001).md). What a sad contrast, that in
this same Beth-el now Israel worships the golden calves!

there he spake with us--"with us," as being in the loins of our
progenitor Jacob (compare [Psa 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#006.md),
"They . . . we;" [Heb 7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#009).md). What
God there spoke to Jacob appertains to us. God's promises to him belong
to all his posterity who follow in the steps of his prayerful faith.

[Hosea 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 12:5</span></span>

Lord God--JEHOVAH, a name implying His immutable constancy to His
promises. From the Hebrew root, meaning "existence." "He that is, was,
and is to be," always the same ([Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md); [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md); compare [Exo
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#014.md); [Exo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md). As He was unchangeable in His
favor to Jacob, so will He be to His believing posterity.

of hosts--which Israel foolishly worshipped. Jehovah has all the hosts
(saba) or powers of heaven and earth at His command, so that He is as
all-powerful, as He is faithful, to fulfil His promises ([Psa
135:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#006.md); [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027).md).

memorial--the name expressive of the character in which God was ever to
be remembered ([Psa 135:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 12:6</span></span>

thou--who dost wish to be a true descendant of Jacob.

to THY God--who is therefore bound by covenant to hear thy prayers.

keep mercy and judgment-- ([Mic 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008).md).
These two include the second-table commandments, duty towards one's
neighbor, the most visible test of the sincerity on one's repentance.

wait on thy God--alone, not on thy idols. Including all the duties of
the first table ([Psa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md), [Psa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md), [Psa
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md); [Psa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 12:7</span></span>

merchant--a play on the double sense of the Hebrew, "Canaan," that is, a
Canaanite and a "merchant" [Eze 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#003.md) :
"Thy birth is . . . of Canaan." They who naturally were descendants of
pious Jacob had become virtually Canaanites, who were proverbial as
cheating merchants (compare [Isa
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#011), Margin.md), the greatest reproach
to Israel, who despised Canaan. The PhÅ“nicians called themselves
Canaanites or merchants ([Isa 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008).md).

oppress--open violence: as the "balances of deceit" imply fraud.

[Hosea 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 12:8</span></span>

And--that is, Notwithstanding.

Yet I am . . . rich--I regard not what the prophets say: I am content
with my state, as I am rich ([Rev
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017).md). Therefore, in just retribution,
this is the very language of the enemy in being the instrument of
Israel's punishment. [Zac 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005.md) : "They
that sell them say . . . I am rich." Far better is poverty with honesty,
than riches gained by sin.

my labours--my gains by labor.

they shall find none--that is, none shall find any.

iniquity . . . that were sin--iniquity that would bring down the penalty
of sin. Ephraim argues, My success in my labors proves that I am not a
guilty sinner as the prophets assert. Thus sinners pervert God's
long-suffering goodness ([Mat 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045).md)
into a justification of their impenitence (compare [Ecc
8:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 12:9</span></span>

And--rather, "And yet." Though Israel deserves to be cast off for ever,
yet I am still what I have been from the time of My delivering them out
of Egypt, their covenant God; therefore, "I will yet make thee to dwell
in tabernacles," that is, to keep the feast of tabernacles again in
remembrance of a new deliverance out of bondage. Fulfilled primarily at
the return from Babylon ([Neh 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#017).md).
Fully and antitypically to be fulfilled at the final restoration from
the present dispersion ([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md);
compare [Lev 23:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#042).md).

[Hosea 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 12:10</span></span>

by . . . the prophets--literally, "upon," that is, My spirit resting on
them. I deposited with them My instructions which ought to have brought
you to the right way. An aggravation of your guilt, that it was not
through ignorance you erred, but in defiance of God and His prophets
\[CALVIN\]. Ahijah the Shilonite, Shemaiah, Iddo, Azariah, Hanani, Jehu,
Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah, Joel, and Amos were "the prophets" before
Hosea.

visions . . . similitudes--I adopted such modes of communication,
adapted to man's capacities, as were calculated to arouse attention: I
left no means untried to reform you. The first, second, and third
chapters contain examples of "similitudes."

[Hosea 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 12:11</span></span>

Is there iniquity in Gilead?--He asks the question, not as if the answer
was doubtful, but to strengthen the affirmation: "Surely they are
vanity"; or as MAURER translates, "They are nothing but iniquity."
Iniquity, especially idolatry, in Scripture is often termed "vanity."
[Pro 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#011.md) : "Wealth gotten by
vanity," that is, iniquity. [Isa 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md)
: "They are all vanity . . . images." "Gilead" refers to Mizpah-gilead,
a city representing the region beyond Jordan ([Hos
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008.md); [Jdg
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#029).md); as "Gilgal," the region on
this side of Jordan ([Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md). In
all quarters alike they are utterly vile.

their altars are as heaps in the furrows--that is, as numerous as such
heaps: namely, the heaps of stones cleared out of a stony field. An
appropriate image, as at a distance they look like altars (compare [Hos
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md), [Hos
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md); [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md). As the third member in the
parallelism answers to the first, "Gilgal" to "Gilead," so the fourth to
the second, "altars" to "vanity." The word "heaps" alludes to the name
"Gilgal," meaning "a heap of stones." The very scene of the general
circumcision of the people, and of the solemn passover kept after
crossing Jordan, is now the stronghold of Israel's idolatry.

[Hosea 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 12:12</span></span>

Jacob fled . . . served--Though ye pride yourselves on the great name of
"Israel," forget not that your progenitor was the same Jacob who was a
fugitive, and who served for Rachel fourteen years. He forgot not ME who
delivered him when fleeing from Esau, and when oppressed by Laban ([Gen
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#005.md); [Gen
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#020.md), [Gen
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#028.md); [Deu
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#005).md). Ye, though delivered from Egypt
([Hos 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013).md), and loaded with My
favors, are yet unwilling to return to Me.

country of Syria--the champaign region of Syria, the portion lying
between the Tigris and Euphrates, hence called Mesopotamia. Padan-aram
means the same, that is, "Low Syria," as opposed to Aramea (meaning the
"high country") or Syria ([Gen 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007).md).

[Hosea 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 12:13</span></span>

by a prophet--Moses ([Num 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md); [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md), [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018).md).

preserved--Translate, "kept"; there is an allusion to the same Hebrew
word in [Hos 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md), "kept sheep";
Israel was kept by God as His flock, even as Jacob kept sheep ([Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md); [Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 12:14</span></span>

provoked him--that is, God.

leave his blood upon him--not take away the guilt and penalty of the
innocent blood shed by Ephraim in general, and to Moloch in particular.

his reproach shall his Lord return unto him--Ephraim's dishonor to God
in worshipping idols, God will repay to him. That God is "his Lord" by
right redemption and special revelation to Ephraim only aggravates his
guilt, instead of giving him hope of escape. God does not give up His
claim to them as His, however they set aside His dominion.
