### [Jonah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

[Jonah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jon 1:1</span></span>

JONAH'S COMMISSION TO NINEVEH, FLIGHT, PUNISHMENT, AND PRESERVATION BY
MIRACLE. (Jon. 1:1-17)

Jonah--meaning in Hebrew, "dove." Compare , where the dove in vain seeks
rest after flying from Noah and the ark: so Jonah. GROTIUS not so well
explains it, "one sprung from Greece" or Ionia, where there were
prophets called AmythaonidÃ&brvbr;.

Amittai--Hebrew for "truth," "truth-telling"; appropriate to a prophet.

[Jonah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jon 1:2</span></span>

to Nineveh--east of the Tigris, opposite the modern Mosul. The only case
of a prophet being sent to the heathen. Jonah, however, is sent to
Nineveh, not solely for Nineveh's good, but also to shame Israel, by the
fact of a heathen city repenting at the first preaching of a single
stranger, Jonah, whereas God's people will not repent, though preached
to by their many national prophets, late and early. Nineveh means "the
residence of Ninus," that is, Nimrod. , where the translation ought to
be, "He (Nimrod) went forth into Assyria and builded Nineveh." Modern
research into the cuneiform inscriptions confirms the Scripture account
that Babylon was founded earlier than Nineveh, and that both cities were
built by descendants of Ham, encroaching on the territory assigned to
Shem (, , , ).

great city--four hundred eighty stadia in circumference, one hundred
fifty in length, and ninety in breadth \[DIODORUS SICULUS, 2.3\]. Taken
by Arbaces the Mede, in the reign of Sardanapalus, about the seventh
year of Uzziah; and a second time by Nabopolassar of Babylon and
Cyaxares the Mede in 625 B.C. See on .

cry-- (; ).

come up before me-- (; ; ; ; ); that is, their wickedness is so great as
to require My open interposition for punishment.

[Jonah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jon 1:3</span></span>

flee--Jonah's motive for flight is hinted at in : fear that after
venturing on such a dangerous commission to so powerful a heathen city,
his prophetical threats should be set aside by God's "repenting of the
evil," just as God had so long spared Israel notwithstanding so many
provocations, and so he should seem a false prophet. Besides, he may
have felt it beneath him to discharge a commission to a foreign
idolatrous nation, whose destruction he desired rather than their
repentance. This is the only case of a prophet, charged with a
prophetical message, concealing it.

from the presence of the Lord--(Compare ). Jonah thought in fleeing from
the land of Israel, where Jehovah was peculiarly present, that he should
escape from Jehovah's prophecy-inspiring influence. He probably knew the
truth stated in , but virtually ignored it (compare ; ).

went down--appropriate in going from land to the sea ().

Joppa--now Jaffa, in the region of Dan; a harbor as early as Solomon's
time ().

Tarshish--Tartessus in Spain; in the farthest west at the greatest
distance from Nineveh in the east.

[Jonah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jon 1:4</span></span>

sent out--literally, caused a wind to burst forth. COVERDALE translates,
"hurled a greate wynde into the see."

[Jonah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jon 1:5</span></span>

mariners were afraid--though used to storms; the danger therefore must
have been extreme.

cried every man unto his god--The idols proved unable to save them,
though each, according to PhÅ“nician custom, called on his tutelary god.
But Jehovah proved able: and the heathen sailors owned it in the end by
sacrificing to Him ().

into the sides--that is, the interior recesses (compare ; , ). Those
conscious of guilt shrink from the presence of their fellow man into
concealment.

fast asleep--Sleep is no necessary proof of innocence; it may be the
fruit of carnal security and a seared conscience. How different was
Jesus' sleep on the Sea of Galilee! (). Guilty Jonah's indifference to
fear contrasts with the unoffending mariners' alarm. The original
therefore is in the nominative absolute: "But as for Jonah, he," &c.
Compare spiritually, .

[Jonah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jon 1:6</span></span>

call upon thy God--The ancient heathen in dangers called on foreign
gods, besides their national ones (compare ). MAURER translates the
preceding clause, "What is the reason that thou sleepest?"

think upon us--for good (compare ; ; , ; ).

[Jonah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jon 1:7</span></span>

cast lots--God sometimes sanctioned this mode of deciding in difficult
cases. Compare the similar instance of Achan, whose guilt involved
Israel in suffering, until God revealed the offender, probably by the
casting of lots (; ). Primitive tradition and natural conscience led
even the heathen to believe that one guilty man involves all his
associates, though innocent, in punishment. So CICERO \[The Nature of
the Gods, 3.37\] mentions that the mariners sailing with Diagoras, an
atheist, attributed a storm that overtook them to his presence in the
ship (compare HORACE'S Odes, 3.2.26).

[Jonah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jon 1:8</span></span>

The guilty individual being discovered is interrogated so as to make
full confession with his own mouth. So in Achan's case ().

[Jonah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jon 1:9</span></span>

I am an Hebrew--He does not say "an Israelite." For this was the name
used among themselves; "Hebrew," among foreigners (; ).

I fear the Lord--in profession: his practice belied his profession: his
profession aggravated his guilt.

God . . . which . . . made the sea--appropriately expressed, as
accounting for the tempest sent on the sea. The heathen had distinct
gods for the "heaven," the "sea," and the "land." Jehovah is the one and
only true God of all alike. Jonah at last is awakened by the violent
remedy from his lethargy. Jonah was but the reflection of Israel's
backsliding from God, and so must bear the righteous punishment. The
guilt of the minister is the result of that of the people, as in Moses'
case (). This is what makes Jonah a suitable type of Messiah, who bore
the imputed sin of the people.

[Jonah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jon 1:10</span></span>

"The men were exceedingly afraid," when made aware of the wrath of so
powerful a God at the flight of Jonah.

Why hast thou done this?--If professors of religion do wrong, they will
hear of it from those who make no such profession.

[Jonah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jon 1:11</span></span>

What shall we do unto thee?--They ask this, as Jonah himself must best
know how his God is to be appeased. "We would gladly save thee, if we
can do so, and yet be saved ourselves" ().

[Jonah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jon 1:12</span></span>

cast me . . . into the sea--Herein Jonah is a type of Messiah, the one
man who offered Himself to die, in order to allay the stormy flood of
God's wrath (compare , as to Messiah), which otherwise must have
engulfed all other men. So Caiaphas by the Spirit declared it expedient
that one man should die, and that the whole nation should not perish ().
Jonah also herein is a specimen of true repentance, which leads the
penitent to "accept the punishment of his iniquity" (, ), and to be more
indignant at his sin than at his suffering.

[Jonah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jon 1:13</span></span>

they could not-- (). Wind and tide--God's displeasure and God's counsel
were against them.

[Jonah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jon 1:14</span></span>

for this man's life--that is, for taking this man's life.

innocent blood--Do not punish us as Thou wouldst punish the shedders of
innocent blood (compare ). In the case of the Antitype, Pontius Pilate
washed his hands and confessed Christ's innocence, "I am innocent of the
blood of this just person." But whereas Jonah the victim was guilty and
the sailors innocent, Christ our sacrificial victim was innocent and
Pontius Pilate and nil of us men were guilty. But by imputation of our
guilt to Him and His righteousness to us, the spotless Antitype exactly
corresponds to the guilty type.

thou . . . Lord, hast done as it pleased thee--That Jonah has embarked
in this ship, that a tempest has arisen, that he has been detected by
casting of lots, that he has passed sentence on himself, is all Thy
doing. We reluctantly put him to death, but it is Thy pleasure it should
be so.

[Jonah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jon 1:15</span></span>

sea ceased . . . raging--so at Jesus' word (). God spares the prayerful
penitent, a truth illustrated now in the case of the sailors, presently
in that of Jonah, and thirdly, in that of Nineveh.

[Jonah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jon 1:16</span></span>

offered a sacrifice--They offered some sacrifice of thanksgiving at
once, and vowed more when they should land. GLASSIUS thinks it means
only, "They promised to offer a sacrifice."

[Jonah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jon 1:17</span></span>

prepared a great fish--not created specially for this purpose, but
appointed in His providence, to which all creatures are subservient. The
fish, through a mistranslation of , was formerly supposed to be a whale;
there, as here, the original means "a great fish." The whale's neck is
too narrow to receive a man. BOCHART thinks, the dog-fish, the stomach
of which is so large that the body of a man in armor was once found in
it \[Hierozoicon, 2.5.12\]. Others, the shark \[JEBB\]. The cavity in
the whale's throat, large enough, according to CAPTAIN SCORESBY, to hold
a ship's jolly boat full of men. A miracle in any view is needed, and we
have no data to speculate further. A "sign" or miracle it is expressly
called by our Lord in . Respiration in such a position could only be by
miracle. The miraculous interposition was not without a sufficient
reason; it was calculated to affect not only Jonah, but also Nineveh and
Israel. The life of a prophet was often marked by experiences which made
him, through sympathy, best suited for discharging the prophetical
function to his hearers and his people. The infinite resources of God in
mercy as well as judgment are prefigured in the devourer being
transformed into Jonah's preserver. Jonah's condition under punishment,
shut out from the outer world, was rendered as much as possible the
emblem of death, a present type to Nineveh and Israel, of the death in
sin, as his deliverance was of the spiritual resurrection on repentance;
as also, a future type of Jesus' literal death for sin, and resurrection
by the Spirit of God.

three days and three nights--probably, like the Antitype, Christ, Jonah
was cast forth on the land on the third day (); the Hebrew counting the
first and third parts of days as whole twenty-four hour days.
