[Deuteronomy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 1:1</span></span>

MOSES' SPEECH AT THE END OF THE FORTIETH YEAR. (Deu. 1:1-46)

These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel--The mental
condition of the people generally in that infantine age of the Church,
and the greater number of them being of young or tender years, rendered
it expedient to repeat the laws and counsels which God had given.
Accordingly, to furnish a recapitulation of the leading branches of
their faith and duty was among the last public services which Moses
rendered to Israel. The scene of their delivery was on the plains of
Moab where the encampment was pitched

on this side Jordan--or, as the Hebrew word may be rendered "on the bank
of the Jordan."

in the wilderness, in the plain--the Arabah, a desert plain, or steppe,
extended the whole way from the Red Sea north to the Sea of Tiberias.
While the high tablelands of Moab were "cultivated fields," the Jordan
valley, at the foot of the mountains where Israel was encamped, was a
part of the great desert plain, little more inviting than the desert of
Arabia. The locale is indicated by the names of the most prominent
places around it. Some of these places are unknown to us. The Hebrew
word, Suph, "red" (for "sea," which our translators have inserted, is
not in the original, and Moses was now farther from the Red Sea than
ever), probably meant a place noted for its reeds ([Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014).md).

Tophel--identified as Tafyle or Tafeilah, lying between Bozrah and
Kerak.

Hazeroth--is a different place from that at which the Israelites
encamped after leaving "the desert of Sinai."

[Deuteronomy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 1:2</span></span>

There are eleven days' journey from Horeb--Distances are computed in the
East still by the hours or days occupiesd by the journey. A day's
journey on foot is about twenty miles--on camels, at the rate of three
miles an hour, thirty miles--and by caravans, about twenty-five miles.
But the Israelites, with children and flocks, would move at a slow rate.
The length of the Ghor from Ezion-geber to Kadesh is a hundred miles.
The days here mentioned were not necessarily successive days
\[ROBINSON\], for the journey can be made in a much shorter period. But
this mention of the time was made to show that the great number of years
spent in travelling from Horeb to the plain of Moab was not owing to the
length of the way, but to a very different cause; namely, banishment for
their apostasy and frequent rebellions.

mount Seir--the mountainous country of Edom.

[Deuteronomy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 1:3</span></span>

in the fortieth year . . . Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
&c.--This impressive discourse, in which Moses reviewed all that God had
done for His people, was delivered about a month before his death, and
after peace and tranquillity had been restored by the complete conquest
of Sihon and Og.

[Deuteronomy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 1:4</span></span>

Ashtaroth--the royal residence of Og, so called from Astarte ("the
moon"), the tutelary goddess of the Syrians. Og was slain at

Edrei--now Edhra, the ruins of which are fourteen miles in circumference
\[BURCKHARDT\]; its general breadth is about two leagues.

[Deuteronomy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 1:5</span></span>

On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this
law--that is, explain this law. He follows the same method here that he
elsewhere observes; namely, that of first enumerating the marvellous
doings of God in behalf of His people, and reminding them what an
unworthy requital they had made for all His kindness--then he rehearses
the law and its various precepts.

[Deuteronomy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 1:6</span></span>

The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
enough in this mount--Horeb was the general name of a mountainous
district; literally, "the parched" or "burnt region," whereas Sinai was
the name appropriated to a particular peak \[see on [Exo
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#002.md)\]. About a year had been spent
among the recesses of that wild solitude, in laying the foundation,
under the immediate direction of God, of a new and peculiar community,
as to its social, political, and, above all, religious character; and
when this purpose had been accomplished, they were ordered to break up
their encampment in Horeb. The command given them was to march straight
to Canaan, and possess it \[[Deu
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 1:7</span></span>

the mount of the Amorites--the hilly tract lying next to Kadesh-barnea
in the south of Canaan.

to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon--that is, PhÅ“nicia, the
country of Sidon, and the coast of the Mediterranean--from the
Philistines to Lebanon. The name "Canaanite" is often used synonymously
with that of "PhÅ“nician."

[Deuteronomy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 1:8</span></span>

I have set the land before you--literally, "before your faces"--it is
accessible; there is no impediment to your occupation. The order of the
journey as indicated by the places mentioned would have led to a course
of invasion, the opposite of what was eventually followed; namely, from
the seacoast eastward--instead of from the Jordan westward (see on [Num
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#001).md).

[Deuteronomy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 1:9</span></span>

I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself
alone--a little before their arrival in Horeb. Moses addresses that new
generation as the representatives of their fathers, in whose sight and
hearing all the transactions he recounts took place. A reference is here
made to the suggestion of Jethro ([Exo
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#018).md). In noticing his practical
adoption of a plan by which the administration of justice was committed
to a select number of subordinate officers, Moses, by a beautiful
allusion to the patriarchal blessing, ascribed the necessity of that
memorable change in the government to the vast increase of the
population.

[Deuteronomy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 1:10</span></span>

ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude--This was neither
an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast. Abraham was told ([Gen
15:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005).md) to look to the stars, and
though they "appear" innumerable, yet those seen by the naked eye
amount, in reality, to no more than three thousand ten in both
hemispheres. The Israelites already far exceeded that number, being at
the last census above six hundred thousand \[[Num
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#051.md)\]. It was a seasonable memento,
calculated to animate their faith in the accomplishment of other parts
of the divine promise.

[Deuteronomy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 1:19</span></span>

we went through all that great and terrible wilderness--of Paran, which
included the desert and mountainous space lying between the wilderness
of Shur westward, or towards Egypt and mount Seir, or the land of Edom
eastwards; between the land of Canaan northwards, and the Red Sea
southwards; and thus it appears to have comprehended really the
wilderness of Sin and Sinai \[FISK\]. It is called by the Arabs El Tih,
"the wandering." It is a dreary waste of rock and of calcareous soil
covered with black sharp flints; all travellers, from a feeling of its
complete isolation from the world, describe it as a great and terrible
wilderness.

[Deuteronomy 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">deu 1:22</span></span>

ye came . . . and said, We will send men before us, and they shall
search us out the land--The proposal to despatch spies emanated from the
people through unbelief; but Moses, believing them sincere, gave his
cordial assent to this measure, and God on being consulted permitted
them to follow the suggestion (see on [Num
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#001).md). The issue proved disastrous to
them, only through their own sin and folly.

[Deuteronomy 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">deu 1:28</span></span>

the cities are great, and walled up to heaven--an Oriental metaphor,
meaning very high. The Arab marauders roam about on horseback, and hence
the walls of St. Catherine's monastery on Sinai are so lofty that
travellers are drawn up by a pulley in a basket.

Anakims--(See on [Num 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#033).md). The
honest and uncompromising language of Moses, in reminding the Israelites
of their perverse conduct and outrageous rebellion at the report of the
treacherous and fainthearted scouts, affords a strong evidence of the
truth of this history as well as of the divine authority of his mission.
There was great reason for his dwelling on this dark passage in their
history, as it was their unbelief that excluded them from the privilege
of entering the promised land ([Heb
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019).md); and that unbelief was a
marvellous exhibition of human perversity, considering the miracles
which God had wrought in their favor, especially in the daily
manifestations they had of His presence among them as their leader and
protector.

[Deuteronomy 1:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">deu 1:34</span></span>

the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth--In consequence of
this aggravated offense (unbelief followed by open rebellion), the
Israelites were doomed, in the righteous judgment of God, to a life of
wandering in that dreary wilderness till the whole adult generation had
disappeared by death. The only exceptions mentioned are Caleb and
Joshua, who was to be Moses' successor.

[Deuteronomy 1:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">deu 1:37</span></span>

Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes--This statement seems to
indicate that it was on this occasion Moses was condemned to share the
fate of the people. But we know that it was several years afterwards
that Moses betrayed an unhappy spirit of distrust at the waters of
strife ([Psa 106:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#032).md). This verse
must be considered therefore as a parenthesis.

[Deuteronomy 1:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">deu 1:39</span></span>

your children . . . who in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil--All ancient versions read "to-day" instead of "that day"; and the
sense is--"your children who now know," or "who know not as yet good or
evil." As the children had not been partakers of the sinful outbreak,
they were spared to obtain the privilege which their unbelieving parents
had forfeited. God's ways are not as man's ways \[[Isa
55:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">deu 1:40</span></span>

turn you, and take your journey into the . . . Red Sea--This command
they disregarded, and, determined to force an onward passage in spite of
the earnest remonstrances of Moses, they attempted to cross the heights
then occupied by the combined forces of the Amorites and Amalekites
(compare [Num 14:43](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#043).md), but were
repulsed with great loss. People often experience distress even while in
the way of duty. But how different their condition who suffer in
situations where God is with them from the feelings of those who are
conscious that they are in a position directly opposed to the divine
will! The Israelites were grieved when they found themselves involved in
difficulties and perils; but their sorrow arose not from a sense of the
guilt so much as the sad effects of their perverse conduct; and "though
they wept," they were not true penitents. So the Lord would not hearken
to their voice, nor give ear unto them.

[Deuteronomy 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">deu 1:46</span></span>

So ye abode at Kadesh many days--That place had been the site of their
encampment during the absence of the spies, which lasted forty days, and
it is supposed from this verse that they prolonged their stay there
after their defeat for a similar period.
