### [Psalms Chapter 86](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)

[Psalms 86:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 86:1</span></span>

This is a prayer in which the writer, with deep emotion, mingles
petitions and praises, now urgent for help, and now elated with hope, in
view of former mercies. The occurrence of many terms and phrases
peculiar to David's Psalms clearly intimates its authorship. (Psa.
86:1-17)

poor and needy--a suffering child of God, as in [Psa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#012), [Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017); [Psa
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027).

I am holy--or, "godly," as in [Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003); [Psa
85:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#008).

[Psalms 86:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 86:4</span></span>

lift up my soul--with strong desire ([Psa
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001)).

[Psalms 86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 86:5</span></span>

unto all . . . that call upon thee--or, "worship Thee" ([Psa
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#015); [Psa
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015)) however undeserving ([Exo
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006); [Lev
11:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#009)).

[Psalms 86:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 86:8</span></span>

neither . . . works--literally, "nothing like thy works," the "gods"
have none at all.

[Psalms 86:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 86:9</span></span>

The pious Jews believed that God's common relation to all would be
ultimately acknowledged by all men ([Psa
45:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#012); [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009)).

[Psalms 86:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 86:11</span></span>

Teach--Show, point out.

the way--of Providence.

walk in thy truth--according to its declarations.

unite my heart--fix all my affections ([Psa
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008)).

to fear thy name--(compare [Psa 86:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#012))
to honor Thy perfections.

[Psalms 86:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 86:13</span></span>

The reason: God had delivered him from death and the power of insolent,
violent, and godless persecutors ([Psa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#003); [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012)).

[Psalms 86:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 86:15</span></span>

Contrasts God with his enemies (compare [Psa
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005)).

[Psalms 86:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 86:16</span></span>

son . . . handmaid--homeborn servant (compare [Luk
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017)).

[Psalms 86:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 86:17</span></span>

Show me--literally, "Make with me a token," by Thy providential care.
Thus in and by his prosperity his enemies would be confounded.
