### [Psalms Chapter 38](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 38:1</span></span>

To bring to remembrance, or, remind God of His mercy and himself of his
sin. Appealing to God for relief from His heavy chastisement, the
Psalmist avows his integrity before men, complains of the defection of
friends and persecution of enemies, and in a submissive spirit, casting
himself on God, with penitent confession he pleads God's covenant
relation and his innocence of the charges of his enemies, and prays for
divine comfort and help. (Psa. 38:1-22)

He deprecates deserved punishment, which is described ([Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001).md), under the figure of bodily
disease \[[Psa 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003.md)\].

[Psalms 38:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 38:2</span></span>

arrows . . . and thy hand--the sharp and heavy afflictions he suffered
([Deu 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 38:4</span></span>

iniquities--afflictions in punishment of sin ([Sa2
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012.md); [Psa
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#010.md); [Psa
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012).md).

gone over mine head--as a flood.

[Psalms 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 38:5</span></span>

The loathsomeness, corruption, and wasting torture of severe physical
disease set forth his mental anguish \[[Psa
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#006.md)\]. It is possible some bodily
disease was connected. The

loins are the seat of strength. His exhaustion left him only the power
to groan \[[Psa 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009.md)\].

[Psalms 38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 38:9</span></span>

That God can hear ([Rom 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md).

[Psalms 38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 38:10</span></span>

My heart panteth--as if barely surviving.

light . . . from me--utter exhaustion ([Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007.md); [Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 38:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 38:11</span></span>

Friends desert, but foes increase in malignity.

[Psalms 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 38:12</span></span>

seek after my life-- ([Sa1 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#001.md); [Sa1
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 38:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 38:13</span></span>

He patiently submits, uttering no reproaches or replies ([Joh
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#009).md) to their insulting speeches;

[Psalms 38:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 38:15</span></span>

for he is confident the

Lord--literally, "Sovereign" (to whom he was a servant), would answer
his prayer ([Psa 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md); [Psa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001).md), and not permit their triumph in
his partial halting, of which he was in danger.

[Psalms 38:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 38:18</span></span>

Consciousness of sin makes suffering pungent, and suffering, rightly
received, leads to confession.

[Psalms 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 38:19</span></span>

Still, while humbled before God, he is the victim of deadly enemies,
full of malice and treachery.

enemies are lively--literally, "of life," who would take my life, that
is, deadly.

[Psalms 38:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 38:21</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019.md); [Psa
35:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#003).md). All terms of frequent use. In
this Psalm the language is generally susceptible of application to
Christ as a sufferer, David, as such, typifying Him. This does not
require us to apply the confessions of sin, but only the pains or
penalties which He bore for us.
