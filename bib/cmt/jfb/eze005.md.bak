### [Ezekiel Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 5:1</span></span>

VISION OF CUTTING THE HAIRS, AND THE CALAMITIES FORESHADOWED THEREBY.
(Eze. 5:1-17)

knife . . . razor--the sword of the foe (compare [Isa
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020).md). This vision implies even
severer judgments than the Egyptian afflictions foreshadowed in the
former, for their guilt was greater than that of their forefathers.

thine head--as representative of the Jews. The whole hair being shaven
off was significant of severe and humiliating ([Sa2
10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004).md) treatment. Especially in the
case of a priest; for priests ([Lev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).md) were forbidden "to make baldness
on their head," their hair being the token of consecration; hereby it
was intimated that the ceremonial must give place to the moral.

balances--implying the just discrimination with which Jehovah weighs out
the portion of punishment "divided," that is, allotted to each: the
"hairs" are the Jews: the divine scales do not allow even one hair to
escape accurate weighing (compare [Mat
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#030).md).

[Ezekiel 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 5:2</span></span>

Three classes are described. The sword was to destroy one third of the
people; famine and plague another third ("fire" in [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md) being explained in [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012) to mean pestilence and famine.md);
that which remained was to be scattered among the nations. A few only of
the last portion were to escape, symbolized by the hairs bound in
Ezekiel's skirts ([Eze 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#003.md); [Jer
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#006.md); [Jer
52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016).md). Even of these some were to be
thrown into the fiery ordeal again ([Eze
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#004.md); [Jer
41:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001.md), &c.; [Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014), &c..md). The "skirts" being able
to contain but few express that extreme limit to which God's goodness
can reach.

[Ezekiel 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 5:5</span></span>

Explanation of the symbols:

Jerusalem--not the mere city, but the people of Israel generally, of
which it was the center and representative.

in . . . midst--Jerusalem is regarded in God's point of view as center
of the whole earth, designed to radiate the true light over the nations
in all directions. Compare Margin ("navel"), [Eze
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#012.md); [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md). No center in the ancient heathen
world could have been selected more fitted than Canaan to be a vantage
ground, whence the people of God might have acted with success upon the
heathenism of the world. It lay midway between the oldest and most
civilized states, Egypt and Ethiopia on one side, and Babylon, Nineveh,
and India on the other, and afterwards Persia, Greece, and Rome. The
PhÅ“nician mariners were close by, through whom they might have
transmitted the true religion to the remotest lands; and all around the
Ishmaelites, the great inland traders in South Asia and North Africa.
Israel was thus placed, not for its own selfish good, but to be the
spiritual benefactor of the whole world. Compare [Psa
67:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#001.md) throughout. Failing in this,
and falling into idolatry, its guilt was far worse than that of the
heathen; not that Israel literally went beyond the heathen in abominable
idolatries. But "corruptio optimi pessima"; the perversion of that which
in itself is the best is worse than the perversion of that which is less
perfect: is in fact the worst of all kinds of perversion. Therefore
their punishment was the severest. So the position of the Christian
professing Church now, if it be not a light to the heathen world, its
condemnation will be sorer than theirs ([Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013.md); [Mat
11:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#021.md); [Heb
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028).md).

[Ezekiel 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 5:6</span></span>

changed . . . into--rather, "hath resisted My judgments wickedly"; "hath
rebelled against My ordinances for wickedness" \[BUXTORF\]. But see on
[Eze 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md), end.

[Ezekiel 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 5:7</span></span>

multiplied--rather, "have been more abundantly outrageous"; literally,
"to tumultuate"; to have an extravagant rage for idols.

neither have done according to the judgments of the nations--have not
been as tenacious of the true religion as the nations have been of the
false. The heathen "changed" not their gods, but the Jews changed
Jehovah for idols (see [Eze 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#006.md),
"changed My judgments into wickedness," that is, idolatry, [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011).md). The Chaldean version and the
Masora support the negative. Others omit it (as it is omitted in [Eze
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#012).md), and translate, "but have done
according to the judgments," &c. However, both [Eze
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#012.md) and also this verse are true.
They in one sense "did according to the heathen," namely, in all that
was bad; in another, namely, in that which was good, zeal for religion,
they did not. [Eze 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#009.md) also proves the
negative to be genuine; because in changing their religion, they have
not done as the nations which have not changed theirs, "I (also) will do
in thee that which I have not done."

[Ezekiel 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 5:8</span></span>

I, even I--awfully emphatic. I, even I, whom thou thinkest to be asleep,
but who am ever reigning as the Omnipotent Avenger of sin, will
vindicate My righteous government before the nations by judgments on
thee.

[Ezekiel 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 5:9</span></span>

See on [Eze 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#007.md).

that which I have not done--worse than any former judgments ([Lam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md); [Dan
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012).md). The prophecy includes the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and the final one by Antichrist
([Zac 13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md), as well as that by
Nebuchadnezzar. Their doom of evil was not exhausted by the Chaldean
conquest. There was to be a germinating evil in their destiny, because
there would be, as the Lord foresaw, a germinating evil in their
character. As God connected Himself peculiarly with Israel, so there was
to be a peculiar manifestation of God's wrath against sin in their case
\[FAIRBAIRN\]. The higher the privileges the greater the punishment in
the case of abuse of them. When God's greatest favor, the gospel, was
given, and was abused by them, then "the wrath was to come on them to
the uttermost" ([Th1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 5:10</span></span>

fathers . . . eat . . . sons--alluding to Moses words ([Lev
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029.md); [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053).md), with the additional sad
feature, that "the sons should eat their fathers" (see [Kg2
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#028.md); [Jer
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md); [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md); [Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 5:11</span></span>

as I five--the most solemn of oaths, pledging the self-existence of God
for the certainty of the event.

defiled my sanctuary--the climax of Jewish guilt: their defiling
Jehovah's temple by introducing idols.

diminish--literally "withdraw," namely, Mine "eye" (which presently
follows), that is, My favors; [Job
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#007.md) uses the Hebrew verb in the same
way. As the Jews had withdrawn from God's sanctuary its sacredness by
"defiling" it, so God withdraws His countenance from them. The
significance of the expression lies in the allusion to [Deu
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#002.md), "Ye shall not diminish aught from
the word which I command you"; they had done so, therefore God
diminishes them. The reading found in six manuscripts, "I will cut thee
off," is not so good.

[Ezekiel 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 5:12</span></span>

Statement in plain terms of what was intended by the symbols ([Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md); see [Eze
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md); [Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md); [Jer
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009).md).

draw out . . . sword after them-- ([Lev
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033).md). Skeptics object; no such thing
happened under Zedekiah, as is here foretold; namely, that a third part
of the nation should die by pestilence, a third part by the sword, and a
third be scattered unto all winds, and a sword sent after them. But the
prophecy is not restricted to Zedekiah's time. It includes all that
Israel suffered, or was still to suffer, for their sins, especially
those committed at that period ([Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021).md). It only received its primary
fulfilment under Zedekiah: numbers then died by the pestilence and by
the sword; and numbers were scattered in all quarters and not carried to
Babylonia alone, as the objectors assert (compare [Ezr
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#004.md); [Est
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#008.md); [Oba
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#014).md).

pestilence . . . and famine--signified by the symbol "fire" ([Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002).md). Compare [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008.md); [Lam
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#010.md); plague and famine burning and
withering the countenance, as fire does.

[Ezekiel 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 5:13</span></span>

cause my fury to rest upon them--as on its proper and permanent
resting-place ([Isa 30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032), Margin.md).

I will be comforted--expressed in condescension to man's conceptions;
signifying His satisfaction in the vindication of His justice by His
righteous judgments ([Deu 28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063.md); [Pro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#026.md); [Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024).md).

they shall how--by bitter experience.

[Ezekiel 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 5:14</span></span>

reproach among the nations--They whose idolatries Israel had adopted,
instead of comforting, would only exult in their calamities brought on
by those idolatries (compare [Luk
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#015).md).

[Ezekiel 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 5:15</span></span>

instruction--literally, "a corrective chastisement," that is, a striking
example to warn all of the fatal consequences of sin. For "it shall be";
all ancient versions have "thou," which the connection favors.

[Ezekiel 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 5:16</span></span>

arrows of famine--hail, rain, mice, locusts, mildew (see [Deu
32:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#023).md).

increase the famine--literally, "congregate" or "collect." When ye think
your harvest safe because ye have escaped drought, mildew, &c., I will
find other means \[CALVIN\], which I will congregate as the forces of an
invading army, to bring famine on you.

[Ezekiel 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 5:17</span></span>

beasts--perhaps meaning destructive conquerors ([Dan
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004).md). Rather, literal "beasts," which
infest desolated regions such as Judea was to become (compare [Eze
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#028.md); [Exo
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#029.md); [Deu
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#024.md); [Kg2
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#025).md). The same threat is repeated in
manifold forms to awaken the careless.

sword--civil war.
