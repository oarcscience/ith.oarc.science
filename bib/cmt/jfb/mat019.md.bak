### [Matthew Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 19:1</span></span>

FINAL DEPARTURE FROM GALILEE--DIVORCE. ( = [Mar
10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md); [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051).md). ([Mat
19:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001).md)

And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he
departed from Galilee--This marks a very solemn period in our Lord's
public ministry. So slightly is it touched here, and in the
corresponding passage of Mark ([Mar
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001).md), that few readers probably note
it as the Redeemer's Farewell to Galilee, which however it was. See on
the sublime statement of Luke ([Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051).md), which relates to the same
transition stage in the progress of our Lord's work.

and came into the coasts--or, boundaries

of Judea beyond Jordan--that is, to the further, or east side of the
Jordan, into Perea, the dominions of Herod Antipas. But though one might
conclude from our Evangelist that our Lord went straight from the one
region to the other, we know from the other Gospels that a considerable
time elapsed between the departure from the one and the arrival at the
other, during which many of the most important events in our Lord's
public life occurred--probably a large part of what is recorded in [Luk
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md), onward to [Mat
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md), and part of John 7:2-11:54.

[Matthew 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 19:2</span></span>

And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there--Mark says
further ([Mar 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001).md), that "as He was
wont, He taught them there." What we now have on the subject of divorce
is some of that teaching.

Divorce ([Mat 19:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003).md).

[Matthew 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 19:3</span></span>

Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?--Two rival
schools (as we saw on [Mat 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031).md) were
divided on this question--a delicate one, as DE WETTE pertinently
remarks, in the dominions of Herod Antipas.

[Matthew 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 19:4</span></span>

And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made
them at the beginning made them male and female--or better, perhaps, "He
that made them made them from the beginning a male and a female."

[Matthew 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 19:5</span></span>

And said, For this cause--to follow out this divine appointment.

shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and
they twain shall be one flesh?--Jesus here sends them back to the
original constitution of man as one pair, a male and a female; to their
marriage, as such, by divine appointment; and to the purpose of God,
expressed by the sacred historian, that in all time one man and one
woman should by marriage become one flesh--so to continue as long as
both are in the flesh. This being God's constitution, let not man break
it up by causeless divorces.

[Matthew 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mat 19:7</span></span>

They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of
divorcement, and to put her away?

[Matthew 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 19:8</span></span>

He saith unto them, Moses--as a civil lawgiver.

because of--or "having respect to."

the hardness of your hearts--looking to your low moral state, and your
inability to endure the strictness of the original law.

suffered you to put away your wives--tolerated a relaxation of the
strictness of the marriage bond--not as approving of it, but to prevent
still greater evils.

But from the beginning it was not so--This is repeated, in order to
impress upon His audience the temporary and purely civil character of
this Mosaic relaxation.

[Matthew 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 19:9</span></span>

And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except, &c.--See
on [Mat 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md).

[Matthew 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 19:10</span></span>

His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife,
it is not good to marry--that is, "In this view of marriage, surely it
must prove a snare rather than a blessing, and had better be avoided
altogether."

[Matthew 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 19:11</span></span>

But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to
whom it is given--that is, "That the unmarried state is better, is a
saying not for everyone, and indeed only for such as it is divinely
intended for." But who are these? they would naturally ask; and this our
Lord proceeds to tell them in three particulars.

[Matthew 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 19:12</span></span>

For there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother's
womb--persons constitutionally either incapable of or indisposed to
marriage.

and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men--persons
rendered incapable by others.

and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom
of heaven's sake--persons who, to do God's work better, deliberately
choose this state. Such was Paul ([Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007).md).

He that is able to receive it, let him receive it--"He who feels this to
be his proper vocation, let him embrace it"; which, of course, is as
much as to say--"he only." Thus, all are left free in this matter.
