### [John Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001)

[John 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 18:1</span></span>

BETRAYAL AND APPREHENSION OF JESUS. ([Joh
18:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#001))

over the brook Kedron--a deep, dark ravine, to the northeast of
Jerusalem, through which flowed this small storm brook or winter
torrent, and which in summer is dried up.

where was a garden--at the foot of the Mount of Olives, "called
Gethsemane; that is, olive press ([Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030), [Mat
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#036)).

[John 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 18:2</span></span>

Judas . . . knew the place, for Jesus ofttimes--see [Joh
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#001); [Luk
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#037).

resorted thither with his disciples--The baseness of this abuse of
knowledge in Judas, derived from admission to the closest privacies of
his Master, is most touchingly conveyed here, though nothing beyond bare
narrative is expressed. Jesus, however, knowing that in this spot Judas
would expect to find Him, instead of avoiding it, hies Him thither, as a
Lamb to the slaughter. "No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down
of Myself" ([Joh 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#018)). Besides, the
scene which was to fill up the little breathing-time, the awful
interval, between the Supper and the Apprehension--like the "silence in
heaven for about the space of half an hour" between the breaking of the
Apocalyptic Seals and the peal of the Trumpets of war ([Rev
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001)) --the AGONY--would have been too
terrible for the upper room; nor would He cloud the delightful
associations of the last Passover and the first Supper by pouring out
the anguish of His soul there. The garden, however, with its amplitude,
its shady olives, its endeared associations, would be congenial to His
heart. Here He had room enough to retire--first, from eight of them, and
then from the more favored three; and here, when that mysterious scene
was over, the stillness would only be broken by the tread of the
traitor.

[John 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 18:3</span></span>

Judas then--"He that was called Judas, one of the Twelve," says Luke
([Luk 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047)), in language which brands
him with peculiar infamy, as in the sacred circle while in no sense of
it.

a band of men--"the detachment of the Roman cohort on duty at the
festival for the purpose of maintaining order" \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\].

officers from the chief priests and Pharisees--captains of the temple
and armed Levites.

lanterns and torches--It was full moon, but in case He should have
secreted Himself somewhere in the dark ravine, they bring the means of
exploring its hiding-places--little knowing whom they had to do with.
"Now he that betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
shall kiss, that same is He, hold Him fast" ([Mat
26:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#048)). The cold-bloodedness of this
speech was only exceeded by the deed itself. "And Judas went before them
\[[Luk 22:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#047)\], and forthwith he came
to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master, and kissed Him" ([Mat
26:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049); compare [Exo
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#027); [Exo
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#007); [Luk
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045)). The impudence of this atrocious
deed shows how thoroughly he had by this time mastered all his scruples.
If the dialogue between our Lord and His captors was before this, as
some interpreters think it was, the kiss of Judas was purely gratuitous,
and probably to make good his right to the money; our Lord having
presented Himself unexpectedly before them, and rendered it unnecessary
for any one to point Him out. But a comparison of the narratives seems
to show that our Lord's "coming forth" to the band was subsequent to the
interview of Judas. "And Jesus said unto him, Friend"--not the endearing
term "friend" (in [Joh 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015)), but
"companion," a word used on occasions of remonstrance or rebuke (as in
[Mat 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013); [Mat
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#012)) --"Wherefore art thou come?"
([Mat 26:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#050)). "Betrayest thou the Son
of man with a kiss"--imprinting upon the foulest act the mark of
tenderest affection? What wounded feeling does this express! Of this
Jesus showed Himself on various occasions keenly susceptible--as all
generous and beautiful natures do.

[John 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 18:4</span></span>

Jesus . . . knowing all things that should come--were coming.

upon him, went forth--from the shade of the trees, probably, into open
view, indicating His sublime preparedness to meet His captors.

Whom seek ye?--partly to prevent a rush of the soldiery upon the
disciples \[BENGEL\]; and see [Mar
14:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051), as showing a tendency to
this: but still more as part of that courage and majesty which so
overawed them. He would not wait to be taken.

[John 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 18:5</span></span>

They answered . . . Jesus of Nazareth--just the sort of blunt, straight
forward reply one expects from military men, simply acting on their
instructions.

I am He--(See on [Joh 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#020)).

Judas . . . stood with them--No more is recorded here of his part of the
scene, but we have found the gap painfully supplied by all the other
Evangelists.

[John 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 18:6</span></span>

As soon then as he said unto them, I am He, they went
backward--recoiled.

and fell to the ground--struck down by a power such as that which smote
Saul of Tarsus and his companions to the earth ([Act
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#014)). It was the glorious effulgence
of the majesty of Christ which overpowered them. "This, occurring before
His surrender, would show His power over His enemies, and so the freedom
with which He gave Himself up" \[MEYER\].

[John 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 18:7</span></span>

Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?--Giving them a door of escape
from the guilt of a deed which now they were able in some measure to
understand.

Jesus of Nazareth--The stunning effect of His first answer wearing off,
they think only of the necessity of executing their orders.

[John 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 18:8</span></span>

I have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go
their way--Wonderful self-possession, and consideration for others, in
such circumstances!

[John 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 18:9</span></span>

That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake, Of them which thou
gavest me have I lost none--The reference is to such sayings as [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039); [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012); showing how conscious the
Evangelist was, that in reporting his Lord's former sayings, he was
giving them not in substance merely, but in form also. Observe, also,
how the preservation of the disciples on this occasion is viewed as part
that deeper preservation undoubtedly intended in the saying quoted.

[John 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 18:10</span></span>

Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's
servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus--None
of the other Evangelists mention the name either of the ardent disciple
or of his victim. John being "known to the high priest" ([Joh
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015)), the mention of the servant's
name by him is quite natural, and an interesting mark of truth in a
small matter. As to the right ear, specified both here and in Luke ([Luk
22:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#050)), the man was "likely foremost
of those who advanced to seize Jesus, and presented himself in the
attitude of a combatant; hence his right side would be exposed to
attack. The blow of Peter was evidently aimed vertically at his head"
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[John 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joh 18:11</span></span>

Then said Jesus--"Suffer ye thus far" ([Luk
22:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051)).

Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me,
shall I not drink it?--This expresses both the feelings which struggled
in the Lord's breast during the Agony in the garden--aversion to the cup
viewed in itself, but, in the light of the Father's will, perfect
preparedness to drink it. (See on [Luk
22:39-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039)). Matthew adds to the address
to Peter the following:--"For all they that take the sword shall perish
by the sword" ([Mat 26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)) --that is,
'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human warfare; but
Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, are attended
with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.' "Thinkest thou that I
cannot now"--even after things have proceeded so far--"pray to My
Father, and He shall presently give Me"--rather, "place at My
disposal"--"more than twelve legions of angels"; with allusion,
possibly, to the one angel who had, in His agony, "appeared to Him from
heaven strengthening Him" ([Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043)); and in the precise number,
alluding to the twelve who needed the help, Himself and His eleven
disciples. (The full complement of a legion of Roman soldiers was six
thousand). "But how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it
must be?" ([Mat 26:53-54](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053)). He could
not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed Himself to be
delivered from the predicted death. "And He touched his ear and healed
him" ([Luk 22:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051)); for "the Son of man
came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them" ([Luk
9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056)), and, even while they were
destroying His, to save theirs.

[John 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joh 18:12</span></span>

Then the band . . . took Jesus--but not till He had made them feel that
"no man took His life from Him, but that He laid it down of Himself."

[John 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 18:13</span></span>

And led him away--"In that hour," says Matthew ([Mat
26:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055)), and probably now, on the
way to judgment, when the crowds were pressing upon Him, "said Jesus to
the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and
staves, for to take Me"--expressive of the indignity which He felt to be
thus done to Him--"I sat daily with you in the temple, and ye laid no
hold on Me. But this" (adds [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053)) "is your hour and the power of
darkness." Matthew continues--"But all this was done that the scriptures
of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him
and fled" ([Mat 26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056)) --thus
fulfilling His prediction ([Mar 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#027);
[Joh 16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032)).

JESUS BEFORE ANNAS AND CAIAPHAS--FALL OF PETER. ([Joh
18:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#013))

And led him away to Annas first--(See on [Luk
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002), and [Mat
26:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#057)). (Also see on [Mar
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053).)

[John 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 18:14</span></span>

Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people--(Also see on [Mar
14:53](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#053).)

[John 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 18:15</span></span>

Simon Peter followed Jesus--Natural though this was, and safe enough,
had he only "watched and prayed that he enter not into temptation," as
his Master bade him ([Mat 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041)), it
was, in his case, a fatal step.

and . . . another disciple--Rather, "the other disciple"--our Evangelist
himself, no doubt.

known unto the high priest--(See on [Joh
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010)).

went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

[John 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 18:16</span></span>

But Peter stood at the door without--by preconcerted arrangement with
his friend till he should get access for him.

Then went out that other . . . and spake to her that kept the door, and
brought in Peter--The naturalness of these small details is not unworthy
of notice. This other disciple first made good his own entrance on the
score of acquaintance with the high priest; this secured, he goes forth
again, now as a privileged person, to make interest for Peter's
admission. But thus our poor disciple is in the coils of the serpent.
The next steps will best be seen by inverting [Joh
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017) and [Joh
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018).

[John 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 18:17</span></span>

Then saith the damsel that kept the door--"one of the maids of the high
priest," says Mark ([Mar 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)). "When
she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him and said" ([Mar
14:67](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#067)). Luke is more graphic ([Luk
22:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#056)) --She "beheld him as he sat by
the fire (literally, 'the light'), and earnestly looked on him (fixed
her gaze upon him), and said." "His demeanor and timidity, which must
have vividly showed themselves, as it so generally happens, leading to
the recognition of him" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

Art thou not also one of this man's disciples?--that is, thou as well as
"that other disciple," whom she knew to be one, but did not challenge,
perceiving that he was a privileged person.

He saith, I am not--"He denied before them all, saying, I know not what
thou sayest" ([Mat 26:70](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070)) --a common
form of point blank denial; "I know \[supply 'Him'\] not, neither
understand I what thou sayest" ([Mar
14:68](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068)); "Woman, I know Him not" ([Luk
22:57](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#057)). This was THE FIRST DENIAL.
"And he went out into the porch \[thinking, perhaps, to steal away\],
and the cock crew," ([Mar 14:68](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068)).

[John 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 18:18</span></span>

And the servants and officers--the menials and some of the "band" that
"took Jesus." (Also see on [Mar
14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

stood there, who had made--"having made."

a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves--"John
alone notices the material (charcoal) of which the fire was made, and
the reason for a fire--the coldness of the night" \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\]. "Peter went in and sat with the servants to see the end
([Mat 26:58](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#058)), and warmed himself at
the fire" ([Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054)). These two
statements are extremely interesting. His wishing to "see the end," of
issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he
evidently feared the worst. But once in, the serpent coil is drawn
closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the
fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the
all-engrossing topic, he may pick up something which he would like to
hear. "And as Peter was beneath in the palace" ([Mar
14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)). Matthew ([Mat
26:69](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#069)) says, "sat without in the
palace." According to Oriental architecture, and especially in large
buildings, as here, the street door--or heavy folding gate through which
single persons entered by a wicket kept by a porter--opened by a passage
or "porch" ([Mar 14:68](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#068)) into a
quadrangular court, here called the "palace" or hall, which was open
above, and is frequently paved with flagstones. In the center of this
court the "fire" would be kindled (in a brazier). At the upper end of
it, probably, was the chamber in which the trial was held, open to the
court and not far from the fire ([Luk
22:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061)), but on a higher level; for
Mark ([Mar 14:66](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#066)) says the court was
"beneath" it. The ascent was, perhaps, by a short flight of steps. This
explanation will make the intensely interesting details more
intelligible.

[John 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 18:19</span></span>

The high priest . . . asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine--probably to entrap Him into some statements which might be
used against Him at the trial. From our Lord's answer it would seem that
"His disciples" were understood to be some secret party. (Also see on
[Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

[John 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 18:20</span></span>

I spake--have spoken.

openly to the world--See [Joh 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004).

I ever taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews
always resort--courting publicity, though with sublime noiselessness.

in secret have I said--spake I.

nothing--that is, nothing of any different nature; all His private
communications with the Twelve being but explanations and developments
of His public teaching. (Compare [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019); [Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016)). (Also see on [Mar
14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

[John 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 18:21</span></span>

Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me . . . they know what I . . .
said--This seems to imply that He saw the attempt to draw Him into
self-crimination, and resented it by falling back upon the right of
every accused party to have some charge laid against Him by competent
witnesses. (Also see on [Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

[John 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 18:22</span></span>

struck Jesus with the palm . . . Answerest Thou the high priest so--(See
[Isa 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006); and compare [Act
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002)). (Also see on [Mar
14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

[John 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 18:23</span></span>

If I have spoken, &c.--"if I spoke" evil, in reply to the high priest.
(Also see on [Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

if well--He does not say "If not" evil, as if His reply were merely
unobjectionable: "well" seems to challenge more than this as due to His
remonstrance This shows that [Mat 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039)
is not to be taken to the letter.

[John 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 18:24</span></span>

Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas--Our translators so render
the words, understanding that the foregoing interview took place before
Caiaphas; Annas, declining to meddle with the case, having sent Him to
Caiaphas at once. But the words here literally are, "Annas sent Him
\[not 'had sent Him'\] to Caiaphas"--and the "now" being of doubtful
authority. Thus read, the verse affords no evidence that He was sent to
Caiaphas before the interview just recorded, but implies rather the
contrary. We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest
interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an
hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and one that
ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by the other
Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called. But the
building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the
room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one.
(Also see on [Mar 14:54](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#054).)

[John 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 18:25</span></span>

And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore .
. . Art thou not also one of his disciples?--In [Mat
26:71](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#071) the second charge was made by
"another maid, when he was gone out into the porch," who "saw him, and
said unto them that were there, This \[fellow\] was also with Jesus of
Nazareth." So also [Mar 14:69](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#069). But in
[Luk 22:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#058) it is said, "After a little
while" (from the time of the first denial), "another \[man\] saw him,
and said, Thou art also of them." Possibly it was thrown at him by more
than one; but these circumstantial variations only confirm the truth of
the narrative.

He denied it, and said, I am not--in [Mat
26:72](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#072), "He denied with an oath, I do
not know the man." This was THE SECOND DENIAL.

[John 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 18:26</span></span>

One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman, whose ear
Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him--No
doubt his relationship to Malchus drew attention to the man who smote
him, and this enabled him to identify Peter. "Sad reprisals!"
\[BENGEL\]. The other Evangelists make his detection to turn upon his
dialect. "After a while \['about the space of one hour after' ([Luk
22:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059))\] came unto him they that stood
by and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech
betrayeth thee" ([Mat 26:73](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#073)). "Thou
art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto" ([Mar
14:70](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070); and so [Luk
22:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#059)). The Galilean dialect had a
more Syrian cast than that of Judea. If Peter had held his peace, this
peculiarity had not been observed; but hoping, probably, to put them off
the scent by joining in the fireside talk, he only thus revealed
himself.

[John 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 18:27</span></span>

Peter then denied again--But, if the challenge of Malchus' kinsman was
made simultaneously with this on account of his Galilean dialect, it was
no simple denial; for [Mat 26:74](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#074) says,
"Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man." So
[Mar 14:71](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#071). This was THE THIRD DENIAL.

and immediately--"while he yet spake" ([Luk
22:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#060)).

the cock crew--As Mark is the only Evangelist who tells us that our Lord
predicted that the cock should crow twice ([Mar
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#030)), so he only mentions that it
did crow twice ([Mar 14:72](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#072)). The other
Evangelists, who tell us merely that our Lord predicted that "before the
cock should crow he would deny Him thrice" ([Mat
26:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#034); [Luk
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#034); [Joh
13:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#038)), mention only one actual
crowing, which was Mark's last. This is something affecting in this
Evangelist--who, according to the earliest tradition (confirmed by
internal evidence), derived his materials so largely from Peter as to
have been styled his "interpreter," being the only one who gives both
the sad prediction and its still sadder fulfilment in full. It seems to
show that Peter himself not only retained through all his after-life the
most vivid recollection of the circumstances of his fall, but that he
was willing that others should know them too. The immediately subsequent
acts are given in full only in Luke ([Luk
22:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#061)): "And the Lord turned and
looked upon Peter," from the hall of judgment to the court, in the way
already explained. But who can tell what lightning flashes of wounded
love and piercing reproach shot from that "look" through the eye of
Peter into his heart! "And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He
had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me thrice. And
Peter went out and wept bitterly." How different from the sequel of
Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of the two men towards the Saviour were
perfectly different from the first; and the treason of Judas was but the
consummation of the wretched man's resistance of the blaze of light in
the midst of which he had lived for three years, while Peter's denial
was but a momentary obscuration of the heavenly light and love to his
Master which ruled his life. But the immediate cause of the revulsion,
which made Peter "weep bitterly," was, beyond all doubt, this
heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave him. And remembering the
Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to
have you that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed \[rather, 'I
prayed'\] for thee that thy faith fail not" (see on [Luk
22:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031)), may we not say that this
prayer fetched down all that there was in that 'look' to pierce and
break the heart of. Peter, to keep it from despair, to work in it
"repentance unto salvation not to be repented of," and at length, under
other healing touches, to "restore his soul?" (See on [Mar
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007)).

[John 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 18:28</span></span>

JESUS BEFORE PILATE. ([Joh 18:28-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028))

Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment--but not till
"in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders
and scribes and the whole council against Him to put Him to death, and
bound Him" ([Mat 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001); and see on [Mar
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#001)). The word here rendered "hall of
judgment" is from the Latin, and denotes "the palace of the governor of
a Roman province."

they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be
defiled--by contact with ceremonially unclean Gentiles.

but that they might eat the passover--If this refer to the principal
part of the festival, the eating of the lamb, the question is, how our
Lord and His disciples came to eat it the night before; and, as it was
an evening meal, how ceremonial defilement contracted in the morning
would unfit them for partaking of it, as after six o'clock it was
reckoned a new day. These are questions which have occasioned immense
research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews appear to
have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge of
them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are among the
not very important questions which probably will never be entirely
solved.

[John 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 18:29</span></span>

Pilate went out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this
man?--State your charge.

[John 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 18:30</span></span>

If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto
thee--They were conscious they had no case of which Pilate could take
cognizance, and therefore insinuate that they had already found Him
worthy of death by their own law; but not having the power, under the
Roman government, to carry their sentence into execution, they had come
merely for his sanction.

[John 18:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 18:32</span></span>

That the saying . . . might be fulfilled which he spake, signifying what
death he should die--that is, by crucifixion ([Joh
12:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032); [Mat
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#019)); which being a Roman mode of
execution, could only be carried into effect by order of the governor.
(The Jewish mode in such cases as this was by stoning).

[John 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 18:33</span></span>

Pilate . . . called Jesus, and said . . . Art thou the King of the
Jews?--In [Luk 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#002) they charge our
Lord before Pilate with "perverting the nation, and forbidding to give
tribute to CÃ&brvbr;sar, saying that He Himself is Christ a king."
Perhaps this was what occasioned Pilate's question.

[John 18:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">joh 18:34</span></span>

Jesus answered . . . Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it
thee of me?--an important question for our Lord's case, to bring out
whether the word "King" were meant in a political sense, with which
Pilate had a right to deal, or whether he were merely put up to it by
His accusers, who had no claims to charge Him but such as were of a
purely religious nature, with which Pilate had nothing to do.

[John 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 18:35</span></span>

Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests
delivered thee to me: What hast thou done?--that is, "Jewish questions I
neither understand nor meddle with; but Thou art here on a charge which,
though it seems only Jewish, may yet involve treasonable matter: As they
state it, I cannot decide the point; tell me, then, what procedure of
Thine has brought Thee into this position." In modern phrase, Pilate's
object in this question was merely to determine the relevancy of the
charge.

[John 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 18:36</span></span>

Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world--He does not say "not
over," but "not of this world"--that is, in its origin and nature;
therefore "no such kingdom as need give thee or thy master the least
alarm."

if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
should not be delivered to the Jews--"A very convincing argument; for if
His servants did not fight to prevent their King from being delivered up
to His enemies, much less would they use force for the establishment of
His kingdom" \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

but now--but the fact is.

is my kingdom not from hence--Our Lord only says whence His kingdom is
not--first simply affirming it, next giving proof of it, then
reaffirming it. This was all that Pilate had to do with. The positive
nature of His kingdom He would not obtrude upon one who was as little
able to comprehend it, as entitled officially to information about it.
(It is worthy of notice that the "MY," which occurs four times in this
one verse--thrice of His kingdom, and once of His servants--is put in
the emphatic form).

[John 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 18:37</span></span>

Art thou a king then?--There was no sarcasm or disdain in this question
(as THOLUCK, ALFORD, and others, allege), else our Lord's answer would
have been different. Putting emphasis upon "thou," his question betrays
a mixture of surprise and uneasiness, partly at the possibility of there
being, after all, something dangerous under the claim, and partly from a
certain awe which our Lord's demeanor probably struck into him.

Thou sayest that I am a king--It is even so.

To this end was I--"have I been."

born and for this cause came I--am I come.

into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth--His birth
expresses His manhood; His coming into the world, His existence before
assuming humanity: The truth, then, here affirmed, though Pilate would
catch little of it, was that His Incarnation was expressly in order to
the assumption of Royalty in our nature. Yet, instead of saying, He came
to be a King, which is His meaning, He says He came to testify to the
truth. Why this? Because, in such circumstances it required a noble
courage not to flinch from His royal claims; and our Lord, conscious
that He was putting forth that courage, gives a turn to His confession
expressive of it. It is to this that Paul alludes, in those remarkable
words to Timothy: "I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things,
and before Christ Jesus, who, in the presence of Pontius Pilate,
witnessed the good confession" ([Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)). This one act of our Lord's
life, His courageous witness-bearing before the governor, was selected
as an encouraging example of the fidelity which Timothy ought to
display. As the Lord (says OLSHAUSEN beautifully) owned Himself the Son
of God before the most exalted theocratic council, so He confessed His
regal dignity in presence of the representative of the highest political
authority on earth.

Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice--Our Lord here not only
affirms that His word had in it a self-evidencing, self-recommending
power, but gently insinuated the true secret of the growth and grandeur
of His kingdom--as A KINGDOM OF TRUTH, in its highest sense, into which
all souls who have learned to live and count all things but loss for the
truth are, by a most heavenly attraction, drawn as into their proper
element; THE KING of whom Jesus is, fetching them in and ruling them by
His captivating power over their hearts.

[John 18:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 18:38</span></span>

Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?--that is, "Thou stirrest the
question of questions, which the thoughtful of every age have asked, but
never man yet answered."

And when he had said this--as if, by putting such a question, he was
getting into interminable and unseasonable inquiries, when this business
demanded rather prompt action.

he went out again unto the Jews--thus missing a noble opportunity for
himself, and giving utterance to that consciousness of the want of all
intellectual and moral certainty, which was the feeling of every
thoughtful mind at that time. "The only certainty," says the elder
PLINY, "is that nothing is certain, nor more miserable than man, nor
more proud. The fearful laxity of morals at that time must doubtless be
traced in a great degree to this skepticism. The revelation of the
eternal truth alone was able to breathe new life into ruined human
nature, and that in the apprehension of complete redemption"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

and saith unto them--in the hearing of our Lord, who had been brought
forth.

I find in him no fault--no crime. This so exasperated "the chief priests
and elders" that, afraid of losing their prey, they poured forth a
volley of charges against Him, as appears from [Luk
23:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#004) : on Pilate's affirming His
innocence, "they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this
place." They see no hope of getting Pilate's sanction to His death
unless they can fasten upon Him a charge of conspiracy against the
government; and as Galilee was noted for its turbulence ([Luk
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#001); [Act
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037)), and our Lord's ministry lay
chiefly there, they artfully introduce it to give color to their charge.
"And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered
nothing ([Mar 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#003)). Then said Pilate
unto Him, Hearest Thou not how many things they witness against Thee?
And He answered him to never a word, insomuch that the governor
marvelled greatly" ([Mat 27:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#013)).
See on [Mar 15:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#003). In his perplexity,
Pilate, hearing of Galilee, bethinks himself of the expedient of sending
Him to Herod, in the hope of thereby further shaking off responsibility
in the case. See [Mar 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#006), and see on
[Luk 23:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#006). The return of the
prisoner only deepened the perplexity of Pilate, who, "calling together
the chief priests, rulers, and people," tells them plainly that not one
of their charges against "this man" had been made good, while even
Herod, to whose jurisdiction he more naturally belonged, had done
nothing to Him: He "will therefore chastise and release him" ([Luk
23:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#013)).

[John 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 18:39</span></span>

But ye have a custom that I should release one unto you at the passover,
&c.--See on [Mar 15:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#007). "On the
typical import of the choice of Christ to suffer, by which Barabbas was
set free, see the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus, particularly [Lev
16:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#005), where the subject is the sin
offering on the great day of atonement" \[KRAFFT in LUTHARDT\].
