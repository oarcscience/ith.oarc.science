### [Isaiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 29:1</span></span>

COMING INVASION OF JERUSALEM: ITS FAILURE: UNBELIEF OF THE JEWS. (Isa.
29:1-24)

Ariel--Jerusalem; Ariel means "Lion of God," that is, city rendered by
God invincible: the lion is emblem of a mighty hero ([Sa2
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#020).md). Otherwise "Hearth of God,"
that is, place where the altar-fire continually burns to God ([Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md); [Eze
43:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015).md).

add . . . year to year--ironically; suffer one year after another to
glide on in the round of formal, heartless "sacrifices." Rather, "add
yet another year" to the one just closed \[MAURER\]. Let a year elapse
and a little more ([Isa 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010.md),
Margin).

let . . . kill sacrifices--rather, "let the beasts (of another year) go
round" \[MAURER\]; that is, after the completion of a year "I will
distress Ariel."

[Isaiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 29:2</span></span>

Yet--rather, "Then."

heaviness . . . sorrow--rather, preserving the Hebrew paronomasia,
"groaning" and "moaning."

as Ariel--either, "the city shall be as a lion of God," that is, it
shall emerge from its dangers unvanquished; or "it shall be as the altar
of burnt offering," consuming with fire the besiegers ([Isa
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md); [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md); [Lev
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#002).md); or best, as [Isa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md) continues the threat, and the
promise of deliverance does not come till [Isa
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md), "it shall be like a hearth of
burning," that is, a scene of devastation by fire \[G. V. SMITH\]. The
prophecy, probably, contemplates ultimately, besides the affliction and
deliverance in Sennacherib's time, the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome,
the dispersion of the Jews, their restoration, the destruction of the
enemies that besiege the city ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md), and the final glory of Israel
([Isa 29:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 29:3</span></span>

I--Jehovah, acting through the Assyrian, &c., His instruments ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md).

mount--an artificial mound formed to out-top high walls ([Isa
37:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#033).md); else a station, namely, of
warriors, for the siege.

round about--not fully realized under Sennacherib, but in the Roman
siege ([Luk 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md); [Luk
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020).md).

forts--siege-towers ([Deu 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 29:4</span></span>

Jerusalem shall be as a captive, humbled to the dust. Her voice shall
come from the earth as that of the spirit-charmers or necromancers ([Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md), faint and shrill, as the voice
of the dead was supposed to be. Ventriloquism was doubtless the trick
caused to make the voice appear to come from the earth ([Isa
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003).md). An appropriate retribution that
Jerusalem, which consulted necromancers, should be made like them!

[Isaiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 29:5</span></span>

Moreover--rather, "Yet"; yet in this extremity help shall come, and the
enemy be scattered.

strangers--foreign enemies, invaders ([Isa
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002).md).

it shall be--namely, the destruction of the enemy.

at an instant--in a moment ([Isa
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 29:6</span></span>

Thou--the Assyrian army.

thunder, &c.--not literally, in the case of the Assyrians ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md); but figuratively for an awful
judgment ([Isa 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md); [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017).md). The ulterior fulfilment, in
the case of the Jews' foes in the last days, may be more literal (see as
to "earthquake," [Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 29:7</span></span>

munition--fortress.

[Isaiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 29:8</span></span>

Their disappointment in the very height of their confident expectation
of taking Jerusalem shall be as great as that of the hungry man who in a
dream fancies he eats, but awakes to hunger still ([Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020).md); their dream shall be
dissipated on the fatal morning ([Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md).

soul--simply his appetite: he is still thirsty.

[Isaiah 29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 29:9</span></span>

Stay--rather, "Be astounded"; expressing the stupid and amazed
incredulity with which the Jews received Isaiah's announcement.

wonder--The second imperative, as often ([Isa
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009).md), is a threat; the first is a
simple declaration of a fact, "Be astounded, since you choose to be so,
at the prophecy, soon you will be amazed at the sight of the actual
event" \[MAURER\].

cry . . . out . . . cry--rather, "Be ye blinded (since you choose to be
so, though the light shines all round you), and soon ye shall be
blinded" in good earnest to your sorrow \[MAURER\], ([Isa
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md).

not with wine--but with spiritual paralysis ([Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021).md).

ye . . . they--The change from speaking to, to speaking of them,
intimates that the prophet turns away from them to a greater distance,
because of their stupid unbelief.

[Isaiah 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 29:10</span></span>

Jehovah gives them up judicially to their own hardness of heart (compare
[Zac 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013).md). Quoted by Paul, with
variations from the Septuagint, [Rom
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md). See [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); [Psa
69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023.md).

eyes; the prophets, &c.--rather, "hath closed your eyes, the prophets;
and your heads (Margin; see also [Isa
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002).md), the seers, He hath covered." The
Orientals cover the head to sleep; thus "covered" is parallel to "closed
your eyes" ([Jdg 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#019).md). Covering the
face was also preparatory to execution ([Est
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#008).md). This cannot apply to the time
when Isaiah himself prophesied, but to subsequent times.

[Isaiah 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 29:11</span></span>

of all--rather, "the whole vision." "Vision" is the same here as
"revelation," or "law"; in [Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md),
the same Hebrew word is translated, "covenant" \[MAURER\].

sealed-- ([Isa 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016).md), God seals up the
truth so that even the learned, because they lack believing docility,
cannot discern it ([Mat 13:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#010.md); [Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025).md). Prophecy remained
comparatively a sealed volume ([Dan
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#004.md), [Dan
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#009).md), until Jesus, who "alone is
worthy," "opened the seals" ([Rev
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md), [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md); [Rev
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 29:12</span></span>

The unlearned succeed no better than the learned, not from want of human
learning, as they fancy, but from not having the teaching of God ([Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md); [Joh
6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045.md); [Co1
2:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 29:13</span></span>

precept of men--instead of the precepts of God, given by His prophets;
also worship external, and by rule, not heartfelt as God requires ([Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024).md). Compare Christ's quotation of
this verse from the Septuagint.

[Isaiah 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 29:14</span></span>

([Hab 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md); [Act
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041).md). The "marvellous work" is one
of unparalleled vengeance on the hypocrites: compare "strange work,"
[Isa 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021.md). The judgment, too, will
visit the wise in that respect in which they most pride themselves;
their wisdom shall be hid, that is, shall no longer appear, so as to
help the nation in its distress (compare [Co1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 29:15</span></span>

seek deep to hide--rather, "That seek to hide deeply," &c. (compare [Isa
30:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#001).md). The reference is to the
secret plan which many of the Jewish nobles had of seeking Egyptian aid
against Assyria, contrary to the advice of Isaiah. At the same time the
hypocrite in general is described, who, under a plausible exterior,
tries to hide his real character, not only from men, but even from God.

[Isaiah 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 29:16</span></span>

Rather, "Ah! your perverseness! just as if the potter should be esteemed
as the clay!" \[MAURER\]. Or, "Ye invert (turn upside down) the order of
things, putting yourselves instead of God," and vice versa, just as if
the potter should be esteemed as the clay \[HORSLEY\], ([Isa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md); [Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 29:17</span></span>

turned--as contrasted with your "turnings of things upside down" ([Isa
29:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#016).md), there shall be other and
better turnings or revolutions; the outpouring of the Spirit in the
latter days ([Isa 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015).md); first on the
Jews; which shall be followed by their national restoration (see on [Isa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#002.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md) then on the Gentiles ([Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028).md).

fruitful field--literally, "a Carmel" (see on [Isa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018).md). The moral change in the Jewish
nation shall be as great as if the wooded Lebanon were to become a
fruitful field, and vice versa. Compare [Mat
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#012.md), Greek: "the kingdom of heaven
forces itself," as it were, on man's acceptance; instead of men having
to seek Messiah, as they had John, in a desert, He presents Himself
before them with loving invitations; thus men's hearts, once a moral
desert, are reclaimed so as to bear fruits of righteousness: vice versa,
the ungodly who seemed prosperous, both in the moral and literal sense,
shall be exhibited in their real barrenness.

[Isaiah 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 29:18</span></span>

deaf . . . blind--(Compare [Mat 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005).md).
The spiritually blind, &c., are chiefly meant; "the book," as Revelation
is called pre-eminently, shall be no longer "sealed," as is described
([Isa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011).md), but the most
unintelligent shall hear and see ([Isa
35:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 29:19</span></span>

meek--rather, the afflicted godly: the idea is, virtuous suffering ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Psa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#009.md); [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011).md) \[BARNES\].

poor among men--that is, the poorest of men, namely, the pious poor.

rejoice--when they see their oppressors punished ([Isa
29:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020).md), and Jehovah exhibited as
their protector and rewarder ([Isa
29:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md); [Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md); [Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 29:20</span></span>

terrible--namely, the persecutors among the Jewish nobles.

scorner-- ([Isa 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md), [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022).md).

watch for--not only commit iniquity, but watch for opportunities of
committing it, and make it their whole study (see [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001.md); [Mat
26:59](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#059.md); [Mat
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 29:21</span></span>

Rather, "Who make a man guilty in his cause" \[GESENIUS\], that is,
unjustly condemn him. "A man" is in the Hebrew a poor man, upon whom
such unjust condemnations might be practiced with more impunity than on
the rich; compare [Isa 29:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#019.md), "the
meek . . . the poor."

him that reproveth--rather, "pleadeth"; one who has a suit at issue.

gate--the place of concourse in a city, where courts of justice were
held ([Rut 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#011.md); [Pro
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#023.md); [Amo
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md), [Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012).md).

just--one who has a just cause; or, Jesus Christ, "the Just One"
\[HORSLEY\].

for a thing of naught--rather, "through falsehood," "by a decision that
is null in justice" \[BARNES\]. Compare as to Christ, [Pro
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021.md); [Mat
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015.md); [Act
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md); [Act
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033.md).

[Isaiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 29:22</span></span>

Join "saith . . . concerning the house of Jacob."

redeemed--out of Ur, a land of idolaters ([Jos
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#003).md).

not now--After the moral revolution described ([Isa
29:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#017).md), the children of Jacob shall no
longer give cause to their forefathers to blush for them.

wax pale--with shame and disappointment at the wicked degeneracy of his
posterity, and fear as to their punishment.

[Isaiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 29:23</span></span>

But--rather, "For."

he--Jacob.

work of mine hands--spiritually, as well as physically ([Isa
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010).md). By Jehovah's agency Israel
shall be cleansed of its corruptions, and shall consist wholly of pious
men ([Isa 54:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md); [Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021).md).

midst of him--that is, his land. Or else "His children" are the Gentiles
adopted among the Israelites, his lineal descendants ([Rom
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md); [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006).md) \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 29:24</span></span>

They . . . that erred-- ([Isa 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007).md).

learn doctrine--rather, "shall receive discipline" or "instruction."
"Murmuring" was the characteristic of Israel's rebellion against God
([Exo 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md); [Psa
106:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#025).md). This shall be so no more.
Chastisements, and, in HORSLEY'S view, the piety of the Gentiles
provoking the Jews to holy jealousy ([Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md), [Rom
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014).md), shall then produce the desired
effect.

Jewish ambassadors were now on their way to Egypt to seek aid against
Assyria ([Isa 30:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#002.md), [Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001).md). Isaiah denounces this reliance
on Egypt rather than on Jehovah. God had prohibited such alliances with
heathen nations, and it was a leading part of Jewish polity that they
should be a separate people ([Exo
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032.md); [Deu
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#002).md).
