### [Jeremiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 7:2</span></span>

THE SEVENTH THROUGH NINTH CHAPTERS. DELIVERED IN THE BEGINNING OF
JEHOIAKIM'S REIGN, ON THE OCCASION OF SOME PUBLIC FESTIVAL. (Jer.
7:1-34)

the gate--that is, the gate of the court of Israel within that of the
women. Those whom Jeremiah addresses came through the gate leading into
the court of the women, and the gate leading into the outer court, or
court of the Gentiles ("these gates").

[Jeremiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 7:3</span></span>

cause you to dwell--permit you still to dwell ([Jer
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#011.md); [Jer
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 7:4</span></span>

The Jews falsely thought that because their temple had been chosen by
Jehovah as His peculiar dwelling, it could never be destroyed. Men think
that ceremonial observances will supersede the need of holiness ([Isa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md). The triple repetition of "the
temple of Jehovah" expresses the intense confidence of the Jews (see
[Jer 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#029.md); [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md).

these--the temple buildings which the prophet points to with his finger
([Jer 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 7:5</span></span>

For--"But" \[MAURER\].

judgment--justice ([Jer 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 7:6</span></span>

this place--this city and land ([Jer
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007).md).

to your hurt--so [Jer 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019.md); "to the
confusion or their own faces" ([Jer
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010.md); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036).md).

[Jeremiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 7:7</span></span>

The apodosis to the "if . . . if" ([Jer
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005).md).

to dwell--to continue to dwell.

for ever and ever--joined with "to dwell," not with the words "gave to
your fathers" (compare [Jer 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md); [Deu
4:40](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040).md).

[Jeremiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 7:8</span></span>

that cannot profit--MAURER translates, "so that you profit nothing" (see
[Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md); [Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031).md).

[Jeremiah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 7:9</span></span>

"Will ye steal . . . and then come and stand before Me?"

whom ye know not--Ye have no grounds of "knowing" that they are gods;
but I have manifested My Godhead by My law, by benefits conferred, and
by miracles. This aggravates their crime \[CALVIN\] ([Jdg
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 7:10</span></span>

And come--And yet come ([Eze 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#039).md).

We are delivered--namely, from all impending calamities. In spite of the
prophet's threats, we have nothing to fear; we have offered our
sacrifices, and therefore Jehovah will "deliver" us.

to do all these abominations--namely, those enumerated ([Jer
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009).md). These words are not to be
connected with "we are delivered," but thus: "Is it with this design
that ye come and stand before Me in this house," in order that having
offered your worthless sacrifices ye may be taken into My favor and so
do all these abominations ([Jer 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009).md)
with impunity? \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 7:11</span></span>

den of robbers--Do you regard My temple as being what robbers make their
den, namely, an asylum wherein ye may obtain impunity for your
abominations ([Jer 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010).md)?

seen it--namely, that ye treat My house as if it were a den of thieves.
Jehovah implies more than is expressed, "I have seen and will punish it"
([Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md); [Mat
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 7:12</span></span>

my place . . . in Shiloh--God caused His tabernacle to be set up in
Shiloh in Joshua's days ([Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001.md);
[Jdg 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031).md). In Eli's time God gave
the ark, which had been at Shiloh, into the hands of the Philistines
([Jer 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#006.md); [Sa1
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010.md); [Psa
78:56-61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056).md). Shiloh was situated between
Beth-el and Shechem in Ephraim.

at the first--implying that Shiloh exceeded the Jewish temple in
antiquity. But God's favor is not tied down to localities ([Act
7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044).md).

my people Israel--Israel was God's people, yet He spared it not when
rebellious: neither will He spare Judah, now that it rebels, though
heretofore it has been His people.

[Jeremiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 7:13</span></span>

rising . . . early--implying unwearied earnestness in soliciting them
([Jer 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md); [Jer
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#017.md); [Ch2
36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 7:14</span></span>

I gave--and I therefore can revoke the gift for it is still Mine ([Lev
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#023).md), now that ye fail in the only
object for which it was given, the promotion of My glory.

Shiloh--as I ceased to dwell there, transferring My temple to Jerusalem;
so I will cease to dwell at Jerusalem.

[Jeremiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 7:15</span></span>

your brethren--children of Abraham, as much as you.

whole seed of Ephraim--They were superior to you in numbers and power:
they were ten tribes: ye but two. "Ephraim," as the leading tribe,
stands for the whole ten tribes ([Kg2
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#023.md); [Psa
78:67-68](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067).md).

[Jeremiah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 7:16</span></span>

When people are given up to judicial hardness of heart, intercessory
prayer for them is unavailing ([Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md); [Jer
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#011.md); [Jer
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md); [Exo
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010.md); [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 7:17</span></span>

Jehovah leaves it to Jeremiah himself to decide, is there not good
reason that prayers should not be heard in behalf of such rebels?

[Jeremiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 7:18</span></span>

children . . . fathers . . . women--Not merely isolated individuals
practised idolatry; young and old, men and women, and whole families,
contributed their joint efforts to promote it. Oh, that there were the
same zeal for the worship of God as there is for error ([Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md), [Jer
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013).md)!

cakes . . . queen of heaven--Cakes were made of honey, fine flour, &c.,
in a round flat shape to resemble the disc of the moon, to which they
were offered. Others read as Margin, "the frame of heaven," that is, the
planets generally; so the Septuagint here; but elsewhere the Septuagint
translates, "queen of heaven." The PhÅ“nicians called the moon Ashtoreth
or Astarte: the wife of Baal or Moloch, the king of heaven. The male and
female pair of deities symbolized the generative powers of nature; hence
arose the introduction of prostitution in the worship. The Babylonians
worshipped Ashtoreth as Mylitta, that is, generative. Our Monday, or
Moon-day, indicates the former prevalence of moon worship (see on [Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md).

that they may provoke me--implying design: in worshipping strange gods
they seemed as if purposely to provoke Jehovah.

[Jeremiah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 7:19</span></span>

Is it I that they provoke to anger? Is it not themselves? ([Deu
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016.md), [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021.md); [Job
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006.md), [Job
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#008.md); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036).md).

[Jeremiah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 7:20</span></span>

beast . . . trees . . . ground--Why doth God vent His fury on these? On
account of man, for whom these were created, that the sad spectacle may
strike terror into him ([Rom 8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 7:21</span></span>

Put . . . burnt offerings unto . . . sacrifices . . . eat flesh--Add the
former (which the law required to be wholly burnt) to the latter (which
were burnt only in part), and "eat flesh" even off the holocausts or
burnt offerings. As far as I am concerned, saith Jehovah, you may do
with one and the other alike. I will have neither ([Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Hos
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013.md); [Amo
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 7:22</span></span>

Not contradicting the divine obligation of the legal sacrifices. But, "I
did not require sacrifices, unless combined with moral obedience" ([Psa
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008.md); [Psa
51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016).md). The superior claim of the
moral above the positive precepts of the law was marked by the ten
commandments having been delivered first, and by the two tables of stone
being deposited alone in the ark ([Deu
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#006).md). The negative in Hebrew often
supplies the want of the comparative: not excluding the thing denied,
but only implying the prior claim of the thing set in opposition to it
([Hos 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006).md). "I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice" ([Sa1 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022).md). Love to
God is the supreme end, external observances only means towards that
end. "The mere sacrifice was not so much what I commanded, as the
sincere submission to My will gives to the sacrifice all its virtue"
\[MAGEE, Atonement, Note 57\].

[Jeremiah 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 7:23</span></span>

([Exo 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md); [Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 7:24</span></span>

hearkened not--They did not give even a partial hearing to Me ([Psa
81:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#011).md).

imagination--rather, as Margin, "the stubbornness"

backward, &c.-- ([Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md); [Jer
32:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#033.md); [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 7:25</span></span>

rising . . . early-- ([Jer 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 7:26</span></span>

hardened . . . neck-- ([Deu 31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027.md);
[Isa 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

worse than their fathers-- ([Jer
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012).md). In [Jer
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md) He had said, "your fathers"; here
He says, "their fathers"; the change to the third person marks growing
alienation from them. He no longer addresses themselves, as it would be
a waste of words in the case of such hardened rebels.

[Jeremiah 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 7:27</span></span>

Therefore--rather, "Though thou speak . . . yet they will not hearken"
\[MAURER\], ([Eze 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007).md), a trial to the
prophet's faith; though he knew his warnings would be unheeded, still he
was to give them in obedience to God.

[Jeremiah 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 7:28</span></span>

unto them--that is, in reference to them.

a nation--The word usually applied to the Gentile nations is here
applied to the Jews, as being east off and classed by God among the
Gentiles.

nor receiveth correction-- ([Jer 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003).md).

truth . . . perished-- ([Jer 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 7:29</span></span>

Jeremiah addresses Jerusalem under the figure of a woman, who, in grief
for her lost children, deprives her head of its chief ornament and goes
up to the hills to weep ([Jdg
11:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#037.md); [Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002).md).

hair--flowing locks, like those of a Nazarite.

high places--The scene of her idolatries is to be the scene of her
mourning ([Jer 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021).md).

generation of his wrath--the generation with which He is wroth. So [Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006.md); "the people of My wrath."

[Jeremiah 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 7:30</span></span>

set their abominations in the house-- ([Jer
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#034.md); [Kg2
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#004.md), [Kg2

8:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 7:31</span></span>

high places of Tophet--the altars \[HORSLEY\] of Tophet; erected to
Moloch, on the heights along the south of the valley facing Zion.

burn . . . sons-- ([Psa 106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038).md).

commanded . . . not--put for, "I forbade expressly" ([Deu
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#003.md); [Deu
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#031).md). See on [Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023.md); [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md).

[Jeremiah 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 7:32</span></span>

valley of slaughter--so named because of the great slaughter of the Jews
about to take place at Jerusalem: a just retribution of their sin in
slaying their children to Moloch in Tophet.

no place--no room, namely, to bury in, so many shall be those slain by
the Chaldeans ([Jer 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md); [Eze
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 7:33</span></span>

fray--scare or frighten ([Deu 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#026).md).
Typical of the last great battle between the Lord's host and the
apostasy ([Rev 19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 7:34</span></span>

Referring to the joyous songs and music with which the bride and
bridegroom were escorted in the procession to the home of the latter
from that of the former; a custom still prevalent in the East ([Jer
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md); [Isa
24:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#007.md); [Rev
