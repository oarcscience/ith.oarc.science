<p>
<p>we were gotten--"torn." 
<p>
<p>from them--expressing the difficulty and pain of the parting. 
<p>
<p>with a straight course--running before the wind, as <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011">Act 16:11</A>. 
<p>
<p>unto Coos--Cos, an island due south from Miletus, which they would reach in about six hours, and coming close to the mainland. 
<p>
<p>the day following unto Rhodes--another island, some fifty miles to the southeast, of brilliant classic memory and beauty. 
<p>
<p>thence unto Patara--a town on the magnificent mainland of Lycia, almost due east from Rhodes. It was the seat of a celebrated oracle of Apollo.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#002">Acts 21:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">act 21:2</A></FONT></span></p>And finding a ship--their former one going no farther, probably. 
<p>
<p>to Ph&Aring;&#147;nica--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Act 11:19</A>). 
<p>
<p>went abroad--One would almost think this extracted from a journal of the voyage, so graphic are its details.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003">Acts 21:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">act 21:3</A></FONT></span></p>when we . . . discovered--"sighted," as the phrase is. 
<p>
<p>Cyprus, we left it on the left hand--that is, steered southeast of it, leaving it on the northwest. 
<p>
<p>sailed into--"unto" 
<p>
<p>Syria, and landed at Tyre--the celebrated seat of maritime commerce for East and West. It might be reached from Patara in about two days. 
<p>
<p>there the ship was to unlade her burden--which gave the apostle time for what follows.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004">Acts 21:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">act 21:4</A></FONT></span></p>finding disciples--finding out the disciples, implying some search. They would expect such, from what is recorded, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Act 11:19</A>. Perhaps they were not many; yet there were gifted ones among them. 
<p>
<p>who said to Paul . . . that he should not go up to Jerusalem--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023">Act 20:23</A>; also see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011">Act 21:11-14</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005">Acts 21:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">act 21:5</A></FONT></span></p>they all brought us on our way with wives and children . . . and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036">Act 20:36</A>). Observe here that the children of these Tyrian disciples not only were taken along with their parents, but must have joined in this act of solemn worship. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001">Eph 6:1</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007">Acts 21:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">act 21:7</A></FONT></span></p>when we had finished our course--completing the voyage 
<p>
<p>from Tyre, we came--which they would do the same day. 
<p>
<p>to Ptolemais--anciently called Accho (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031">Jdg 1:31</A>), now St. Jean d'Acre, or Acre. 
<p>
<p>and saluted the brethren, and abode, &amp;c.--disciples gathered probably as at Tyre, on the occasion mentioned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Act 11:19</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008">Acts 21:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">act 21:8</A></FONT></span></p>next day we that were of Paul's company departed--(The words "the were of Paul's company" are omitted in the best manuscripts. They were probably added as the connecting words at the head of some church lessons). 
<p>
<p>and came to C&Atilde;&brvbr;sarea--a run along the coast, southward, of some thirty miles. 
<p>
<p>Philip the evangelist--a term answering apparently very much to our missionary [HOWSON], by whose ministry such joy had been diffused over Samaria and the Ethiopian eunuch had been baptized (Acts 8:4-40). 
<p>
<p>one of the seven--deacons, who had "purchased to himself a good degree" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013">Ti1 3:13</A>). He and Paul now meet for the first time, some twenty-five years after that time.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009">Acts 21:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">act 21:9</A></FONT></span></p>the same man had four daughters . . . which did prophesy--fulfilling <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028">Joe 2:28</A> (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018">Act 2:18</A>). This is mentioned, it would seem, merely as a high distinction divinely conferred on so devoted a servant of the Lord Jesus, and probably indicates the high tone of religion in his family.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010">Acts 21:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">act 21:10</A></FONT></span></p>tarried there many--"a good many" 
<p>
<p>days--Finding himself in good time for Pentecost at Jerusalem, he would feel it a refreshing thing to his spirit to hold Christian communion for a few days with such a family. 
<p>
<p>there came down from Judea--the news of Paul's arrival having spread. 
<p>
<p>a certain prophet . . . Agabus--no doubt the same as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Act 11:28</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011">Acts 21:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">act 21:11</A></FONT></span></p>So shall the Jews bind the man that owneth this girdle, &amp;c.--For though the Romans did it, it was at the Jews' instigation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033">Act 21:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017">Act 28:17</A>). Such dramatic methods of announcing important future events would bring the old prophets to remembrance. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002">Isa 20:2</A>, &amp;c.; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001">Jer 13:1</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001">Eze 5:1</A>, &amp;c.). This prediction and that at Tyre (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004">Act 21:4</A>) were intended, not to prohibit him from going, but to put his courage to the test and when he stood the test, to deepen and mature it.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#012">Acts 21:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">act 21:12</A></FONT></span></p>we and they at that place--the C&Atilde;&brvbr;sarean Christians. 
<p>
<p>besought him--even with tears, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013">Act 21:13</A>. 
<p>
<p>not to go to Jerusalem.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013">Acts 21:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">act 21:13</A></FONT></span></p>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart--Beautiful union of manly resoluteness and womanly tenderness, alike removed from mawkishness and stoicism! 
<p>
<p>I am ready not to be bound only--"If that is all, let it come." 
<p>
<p>but to die, &amp;c.--It was well he could add this, for he had that also to do.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015">Acts 21:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">act 21:15</A></FONT></span></p>we took up our carriages--"our baggage." 
<p>
<p>and went up to Jerusalem--for the fifth time after his conversion, thus concluding his third missionary tour, which proved his last, so far as recorded; for though he accomplished the fourth and last part of the missionary plan sketched out (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021">Act 19:21</A>) --"After I have been at Jerusalem, I must also see Rome"--it was as "a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016">Acts 21:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">act 21:16</A></FONT></span></p>went with us . . . and brought with them--rather, "brought us to." 
<p>
<p>One Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, &amp;c.--not an "aged" disciple, but probably "a disciple of old standing," perhaps one of the three thousand converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to the Saviour Himself during His lifetime. He had come, probably, with the other Cyprians (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020">Act 11:20</A>), to Antioch, "preaching the Lord Jesus unto the Grecians," and now he appears settled at Jerusalem.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#017">Acts 21:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">act 21:17</A></FONT></span></p>PAUL REPORTS THE EVENTS OF HIS THIRD MISSIONARY JOURNEY--IN THE TEMPLE, PURIFYING HIMSELF FROM A JEWISH VOW, HE IS SEIZED BY A MOB AND BEATEN TO THE DANGER OF HIS LIFE--THE UPROAR BECOMING UNIVERSAL, THE ROMAN COMMANDANT HAS HIM BROUGHT IN CHAINS TO THE FORTRESS, FROM THE STAIRS OF WHICH HE IS PERMITTED TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE. (Acts 21:17-40)
<p>
<p>the brethren received us gladly--the disciples generally, as distinguished from the official reception recorded in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018">Act 21:18</A>.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018">Acts 21:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">act 21:18</A></FONT></span></p>Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present--to "report himself" formally to the acknowledged head of the church at Jerusalem, and his associates in office. See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013">Act 15:13</A>. Had any other of the apostles been in Jerusalem on that occasion, it could hardly fail to have been noted.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#019">Acts 21:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">act 21:19</A></FONT></span></p>he declared particularly--in detail. 
<p>
<p>what God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry--as on previous occasions (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027">Act 14:27</A>; and see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015">Rom 15:15</A>); no doubt referring to the insidious and systematic efforts of the Judaizing party in a number of places to shrivel the Church of Christ into a Jewish sect, and his own counter-procedure.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020">Acts 21:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">act 21:20</A></FONT></span></p>they glorified the Lord, &amp;c.--constrained to justify his course, notwithstanding the Jewish complexion of the Christianity of Jerusalem.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021">Acts 21:21</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">act 21:21</A></FONT></span></p>they are informed . . . that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles--those residing in heathen countries. 
<p>
<p>to forsake Moses, &amp;c.--This calumny of the unbelieving Jews would find easy credence among the Christian zealots for Judaism.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023">Acts 21:23</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_023">act 21:23</A></FONT></span></p>we have four men--Christian Jews, no doubt. 
<p>
<p>which have a vow--perhaps kept ready on purpose.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024">Acts 21:24</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">act 21:24</A></FONT></span></p>be at charges with them--that is, defray the expense of the sacrifices legally required of them, along with his own, which was deemed a mark of Jewish generosity.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025">Acts 21:25</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_025">act 21:25</A></FONT></span></p>touching the Gentiles . . . we have written and concluded that they observe no such things, &amp;c.--This shows that with all their conciliation to Jewish prejudice, the Church of Jerusalem was taught to adhere to the decision of the famous council held there (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019">Act 15:19-29</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026">Acts 21:26</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_026">act 21:26</A></FONT></span></p>to signify--that is, announce to the priest. 
<p>
<p>the accomplishment of the days of purification, &amp;c.--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014">Num 6:14-21</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027">Acts 21:27</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_027">act 21:27</A></FONT></span></p>the Jews . . . of Asia--in all likelihood those of Ephesus (since they recognized Trophimus apparently as a townsman, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029">Act 21:29</A>), embittered by their discomfiture (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009">Act 19:9</A>, &amp;c.).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_030">act 21:30</A></FONT></span></p>took Paul, and drew him out of the temple; and forthwith the doors were shut--that the murder they meant to perpetrate might not pollute that holy place.

See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#032">Act 21:32</A>. This part of the narrative is particularly graphic.

<p>
<p>to be carried into the castle--rather, perhaps, "the barracks," or that part of the fortress of Antonia appropriated to the soldiers. The fort was built by Herod on a high rock at the northwest corner of the great temple area, and called after Mark Antony.

<p>
<p>a great silence--the people awed at the permission given him by the commandant, and seeing him sitting as a listener.
