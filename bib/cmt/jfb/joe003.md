### [Joel Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)

[Joel 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joe 3:1</span></span>

GOD'S VENGEANCE ON ISRAEL'S FOES IN THE VALLEY OF JEHOSHAPHAT. HIS
BLESSING ON THE CHURCH. (Joel 3:1-21)

bring again the captivity--that is, reverse it. The Jews restrict this
to the return from Babylon. Christians refer it to the coming of Christ.
But the prophet comprises the whole redemption, beginning from the
return out of Babylon, then continued from the first advent of Christ
down to the last day (His second advent), when God will restore His
Church to perfect felicity \[CALVIN\].

[Joel 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joe 3:2</span></span>

Parallel to [Zac 14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002), where the
"Mount of Olives" answers to the "Valley of Jehoshaphat" here. The
latter is called "the valley of blessing" (Berachah) ([Ch2
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#026)). It lies between Jerusalem and
the Mount of Olives and has the Kedron flowing through it. As
Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederate foes of Judah, namely, Ammon,
Moab, &c. ([Psa 83:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#006)), in this
valley, so God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, Philistines,
Edom, and Egypt, with a similar utter overthrow ([Joe
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004), [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019)). This has been long ago
fulfilled; but the ultimate event shadowed forth herein is still future,
when God shall specially interpose to destroy Jerusalem's last foes, of
whom Tyre, Zidon, Edom, Egypt, and Philistia are the types. As
"Jehoshaphat" means "the judgment of Jehovah," the valley of Jehoshaphat
may be used as a general term for the theater of God's final judgments
on Israel's foes, with an allusion to the judgment inflicted on them by
Jehoshaphat. The definite mention of the Mount of Olives in [Zac
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004), and the fact that this was the
scene of the ascension, makes it likely the same shall be the scene of
Christ's coming again: compare "this same Jesus . . . shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven" ([Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)).

all nations--namely, which have maltreated Judah.

plead with them-- ([Isa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016); [Eze
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022)).

my heritage Israel-- ([Deu 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009); [Jer
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#016)). Implying that the source of
Judah's redemption is God's free love, wherewith He chose Israel as His
peculiar heritage, and at the same time assuring them, when desponding
because of trials, that He would plead their cause as His own, and as if
He were injured in their person.

[Joel 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joe 3:3</span></span>

cast lots for my people--that is, divided among themselves My people as
their captives by lot. Compare as to the distribution of captives by lot
([Oba 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011); [Nah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010)).

given a boy for . . . harlot--Instead of paying a harlot for her
prostitution in money, they gave her a Jewish captive boy as a slave.

girl for wine--So valueless did they regard a Jewish girl that they
would sell her for a draught of wine.

[Joel 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joe 3:4</span></span>

what have ye to do with me--Ye have no connection with Me (that is, with
My people: God identifying Himself with Israel); I (that is, My people)
have given you no cause of quarrel, why then do ye trouble Me (that is,
My people)? (Compare the same phrase, [Jos
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#024); [Jdg
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#012); [Sa2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#010); [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029)).

Tyre . . . Zidon . . . Palestine-- ([Amo
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006), [Amo
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#009)).

if ye recompense me--If ye injure Me (My people), in revenge for fancied
wrongs ([Eze 25:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#015)), I will requite
you in your own coin swiftly and speedily.

[Joel 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joe 3:5</span></span>

my silver . . . my gold--that is, the gold and silver of My people. The
Philistines and Arabians had carried off all the treasures of King
Jehoram's house ([Ch2 21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016)).
Compare also [Kg1 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#018); [Kg2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2012.htm#018); [Kg2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#014), for the spoiling of the
treasures of the temple and the king's palace in Judah by Syria. It was
customary among the heathen to hang up in the idol temples some of the
spoils of war as presents to their gods.

[Joel 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joe 3:6</span></span>

Grecians--literally, "Javanites," that is, the Ionians, a Greek colony
on the coast of Asia Minor who were the first Greeks known to the Jews.
The Greeks themselves, however, in their original descent came from
Javan ([Gen 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002), [Gen
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#004)). Probably the germ of Greek
civilization in part came through the Jewish slaves imported into Greece
from PhÅ“nicia by traffickers. [Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013) mentions Javan and Tyre as
trading in the persons of men.

far from their border--far from Judea; so that the captive Jews were cut
off from all hope of return.

[Joel 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joe 3:7</span></span>

raise them--that is, I will rouse them. Neither sea nor distance will
prevent My bringing them back. Alexander, and his successors, restored
to liberty many Jews in bondage in Greece \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 13.5;
Wars of the Jews, 9,2\].

[Joel 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joe 3:8</span></span>

sell them to . . . Sabeans--The Persian Artaxerxes Mnemon and Darius
Ochus, and chiefly the Greek Alexander, reduced the PhÅ“nician and
Philistine powers. Thirty thousand Tyrians after the capture of Tyre by
the last conqueror, and multitudes of Philistines on the taking of Gaza,
were sold as slaves. The Jews are here said to do that which the God of
Judah does in vindication of their wrong, namely, sell the PhÅ“nicians
who sold them, to a people "far off," as was Greece, whither the Jews
had been sold. The Sabeans at the most remote extremity of Arabia Felix
are referred to (compare [Jer 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020);
[Mat 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#042)).

[Joel 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joe 3:9</span></span>

The nations hostile to Israel are summoned by Jehovah to "come up" (this
phrase is used because Jerusalem was on a hill) against Jerusalem, not
that they may destroy it, but to be destroyed by the Lord (Eze. 38:7-23;
[Zac 12:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002); [Zac
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002)).

Prepare war--literally, sanctify war: because the heathen always began
war with religious ceremonies. The very phrase used of Babylon's
preparations against Jerusalem ([Jer
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004)) is now used of the final foes of
Jerusalem. As Babylon was then desired by God to advance against her for
her destruction, so now all her foes, of whom Babylon was the type, are
desired to advance against her for their own destruction.

[Joel 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joe 3:10</span></span>

Beat your ploughshares into swords--As the foes are desired to "beat
their ploughshares into swords, and their pruning hooks into spears,"
that so they may perish in their unhallowed attack on Judah and
Jerusalem, so these latter, and the nations converted to God by them,
after the overthrow of the antichristian confederacy, shall, on the
contrary, "beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into
pruning hooks," when under Messiah's coming reign there shall be war no
more ([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018); [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003)).

let the weak say, I am strong--So universal shall be the rage of
Israel's foes for invading her, that even the weak among them will fancy
themselves strong enough to join the invading forces. Age and infirmity
were ordinarily made valid excuses for exemption from service, but so
mad shall be the fury of the world against God's people, that even the
feeble will not desire to be exempted (compare [Psa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001)).

[Joel 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">joe 3:11</span></span>

Assemble--"Hasten" \[MAURER\].

thither--to the valley of Jehoshaphat.

thy mighty ones--the warriors who fancy themselves "mighty ones," but
who are on that very spot to be overthrown by Jehovah \[MAURER\].
Compare "the mighty men" ([Joe 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009)).
Rather, Joel speaks of God's really "mighty ones" in contrast to the
self-styled "mighty men" ([Joe 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009);
[Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020); [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003); compare [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013)). AUBERLEN remarks: One prophet
supplements the other, for they all prophesied only "in part." What was
obscure to one was revealed to the other; what is briefly described by
one is more fully so by another. Daniel calls Antichrist a king, and
dwells on his worldly conquests; John looks more to his spiritual
tyranny, for which reason he adds a second beast, wearing the semblance
of spirituality. Antichrist himself is described by Daniel. Isaiah (Isa.
29:1-24), Joel (Joel 3:1-21) describe his army of heathen followers
coming up against Jerusalem, but not Antichrist himself.

[Joel 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">joe 3:12</span></span>

See [Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002).

judge all the heathen round about--that is, all the nations from all
parts of the earth which have maltreated Israel; not merely, as
HENDERSON supposes, the nations round about Jerusalem (compare [Psa
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006); [Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004); [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003), [Mic
4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011); [Zep
3:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015); [Zac
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009); [Zac
14:3-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003); [Mal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)).

[Joel 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joe 3:13</span></span>

Direction to the ministers of vengeance to execute God's wrath, as the
enemy's wickedness is come to its full maturity. God does not cut off
the wicked at once, but waits till their guilt is at its full (so as to
the Amorites iniquity, [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016)), to
show forth His own long-suffering, and the justice of their doom who
have so long abused it ([Mat 13:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#027),
[Mat 13:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#038), [Mat
13:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#040); [Rev
14:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015)). For the image of a harvest
to be threshed, compare [Jer 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033);
and a wine-press, [Isa 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003) and [Lam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015).

[Joel 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joe 3:14</span></span>

The prophet in vision seeing the immense array of nations congregating,
exclaims, "Multitudes, multitudes!" a Hebraism for immense multitudes.

valley of decision--that is, the valley in which they are to meet their
"determined doom." The same as "the valley of Jehoshaphat," that is,
"the valley of judgment" (see on [Joe
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002)). Compare [Joe
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#012), "there will I sit to judge,"
which confirms English Version rather than Margin, "threshing." The
repetition of "valley of decision" heightens the effect and pronounces
the awful certainty of their doom.

[Joel 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joe 3:15</span></span>

(See on [Joe 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010); [Joe
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030)).

[Joel 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joe 3:16</span></span>

(Compare [Eze 38:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#018)). The victories
of the Jews over their cruel foe Antiochus, under the Maccabees, may be
a reference of this prophecy; but the ultimate reference is to the last
Antichrist, of whom Antiochus was the type. Jerusalem being the central
seat of the theocracy ([Psa 132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013)),
it is from thence that Jehovah discomfits the foe.

roar--as a lion ([Jer 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030); [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002); [Amo
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#008)). Compare as to Jehovah's voice
thundering, [Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013); [Hab
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#010).

Lord . . . the hope of his people--or, "their refuge" ([Psa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001)).

[Joel 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joe 3:17</span></span>

shall ye know--experimentally by the proofs of favors which I shall
vouchsafe to you. So "know" ([Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016); [Hos
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#020)).

dwelling in Zion--as peculiarly your God.

holy . . . no strangers pass through--to attack, or to defile, the holy
city ([Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008); [Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001); [Zac
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021)). Strangers, or Gentiles, shall
come to Jerusalem, but it shall be in order to worship Jehovah there
([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)).

[Joel 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joe 3:18</span></span>

mountains . . . drop . . . wine--figurative for abundance of vines,
which were cultivated in terraces of earth between the rocks on the
sides of the hills of Palestine ([Amo
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013)).

hills . . . flow with milk--that is, they shall abound in flocks and
herds yielding milk plentifully, through the richness of the pastures.

waters--the great desideratum for fertility in the parched East ([Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025)).

fountain . . . of . . . house of . . . Lord . . . water . . . valley of
Shittim--The blessings, temporal and spiritual, issuing from Jehovah's
house at Jerusalem, shall extend even to Shittim, on the border between
Moab and Israel, beyond Jordan ([Num
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001); [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049); [Jos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001); [Mic
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005)). "Shittim" means "acacias," which
grow only in arid regions: implying that even the arid desert shall be
fertilized by the blessing from Jerusalem. So [Eze
47:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001) describes the waters issuing
from the threshold of the house as flowing into the Dead Sea, and
purifying it. Also in [Zac 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008) the
waters flow on one side into the Mediterranean, on the other side into
the Dead Sea, near which latter Shittim was situated (compare [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001)).

[Joel 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joe 3:19</span></span>

Edom--It was subjugated by David, but revolted under Jehoram ([Ch2
21:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008)); and at every subsequent
opportunity tried to injure Judah. Egypt under Shishak spoiled Jerusalem
under Rehoboam of the treasures of the temple and the king's house;
subsequently to the captivity, it inflicted under the Ptolemies various
injuries on Judea. Antiochus spoiled Egypt ([Dan
11:40-43](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040)). Edom was made "desolate"
under the Maccabees \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 12.11,12\]. The low
condition of the two countries for centuries proves the truth of the
prediction (compare [Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001), &c.;
[Jer 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017); [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010)). So shall fare all the foes of
Israel, typified by these two ([Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001), &c.).

[Joel 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joe 3:20</span></span>

dwell for ever-- ([Amo 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015)), that is,
be established as a flourishing state.

[Joel 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joe 3:21</span></span>

cleanse . . . blood . . . not cleansed--I will purge away from Judah the
extreme guilt (represented by "blood," the shedding of which was the
climax of her sin, [Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)) which
was for long not purged away, but visited with judgments ([Isa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004)). Messiah saves from guilt, in
order to save from punishment ([Mat
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021)).
