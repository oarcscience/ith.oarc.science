### [Revelation Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 5:1</span></span>

THE BOOK WITH SEVEN SEALS: NONE WORTHY TO OPEN IT BUT THE LAMB: HE TAKES
IT AMIDST THE PRAISES OF THE REDEEMED, AND OF THE WHOLE HEAVENLY HOST.
([Rev 5:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001).md)

in, &c.--Greek, "(lying) upon the right hand." His right hand was open
and on it lay the book. On God's part there was no withholding of His
future purposes as contained in the book: the only obstacle to unsealing
it is stated in [Rev 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003.md) \[ALFORD\].

book--rather, as accords with the ancient form of books, and with the
writing on the backside, "a roll." The writing on the back implies
fulness and completeness, so that nothing more needs to be added ([Rev
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018).md). The roll, or book, appears
from the context to be "the title-deed of man's inheritance" \[DE
BURGH\] redeemed by Christ, and contains the successive steps by which
He shall recover it from its usurper and obtain actual possession of the
kingdom already "purchased" for Himself and His elect saints. However,
no portion of the roll is said to be unfolded and read; but simply the
seals are successively opened, giving final access to its contents being
read as a perfect whole, which shall not be until the events symbolized
by the seals shall have been past, when [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md) shall receive its complete
accomplishment, and the Lamb shall reveal God's providential plans in
redemption in all their manifold beauties. Thus the opening of the seals
will mean the successive steps by which God in Christ clears the way for
the final opening and reading of the book at the visible setting up of
the kingdom of Christ. Compare, at the grand consummation, [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md), "Another book was opened . . .
the book of life"; [Rev 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#019.md). None is
worthy to do so save the Lamb, for He alone as such has redeemed man's
forfeited inheritance, of which the book is the title-deed. The question
([Rev 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002).md) is not (as commonly
supposed), Who should reveal the destinies of the Church (for this any
inspired prophet would be competent to do)? but, Who has the WORTH to
give man a new title to his lost inheritance? \[DE BURGH\].

sealed . . . seven seals--Greek, "sealed up," or "firmly sealed." The
number seven (divided into four, the world-wide number, and three, the
divine) abounds in Revelation and expresses completeness. Thus, the
seven seals, representing all power given to the Lamb; the seven
trumpets, by which the world kingdoms are shaken and overthrown, and the
Lamb's kingdom ushered in; and the seven vials, by which the beast's
kingdom is destroyed.

[Revelation 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 5:2</span></span>

strong-- ([Psa 103:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020).md). His voice
penetrated heaven, earth, and Hades ([Rev
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001).md).

[Revelation 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 5:3</span></span>

no man--Greek, "no one." Not merely no man, but also no one of any order
of beings.

in earth--Greek, "upon the earth."

under the earth--namely, in Hades.

look thereon--to look upon the contents, so as to read them.

[Revelation 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 5:4</span></span>

and to read--inserted in English Version Greek text without good
authority. One oldest manuscript, ORIGEN, CYPRIAN, and HILARY omit the
clause. "To read" would be awkward standing between "to open the book"
and "to look thereon." John having been promised a revelation of "things
which must be hereafter," weeps now at his earnest desire being
apparently frustrated. He is a pattern to us to imitate, as an eager and
teachable learner of the Apocalypse.

[Revelation 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 5:5</span></span>

one of--Greek, "one from among." The "elder" meant is, according to some
(in LYRA), Matthew. With this accords the description here given of
Christ, "the Lion, which is (so the Greek) of the tribe of Juda, the
root of David"; the royal, David-descended, lion-aspect of Christ being
that prominent in Matthew, whence the lion among the fourfold cherubim
is commonly assigned to him. GERHARD in BENGEL thought Jacob to be
meant, being, doubtless, one of those who rose with Christ and ascended
to heaven ([Mat 27:52-53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052).md). The elders
in heaven round God's throne know better than John, still in the flesh,
the far-reaching power of Christ.

Root of David-- ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md), [Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010).md). Not merely "a sucker come up
from David's ancient root" (as ALFORD limits it), but also including the
idea of His being Himself the root and origin of David: compare these
two truths brought together, [Mat
22:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042.md). Hence He is called not
merely Son of David, but also David. He is at once "the branch" of
David, and "the root" of David, David's Son and David's Lord, the Lamb
slain and therefore the Lion of Juda: about to reign over Israel, and
thence over the whole earth.

prevailed--Greek, "conquered": absolutely, as elsewhere ([Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021).md): gained the victory: His past
victory over all the powers of darkness entitles Him now to open the
book.

to open--that is, so as to open. One oldest manuscript, B, reads, "He
that openeth," that is, whose office it is to open, but the weight of
oldest authorities is with English Version reading, namely, A, Vulgate,
Coptic, and ORIGEN.

[Revelation 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 5:6</span></span>

I beheld, and, lo--One oldest manuscript, A, omits "and, lo." Another,
B, CYPRIAN, &c., support, "and, lo," but omit, "and I beheld."

in the midst of the throne--that is, not on the throne (compare [Rev
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007).md), but in the midst of the company
([Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004).md) which was "round about the
throne."

Lamb--Greek, "arnion"; always found in Revelation exclusively, except in
[Joh 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md) alone: it expresses
endearment, namely, the endearing relation in which Christ now stands to
us, as the consequence of His previous relation as the sacrificial Lamb.
So also our relation to Him: He the precious Lamb, we His dear lambs,
one with Him. BENGEL thinks there is in Greek, "arnion," the idea of
taking the lead of the flock. Another object of the form Greek,
"arnion," the Lamb, is to put Him in the more marked contrast to Greek,
"therion," the Beast. Elsewhere Greek, "amnos," is found, applying to
Him as the paschal, sacrificial Lamb ([Isa
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md), Septuagint; [Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md), [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036.md); [Act
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019).md).

as it had been slain--bearing marks of His past death wounds. He was
standing, though bearing the marks of one slain. In the midst of
heavenly glory Christ crucified is still the prominent object.

seven horns--that is, perfect might, "seven" symbolizing perfection;
"horns," might, in contrast to the horns of the Antichristian world
powers, [Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md); &c.; [Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020.md); [Dan
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#003.md).

seven eyes . . . the seven Spirits . . . sent forth--So one oldest
manuscript, A. But B reads, "being sent forth." As the seven lamps
before the throne represent the Spirit of God immanent in the Godhead,
so the seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same sevenfold Spirit
profluent from the incarnate Redeemer in His world-wide energy. The
Greek for "sent forth," apostellomena, or else apestalmenoi, is akin to
the term "apostle," reminding us of the Spirit-impelled labors of
Christ's apostles and minister throughout the world: if the present
tense be read, as seems best, the idea will be that of those labors
continually going on unto the end. "Eyes" symbolize His all-watchful and
wise providence for His Church, and against her foes.

[Revelation 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 5:7</span></span>

The book lay on the open hand of Him that sat on the throne for any to
take who was found worthy \[ALFORD\]. The Lamb takes it from the Father
in token of formal investiture into His universal and everlasting
dominion as Son of man. This introductory vision thus presents before
us, in summary, the consummation to which all the events in the seals,
trumpets, and vials converge, namely, the setting up of Christ's kingdom
visibly. Prophecy ever hurries to the grand crisis or end, and dwells on
intermediate events only in their typical relation to, and
representation of, the end.

[Revelation 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 5:8</span></span>

had taken--Greek, "took."

fell down before the Lamb--who shares worship and the throne with the
Father.

harps--Two oldest manuscripts, A, B, Syriac and Coptic read, "a harp": a
kind of guitar, played with the hand or a quill.

vials--"bowls" \[TREGELLES\]; censers.

odours--Greek, "incense."

prayers of saints--as the angel offers their prayers ([Rev
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md) with incense (compare [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002).md). This gives not the least
sanction to Rome's dogma of our praying to saints. Though they be
employed by God in some way unknown to us to present our prayers
(nothing is said of their interceding for us), yet we are told to pray
only to Him ([Rev 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010.md); [Rev
22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008).md). Their own employment is
praise (whence they all have harps): ours is prayer.

[Revelation 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 5:9</span></span>

sung--Greek, "sing": it is their blessed occupation continually. The
theme of redemption is ever new, ever suggesting fresh thoughts of
praise, embodied in the "new song."

us to God--So manuscript B, Coptic, Vulgate, and CYPRIAN. But A omits
"us": and Aleph reads instead, "to our God."

out of--the present election-church gathered out of the world, as
distinguished from the peoples gathered to Christ as the subjects, not
of an election, but of a general and world-wide conversion of all
nations.

kindred . . . tongue . . . people . . . nation--The number four marks
world-wide extension: the four quarters of the world. For "kindred,"
translate as Greek, "tribe." This term and "people" are usually
restricted to Israel: "tongue and nation" to the Gentiles ([Rev
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009.md); [Rev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009.md); [Rev
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007.md), the oldest reading; [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006).md). Thus there is here marked the
election-Church gathered from Jews and Gentiles. In [Rev
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#011.md), for "tribes," we find among the
four terms "kings"; in [Rev 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md),
"multitudes."

[Revelation 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 5:10</span></span>

made us--A, B, Aleph, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read, "them." The
Hebrew construction of the third person for the first, has a graphic
relation to the redeemed, and also has a more modest sound than us,
priests \[BENGEL\].

unto our God--So B and Aleph read. But A omits the clause.

kings--So B reads. But A, Aleph, Vulgate, Coptic, and CYPRIAN, read, "A
kingdom." Aleph reads also "a priesthood" for priests. They who cast
their crowns before the throne, do not call themselves kings in the
sight of the great King ([Rev
4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010).md); though their priestly access
has such dignity that their reigning on earth cannot exceed it. So in
[Rev 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006.md) they are not called "kings"
\[BENGEL\].

we shall reign on the earth--This is a new feature added to [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006.md). Aleph, Vulgate, and Coptic read,
"They shall reign." A and B read, "They reign." ALFORD takes this
reading and explains it of the Church EVEN NOW, in Christ her Head,
reigning on the earth: "all things are being put under her feet, as
under His; her kingly office and rank are asserted, even in the midst of
persecution." But even if we read (I think the weightiest authority is
against it), "They reign," still it is the prophetical present for the
future: the seer being transported into the future when the full number
of the redeemed (represented by the four living creatures) shall be
complete and the visible kingdom begins. The saints do spiritually reign
now; but certainly not as they shall when the prince of this world shall
be bound (see on [Rev 20:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002).md). So far
from reigning on the earth now, they are "made as the filth of the world
and the offscouring of all things." In [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md), [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md), the locality and time of the
kingdom are marked. KELLY translates, "reign over the earth" (Greek,
"epi tees gees"), which is justified by the Greek (Septuagint, [Jdg
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#008.md); [Mat
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022).md). The elders, though ruling over
the earth, shall not necessarily (according to this passage) remain on
the earth. But English Version is justified by [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md). "The elders were meek, but the
flock of the meek independently is much larger" \[BENGEL\].

[Revelation 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 5:11</span></span>

I beheld--the angels: who form the outer circle, while the Church, the
object of redemption, forms the inner circle nearest the throne. The
heavenly hosts ranged around gaze with intense love and adoration at
this crowning manifestation of God's love, wisdom, and power.

ten thousand times ten thousand--Greek, "myriads of myriads."

[Revelation 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 5:12</span></span>

to receive power--Greek, "the power." The remaining six (the whole being
seven, the number for perfection and completeness) are all, as well as
"power," ranged under the one Greek article, to mark that they form one
complete aggregate belonging to God and His co-equal, the Lamb. Compare
[Rev 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#012.md), where each of all seven has
the article.

riches--both spiritual and earthly.

blessing--ascribed praise: the will on the creature's part, though
unaccompanied by the power, to return blessing for blessing conferred
\[ALFORD\].

[Revelation 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 5:13</span></span>

The universal chorus of creation, including the outermost circles as
well as the inner (of saints and angels), winds up the doxology. The
full accomplishment of this is to be when Christ takes His great power
and reigns visibly.

every creature--"all His works in all places of His dominion" ([Psa
103:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#022).md).

under the earth--the departed spirits in Hades.

such as are--So B and Vulgate. But A omits this.

in the sea--Greek, "upon the sea": the sea animals which are regarded as
being on the surface \[ALFORD\].

all that are in them--So Vulgate reads. A omits "all (things)" here
(Greek, "panta"), and reads, "I heard all (Greek, "pantas") saying":
implying the harmonious concert of all in the four quarters of the
universe.

Blessing, &c.--Greek, "the blessing, the honor, and the glory, and the
might to the ages of the ages." The fourfold ascription indicates
world-wide universality.

[Revelation 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 5:14</span></span>

said--So A, Vulgate, and Syriac read. But B and Coptic read, "(I heard)
saying."

Amen--So A reads. But B reads, "the (accustomed) Amen." As in [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011.md), the four and twenty elders
asserted God's worthiness to receive the glory, as having created all
things, so here the four living creatures ratify by their "Amen" the
whole creation's ascription of the glory to Him.

four and twenty--omitted in the oldest manuscripts: Vulgate supports it.

him that liveth for ever and ever--omitted in all the manuscripts:
inserted by commentators from [Rev
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009.md). But there, where the thanksgiving
is expressed, the words are appropriate; but here less so, as their
worship is that of silent prostration. "Worshipped" (namely, God and the
Lamb). So in [Rev 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md), "worship" is
used absolutely.
