### [Matthew Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 20:1</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE LABORERS IN THE VINEYARD. (Mat. 20:1-16)

For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
&c.--The figure of a vineyard, to represent the rearing of souls for
heaven, the culture required and provided for that purpose, and the care
and pains which God takes in that whole matter, is familiar to every
reader of the Bible. ([Psa 80:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md);
[Isa 5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md); [Luk
20:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#009.md); [Joh
15:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001).md). At vintage time, as WEBSTER
and WILKINSON remark, labor was scarce, and masters were obliged to be
early in the market to secure it. Perhaps the pressing nature of the
work of the Gospel, and the comparative paucity of laborers, may be
incidentally suggested, [Mat 9:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037.md).
The "laborers," as in [Mat 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#038.md), are
first, the official servants of the Church, but after them and along
with them all the servants of Christ, whom He has laid under the
weightiest obligation to work in His service.

[Matthew 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 20:2</span></span>

And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny--a usual day's
hire.

he sent them into his vineyard.

[Matthew 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 20:3</span></span>

And he went out about the third hour--about nine o'clock, or after a
fourth of the working day had expired: the day of twelve hours was
reckoned from six to six.

and saw others standing idle in the market place--unemployed.

[Matthew 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 20:4</span></span>

And said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is
right--just, equitable, in proportion to their time.

I will give you. And they went their way.

[Matthew 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mat 20:5</span></span>

Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour--about noon, and about
three o'clock in the afternoon.

and did likewise--hiring and sending into his vineyard fresh laborers
each time.

[Matthew 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mat 20:6</span></span>

And about the eleventh hour--but one hour before the close of the
working day; a most unusual hour both for offering and engaging

and found others standing idle, and saith, Why stand ye here all the day
idle?--Of course they had not been there, or not been disposed to offer
themselves at the proper time; but as they were now willing, and the day
was not over, and "yet there was room," they also are engaged, and on
similar terms with all the rest.

[Matthew 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mat 20:8</span></span>

So when even was come--that is, the reckoning time between masters and
laborers (see [Deu 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015).md); pointing to
the day of final account.

the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward--answering to Christ
Himself, represented "as a Son over His own house" ([Heb
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md); see [Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027.md); [Joh
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#035.md); [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027).md).

Call the labourers and give them their hire, beginning from the last
unto the first--Remarkable direction this--last hired, first paid.

[Matthew 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mat 20:9</span></span>

And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
received every man a penny--a full day's wages.

[Matthew 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mat 20:10</span></span>

But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received
more--This is that calculating, mercenary spirit which had peeped
out--though perhaps very slightly--in Peter's question ([Mat
19:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#027).md), and which this parable was
designed once for all to put down among the servants of Christ.

[Matthew 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mat 20:11</span></span>

And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the
house--rather, "the householder," the word being the same as in [Mat
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md).

[Matthew 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mat 20:12</span></span>

Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them
equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat--the burning heat.

of the day--who have wrought not only longer but during a more trying
period of the day.

[Matthew 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mat 20:13</span></span>

But he answered one of them--doubtless the spokesman of the complaining
party.

and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a
penny? &c.

[Matthew 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mat 20:15</span></span>

Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye
evil, because I am good?--that is, "You appeal to justice, and by that
your mouth is shut; for the sum you agreed for is paid you. Your case
being disposed of, with the terms I make with other laborers you have
nothing to do; and to grudge the benevolence shown to others, when by
your own admission you have been honorably dealt with, is both unworthy
envy of your neighbor, and discontent with the goodness that engaged and
rewarded you in his service at all."

[Matthew 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mat 20:16</span></span>

So the last shall be first, and the first last--that is, "Take heed lest
by indulging the spirit of these murmurers at the penny given to the
last hired, ye miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard; while
the consciousness of having come in so late may inspire these last with
such a humble frame, and such admiration of the grace that has hired and
rewarded them at all, as will put them into the foremost place in the
end."

for many be called, but few chosen--This is another of our Lord's terse
and pregnant sayings, more than once uttered in different connections.
(See [Mat 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030.md); [Mat
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014).md). The "calling" of which the New
Testament almost invariably speaks is what divines call effectual
calling, carrying with it a supernatural operation on the will to secure
its consent. But that cannot be the meaning of it here; the "called"
being emphatically distinguished from the "chosen." It can only mean
here the "invited." And so the sense is, Many receive the invitations of
the Gospel whom God has never "chosen to salvation through
sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" ([Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). But what, it may be asked, has
this to do with the subject of our parable? Probably this--to teach us
that men who have wrought in Christ's service all their days may, by the
spirit which they manifest at the last, make it too evident that, as
between God and their own souls, they never were chosen workmen at all.
