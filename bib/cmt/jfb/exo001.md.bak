Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Exodus Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 1:1</span></span>

INCREASE OF THE ISRAELITES. (Exo. 1:1-22)

Now these are the names--(See Gen. 46:8-26).

[Exodus 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 1:7</span></span>

children of Israel were fruitful--They were living in a land where,
according to the testimony of an ancient author, mothers produced three
and four sometimes at a birth; and a modern writer declares "the females
in Egypt, as well among the human race as among animals, surpass all
others in fruitfulness." To this natural circumstance must be added the
fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham.

[Exodus 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 1:8</span></span>

Now there arose up a new king--About sixty years after the death of
Joseph a revolution took place--by which the old dynasty was overthrown,
and upper and lower Egypt were united into one kingdom. Assuming that
the king formerly reigned in Thebes, it is probable that he would know
nothing about the Hebrews; and that, as foreigners and shepherds, the
new government would, from the first, regard them with dislike and
scorn.

[Exodus 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 1:9</span></span>

he said . . . Behold, the . . . children of Israel are more and mightier
than we--They had risen to great prosperity--as during the lifetime of
Joseph and his royal patron, they had, probably, enjoyed a free grant of
the land. Their increase and prosperity were viewed with jealousy by the
new government; and as Goshen lay between Egypt and Canaan, on the
border of which latter country were a number of warlike tribes, it was
perfectly conformable to the suggestions of worldly policy that they
should enslave and maltreat them, through apprehension of their joining
in any invasion by those foreign rovers. The new king, who neither knew
the name nor cared for the services of Joseph, was either Amosis, or one
of his immediate successors \[OSBURN\].

[Exodus 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 1:11</span></span>

Therefore they did set over them taskmasters--Having first obliged them,
it is thought, to pay a ruinous rent and involved them in difficulties,
that new government, in pursuance of its oppressive policy, degraded
them to the condition of serfs--employing them exactly as the laboring
people are in the present day (driven in companies or bands), in rearing
the public works, with taskmasters, who anciently had sticks--now
whips--to punish the indolent, or spur on the too languid. All public or
royal buildings, in ancient Egypt, were built by captives; and on some
of them was placed an inscription that no free citizen had been engaged
in this servile employment.

they built for Pharaoh treasure cities--These two store-places were in
the land of Goshen; and being situated near a border liable to invasion,
they were fortified cities (compare 2Ch. 11:1-12:16). Pithom (Greek,
Patumos), lay on the eastern Pelusiac branch of the Nile, about twelve
Roman miles from Heliopolis; and Raamses, called by the Septuagint
Heroopolis, lay between the same branch of the Nile and the Bitter
Lakes. These two fortified cities were situated, therefore, in the same
valley; and the fortifications, which Pharaoh commanded to be built
around both, had probably the same common object, of obstructing the
entrance into Egypt, which this valley furnished the enemy from Asia
\[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Exodus 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 1:13</span></span>

The Egyptians . . . made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in
mortar, and in brick--Ruins of great brick buildings are found in all
parts of Egypt. The use of crude brick, baked in the sun, was universal
in upper and lower Egypt, both for public and private buildings; all but
the temples themselves were of crude brick. It is worthy of remark that
more bricks bearing the name of Thothmes III, who is supposed to have
been the king of Egypt at the time of the Exodus, have been discovered
than of any other period \[WILKINSON\]. Parties of these brickmakers are
seen depicted on the ancient monuments with "taskmasters," some
standing, others in a sitting posture beside the laborers, with their
uplifted sticks in their hands.

[Exodus 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 1:15</span></span>

the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives--Two only were spoken
to--either they were the heads of a large corporation \[LABORDE\], or,
by tampering with these two, the king designed to terrify the rest into
secret compliance with his wishes \[CALVIN\].

[Exodus 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 1:16</span></span>

if it be a son, then ye shall kill him--Opinions are divided, however,
what was the method of destruction which the king did recommend. Some
think that the "stools" were low seats on which these obstetric
practitioners sat by the bedside of the Hebrew women; and that, as they
might easily discover the sex, so, whenever a boy appeared, they were to
strangle it, unknown to its parents; while others are of opinion that
the "stools" were stone troughs, by the river side--into which, when the
infants were washed, they were to be, as it were, accidentally dropped.

[Exodus 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 1:17</span></span>

But the midwives feared God--Their faith inspired them with such courage
as to risk their lives, by disobeying the mandate of a cruel tyrant; but
it was blended with weakness, which made them shrink from speaking the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

[Exodus 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 1:20</span></span>

God dealt well with the midwives--This represents God as rewarding them
for telling a lie. This difficulty is wholly removed by a more correct
translation. To "make" or "build up a house" in Hebrew idiom, means to
have a numerous progeny. The passage then should be rendered thus: "God
protected the midwives, and the people waxed very mighty; and because
the midwives feared, the Hebrews grew and prospered."
