### [Zephaniah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 3:1</span></span>

RESUMPTION OF THE DENUNCIATION OF JERUSALEM, AS BEING UNREFORMED BY THE
PUNISHMENT OF OTHER NATIONS: AFTER HER CHASTISEMENT JEHOVAH WILL
INTERPOSE FOR HER AGAINST HER FOES; HIS WORSHIP SHALL FLOURISH IN ALL
LANDS, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM, WHERE HE SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF HIS
PEOPLE, AND SHALL MAKE THEM A PRAISE IN ALL THE EARTH. (Zep. 3:1-20)

filthy--MAURER translates from a different root, "rebellious,"
"contumacious." But the following term, "polluted," refers rather to her
inward moral filth, in spite of her outward ceremonial purity
\[CALVIN\]. GROTIUS says, the Hebrew is used of women who have
prostituted their virtue. There is in the Hebrew Moreah; a play on the
name Moriah, the hill on which the temple was built; implying the
glaring contrast between their filthiness and the holiness of the
worship on Moriah in which they professed to have a share.

oppressing--namely, the poor, weak, widows, orphans and strangers ([Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003).md).

[Zephaniah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zep 3:2</span></span>

received not correction--Jerusalem is incurable, obstinately rejecting
salutary admonition, and refusing to be reformed by "correction" ([Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003).md).

trusted not in . . . Lord--Distrust in the Lord as if He were
insufficient, is the parent of all superstitions and wickednesses
\[CALVIN\].

drew not near to her God--Though God was specially near to her ([Deu
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007).md) as "her God," yet she drew not
near to Him, but gratuitously estranged herself from Him.

[Zephaniah 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 3:3</span></span>

roaring--for prey ([Pro 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#015.md); [Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027.md); [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004.md); [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md).

evening wolves--which are most ravenous at evening after being foodless
all day ([Jer 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Hab
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008).md).

they gnaw not the bones till the morrow--rather, "they put not off till
to-morrow to gnaw the bones"; but devour all at once, bones and flesh,
so ragingly ravenous are they \[CALVIN\].

[Zephaniah 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 3:4</span></span>

light--in whose life and teaching there is no truth, gravity, or
steadiness.

treacherous--false to Jehovah, whose prophets they profess to be ([Jer
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#032.md); [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028).md).

polluted . . . sanctuary--by their profane deeds.

[Zephaniah 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 3:5</span></span>

The Jews regard not God's justice manifested in the midst of them, nor
His judgments on the guilty nations around.

The just Lord--Why then are ye so unjust?

is in the midst thereof--He retorts on them their own boast, "Is not the
Lord among us" ([Mic 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md)? True He
is, but it is for another end from what ye think \[CALVIN\]; namely, to
lead you by the example of His righteousness to be righteous. [Lev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md), "Ye shall be holy: for I the
Lord your God am holy" \[MAURER\]. But CALVIN, "That ye may feel His
hand to be the nearer for taking vengeance for your crimes: 'He will not
do iniquity' by suffering your sins to go unpunished" ([Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md).

every morning--literally, "morning by morning." The time in the sultry
East for dispensing justice.

bring . . . to light--publicly and manifestly by the teaching of His
prophets, which aggravates their guilt; also by samples of His judgments
on the guilty.

he faileth not--He is continually setting before you samples of His
justice, sparing no pains. Compare [Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md); [Isa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md), "he wakeneth morning by
morning."

knoweth no shame--The unjust Jews are not shamed by His justice into
repentance.

[Zephaniah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zep 3:6</span></span>

I had hoped that My people by My judgments on other nations would be led
to amendment; but they are not, so blinded by sin are they.

towers--literally, "angles" or "corners"; hence the towers built at the
angles of their city walls. Under Josiah's long and peaceful reign the
Jews were undisturbed, while the great incursion of Scythians into
Western Asia took place. The judgment on the ten tribes in a former
reign also is here alluded to.

[Zephaniah 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 3:7</span></span>

I said, Surely, &c.--God speaks after the manner of men in condescension
to man's infirmity; not as though God was ignorant of the future
contingency, but in their sense, Surely one might have expected ye would
under such circumstances repent: but no!

thou--at least, O Jerusalem! Compare "thou, even thou, at least in this
thy day" ([Luk 19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042).md).

their dwelling--the sanctuary \[BUXTORF\]. Or, the city. Compare Jesus'
words ([Luk 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035).md), "Behold, your
house is left unto you desolate" ([Lev
26:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031.md); [Psa
69:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#025).md); and used as to the temple
([Mic 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md). "Their" is used instead
of "thy"; this change of person implies that God puts them to a greater
distance.

howsoever I punished them--Howsoever I might have punished them, I would
not have cut off their dwelling. CALVIN, "Howsoever I had marked them
out for punishment" because of their provocations, still, if even then
they had repented, taught by My corrections, I was ready to have
pardoned them. MAURER, "Altogether in accordance with what I had long
ago decreed (ordained) concerning you" ([Deu
28:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001.md), and, on the other hand, Deu.
28:15-68; [Deu 27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015).md). English
Version, or CALVIN'S view, is better.

rose early, and corrupted, &c.--Early morning is in the East the best
time for transacting serious business, before the relaxing heat of
midday comes on. Thus it means, With the greatest earnestness they set
themselves to "corrupt all their doings" ([Gen
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md); [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md); [Jer
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007.md); [Jer
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003).md).

[Zephaniah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 3:8</span></span>

wait ye upon me--Here Jehovah turns to the pious Jews. Amidst all these
judgments on the Jewish nation, look forward to the glorious time of
restoration to be ushered in by God's precious outpouring of wrath on
all nations, Isa. 30:18-33; where the same phrase, "blessed are all they
that wait for Him," is used as to the same great event. CALVIN
erroneously makes this verse an address to the ungodly; and so MAURER,
"Ye shall not have to wait for Me in vain"; I will presently come armed
with indignation: I will no longer contend with you by My prophets.

until the day--that is, waiting for the day ([Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md).

rise up to the prey--like a savage beast rising from his lair, greedy
for the prey (compare [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).md). Or
rather, as a warrior leading Israel to certain victory, which is
expressed by "the prey," or booty, which is the reward of victory. The
Septuagint and Syriac versions read the Hebrew, "I rise up as a witness"
(compare [Job 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008.md); [Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005).md). Jehovah being in this view
witness, accuser, and judge. English Version is better (compare [Isa
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#023).md).

gather the nations--against Jerusalem ([Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md), to pour out His indignation
upon them there ([Joe 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md); [Zac
12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002).md).

[Zephaniah 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 3:9</span></span>

For--The blessed things promised in this and [Zep
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md) are the immediate results of the
punishment inflicted on the nations, mentioned in [Zep
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008.md) (compare [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019).md).

turn to the people a pure language--that is, changing their impure
language I will give to them again a pure language (literally, "lip").
Compare for this Hebrew idiom, [Sa1
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#009.md), Margin. The confusion of
languages was of the penalty sin, probably idolatry at Babel ([Gen
11:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md), Margin, where also "lip"
expresses language, and perhaps also religion; [Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md), "a tower whose top may reach unto
heaven," or rather, points to heaven, namely, dedicated to the heavens
idolized, or Bel); certainly, of rebellion against God's will. An
earnest of the removal of this penalty was the gift of tongues on
pentecost ([Act 2:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#006).md). The full
restoration of the earth's unity of language and of worship is yet
future, and is connected with the restoration of the Jews, to be
followed by the conversion of the world. Compare [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md); [Rom
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md), "with one mind and one mouth
glorify God." The Gentiles' lips have been rendered impure through being
the instruments of calling on idols and dishonoring God (compare [Psa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md); [Hos
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#017).md). Whether Hebrew shall be the one
universal language or not, the God of the Hebrews shall be the one only
object of worship. Until the Holy Ghost purify the lips, we cannot
rightly call upon God ([Isa 6:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md).

serve him with one consent--literally, "shoulder" or "back"; metaphor
from a yoke, or burden, borne between two ([Num
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#023).md); helping one another with
conjoint effort. If one of the two bearers of a burden, laid on both
conjointly, give way, the burden must fall to the earth \[CALVIN\].
Christ's rule is called a burden ([Mat
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md); [Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md); [Rev
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#024.md); compare [Co2
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014) for the same image.md).

[Zephaniah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 3:10</span></span>

From beyond . . . Ethiopia my suppliants--literally, "burners of
incense" (compare [Psa 141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002.md); [Rev
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md); [Rev
8:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#003).md). The Israelites are meant,
called "the daughter of My dispersed," a Hebrew idiom for My dispersed
people. "The rivers of Ethiopia" are those which enclose it on the
north. In the west of Abyssinia there has long existed a people called
Falashas, or "emigrants" (akin to the synonym "Philistine"). These trace
their origin to Palestine and profess the Jewish religion. In physical
traits they resemble the Arabs. When Bruce was there, they had a Jewish
king, Gideon, and his queen, Judith. Probably the Abyssinian Christians
were originally in part converted Jews. They are here made the
representatives of all Israel which is to be restored.

shall bring mine offering--that is, the offering that is My right. I
prefer, with DE WETTE and Chaldee Version, making "suppliants" the
objective case, not the nominative. The peoples: ([Zep
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md), brought to fear Me by My
judgments, "shall bring as Mine offering My suppliants (an appropriate
term for the Jews, on whom then there shall have been poured the spirit
of supplications, [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md), the
daughter of My dispersed." So [Isa
66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md), "they shall bring all your
brethren for an offering unto the Lord." Compare HORSLEY'S view of [Isa
18:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md), [Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md). England in this view may be the
naval power to restore Israel to Palestine ([Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009).md). The Hebrew for "Ethiopia" is
Cush, which may include not only Ethiopia, but also the region of the
Tigris and Babylon, where Nimrod, Cush's son ([Gen
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008).md), founded Nineveh and acquired
Babylon, and where the ten tribes are mentioned as being scattered ([Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md); [Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013.md); compare [Isa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md). The restoration under Cyrus of
the Jews transported under Pharaoh-necho to Egypt and Ethiopia, was an
earnest of the future restoration under Christ.

[Zephaniah 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 3:11</span></span>

shalt thou not be ashamed--Thou shalt then have no cause to be ashamed;
for I will then take away out of the midst of thee those who by their
sins gave thee cause for shame ([Zep
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#007).md).

them that rejoice in thy pride--those priding themselves on that which
thou boastest of, thy temple ("My holy mountain"), thy election as God's
people, &c., in the Pharisaic spirit ([Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md); [Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009).md). Compare [Jer
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md), "mine eyes shall weep for your
pride." The converted remnant shall be of a humble spirit ([Zep
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012.md); [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md), [Isa
66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010).md).

[Zephaniah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zep 3:12</span></span>

afflicted . . . they shall trust in . . . Lord--the blessed effect of
sanctified affliction on the Jewish remnant. Entire trust in the Lord
cannot be, except where all cause for boasting is taken away ([Isa
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032.md); [Zac
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#011).md).

[Zephaniah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zep 3:13</span></span>

nor speak lies--worshipping God in truth, and towards man having love
without dissimulation. The characteristic of the 144,000 sealed of
Israel.

none shall make them afraid--either foreign foe, or unjust prince ([Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003).md), prophet, or priest ([Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004).md).

[Zephaniah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 3:14</span></span>

The prophet in mental vision sees the joyful day of Zion present, and
bids her rejoice at it.

[Zephaniah 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 3:15</span></span>

The cause for joy: "The Lord hath taken away thy judgments," namely,
those sent by Him upon thee. After the taking away of sin ([Zep
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#013).md) follows the taking away of
trouble. When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. Happiness
follows in the wake of holiness.

the Lord is in the midst of thee--Though He seemed to desert thee for a
time, He is now present as thy safeguard ([Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017).md).

not see evil any more--Thou shalt not experience it ([Jer
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012.md); [Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017).md).

[Zephaniah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zep 3:16</span></span>

Let not thine hands be slack-- ([Heb
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012).md). Do not faint in the work of
the Lord.

[Zephaniah 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zep 3:17</span></span>

he will rest in his love--content with it as His supreme delight
(compare [Luk 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007.md), [Luk
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010).md) \[CALVIN\], ([Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019).md). Or, He shall be silent, namely
as to thy faults, not imputing them to thee \[MAURER\] ([Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md); [Eze
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#016).md). I prefer explaining it of that
calm silent joy in the possession of the object of one's love, too great
for words to express: just as God after the six days of creation rested
with silent satisfaction in His work, for "behold it was very good"
([Gen 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031.md); [Gen
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002).md). So the parallel clause by
contrast expresses the joy, not kept silent as this, but uttered in
"singing."

[Zephaniah 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zep 3:18</span></span>

sorrowful for the solemn assembly--pining after the solemn assembly
which they cannot celebrate in exile ([Lam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md); [Lam
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006).md).

who are of thee--that is, of thy true citizens; and whom therefore I
will restore.

to whom the reproach of it was a burden--that is, to whom thy reproach
("the reproach of My people," [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016); their ignominious captivity.md) was
a burden. "Of it" is put of thee, as the person is often changed. Those
who shared in the burden of reproach which fell on My people. Compare
[Isa 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md), "the rebuke of His people
shall He take away from off all the earth."

[Zephaniah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">zep 3:19</span></span>

undo--MAURER translates, "I will deal with," that is, as they deserve.
Compare [Eze 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#025.md), where the Hebrew
is similarly translated. The destruction of Israel's foes precedes
Israel's restoration ([Isa 66:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015).md).

her that halteth--all that are helpless. Their weakness will be no
barrier in the way of My restoring them. So in [Psa
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#015.md), Margin, "halting" is used for
adversity. Also [Eze 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md); [Mic
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md).

I will get them praise, &c.--literally, "I will make them (to become) a
praise and a name," &c.

shame-- ([Eze 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#029).md).

[Zephaniah 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zep 3:20</span></span>

make you a name . . . praise--make you to become celebrated and praised.

turn back your captivity--bring back your captives \[MAURER\]. The
Hebrew is plural, "captivities"; to express the captivities of different
ages of their history, as well as the diversity of places in which they
were and are dispersed.

before your eyes--Incredible as the event may seem, your own eyes with
delight shall see it. You will scarcely believe it for joy, but the
testimony of your own eyes shall convince you of the delightful reality
(compare [Luk 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041).md).
