### [Ezekiel Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 40:1</span></span>

THE REMAINING CHAPTERS, THE FORTIETH THROUGH FORTY-EIGHTH, GIVE AN IDEAL
PICTURE OF THE RESTORED JEWISH TEMPLE. (Eze. 40:1-49)

beginning of the year--the ecclesiastical year, the first month of which
was Nisan.

the city . . . thither--Jerusalem, the center to which all the prophet's
thoughts tended.

[Ezekiel 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 40:2</span></span>

visions of God--divinely sent visions.

very high mountain--Moriah, very high, as compared with the plains of
Babylon, still more so as to its moral elevation ([Eze
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022.md); [Eze
20:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#040).md).

by which--Ezekiel coming from the north is set down at (as the Hebrew
for "upon" may be translated) Mount Moriah, and sees the city-like frame
of the temple stretching southward. In [Eze
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md), "God brings him thither," that
is, close up to it, so as to inspect it minutely (compare [Rev
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010).md). In this closing vision, as in
the opening one of the book, the divine hand is laid on the prophet, and
he is borne away in the visions of God. But the scene there was by the
Chebar, Jehovah having forsaken Jerusalem; now it is the mountain of
God, Jehovah having returned thither; there, the vision was calculated
to inspire terror; here, hope and assurance.

[Ezekiel 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 40:3</span></span>

man--The Old Testament manifestations of heavenly beings as men prepared
men's minds for the coming incarnation.

brass--resplendent.

line--used for longer measurements ([Zac
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001).md).

reed--used in measuring houses ([Rev
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015).md). It marked the straightness of
the walls.

[Ezekiel 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 40:5</span></span>

Measures were mostly taken from the human body. The greater cubit, the
length from the elbow to the end of the middle finger, a little more
than two feet: exceeding the ordinary cubit (from the elbow to the
wrist) by an hand-breadth, that is, twenty-one inches in all. Compare
[Eze 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#013.md), with [Eze
40:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#005.md). The palm was the full breadth of
the hand, three and a half inches.

breadth of the building--that is, the boundary wall. The imperfections
in the old temple's boundary wall were to have no place here. The
buildings attached to it had been sometimes turned to common uses; for
example, Jeremiah was imprisoned in one ([Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002.md); [Jer
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026).md). But now all these were to be
holy to the Lord. The gates and doorways to the city of God were to be
imprinted in their architecture with the idea of the exclusion of
everything defiled ([Rev 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md). The
east gate was to be especially sacred, as it was through it the glory of
God had departed ([Eze 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#023).md), and
through it the glory was to return ([Eze
43:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001.md); [Eze
44:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 40:6</span></span>

the stairs--seven in number ([Eze
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#026).md).

threshold--the sill \[FAIRBAIRN\].

other threshold--FAIRBAIRN considers there is but one threshold, and
translates, "even the one threshold, one rod broad." But there is
another threshold mentioned in [Eze
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007.md). The two thresholds here seem to
be the upper and the lower.

[Ezekiel 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 40:7</span></span>

chamber--These chambers were for the use of the Levites who watched at
the temple gates; guard-chambers ([Kg2
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#004.md); [Ch1
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#026).md); also used for storing
utensils and musical instruments.

[Ezekiel 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 40:9</span></span>

posts--projecting column-faced fronts of the sides of the doorway,
opposite to one another.

[Ezekiel 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 40:12</span></span>

space--rather, "the boundary."

[Ezekiel 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 40:16</span></span>

narrow--latticed \[HENDERSON\]. The ancients had no glass, so they had
them latticed, narrow in the interior of the walls, and widening at the
exterior. "Made fast," or "firmly fixed in the chambers" \[MAURER\].

arches--rather, "porches."

[Ezekiel 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 40:17</span></span>

pavement--tesselated mosaic ([Est
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006).md).

chambers--serving as lodgings for the priests on duty in the temple, and
as receptacles of the tithes of salt, wine, and oil.

[Ezekiel 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 40:18</span></span>

The higher pavement was level with the entrance of the gates, the lower
was on either side of the raised pavement thus formed. Whereas Solomon's
temple had an outer court open to alterations and even idolatrous
innovations ([Kg2 23:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md); [Ch1
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#005).md), in this there was to be no room
for human corruptions. Its compass was exactly defined, one hundred
cubits; and the fine pavement implied it was to be trodden only by clean
feet (compare [Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008).md).

[Ezekiel 40:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 40:20</span></span>

The different approaches corresponded in plan. In the case of these two
other gates, however, no mention is made of a building with thirty
chambers such as was found on the east side. Only one was needed, and it
was assigned to the east as being the sacred quarter, and that most
conveniently situated for the officiating priests.

[Ezekiel 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 40:23</span></span>

and toward the east--an elliptical expression for "The gate of the inner
court was over against the (outer) gate toward the north (just as the
inner gate was over against the outer gate) toward the east."

[Ezekiel 40:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 40:28</span></span>

The inner court and its gates.

according to these measures--namely, the measures of the outer gate. The
figure and proportions of the inner answered to the outer.

[Ezekiel 40:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 40:30</span></span>

This verse is omitted in the Septuagint, the Vatican manuscript, and
others. The dimensions here of the inner gate do not correspond to the
outer, though [Eze 40:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#028.md) asserts that
they do. HAVERNICK, retaining the verse, understands it of another porch
looking inwards toward the temple.

arches--the porch \[FAIRBAIRN\]; the columns on which the arches rest
\[HENDERSON\].

[Ezekiel 40:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 40:31</span></span>

eight steps--The outer porch had only seven ([Eze
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#026).md).

[Ezekiel 40:37](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">eze 40:37</span></span>

posts--the Septuagint and Vulgate read, "the porch," which answers
better to [Eze 40:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#031.md). "The arches"
or "porch" \[MAURER\].

[Ezekiel 40:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">eze 40:38</span></span>

chambers . . . entries--literally, "a chamber and its door."

by the posts--that is, at or close by the posts or columns.

where they washed the burnt offering--This does not apply to all the
gates but only to the north gate. For [Lev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#011.md) directs the sacrifices to be
killed north of the altar; and [Eze
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#005.md) calls the north gate, "the gate of
the altar." And [Eze 40:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#040.md)
particularly mentions the north gate.

[Ezekiel 40:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">eze 40:43</span></span>

hooks--cooking apparatus for cooking the flesh of the sacrifices that
fell to the priests. The hooks were "fastened" in the walls within the
apartment, to hang the meat from, so as to roast it. The Hebrew comes
from a root "fixed" or "placed."

[Ezekiel 40:44](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">eze 40:44</span></span>

the chambers of the singers--two in number, as proved by what follows:
"and their prospect (that is, the prospect of one) was toward the south,
(and) one toward the north." So the Septuagint.

[Ezekiel 40:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">eze 40:46</span></span>

Zadok--lineally descended from Aaron. He had the high priesthood
conferred on him by Solomon, who had set aside the family of Ithamar
because of the part which Abiathar had taken in the rebellion of
Adonijah ([Kg1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#007.md); [Kg1
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026).md).

[Ezekiel 40:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">eze 40:47</span></span>

court, an hundred cubits . . . foursquare--not to be confounded with the
inner court, or court of Israel, which was open to all who had
sacrifices to bring, and went round the three sides of the sacred
territory, one hundred cubits broad. This court was one hundred cubits
square, and had the altar in it, in front of the temple. It was the
court of the priests, and hence is connected with those who had charge
of the altar and the music. The description here is brief, as the things
connected with this portion were from the first divinely regulated.

[Ezekiel 40:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">eze 40:48</span></span>

These two verses belong to the forty-first chapter, which treats of the
temple itself.

[Ezekiel 40:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">eze 40:49</span></span>

twenty . . . eleven cubits--in Solomon's temple ([Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003).md) "twenty . . . ten cubits." The
breadth perhaps was ten and a half; [Kg1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#003.md) designates the number by the
lesser next round number, "ten"; Ezekiel here, by the larger number,
"eleven" \[MENOCHIUS\]. The Septuagint reads "twelve."

he brought me by the steps--They were ten in number \[Septuagint\].
