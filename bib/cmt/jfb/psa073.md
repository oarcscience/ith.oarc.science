### [Psalms Chapter 73](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 73:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 73:1</span></span>

Of Asaph--(see Introduction). God is good to His people. For although
the prosperity of the wicked, and the afflictions of the righteous,
tempted the Psalmist to misgivings of God's government, yet the sudden
and fearful ruin of the ungodly, seen in the light of God's revelation,
reassures his heart; and, chiding himself for his folly, he is led to
confide renewedly in God, and celebrate His goodness and love. (Psa.
73:1-28)

The abrupt announcement of the theme indicates that it is the conclusion
of a perplexing mental conflict, which is then detailed (compare [Jer
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md).

Truly--or, "Surely it is so."

clean heart-- ([Psa 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md) describes
the true Israel.

[Psalms 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 73:2</span></span>

The figures express his wavering faith, by terms denoting tottering and
weakness (compare [Psa 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#005.md); [Psa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 73:3</span></span>

The prosperous wicked are insolently proud (compare [Psa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#005).md). They die, as well as live, free
from perplexities: pride adorns them, and violence is their clothing;
indeed they are inflated with unexpected success. With all this--

[Psalms 73:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 73:8</span></span>

They are corrupt--or, literally, "they deride," they speak maliciously
and arrogantly and invade even heaven with blasphemy ([Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006).md), and cover earth with slanders
([Job 21:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 73:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 73:10</span></span>

Hence God's people are confounded, turned hither (or back) and thither,
perplexed with doubts of God's knowledge and care, and filled with
sorrow.

[Psalms 73:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 73:12</span></span>

prosper in the word--literally, "secure for ever."

[Psalms 73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 73:13</span></span>

The Psalmist, partaking of these troubles, is especially disturbed in
view of his own case, that with all his diligent efforts for a holy
life, he is still sorely tried.

[Psalms 73:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 73:15</span></span>

Freed from idiomatic phrases, this verse expresses a supposition, as,
"Had I thus spoken, I should," &c., intimating that he had kept his
troubles to himself.

generation of thy children--Thy people ([Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md).

offend--literally, "deceive, mislead."

[Psalms 73:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 73:16</span></span>

Still he--

thought--literally, "studied," or, "pondered this riddle"; but in vain;
it remained a toil (compare Margin), till he--

[Psalms 73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 73:17</span></span>

went into the sanctuary--to enquire (compare [Exo
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md); [Psa
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007.md); [Psa
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 73:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 73:18</span></span>

their end--future ([Psa 37:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037).md),
which is dismal and terribly sudden ([Pro
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md); [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001).md), aggravated and hastened by
terror. As one despises an unsubstantial dream, so God, waking up to
judgment ([Psa 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md); [Psa
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023).md), despises their vain shadow of
happiness ([Psa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md); [Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007).md). They are thrown into ruins as a
building falling to pieces ([Psa
74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 73:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 73:21</span></span>

He confesses how--

foolish--literally, "stupid," and

ignorant--literally, "not discerning," had been his course of thought.

[Psalms 73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 73:22</span></span>

before thee--literally, "with Thee," in conduct respecting Thee.

[Psalms 73:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 73:23</span></span>

Still he was with God, as a dependent beneficiary, and so kept from
falling ([Psa 73:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 73:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 73:24</span></span>

All doubts are silenced in confidence of divine guidance and future
glory.

receive me to glory--literally, "take for (me) glory" (compare [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018.md); [Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 73:25</span></span>

God is his only satisfying good.

[Psalms 73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 73:26</span></span>

strength--literally, "rock" ([Psa
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002).md).

portion-- ([Psa 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Lam
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#024).md).

[Psalms 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 73:27</span></span>

The lot of apostates, described by a figure of frequent use ([Jer
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md), [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Eze
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#035).md), is contrasted with his, who
finds happiness in nearness to God ([Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008).md), and his delightful work the
declaration of His praise.
