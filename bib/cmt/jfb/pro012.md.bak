1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#002).md).

hateth reproof-- ([Pro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#017).md).

brutish--stupid, regardless of his own welfare ([Psa
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010.md); [Psa
73:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#022).md).

[Proverbs 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 12:3</span></span>

Wickedness cannot give permanent prosperity.

15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005.md); [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008).md).

[Proverbs 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 12:4</span></span>

A virtuous woman--in the wide sense of well-disposed to all moral duties
([Pro 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#010).md).

maketh ashamed--that is, by misconduct.

rottenness--an incurable evil.

[Proverbs 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 12:5</span></span>

thoughts--or, "purposes."

are right--literally, "are judgment," that is, true decisions.

counsels--(Compare [Pro 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#014).md).

deceit--contrary to truth and honesty.

[Proverbs 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 12:6</span></span>

The words--or, "expressed designs" of the wicked are for evil purposes.

the mouth--or, "words" of the righteous delivering instead of ensnaring
men.

[Proverbs 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 12:7</span></span>

Such conduct brings a proper return, by the destruction of the wicked
and well-being of the righteous and his family.

[Proverbs 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 12:8</span></span>

despised--as opposed to commended ([Pro
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#012).md).

perverse heart--or, "wicked principles," as opposed to one of wisdom.

[Proverbs 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 12:9</span></span>

regardeth--literally, "knoweth" ([Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006).md).

mercies . . . cruel--as acts of compassion ungraciously rendered to the
needy. The righteous more regards a beast than the wicked a man.

[Proverbs 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 12:11</span></span>

the wicked . . . evil--They love the crafty arts of deception.

the root . . . fruit--their own resources supply them; or, it may be
rendered: "He (God) giveth, or, sets ([Eze
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022).md) the root of the righteous," and
hence it is firm: or, the verb is impersonal; "As to the root . . . it
is firm" ([Pro 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#019).md).

[Proverbs 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 12:13</span></span>

The wicked is snared, &c.--The sentiment expanded. While the wicked,
such as liars, flatterers, &c., fall by their own words, the righteous
are unhurt. Their good conduct makes friends, and God rewards them.

speaketh--literally, "speaketh hastily," or indiscreetly ([Psa
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033).md), as an angry man retorts harsh
and provoking invectives.

tongue . . . health--by soothing and gentle language.

[Proverbs 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 12:19</span></span>

God's wise limitations ([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md).

mischief--as penal evil.

[Proverbs 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 12:22</span></span>

more excellent--(Compare Margin); or, "more successful," while the
wicked fail; or, we may read it: "The righteous guides his friend, but,"
