### [John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

[John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 5:1</span></span>

THE IMPOTENT MAN HEALED--DISCOURSE OCCASIONED BY THE PERSECUTION ARISING
THEREUPON. (John 5:1-47)

a feast of the Jews--What feast? No question has more divided the
Harmonists of the Gospels, and the duration of our Lord's ministry may
be said to hinge on it. For if, as the majority have thought (until of
late years) it was a Passover, His ministry lasted three and a half
years; if not, probably a year less. Those who are dissatisfied with the
Passover-view all differ among themselves what other feast it was, and
some of the most acute think there are no grounds for deciding. In our
judgment the evidence is in favor of its being a Passover, but the
reasons cannot be stated here.

[John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 5:2</span></span>

sheep market--The supplement should be (as in Margin) "sheep \[gate\],"
mentioned in [Neh 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md), [Neh
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#032.md).

Bethesda--that is, "house (place) of mercy," from the cures wrought
there.

five porches--for shelter to the patients.

[John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 5:3</span></span>

impotent--infirm.

[John 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 5:4</span></span>

an angel, &c.--This miracle differed in two points from all other
miracles recorded in Scripture: (1) It was not one, but a succession of
miracles periodically wrought: (2) As it was only wrought "when the
waters were troubled," so only upon one patient at a time, and that the
patient "who first stepped in after the troubling of the waters." But
this only the more undeniably fixed its miraculous character. We have
heard of many waters having a medicinal virtue; but what water was ever
known to cure instantaneously a single disease? And who ever heard of
any water curing all, even the most diverse diseases--"blind, halt,
withered"--alike? Above all, who ever heard of such a thing being done
"only at a certain season," and most singularly of all, doing it only to
the first person who stepped in after the moving of the waters? Any of
these peculiarities--much more all taken together--must have proclaimed
the supernatural character of the cures wrought. (If the text here be
genuine, there can be no doubt of the miracle, as there were multitudes
living when this Gospel was published who, from their own knowledge of
Jerusalem, could have exposed the falsehood of the Evangelist, if no
such cure had been known there. The want of [Joh
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md) and part of [Joh
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#003.md) in some good manuscripts, and the
use of some unusual words in the passage, are more easily accounted for
than the evidence in their favor if they were not originally in the
text. Indeed [Joh 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007.md) is
unintelligible without [Joh 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004.md). The
internal evidence brought against it is merely the unlikelihood of such
a miracle--a principle which will carry us a great deal farther if we
allow it to weigh against positive evidence).

[John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 5:5</span></span>

thirty and eight years--but not all that time at the pool. This was
probably the most pitiable of all the cases, and therefore selected.

[John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 5:6</span></span>

saw him lie, and knew, &c.--As He doubtless visited the spot just to
perform this cure, so He knows where to find His patient, and the whole
previous history of his case ([Joh
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025).md).

Wilt thou be made whole?--Could anyone doubt that a sick man would like
to be made whole, or that the patients came thither, and this man had
returned again and again, just in hope of a cure? But our Lord asked the
question. (1) To fasten attention upon Himself; (2) By making him detail
his case to deepen in him the feeling of entire helplessness; (3) By so
singular a question to beget in his desponding heart the hope of a cure.
(Compare [Mar 10:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#051).md).

[John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 5:7</span></span>

Sir, I have no man, &c.--Instead of saying he wished to be cured, he
just tells with piteous simplicity how fruitless had been all his
efforts to obtain it, and how helpless and all but hopeless he was. Yet
not quite. For here he is at the pool, waiting on. It seemed of no use;
nay, only tantalizing,

while I am coming, another steppeth down before me--the fruit was
snatched from his lips. Yet he will not go away. He may get nothing by
staying, he may drop into his grave ere he get into the pool; but by
going from the appointed, divine way of healing, he can get nothing.
Wait therefore he will, wait he does, and when Christ comes to heal him,
lo! he is waiting his turn. What an attitude for a sinner at Mercy's
gate! The man's hopes seemed low enough ere Christ came to him. He might
have said, just before "Jesus passed by that way," "This is no use; I
shall never get in; let me die at home." Then all had been lost. But he
held on, and his perseverance was rewarded with a glorious cure.
Probably some rays of hope darted into his heart as he told his tale
before those Eyes whose glance measured his whole case. But the word of
command consummates his preparation to receive the cure, and
instantaneously works it.

[John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 5:8</span></span>

Rise, take up thy bed, &c.--"Immediately" he did so. "He spake and it
was done." The slinging of his portable couch over his shoulders was
designed to show the perfection of the cure.

[John 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">joh 5:9</span></span>

the same day was the sabbath--Beyond all doubt this was intentional, as
in so many other healings, in order that when opposition arose on this
account men might be compelled to listen to His claims and His teaching.

[John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">joh 5:10</span></span>

The Jews--that is, those in authority. (See on [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019)..md)

it is not lawful to carry thy bed--a glorious testimony to the cure, as
instantaneous and complete, from the lips of the most prejudiced! (And
what a contrast does it, as all our Lord's miracles, present to the
bungling miracles of the Church of Rome!) In ordinary circumstances, the
rulers had the law on their side ([Neh
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#015.md); [Jer
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021).md). But when the man referred them
to "Him that had made him whole" ([Joh
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#011).md) as his authority, the argument
was resistless. Yet they ingeniously parried the thrust, asking him, not
who had "made him whole"--that would have condemned themselves and
defeated their purpose--but who had bidden him "take up his bed and
walk," in other words, who had dared to order a breach of the sabbath?
It is time we were looking after Him--thus hoping to shake the man's
faith in his Healer.

[John 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 5:13</span></span>

he that was healed wist not, &c.--That some one, with unparalleled
generosity, tenderness and power, had done it, the man knew well enough:
but as he had never heard of Him before, so he disappeared too quickly
for any inquiries.

conveyed himself away--slipped out of the crowd that had gathered, to
avoid both hasty popularity and precipitate hatred ([Mat
12:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014).md).

[John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">joh 5:14</span></span>

findeth him in the temple--saying, perhaps, "I will go into Thy house
with burnt offerings, I will pay my vows which my lips have uttered and
my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble" ([Psa
66:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#013).md). Jesus, there Himself for
His own ends, "findeth him there"--not all accidentally, be assured.

sin no more, &c.--a glimpse this of the reckless life he had probably
led before his thirty-eight years' infirmity had come upon him, and
which not improbably had brought on, in the just judgment of God, his
chronic complaint. Fearful illustration this of "the severity of God,"
but glorious manifestation of our Lord's insight into "what was in man."

[John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">joh 5:15</span></span>

The man departed, and told, &c.--little thinking how unwelcome his
grateful and eager testimony would be. "The darkness received not the
light which was pouring its rays upon it" ([Joh
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005.md), [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011).md) \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 5:16</span></span>

because he had done these things on the sabbath day--What to these
hypocritical religionists was the doing of the most glorious and
beneficent miracles, compared with the atrocity of doing them on the
sabbath day! Having given them this handle, on purpose to raise the
first public controversy with them, and thus open a fitting opportunity
of laying His claims before them, He rises at once to the whole height
of them, in a statement which for grandeur and terseness exceeds almost
anything that ever afterwards fell from Him, at least to His enemies.

[John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 5:17</span></span>

My Father worketh hitherto and I work--The "I" is emphatic; "The
creative and conservative activity of My Father has known no
sabbath-cessation from the beginning until now, and that is the law of
My working."

[John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 5:18</span></span>

God was his Father--literally, "His own \[or peculiar\] Father," (as in
[Rom 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032).md). The addition is their own,
but a very proper one.

making himself equal with God--rightly gathering this to be His meaning,
not from the mere words "My Father," but from His claim of right to act
as His Father did in the like high sphere, and by the same law of
ceaseless activity in that sphere. And as, instead of instantly
disclaiming any such meaning--as He must have done if it was false--He
positively sets His seal to it in the following verses, merely
explaining how consistent such claim was with the prerogatives of His
Father, it is beyond all doubt that we have here an assumption of
peculiar personal Sonship, or participation in the Father's essential
nature.

[John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">joh 5:19</span></span>

the Son can do nothing of himself--that is, apart from and in rivalry of
the Father, as they supposed. The meaning is, "The Son can have no
separate interest or action from the Father."

for what things, &c.--On the contrary, "whatever the Father doeth that
same doeth the Son,"

likewise--"in the like manner." What claim to absolute equality with the
Father could exceed this: not only to do "the same things," but to do
them as the Father does them?

[John 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">joh 5:20</span></span>

Father loveth . . . and showeth him all, &c.--As love has no
concealments, so it results from the perfect fellowship and mutual
endearment of the Father and the Son (see on [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md), whose interests are one, even
as their nature, that the Father communicates to the Son all His
counsels, and what has been thus shown to the Son is by Him executed in
His mediatorial character. "With the Father, doing is willing; it is
only the Son who acts in Time" \[ALFORD\]. Three things here are clear:
(1) The personal distinctions in the Godhead. (2) Unity of action among
the Persons results from unity of nature. (3) Their oneness of interest
is no unconscious or involuntary thing, but a thing of glorious
consciousness, will, and love, of which the Persons themselves are the
proper Objects.

show him greater things, &c.--referring to what He goes on to mention
([Joh 5:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021).md), comprised in two great
words, LIFE and JUDGMENT, which STIER beautifully calls God's Regalia.
Yet these, Christ says, the Father and He do in common.

[John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">joh 5:21</span></span>

raiseth the dead and quickeneth them--one act in two stages. This is His
absolute prerogative as God.

so the Son quickeneth them--that is, raiseth up and quickeneth.

whom he will--not only doing the same divine act, but doing it as the
result of His own will, even as the Father does it. This statement is of
immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ, distinguishing
them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles, who as human
instruments were employed to perform super-natural actions, while Christ
did all as the Father's commissioned Servant indeed, but in the exercise
of His own absolute right of action.

[John 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">joh 5:22</span></span>

For the Father judgeth no man, &c.--rather, "For neither doth the Father
judge any man," implying that the same "thing was meant in the former
verse of the quickening of the dead"--both acts being done, not by the
Father and the Son, as though twice done, but by the Father through the
Son as His voluntary Agent.

all judgment--judgment in its most comprehensive sense, or as we should
say, all administration.

[John 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">joh 5:23</span></span>

honour the Son as . . . the Father--As he who believes that Christ in
the foregoing verses has given a true account of His relation to the
Father must of necessity hold Him entitled to the same honor as the
Father, so He here adds that it was the Father's express intention in
making over all judgment to the Son, that men should thus honor Him.

honoureth not the Father--does not do it in fact, whatever he may
imagine, and will be held as not doing it by the Father Himself, who
will accept no homage which is not accorded to His own Son.

[John 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 5:24</span></span>

believeth on him that sent me--that is, believeth in Him as having sent
Me. I have spoken of the Son's right not only to heal the sick but to
raise from the dead, and quicken whom He will: And now I say unto you,
That life-giving operation has already passed upon all who receive My
words as the Sent of the Father on the great errand of mercy.

hath everlasting life--immediately on his believing (compare [Joh
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012).md).

is passed--"hath passed over"

from death unto life--What a transition! (Compare [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014).md).

[John 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 5:25</span></span>

The hour cometh--in its whole fulness, at Pentecost.

and now is--in its beginnings.

the dead--the spiritually dead, as is clear from [Joh
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md). Here He rises from the calmer
phrase "hearing his word" ([Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024).md),
to the grander expression, "hearing the voice of the Son of God," to
signify that as it finds men in a dead condition, so it carries with it
a resurrection-power.

shall live--in the sense of [Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md).

[John 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 5:26</span></span>

given to the Son, &c.--Does this refer to the essential life of the Son
before all time ([Joh 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004).md) (as most of
the Fathers, and OLSHAUSEN, STIER, ALFORD, &c., among the moderns), or
to the purpose of God that this essential life should reside in the
Person of the Incarnate Son, and be manifested thus to the world?
\[CALVIN, LUCKE, LUTHARDT, &c.\] The question is as difficult as the
subject is high. But as all that Christ says of His essential relation
to the Father is intended to explain and exalt His mediatorial
functions, so the one seems in our Lord's own mind and language mainly
the starting-point of the other.

[John 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 5:27</span></span>

because he is the Son of man--This seems to confirm the last remark,
that what Christ had properly in view was the indwelling of the Son's
essential life in humanity as the great theater and medium of divine
display, in both the great departments of His work--life-giving and
judgment. The appointment of a Judge in our own nature is one of the
most beautiful arrangements of divine wisdom in redemption.

[John 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">joh 5:28</span></span>

Marvel not at this--this committal of all judgment to the Son of man.

for the hour is coming--He adds not in this case (as in [Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025).md), "and now is," because this was
not to be till the close of the whole dispensation of mercy.

[John 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">joh 5:29</span></span>

resurrection of life--that is, to life everlasting ([Mat
25:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046).md).

of damnation--It would have been harsh to say "the resurrection of
death," though that is meant, for sinners rise from death to death
\[BENGEL\]. The resurrection of both classes is an exercise of sovereign
authority; but in the one case it is an act of grace, in the other of
justice. (Compare [Dan 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md), from
which the language is taken). How awfully grand are these unfoldings of
His dignity and authority from the mouth of Christ Himself! And they are
all in the third person; in what follows He resumes the first person.

[John 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 5:30</span></span>

of mine own self do nothing--that is, apart from the Father, or in any
interest than My own. (See on [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md).

as I hear--that is, "My judgments are all anticipated in the bosom of My
Father, to which I have immediate access, and by Me only responded to
and reflected. They cannot therefore err, as I live for one end only, to
carry into effect the will of Him that sent Me."

[John 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 5:31</span></span>

If I . . . witness of myself--standing alone, and setting up any
separate interest.

[John 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">joh 5:32</span></span>

There is another--that is, the Father, as is plain from the connection.
How brightly the distinction of the Persons shines out here!

and I know that the witness, &c.--"This is the Son's testimony to the
Father's truth (see [Joh 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md); [Joh
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#026.md), [Joh
8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055).md). It testifies to the full
consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of His
humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father" \[ALFORD\]. And thus He
cheered His spirit under the cloud of human opposition which was already
gathering over His head.

[John 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">joh 5:33</span></span>

Ye sent unto John--(See [Joh 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md),
&c.).

receive not testimony . . . from man--that is, depend not on human
testimony.

but . . . that ye might be saved--"I refer to him merely to aid your
salvation."

[John 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 5:35</span></span>

He was a burning and a shining light--literally, "the burning and
shining lamp" (or torch):--that is, "the great light of his day." Christ
is never called by the humble word here applied to John--a
light-bearer--studiously used to distinguish him from his Master, but
ever the Light in the most absolute sense. (See on [Joh
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006).md).

willing for a season--that is, till they saw that it pointed whither
they were not prepared to go.

to rejoice in his light--There is a play of irony here, referring to the
hollow delight with which his testimony tickled them.

[John 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 5:36</span></span>

I have greater witness--rather, "The witness which I have is greater."

the works . . . bear witness of me--not simply as miracles nor even as a
miracle of mercy, but these miracles, as He did them, with a will and a
power, a majesty and a grace manifestly His own.

[John 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 5:37</span></span>

the Father himself . . . hath borne witness of me--not referring,
probably, to the voice of His baptism, but (as seems from what follows)
to the testimony of the Old Testament Scripture \[CALVIN, LUCKE, MEYER,
LUTHARDT, &c.\].

neither heard his voice, &c.--never recognized Him in this character.
The words are "designedly mysterious, like many others which our Lord
uttered" \[STIER\].

[John 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 5:38</span></span>

not his word abiding in you--passing now from the Witness to the
testimony borne by Him in "the lively oracles" ([Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md): both were alike strangers to
their breasts, as was evidenced by their rejecting Him to whom all that
witness was borne.

[John 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 5:39</span></span>

Search the scriptures, &c.--"In the Scriptures ye find your charter of
eternal life; go search them then, and you will find that I am the Great
Burden of their testimony; yet ye will not come to Me for that life
eternal which you profess to find there, and of which they tell you I am
the appointed Dispenser." (Compare [Act
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011).md). How touching and gracious
are these last words! Observe here (1) The honor which Christ gives to
the Scriptures, as a record which all have a right and are bound to
search--the reverse of which the Church of Rome teaches; (2) The
opposite extreme is, resting in the mere Book without the living Christ,
to direct the soul to whom is its main use and chiefest glory.

[John 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 5:41</span></span>

I receive not honour from men--contrasting His own end with theirs,
which was to obtain human applause.

[John 5:42](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">joh 5:42</span></span>

not the love of God in you--which would inspire you with a single desire
to know His mind and will, and yield yourselves to it, in spite of
prejudice and regardless of consequences.

[John 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">joh 5:43</span></span>

if another shall come, &c.--How strikingly has this been verified in the
history of the Jews! "From the time of the true Christ to our time,
