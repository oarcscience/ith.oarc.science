15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#019.md); see on [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001), title.md). The theme may be stated
in LUTHER'S well-known words, "A mighty fortress is our God." The great
deliverance ([Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md); [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md) may have occasioned its
composition. ([Psa 46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001).md)

refuge--literally, "a place of trust" ([Psa
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012).md).

strength-- ([Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002).md).

physical commotions.

[Psalms 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 46:3</span></span>

[Psalms 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 46:4</span></span>

36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001).md).

city of God, the holy place--His earthly residence, Jerusalem and the
temple (compare [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md); [Psa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md); [Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002), &c..md). God's favor, like a river
whose waters are conducted in channels, is distributed to all parts of
His Church.

most High--denoting His supremacy ([Psa
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 46:5</span></span>

right early--literally, "at the turn of morning," or change from night
to day, a critical time ([Psa 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md);
compare [Isa 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036).md).

[Psalms 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 46:6</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002).md).

with us--on our side; His presence is terror to our enemies, safety to
us.

24:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 46:8</span></span>

enemies.

The usual weapons of war ([Psa 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#012).md),
as well as those using them, are brought to an end.

[Psalms 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 46:10</span></span>

Be still, &c.--literally, "Leave off to oppose Me and vex My people. I
am over all for their safety." (Compare [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md); [Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022).md).
