AARON'S ROD FLOURISHES. ([Num 17:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#001).md)

Speak unto the children of Israel--The controversy with Moses and Aaron
about the priesthood was of such a nature and magnitude as required a
decisive and authoritative settlement. For the removal of all doubts and
the silencing of all murmuring in the future regarding the holder of the
office, a miracle was wrought of a remarkable character and permanent
duration; and in the manner of performing it, all the people were made
to have a direct and special interest.

take of every one . . . princes . . . twelve rods--As the princes, being
the oldest sons of the chief family, and heads of their tribes, might
have advanced the best claims to the priesthood, if that sacred dignity
was to be shared among all the tribes, they were therefore selected, and
being twelve in number--that of Joseph being counted only one--Moses was
ordered to see that the name of each was inscribed--a practice borrowed
from the Egyptians--upon his rod or wand of office. The name of Aaron
rather than of Levi was used, as the latter name would have opened a
door of controversy among the Levites; and as there was to be one rod
only for the head of each tribe, the express appointment of a rod for
Aaron determined him to be the head of that tribe, as well as that
branch or family of the tribe to which the priestly dignity should
belong. These rods were to be laid in the tabernacle close to the ark
(compare [Num 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md) and [Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md), where a divine token was
promised that would for all time terminate the dispute.

[Numbers 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 17:6</span></span>

the rod of Aaron was among their rods--either one of the twelve, or, as
many suppose, a thirteenth in the midst ([Heb
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#004).md). The rods were of dry sticks or
wands, probably old, as transmitted from one head of the family to a
succeeding.

[Numbers 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 17:8</span></span>

Moses went into the tabernacle--being privileged to do so on this
occasion by the special command of God. And he there beheld the
remarkable spectacle of Aaron's rod--which, according to JOSEPHUS, was a
stick of an almond tree, bearing fruit in three different stages at
once--buds, blossoms, and fruit.

[Numbers 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">num 17:10</span></span>

Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token
against the rebels--For if, after all admonitions and judgments,
seconded by miracles, the people should still rebel, they would
certainly pay the penalty by death.

[Numbers 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">num 17:12</span></span>

Behold, we die, we perish--an exclamation of fear, both from the
remembrance of former judgments, and the apprehension of future relapses
into murmuring.

[Numbers 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">num 17:13</span></span>

cometh any thing near--that is, nearer than he ought to do; an error
into which many may fall. Will the stern justice of God overtake every
slight offense? We shall all be destroyed. Some, however, regard this
exclamation as the symptom or a new discontent, rather than the
indication of a reverential and submissive spirit. Let us fear and sin
not.
