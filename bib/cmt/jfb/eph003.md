### [Ephesians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

[Ephesians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 3:1</span></span>

HIS APOSTOLIC OFFICE TO MAKE KNOWN THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST REVEALED BY THE
SPIRIT: PRAYER THAT BY THE SAME SPIRIT THEY MAY COMPREHEND THE VAST LOVE
OF CHRIST: DOXOLOGY ENDING THIS DIVISION OF THE EPISTLE. (Eph. 3:1-21)

of Jesus Christ--Greek, "Christ Jesus." The office is the prominent
thought in the latter arrangement; the person, in the former. He here
marks the Messiahship of "Christ," maintained by him as the origin of
his being a "prisoner," owing to the jealousy of the Jews being roused
at his preaching it to the Gentiles. His very bonds were profitable to
("for" or "in behalf of you") Gentiles ([Eph
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013); [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)). He digresses at "For this
cause," and does not complete the sentence which he had intended, until
[Eph 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014), where he resumes the words,
"For this cause," namely, because I know this your call of God as
Gentiles ([Eph 2:11-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)), to be
"fellow-heirs" with the Jews ([Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006)), "I bow my knees to" the Father
of our common Saviour ([Eph 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014))
to confirm you in the faith by His Spirit. "I Paul," expresses the agent
employed by the Spirit to enlighten them, after he had been first
enlightened himself by the same Spirit ([Eph
3:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003), [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009)).

[Ephesians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 3:2</span></span>

If--The Greek does not imply doubt: "Assuming (what I know to be the
fact, namely) that ye have heard," &c. "If, as I presume," The
indicative in the Greek shows that no doubt is implied: "Seeing that
doubtless," &c. He by this phrase delicately reminds them of their
having heard from himself, and probably from others subsequently, the
fact. See Introduction, showing that these words do not disprove the
address of this Epistle to the Ephesians. Compare [Act
20:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017).

the dispensation--"The office of dispensing, as a steward, the grace of
God which was (not 'is') given me to you-ward," namely, to dispense to
you.

[Ephesians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 3:3</span></span>

he made known--The oldest manuscripts read, "That by revelation was the
mystery (namely, of the admission of the Gentiles, [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006); [Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)) made known unto me ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012))."

as I wrote afore--namely, in this Epistle ([Eph
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)), the words of which he partly
repeats.

[Ephesians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 3:4</span></span>

understand my knowledge--"perceive my understanding" \[ALFORD\], or
"intelligence." "When ye read," implies that, deep as are the mysteries
of this Epistle, the way for all to understand them is to read it ([Ti2
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)). By perceiving his
understanding of the mysteries, they, too, will be enabled to
understand.

the mystery of Christ--The "mystery" is Christ Himself, once hidden, but
now revealed ([Col 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027)).

[Ephesians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 3:5</span></span>

in other ages--Greek, "generations."

not made known--He does not say, "has not been revealed." Making known
by revelation is the source of making known by preaching \[BENGEL\]. The
former was vouchsafed only to the prophets, in order that they might
make known the truth so revealed to men in general.

unto the sons of men--men in their state by birth, as contrasted with
those illuminated "by the Spirit" (Greek, "IN the Spirit," compare [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)), [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017).

as--The mystery of the call of the Gentiles (of which Paul speaks here)
was not unknown to the Old Testament prophets ([Isa
56:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#006); [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006)). But they did not know it with
the same explicit distinctness "As" it has been now known ([Act
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#019); [Act
11:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#018)). They probably did not know
that the Gentiles were to be admitted without circumcision or that they
were to be on a level with the Jews in partaking of the grace of God.
The gift of "the Spirit" in its fulness was reserved for the New
Testament that Christ might thereby be glorified. The epithet, "holy,"
marks the special consecration of the New Testament "prophets" (who are
here meant) by the Spirit, compared with which even the Old Testament
prophets were but "sons of men" ([Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003), and elsewhere).

[Ephesians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 3:6</span></span>

Translate, "That the Gentiles are," &c. "and fellow members of the same
body, and fellow partakers of the (so the oldest manuscripts read, not
'HIS') promise, in Christ Jesus (added in the oldest manuscripts),
through the Gospel." It is "in Christ Jesus" that they are made "fellow
heirs" in the inheritance of GOD: "of the same body" under the Head,
CHRIST JESUS; and "fellow partakers of the promise" in the communion of
THE HOLY SPIRIT ([Eph 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013); [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)). The Trinity is thus alluded to,
as often elsewhere in this Epistle ([Eph
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019), [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022)).

[Ephesians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 3:7</span></span>

Whereof--"of which" Gospel.

according to--in consequence of, and in accordance with, "the gift of
the grace of God."

given--"which (gift of grace) was given to me by (Greek, 'according to,'
as in [Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020); [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019) : as the result of, and in
proportion to) the effectual working (Greek, 'energy,' or 'in-working')
of His power."

[Ephesians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 3:8</span></span>

am--Not merely was I in times past, but I still am the least worthy of
so high an office (compare [Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015),
end).

least of all saints--not merely "of all apostles" ([Co1
15:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009)).

is--Greek, "has been given."

among--omitted in the oldest manuscripts Translate, "to announce to the
Gentiles the glad tidings of the unsearchable ([Job
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009)) riches," namely, of Christ's
grace ([Eph 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007)). [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033), "unsearchable" as a mine
inexhaustible, whose treasures can never be fully explored ([Eph
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)).

[Ephesians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 3:9</span></span>

to make all men see--Greek, "to enlighten all" ([Eph
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#018); [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028); [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004)). "All" (compare [Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028)).

fellowship--The oldest manuscripts read, "economy," or "dispensation"
(compare [Col 1:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025); and see on [Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010), above). "To make all see how it
hath seemed good to God at this time to dispense (through me and others,
His stewards) what heretofore was a mystery." ELLICOTT explains it, "the
arrangement," or "regulation" of the mystery (the union of Jews and
Gentiles in Christ) which was now to be humbly traced and acknowledged
in the fact of its having secretly existed in the counsel of God, and
now having been revealed to the heavenly powers by means of the Church.

from the beginning of the world--Greek, "from (the beginning of) the
ages." Compare [Eph 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004); [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025); [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007). The "ages" are the vast
successive periods of time, marked by successive stages of creation and
orders of beings.

in God--"hidden in" His counsels ([Eph
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)).

created all things by Jesus Christ--God's creation of the world and all
things therein is the foundation of the rest of the "economy," which is
freely dispensed according to the universal power of God \[BENGEL\]. AS
God created "the whole range of things" (so the Greek), physical and
spiritual alike, He must have an absolute right to adjust all things as
He will. Hence, we may see His right to keep the mystery of world-wide
salvation in Christ "hidden in Himself," till his own good time for
revealing it. The oldest manuscripts omit "by Jesus Christ."

[Ephesians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 3:10</span></span>

The design of God in giving Paul grace to proclaim to the Gentiles the
mystery of salvation heretofore hidden.

now--first: opposed to "hidden from the beginning of the world" ([Eph
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)).

unto the principalities and--Greek adds "the"

powers--unto the various orders of good angels primarily, as these dwell
"in the heavenly places" in the highest sense; "known" to their adoring
joy ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016); [Pe1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012)). Secondarily, God's wisdom in
redemption is made known to evil angels, who dwell "in heavenly places"
in a lower sense, namely, the air (compare [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002) with [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)); "known" to their dismay ([Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015)).

might be known--Translate, "may be known."

by the church--"by means of," or "through the Church," which is the
"theater" for the display of God's manifold wisdom ([Luk
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010); [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009)): "a spectacle (Greek, 'theater')
to angels." Hence, angels are but our "fellow servants" ([Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)).

manifold wisdom--though essentially one, as Christ is one, yet varying
the economy in respect to places, times, and persons ([Isa
55:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008); [Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)). Compare [Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010), "stewards of the manifold grace
of God." Man cannot understand aright its single acts till he can survey
them as a connected whole ([Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)). The call of the Church is no
haphazard remedy, or afterthought, but part of the eternal scheme,
which, amidst manifold varieties of dispensation, is one in its end.

[Ephesians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 3:11</span></span>

which he purposed--Greek, "made." ELLICOTT translates, "wrought."

[Ephesians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 3:12</span></span>

Translate, "our boldness and our access ([Eph
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018)) in confidence through our faith
in Him." ALFORD quotes as an instance, [Rom
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038), &c. "THE access" (Greek) implies
the formal introduction into the presence of a monarch.

[Ephesians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 3:13</span></span>

"I entreat you not to be dispirited."

for you--in your behalf.

which is--rather, "which are your glory," namely, inasmuch as showing
that God loved you so much, as both to give His Son for you, and to
permit His apostles to suffer "tribulations" for you \[CHRYSOSTOM\] in
preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles. See on [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), "prisoner for you Gentiles." My
tribulations are your spiritual "glory," as your faith is furthered
thereby ([Co1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010)).

[Ephesians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 3:14</span></span>

For this cause--Resuming the thread of [Eph
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001), "For this cause." Because ye have
such a standing in God's Church \[ALFORD\].

bow my knees--the proper attitude in humble prayer. Posture affects the
mind, and is not therefore unimportant. See Paul's practice ([Act
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036)); and that of the Lord Himself
on earth ([Luk 22:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#041)).

unto the Father--The oldest manuscripts omit "of our Lord Jesus Christ."
But Vulgate and some very old authorities retain them: [Eph
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015), "From whom," in either case,
refers to "the Father" (Patera), as "family" (patria, akin in sound and
etymology) plainly refers to Him. Still the foundation of all sonship is
in Jesus Christ.

[Ephesians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 3:15</span></span>

the whole family--ALFORD, MIDDLETON, and others translate, "every
family": alluding to the several families in heaven and in earth
supposed to exist \[THEOPHYLACT, Ã†cumenius, in SUICER, 2.633\], the
apostle thus being supposed to imply that God, in His relation of Father
to us His adopted children, is the great prototype of the paternal
relation wherever found. But the idea that "the holy angels are bound up
in spiritual families or compaternities," is nowhere else in Scripture
referred to. And [Act 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036), where the
article is similarly omitted, and yet the translation is, "All the house
of Israel," shows that in New Testament Greek the translation is
justifiable, "all the family," or "the whole family": which accords with
Scripture views, that angels and men, the saints militant and those with
God, are one holy family joined under the one Father in Christ, the
mediator between heaven and earth ([Eph
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010); [Phi
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)). Hence angels are termed our
"brethren" ([Rev 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)), and "sons of
God" by creation, as we are by adoption ([Job
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007)). The Church is part of the grand
family, or kingdom, which comprehends, besides men, the higher spiritual
world, where the archetype, to the realization of which redeemed man is
now tending, is already realized. This universal idea of the "kingdom"
of God as one divine community, is presented to us in the Lord's Prayer.
By sin men were estranged, not only from God, but from that higher
spiritual world in which the kingdom of God is already realized. As
Christ when He reconciled men to God, united them to one another in a
divine community (joined to Himself, the one Head), breaking down the
partition wall between Jew and Gentile ([Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)), so also He joins them in
communion with all those who have already attained that perfection in
the kingdom of God, to which the Church on earth is aspiring ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)) \[NEANDER\].

is named--derives its origin and its name as sons of God. To be named,
and to be, are one with God. To bear God's name is to belong to God as
His own peculiar people ([Num 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#027);
[Isa 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007); [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005); [Rom
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025)).

[Ephesians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 3:16</span></span>

according to--that is in abundance consonant to the riches of His glory;
not "according to" the narrowness of our hearts. [Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011), "Strengthened with all might
according to His glorious power."

by--Greek, "through"; "by means of His Spirit."

in--The Greek implies, "infused into."

the inner man-- ([Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022), [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024); [Pe1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004)); "the hidden man of the heart."
Not predicated of unbelievers, whose inward and outward man alike are
carnal. But in believers, the "inner (new) man," their true self, stands
in contrast to their old man, which is attached to them as a body of
death daily being mortified, but not their true self.

[Ephesians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 3:17</span></span>

That--So that.

dwell--abidingly make His abode ([Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)). Where the Spirit is there
Christ is ([Joh 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#016), [Joh
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018)).

by faith--Greek, "through faith," which opens the door of the heart to
Jesus ([Joh 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)). It is not enough
that He be on the tongue, or flit through the brain: the heart is His
proper seat \[CALVIN\]. "You being rooted and grounded in love" (compare
[Eph 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)), is in the Greek connected
with this clause, not with the clause, "that ye may be able to
comprehend." "Rooted" is an image from a tree; "grounded" (Greek,
"founder," "having your foundations resting on"), from a building
(compare Notes,, see on [Eph 2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020);
[Col 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023); [Col
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007)). Contrast [Mat
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#006), [Mat
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#021). "Love," the first-fruit of the
Spirit, flowing from Christ's love realized in the soul, was to be the
basis on which should rest their further comprehension of all the
vastness of Christ's love.

[Ephesians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 3:18</span></span>

May be able--even still further. Greek, "May be fully able."

breadth . . . length . . . depth . . . height--namely, the full
dimensions of the spiritual temple, answering to "the fulness of God"
([Eph 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)), to which the Church,
according to its capacity, ought to correspond (compare [Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010), [Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013)) as to "the fulness of Christ."
The "breadth" implies Christ's world-wide love, embracing all men: the
"length," its being extended through all ages ([Eph
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021)); the "depth," its profound
wisdom which no creature can fathom ([Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)); the "height," its being beyond
the reach of any foe to deprive us of ([Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)) \[BENGEL\]. I prefer to
understand "the breadth," &c., to refer to the whole of the vast mystery
of free salvation in Christ for all, Gentile and Jew alike, of which
Paul had been speaking ([Eph 3:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003)),
and of which he now prays they may have a fuller comprehension. As
subsidiary to this, and the most essential part of it, he adds, "and to
know the love of Christ" ([Eph 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)).
GROTIUS understands depth and height of God's goodness raising us from
the lowest depression to the greatest height.

[Ephesians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 3:19</span></span>

passeth--surpasseth, exceeds. The paradox "to know . . . which passeth
knowledge," implies that when he says "know," he does not mean that we
can adequately know; all we know is, that His love exceeds far our
knowledge of it, and with even our fresh accessions of knowledge
hereafter, will still exceed them. Even as God's power exceeds our
thoughts ([Eph 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020)).

filled with--rather, as Greek, "filled even unto all the fulness of God"
(this is the grand goal), that is, filled, each according to your
capacity, with the divine wisdom, knowledge, and love; "even as God is
full," and as Christ who dwells in your hearts, hath "all the fulness of
the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily" ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)).

[Ephesians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 3:20</span></span>

unto him--contrasted with ourselves and our needs. Translate, "that is
able above all things (what is above all things) to do exceeding
abundantly above what we ask or (even) think": thought takes a wider
range than prayers. The word, above, occurs thrice as often in Paul's
writings, as in all the rest of the New Testament, showing the warm
exuberance of Paul's spirit.

according to the power--the indwelling Spirit ([Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026)). He appeals to their and his
experience.

[Ephesians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 3:21</span></span>

Translate, "Unto Him be the glory (that is, the whole glory of the
gracious dispensation of salvation just spoken of) in the Church (as the
theater for the manifestation of the glory, [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)) in Christ Jesus (as in Him all
the glory centers, [Zac 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)) to all
the generations of eternal ages," literally, "of the age of the ages."
Eternity is conceived as consisting of "ages" (these again consisting of
"generations") endlessly succeeding one another.
