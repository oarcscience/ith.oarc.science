### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001.md)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 22:1</span></span>

AHAB SLAIN AT RAMOTH-GILEAD. (1Ki. 22:1-36)

continued three years without war between Syria and Israel--The
disastrous defeat of Ben-hadad had so destroyed his army and exhausted
the resources of his country, that, however eager, he was unable to
recommence active hostilities against Israel. But that his hereditary
enmity remained unsubdued, was manifest by his breach of faith
concerning the treaty by which he had engaged to restore all the cities
which his father had seized ([Kg1
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#034).md).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 22:2</span></span>

Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel--It was
singular that a friendly league between the sovereigns of Israel and
Judah should, for the first time, have been formed by princes of such
opposite characters--the one pious, the other wicked. Neither this
league nor the matrimonial alliance by which the union of the royal
families was more closely cemented, met the Lord's approval ([Ch2
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002).md). It led, however, to a visit by
Jehoshaphat, whose reception in Samaria was distinguished by the most
lavish hospitality ([Ch2 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#002).md). The
opportunity of this visit was taken advantage of, to push an object on
which Ahab's heart was much set.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 22:3</span></span>

Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours--a Levitical and free town on the
north border of Gad ([Deu 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md); [Jos
21:38](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#038).md), on the site of the present
Salt Lake, in the province of Belka. It lay within the territories of
the Israelitish monarch, and was unjustly alienated; but whether it was
one of the cities usurped by the first Ben-hadad, which his son had
promised to restore, or was retained for some other reasons, the sacred
historian has not mentioned. In the expedition which Ahab meditated for
the recovery of this town, the aid of Jehoshaphat was asked and promised
(see [Ch2 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#003).md). Previous to declaring
hostilities, it was customary to consult the prophets (see on [Sa1
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#008).md); and Jehoshaphat having
expressed a strong desire to know the Lord's will concerning this war,
Ahab assembled four hundred of his prophets. These could not be either
the prophets of Baal or of Ashteroth ([Kg1
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#019).md), but seem ([Kg1
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#012).md) to have been false prophets,
who conformed to the symbolic calf-worship of Jehovah. Being the
creatures of Ahab, they unanimously predicted a prosperous issue to the
war. But dissatisfied with them, Jehoshaphat inquired if there was any
true prophet of the Lord. Ahab agreed, with great reluctance, to allow
Micaiah to be summoned. He was the only true prophet then to be found
residing in Samaria, and he had to be brought out of prison ([Kg1
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026).md), into which, according to
JOSEPHUS, he had been cast on account of his rebuke to Ahab for sparing
the king of Syria.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 22:10</span></span>

a void place--literally, "a threshing-floor," formed at the gate of
Samaria.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg1 22:11</span></span>

Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron--Small projections,
of the size and form of our candle extinguishers (worn in many parts of
the East as military ornaments), were worn by the Syrians of that time,
and probably by the Israelite warriors also. Zedekiah, by assuming two
horns, personated two heroes, and, pretending to be a prophet, wished in
this manner to represent the kings of Israel and Judah in a military
triumph. It was a symbolic action, to impart greater force to his
language (see [Deu 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017).md); but it was
little more than a flourish with a spontoon \[CALMET, Fragments\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg1 22:14</span></span>

what the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak--On the way the messenger
who conducted \[Micaiah\] to the royal presence informed him of the
tenor of the prophecies already given and recommended him to agree with
the rest, no doubt from the kindly motive of seeing him released from
imprisonment. But Micaiah, inflexibly faithful to his divine mission as
a prophet, announced his purpose to proclaim honestly whatever God
should bid him. On being asked by the king, "Shall I go against
Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" the prophet gave precisely the same
answer as the previous oracles that had been consulted; but it must have
been given in a sarcastic tone and in ironical mockery of their way of
speaking. Being solemnly urged to give a serious and truthful answer,
Micaiah then declared the visionary scene the Spirit had revealed to
him;--

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg1 22:17</span></span>

I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a
shepherd--The purport of this was that the army of Israel would be
defeated and dispersed; that Ahab would fall in the battle, and the
people return without either being pursued or destroyed by the enemy.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">kg1 22:18</span></span>

Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but
evil?--Since Ahab was disposed to trace this unwelcome truth to personal
enmity, Micaiah proceeded fearlessly to tell the incensed monarch in
full detail what had been revealed to him. The Hebrew prophets,
borrowing their symbolic pictures from earthly scenes, described God in
heaven as a king in His kingdom. And as earthly princes do nothing of
importance without asking the advice of their counsellors, God is
represented as consulting about the fate of Ahab. This prophetic
language must not be interpreted literally, and the command must be
viewed as only a permission to the lying spirit ([Rom
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034).md) \[CALMET\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg1 22:24</span></span>

Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the
cheek--The insolence of this man, the leader of the false prophets,
seems to have been provoked by jealousy at Micaiah's assumed monopoly of
the spirit of inspiration. This mode of smiting, usually with a shoe, is
both severe and ignominious. The calm reply of the Lord's prophet
consisted in announcing the fate of the false prophets who suffered as
the advisers of the disastrous expedition.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 22:26</span></span>

Take Micaiah, . . . Put this fellow in prison--Ahab, under the impulse
of vehement resentment, remands the prophet until his return.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">kg1 22:27</span></span>

bread of affliction, water of affliction--that is, the poorest prison
fare. Micaiah submitted, but reiterated aloud, in the presence of all,
that the issue of the war would be fatal to Ahab.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg1 22:29</span></span>

went up to Ramoth-gilead--The king of Israel, bent on this expedition,
marched, accompanied by his ally, with all his forces to the siege; but
on approaching the scene of action, his courage failed, and, hoping to
evade the force of Micaiah's prophecy by a secret stratagem, he assumed
the uniform of a subaltern, while he advised Jehoshaphat to fight in his
royal attire. The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest
end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation
([Kg1 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#031).md), had given special
instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill
him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their
assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted.
Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and
the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died
at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which
brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood
that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with
Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it \[[Kg1
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md)\]. Ahab was succeeded by his son
Ahaziah \[[Kg1 22:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#040.md)\].
