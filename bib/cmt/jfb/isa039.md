### [Isaiah Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001)

[Isaiah 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 39:1</span></span>

HEZEKIAH'S ERROR IN THE DISPLAY OF HIS RICHES TO THE BABYLONIAN
AMBASSADOR. ([Isa 39:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001))

Merodach-baladan--For a hundred fifty years before the overthrow of
Nineveh by Cyaxares the Mede, a succession of rulers, mostly viceroys of
Assyria, ruled Babylon, from the time of Nabonassar, 747 B.C. That date
is called "the Era of Nabonassar." Pul or Phallukha was then expelled,
and a new dynasty set up at Nineveh, under Tiglath-pileser. Semiramis,
Pul's wife, then retired to Babylon, with Nabonassar, her son, whose
advent to the throne of Babylon, after the overthrow of the old line at
Nineveh, marked a new era. Sometimes the viceroys of Babylon made
themselves, for a time, independent of Assyria; thus Merodach-baladan at
this time did so, encouraged by the Assyrian disaster in the Jewish
campaign. He had done so before, and was defeated in the first year of
Sennacherib's reign, as is recorded in cuneiform characters in that
monarchs palace of Koyunjik. Nabopolassar was the first who established,
permanently, his independence; his son, Nebuchadnezzar, raised Babylon
to the position which Nineveh once occupied; but from the want of stone
near the Lower Euphrates, the buildings of Babylon, formed of sun-dried
brick, have not stood the wear of ages as Nineveh has.

Merodach--an idol, the same as the god of war and planet Mars ([Jer
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002)). Often kings took their names
from their gods, as if peculiarly under their tutelage. So Belshazzar
from Bel.

Baladan--means "Bel is his lord." The chronicle of EUSEBIUS contains a
fragment of BEROSUS, stating that Acises, an Assyrian viceroy, usurped
the supreme command at Babylon. Merodach- (or Berodach-) baladan
murdered him and succeeded to the throne. Sennacherib conquered
Merodach-baladan and left Esar-haddon, his son, as governor of Babylon.
Merodach-baladan would naturally court the alliance of Hezekiah, who,
like himself, had thrown off the yoke of the Assyrian king, and who
would be equally glad of the Babylonian alliance against Assyria; hence
arose the excessive attention which he paid to the usurper.

sick--An additional reason is given ([Ch2
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031)). "The princes of Babylon sent
to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land"; namely, the
recession of the shadow on Ahaz' sundial; to the Chaldean astronomers,
such a fact would be especially interesting, the dial having been
invented at Babylon.

[Isaiah 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 39:2</span></span>

glad--It was not the mere act, but the spirit of it, which provoked God
([Ch2 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#025)), "Hezekiah rendered not
again according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted
up"; also compare [Ch2 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#031). God
"tries" His people at different times by different ways, bringing out
"all that is in their heart," to show them its varied corruptions.
Compare David in a similar case ([Ch1
21:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#001)).

precious things--rather, "the house of his (aromatic) spices"; from a
Hebrew root, to "break to pieces," as is done to aromatics.

silver . . . gold--partly obtained from the Assyrian camp ([Isa
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#004)); partly from presents ([Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023), [Ch2
32:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027)).

precious ointment--used for anointing kings and priests.

armour--or else vessels in general; the parallel passage ([Ch2
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#027)), "treasuries . . . for
shields," favors English Version. His arsenal.

[Isaiah 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 39:3</span></span>

What . . . whence--implying that any proposition coming from the
idolatrous enemies of God, with whom Israel was forbidden to form
alliance, should have been received with anything but gladness. Reliance
on Babylon, rather than on God, was a similar sin to the previous
reliance on Egypt (Isa. 30:1-31:9).

far country--implying that he had done nothing more than was proper in
showing attention to strangers "from a far country."

[Isaiah 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 39:4</span></span>

All--a frank confession of his whole fault; the king submits his conduct
to the scrutiny of a subject, because that subject was accredited by
God. Contrast Asa ([Ch2 16:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 39:5</span></span>

Lord of hosts--who has all thy goods at His disposal.

[Isaiah 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 39:6</span></span>

days come--one hundred twenty years afterwards. This is the first
intimation that the Jews would be carried to Babylon--the first
designation of their place of punishment. The general prophecy of Moses
([Lev 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033); [Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064)); the more particular one of
Ahijah in Jeroboam's time ([Kg1
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#015)), "beyond the river"; and of
[Amo 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027), "captivity beyond
Damascus"; are now concentrated in this specific one as to "Babylon"
([Mic 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010)). It was an exact
retribution in kind, that as Babylon had been the instrument of Hezekiah
and Judah's sin, so also it should be the instrument of their
punishment.

[Isaiah 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 39:7</span></span>

sons . . . from thee--The sons which Hezekiah (as JOSEPHUS tells us)
wished to have (see on [Isa 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003), on
"wept sore") will be among the foremost in suffering.

eunuchs--fulfilled ([Dan 1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002), [Dan
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 39:8</span></span>

peace . . . in my days--The punishment was not, as in David's case ([Sa2
24:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013)), sent in his time. True
repentance acquiesces in all God's ways and finds cause of thanksgiving
in any mitigation.

The former were local and temporary in their reference. These belong to
the distant future, and are world-wide in their interest; the
deliverance from Babylon under Cyrus, which he here foretells by
prophetic suggestion, carries him on to the greater deliverance under
Messiah, the Saviour of Jews and Gentiles in the present eclectic
Church, and the restorer of Israel and Head of the world-wide kingdom,
literal and spiritual, ultimately. As Assyria was the hostile world
power in the former part, which refers to Isaiah's own time, so Babylon
is so in the latter part, which refers to a period long subsequent. The
connecting link, however, is furnished ([Isa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#006)) at the close of the former part.
The latter part was written in the old age of Isaiah, as appears from
the greater mellowness of style and tone which pervades it; it is less
fiery and more tender and gentle than the former part.
