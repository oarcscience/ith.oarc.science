### [Joshua Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 11:1</span></span>

DIVERS KINGS OVERCOME AT THE WATERS OF MEROM. ([Jos
11:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#001).md)

And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
things--The scene of the sacred narrative is here shifted to the north
of Canaan, where a still more extensive confederacy was formed among the
ruling powers to oppose the further progress of the Israelites. Jabin
("the Intelligent"), which seems to have been a hereditary title ([Jdg
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002).md), took the lead, from Hazor being
the capital of the northern region ([Jos
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#010).md). It was situated on the borders
of lake Merom. The other cities mentioned must have been in the vicinity
though their exact position is unknown.

[Joshua 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 11:2</span></span>

the kings that were on the north of the mountains--the Anti-libanus
district.

the plains south of Chinneroth--the northern part of the Arabah, or
valley of the Jordan.

the valley--the low and level country, including the plain of Sharon.

borders of Dor on the west--the highlands of Dor, reaching to the town
of Dor on the Mediterranean coast, below mount Carmel.

[Joshua 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 11:3</span></span>

the Canaanites on the east and on the west--a particular branch of the
Canaanitish population who occupied the western bank of the Jordan as
far northward as the Sea of Galilee, and also the coasts of the
Mediterranean Sea.

under Hermon--now Jebel-es-sheikh. It was the northern boundary of
Canaan on the east of the Jordan.

land of Mizpeh--now CÅ“lo-Syria.

[Joshua 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 11:4</span></span>

they went out, . . . as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in
multitude--The chiefs of these several tribes were summoned by Jabin,
being all probably tributary to the kingdom of Hazor. Their combined
forces, according to JOSEPHUS, amounted to three hundred thousand
infantry, ten thousand cavalry, and twenty thousand war chariots.

with horses and chariots very many--The war chariots were probably like
those of Egypt, made of wood, but nailed and tipped with iron. These
appear for the first time in the Canaanite war, to aid this last
determined struggle against the invaders; and "it was the use of these
which seems to have fixed the place of rendezvous by the lake Merom (now
Huleh), along whose level shores they could have full play for their
force." A host so formidable in numbers, as well as in military
equipments, was sure to alarm and dispirit the Israelites. Joshua,
therefore, was favored with a renewal of the divine promise of victory
([Jos 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006).md), and thus encouraged, he,
in the full confidence of faith, set out to face the enemy.

[Joshua 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 11:6</span></span>

to-morrow, about this time will I deliver them up all slain before
Israel--As it was impossible to have marched from Gilgal to Merom in one
day, we must suppose Joshua already moving northward and within a day's
distance of the Canaanite camp, when the Lord gave him this assurance of
success. With characteristic energy he made a sudden advance, probably
during the night, and fell upon them like a thunderbolt, when scattered
along the rising grounds (Septuagint), before they had time to rally on
the plain. In the sudden panic "the Lord delivered them into the hand of
Israel, who smote them, and chased them." The rout was complete; some
went westward, over the mountains, above the gorge of the Leontes, to
Sidon and Misrephothmaim ("glass-smelting houses"), in the neighborhood,
and others eastward to the plain of Mizpeh.

[Joshua 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jos 11:8</span></span>

they left none remaining--of those whom they overtook. All those who
fell into their hands alive were slain.

[Joshua 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 11:9</span></span>

Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him--(See [Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006).md). Houghing the horses is done by
cutting the sinews and arteries of their hinder legs, so that they not
only become hopelessly lame, but bleed to death. The reasons for this
special command were that the Lord designed to lead the Israelites to
trust in Him, not in military resources ([Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md); to show that in the land of
promise there was no use of horses; and, finally, to discourage their
travelling as they were to be an agricultural, not a trading, people.

[Joshua 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 11:11</span></span>

he burnt Hazor with fire--calmly and deliberately, doubtless, according
to divine direction.

[Joshua 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 11:13</span></span>

as for the cities that stood still in their strength--literally, "on
their heaps." It was a PhÅ“nician custom to build cities on heights,
natural or artificial \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Joshua 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 11:16</span></span>

So Joshua took all that land--Here follows a general view of the
conquest. The division of the country there into five parts; namely, the
hills, the land of Goshen, that is, a pastoral land near Gibeon ([Jos
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#041).md); the valley, the plains and the
mountains of Israel, i. e., Carmel, rests upon a diversity of
geographical positions, which is characteristic of the region.

[Joshua 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jos 11:17</span></span>

from the mount Halak--Hebrew, "the smooth mountain."

that goeth up to Seir--an irregular line of white naked hills, about
eighty feet high, and seven or eight geographical miles in length that
cross the whole Ghor, eight miles south of the Dead Sea, probably "the
ascent of Akrabbim" \[ROBINSON\].

unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon--the city or temple of the god of
destiny, in Baalbec.

[Joshua 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 11:23</span></span>

Joshua took the whole land--The battle of the take of Merom was to the
north what the battle of Beth-horon was to the south; more briefly told
and less complete in its consequences; but still the decisive conflict
by which the whole northern region of Canaan fell into the hands of
Israel \[STANLEY\].
