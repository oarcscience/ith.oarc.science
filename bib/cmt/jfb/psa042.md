of this Levitical family of singers accompanying David in exile, mourns
his absence from the sanctuary, a cause of grief aggravated by the
taunts of enemies, and is comforted in hopes of relief. This course of
thought is repeated with some variety of detail, but closing with the
same refrain. ([Psa 42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001).md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 42:3</span></span>

3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002.md); [Psa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 42:4</span></span>

The verbs are properly rendered as futures, "I will remember,"
&c.,--that is, the recollection of this season of distress will give
greater zest to the privileges of God's worship, when obtained.

[Psalms 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 42:5</span></span>

4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md); [Psa

therefore--that is, finding no comfort in myself, I turn to Thee, even
in this distant "land of Jordan and the (mountains) Hermon, the country

round about Jerusalem, perhaps denoted the contempt with which the place
of exile was regarded.

[Psalms 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 42:7</span></span>

The roar of successive billows, responding to that of floods of rain,
represented the heavy waves of sorrow which overwhelmed him.

[Psalms 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 42:8</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 42:9</span></span>
