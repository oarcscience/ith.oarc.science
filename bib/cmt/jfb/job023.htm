<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 23:2</A></FONT></span></p>JOB'S ANSWER. (Job 23:1-17)
<p>
<p>to-day--implying, perhaps, that the debate was carried on through more days than one (see Introduction). 
<p>
<p>bitter-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011">Job 7:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001">Job 10:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>my stroke--the hand of God on me (Margin, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#021">Job 19:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#004">Psa 32:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>heavier than--is so heavy that I cannot relieve myself adequately by groaning.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#003">Job 23:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 23:3</A></FONT></span></p>The same wish as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003">Job 13:3</A> (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019">Heb 10:19-22</A>). 
<p>
<p>Seat--The idea in the Hebrew is a well-prepared throne (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007">Psa 9:7</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#004">Job 23:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 23:4</A></FONT></span></p>order--state methodically (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018">Job 13:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026">Isa 43:26</A>). 
<p>
<p>fill, &amp;c.--I would have abundance of arguments to adduce.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 23:5</A></FONT></span></p>he--emphatic: it little matters what man may say of me, if only I know what God judges of me.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 23:6</A></FONT></span></p>An objection suggests itself, while he utters the wish (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#005">Job 23:5</A>). Do I hereby wish that He should plead against me with His omnipotence? Far from it! (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#019">Job 9:19</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#034">Job 9:34</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021">Job 13:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018">Job 30:18</A>). 
<p>
<p>strength--so as to prevail with Him: as in Jacob's case (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003">Hos 12:3-4</A>). UMBREIT and MAURER better translate as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#020">Job 4:20</A> (I only wish that He) "would attend to me," that is, give me a patient hearing as an ordinary judge, not using His omnipotence, but only His divine knowledge of my innocence.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007">Job 23:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 23:7</A></FONT></span></p>There--rather, "Then": if God would "attend" to me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</A>). 
<p>
<p>righteous--that is, the result of my dispute would be, He would acknowledge me as righteous. 
<p>
<p>delivered--from suspicion of guilt on the part of my Judge.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 23:8</A></FONT></span></p>But I wish in vain. For "behold," &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>forward . . . backward--rather, "to the east--to the west." The Hebrew geographers faced the east, that is, sunrise: not the north, as we do. So "before" means east: "behind," west (so the Hindus). Para, "before"--east: Apara, "behind"--west: Daschina, "the right hand"--south: Bama, "left"--north. A similar reference to sunrise appears in the name Asia, "sunrise," Europe, "sunset"; pure Babylonian names, as RAWLINSON shows.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#009">Job 23:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 23:9</A></FONT></span></p>Rather, "To the north." 
<p>
<p>work--God's glorious works are especially seen towards the north region of the sky by one in the northern hemisphere. The antithesis is between God working and yet not being beheld: as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#011">Job 9:11</A>, between "He goeth by," and "I see Him not." If the Hebrew bears it, the parallelism to the second clause is better suited by translating, as UMBREIT, "doth hide himself"; but then the antithesis to "behold" would be lost. 
<p>
<p>right hand--"in the south." 
<p>
<p>hideth--appropriately, of the unexplored south, then regarded as uninhabitable because of its heat (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029">Job 34:29</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010">Job 23:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 23:10</A></FONT></span></p>But--correcting himself for the wish that his cause should be known before God. The omniscient One already knoweth the way in me (my inward principles: His outward way or course of acts is mentioned in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</A>. So in me, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#021">Job 4:21</A>); though for some inscrutable cause He as yet hides Himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8-9</A>). 
<p>
<p>when--let Him only but try my cause, I shall, &amp;c.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#011">Job 23:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">job 23:11</A></FONT></span></p>held--fast by His steps. The law is in Old Testament poetry regarded as a way, God going before us as our guide, in whose footsteps we must tread (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005">Psa 17:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>declined-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005">Psa 125:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012">Job 23:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 23:12</A></FONT></span></p>esteemed--rather, "laid up," namely, as a treasure found (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#044">Mat 13:44</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011">Psa 119:11</A>); alluding to the words of Eliphaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022">Job 22:22</A>). There was no need to tell me so; I have done so already (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016">Jer 15:16</A>). 
<p>
<p>necessary--"Appointed portion" (of food; as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008">Pro 30:8</A>). UMBREIT and MAURER translate, "More than my law," my own will, in antithesis to "the words of His mouth" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038">Joh 6:38</A>). Probably under the general term, "what is appointed to me" (the same Hebrew is in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</A>), all that ministers to the appetites of the body and carnal will is included.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013">Job 23:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">job 23:13</A></FONT></span></p>in one mind--notwithstanding my innocence, He is unaltered in His purpose of proving me guilty (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#012">Job 9:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>soul--His will (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003">Psa 115:3</A>). God's sovereignty. He has one great purpose; nothing is haphazard; everything has its proper place with a view to His purpose.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">job 23:14</A></FONT></span></p>many such--He has yet many more such ills in store for me, though hidden in His breast (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#013">Job 10:13</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#015">Job 23:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">job 23:15</A></FONT></span></p>God's decrees, impossible to be resisted, and leaving us in the dark as to what may come next, are calculated to fill the mind with holy awe [BARNES].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016">Job 23:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">job 23:16</A></FONT></span></p>soft--faint; hath melted my courage. Here again Job's language is that of Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014">Psa 22:14</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017">Job 23:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">job 23:17</A></FONT></span></p>Because I was not taken away by death from the evil to come (literally, "from before the face of the darkness," <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001">Isa 57:1</A>). Alluding to the words of Eliphaz (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011">Job 22:11</A>), "darkness," that is, calamity. 
<p>
<p>cut off--rather, in the Arabic sense, brought to the land of silence; my sad complaint hushed in death [UMBREIT]. "Darkness" in the second clause, not the same Hebrew word as in the first, "cloud," "obscurity." Instead of "covering the cloud (of evil) from my face," He "covers" me with it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011">Job 22:11</A>).
