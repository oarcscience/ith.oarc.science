### [Jeremiah Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 47:1</span></span>

PROPHECY AGAINST THE PHILISTINES. ([Jer
47:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001).md)

Pharaoh-necho probably smote Gaza on his return after defeating Josiah
at Megiddo ([Ch2 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020).md) \[GROTIUS\].
Or, Pharaoh-hophra ([Jer 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005.md), [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007).md) is intended: probably on his
return from his fruitless attempt to save Jerusalem from the Chaldeans,
he smote Gaza in order that his expedition might not be thought
altogether in vain \[CALVIN\] ([Amo
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 47:2</span></span>

waters-- ([Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).md). The Chaldeans
from the north are compared to the overwhelming waters of their own
Euphrates. The smiting of Gaza was to be only the prelude of a greater
disaster to the Philistines. Nebuzara-dan was left by Nebuchadnezzar,
after he had taken Jerusalem, to subdue the rest of the adjoining cities
and country.

[Jeremiah 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 47:3</span></span>

(Compare [Jer 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029).md).

fathers . . . not look back to . . . children--Each shall think only of
his own safety, not even the fathers regarding their own children. So
desperate shall be the calamity that men shall divest themselves of the
natural affections.

for feebleness of hands--The hands, the principal instruments of action,
shall have lost all power; their whole hope shall be in their feet.

[Jeremiah 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 47:4</span></span>

every helper--The Philistines, being neighbors to the PhÅ“nicians of
Tyre and Sidon, would naturally make common cause with them in the case
of invasion. These cities would have no helper left when the Philistines
should be destroyed.

Caphtor--the Caphtorim and Philistines both came from Mizraim ([Gen
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013).md). The Philistines are said to
have been delivered by God from Caphtor ([Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md). Perhaps before the time of Moses
they dwelt near and were subjugated by the Caphtorim ([Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023).md) and subsequently delivered. "The
remnant" means here those still left after the Egyptians had attacked
Gaza and Palestine; or rather, those left of the Caphtorim after the
Chaldeans had attacked them previous to their attack on the Philistines.
Some identify Caphtor with Cappadocia; GESENIUS, with Crete ([Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016), Cherethims.md); KITTO, Cyprus.
Between Palestine and Idumea there was a city Caparorsa; and their close
connection with Palestine on the one hand, and Egypt (Mizraim, [Gen
10:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013).md) on the other hand, makes
this locality the most likely.

[Jeremiah 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 47:5</span></span>

Baldness . . . cut thyself--Palestine is represented as a female who has
torn off her hair and cut her flesh, the heathenish ([Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028).md) token of mourning ([Jer
48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037).md).

their valley--the long strip of low plain occupied by the Philistines
along the Mediterranean, west of the mountains of Judea. The Septuagint
reads Anakim, the remains of whom were settled in those regions ([Num
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#028).md). Joshua dislodged them so that
none were left but in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod ([Jos
11:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#021).md). But the parallel ([Jer
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007).md), "Ashkelon . . . the sea-shore,"
established English Version here, "Ashkelon . . . their valley."

[Jeremiah 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 47:6</span></span>

Jeremiah, in the person of the Philistines afflicting themselves ([Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005).md), apostrophizes the "sword of the
Lord," entreating mercy (compare [Deu
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md); [Eze
21:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003.md), [Eze
21:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009).md).

up thyself--Hebrew, "Gather thyself," that is, retire or return.

[Jeremiah 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 47:7</span></span>

Jeremiah, from addressing the sword in the second person, turns to his
hearers and speaks of it in the third person.

Lord . . . given it a charge-- ([Eze
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#017).md).

the sea-shore--the strip of land between the mountains and
Mediterranean, held by the Philistines: "their valley" (see on [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005).md).

there hath he appointed it-- ([Mic
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009).md). There hath He ordered it to
rage.

It had taken part with the Chaldeans against Judea ([Kg2
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002).md). Fulfilled by Nebuchadnezzar
five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, when also he attacked
Egypt ([Jer 43:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#008).md) and Ammon ([Jer
49:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001).md). \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities,
10:9,7\]. Jeremiah in this prophecy uses that of Isa. 15:1-16:14,
amplifying and adapting it to his purpose under inspiration, at the same
time confirming its divine authority. Isaiah, however, in his prophecy
refers to the devastation of Moab by the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser;
Jeremiah refers to that by Nebuchadnezzar.
