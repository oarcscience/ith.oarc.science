### [Philippians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

[Philippians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">phi 3:1</span></span>

WARNING AGAINST JUDAIZERS: HE HAS GREATER CAUSE THAN THEY TO TRUST IN
LEGAL RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT RENOUNCED IT FOR CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS, IN
WHICH HE PRESSES AFTER PERFECTION: WARNING AGAINST CARNAL PERSONS:
CONTRAST OF THE BELIEVER'S LIFE AND HOPE. (Phi. 3:1-21)

Finally--rather, not with the notion of time, but making a transition to
another general subject, "Furthermore" \[BENGEL and WAHL\] as in [Th1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001.md). Literally, "As to what remains,"
&c. It is often used at the conclusion of Epistles for "finally" ([Eph
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010.md); [Th2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001).md). But it is not restricted to this
meaning, as ALFORD thinks, supposing that Paul used it here intending to
close his Epistle, but was led by the mention of the Judaizers into a
more lengthened dissertation.

the same things--concerning "rejoicing," the prevailing feature in this
Epistle ([Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018.md), [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025.md); [Phi
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#017.md); [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md), where, compare the "again I say,"
with "the same things" here).

In the Lord--marks the true ground of joy, in contrast with "having
confidence in the flesh," or in any outward sensible matter of boasting
([Phi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).md).

not grievous--"not irksome."

for you it is safe--Spiritual joy is the best safety against error ([Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md); [Neh
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/neh008.htm#010), end.md).

[Philippians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">phi 3:2</span></span>

Beware--Greek, "Have your eye on" so as to beware of. Contrast "mark,"
or "observe," namely, so as to follow [Phi
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md).

dogs--Greek, "the dogs," namely, those impure persons "of whom I have
told you often" ([Phi 3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018).md); "the
abominable" (compare [Rev 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md), with
[Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md); [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md); [Tit
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md): "dogs" in filthiness,
unchastity, and snarling ([Deu 23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md);
[Psa 59:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#006.md), [Psa
59:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014.md); [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022).md): especially "enemies of the
cross of Christ" ([Phi 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md); [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016.md), [Psa
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020).md). The Jews regarded the Gentiles
as "dogs" ([Mat 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026).md); but by their
own unbelief they have ceased to be the true Israel, and are become
"dogs" (compare [Isa 56:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010).md).

evil workers-- ([Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013).md),
"deceitful workers." Not simply "evildoers" are meant, but men who
"worked," indeed, ostensibly for the Gospel, but worked for evil:
"serving not our Lord, but their own belly" ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md); compare [Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018).md). Translate, "The evil workmen,"
that is, bad teachers (compare [Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015).md).

concision--Circumcision had now lost its spiritual significance, and was
now become to those who rested on it as any ground of justification, a
senseless mutilation. Christians have the only true circumcision,
namely, that of the heart; legalists have only "concision," that is, the
cutting off of the flesh. To make "cuttings in the flesh" was expressly
prohibited by the law ([Lev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#005).md): it
was a Gentile-heathenish practice ([Kg1
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#028).md); yet this, writes Paul
indignantly, is what these legalists are virtually doing in violation of
the law. There is a remarkable gradation, says BIRKS \[HorÃ&brvbr;
ApostolicÃ&brvbr;\] in Paul's language as to circumcision. In his first
recorded discourse ([Act 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039).md),
circumcision is not named, but implied as included in the law of Moses
which cannot justify. Six or seven years later, in the Epistle to
Galatians ([Gal 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003).md), the first
Epistle in which it is named, its spiritual inefficiency is maintained
against those Gentiles who, beginning in the Spirit, thought to be
perfected in the flesh. Later, in Epistle to Romans ([Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028).md), he goes farther, and claims
the substance of it for every believer, assigning the shadow only of it
to the unbelieving Jew. In Epistle to Colossians ([Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011).md), still later, he expounds more
fully the true circumcision as the exclusive privilege of the believer.
Last of all here, the very name is denied to the legalist, and a term of
reproach is substituted, "concision," or flesh-cutting. Once obligatory
on all the covenant-people, then reduced to a mere national distinction,
it was more and more associated in the apostle's experience with the
open hostility of the Jews, and the perverse teaching of false brethren.

[Philippians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">phi 3:3</span></span>

"We are the (real) circumcision" ([Rom
2:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md); [Col
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011).md).

worship God in the Spirit--The oldest manuscripts read, "worship by the
Spirit of God"; our religious service is rendered by the Spirit ([Joh
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023).md). Legal worship was outward,
and consisted in outward acts, restricted to certain times and places.
Christian worship is spiritual, flowing from the inworkings of the Holy
Spirit, not relating to certain isolated acts, but embracing the whole
life ([Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).md). In the former, men
trusted in something human, whether descent from the theocratic nation,
or the righteousness of the law, or mortification of "the flesh"
("Having confidence," or "glorying in the flesh") \[NEANDER\] ([Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009).md).

rejoice in Christ Jesus--"make our boast in Christ Jesus," not in the
law: the ground of their boasting.

have no confidence in the flesh--but in the Spirit.

[Philippians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">phi 3:4</span></span>

"Although I (emphatical) might have confidence even in the flesh."
Literally, "I having," but not using, "confidence in the flesh."

I more--have more "whereof I might have confidence in the flesh."

[Philippians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">phi 3:5</span></span>

In three particulars he shows how he "might have confidence in the
flesh" ([Phi 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004)): (1.md) His pure Jewish
blood. (2) His legal preciseness and high status as such. (3) His zeal
for the law. The Greek is literally, "Being in circumcision an eighth
day person," that is, not one circumcised in later life as a proselyte,
but on the eighth day after birth, as the law directed in the case of
Jew-born infants.

of the tribe of Benjamin--son of Rachel, not of the maid-servant
\[BENGEL\].

Hebrew of the Hebrews--neither one or other parent being Gentile. The
"Hebrew," wherever he dwelt, retained the language of his fathers. Thus
Paul, though settled in Tarsus, a Greek city, calls himself a Hebrew. A
"Grecian" or Hellenist, on the other hand, in the New Testament, is the
term used for a "Greek-speaking" Jew \[TRENCH\].

touching the law--that is, as to legal status and strictness.

a Pharisee--"of the straitest sect" ([Act
26:5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005).md).

[Philippians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">phi 3:6</span></span>

Concerning--Translate as before and after, "As touching Zeal" (compare
[Act 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md); [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009).md).

blameless--Greek, "having become blameless" as to ceremonial
righteousness: having attained in the eyes of man blameless legal
perfection. As to the holiness before God, which is the inner and truest
spirit of the law, and which flows from "the righteousness of God by
faith," he on the contrary declares ([Phi
3:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012).md) that he has not attained
perfection.

[Philippians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">phi 3:7</span></span>

gain--rather as Greek, "gains"; including all possible advantages of
outward status, which he had heretofore enjoyed.

I counted--Greek, "I have counted for Christ's sake loss." He no longer
uses the plural as in "gains"; for he counts them all but one great
"loss" ([Mat 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md); [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025).md).

[Philippians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">phi 3:8</span></span>

Yea doubtless--The oldest manuscripts omit "doubtless" (Greek, "ge"):
translate, "nay more." Not only "have I counted" those things just
mentioned "loss for Christ's sake, but, moreover, I even DO count ALL
things but loss," &c.

for the excellency--Greek, "On account of the surpassing excellency (the
supereminence above them all) of the knowledge of Christ Jesus."

my Lord--believing and loving appropriation of Him ([Psa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md); [Joh
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#028).md).

for whom--"on account of whom."

I have suffered the loss--not merely I "counted" them "loss," but have
actually lost them.

all things--The Greek has the article, referring to the preceding "all
things"; "I have suffered the loss of them all."

dung--Greek, "refuse (such as excrements, dregs, dross) cast to the
dogs," as the derivation expresses. A "loss" is of something having
value; but "refuse" is thrown away as not worthy of being any more
touched or looked at.

win--Translate, to accord with the translation, [Phi
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md), "gain Christ." A man cannot make
other things his "gain" or chief confidence, and at the same time "gain
Christ." He who loses all things, and even himself, on account of
Christ, gains Christ: Christ is His, and He is Christ's ([Sol
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016.md); [Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md); [Luk
9:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023.md); [Co1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023).md).

[Philippians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">phi 3:9</span></span>

be found in him--"be found" at His coming again, living spiritually "in
Him" as the element of my life. Once lost, I have been "found," and I
hope to be perfectly "found" by Him ([Luk
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008).md).

own righteousness . . . of the law-- ([Phi
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md); [Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md), [Rom
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005).md). "Of," that is, from.

righteousness . . . of God by faith--Greek, "which is from God (resting)
upon faith." Paul was transported from legal bondage into Christian
freedom at once, and without any gradual transition. Hence, the bands of
Pharisaism were loosed instantaneously; and opposition to Pharisaic
Judaism took the place of opposition to the Gospel. Thus God's
providence fitly prepared him for the work of overthrowing all idea of
legal justification. "The righteousness of faith," in Paul's sense, is
the righteousness or perfect holiness of Christ appropriated by faith,
as the objective ground of confidence for the believer, and also as a
new subjective principle of life. Hence it includes the essence of a new
disposition, and may easily pass into the idea of sanctification, though
the two ideas are originally distinct. It is not any arbitrary act of
God, as if he treated as sinless a man persisting in sin, simply because
he believes in Christ; but the objective on the part of God corresponds
to the subjective on the part of man, namely, faith. The realization of
the archetype of holiness through Christ contains the pledge that this
shall be realized in all who are one with Him by faith, and are become
the organs of His Spirit. Its germ is imparted to them in believing
although the fruit of a life perfectly conformed to the Redeemer, can
only be gradually developed in this life \[NEANDER\].

[Philippians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">phi 3:10</span></span>

That I may know him--experimentally. The aim of the "righteousness" just
mentioned. This verse resumes, and more fully explains, "the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ" ([Phi
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008).md). To know HIM is more than merely
to know a doctrine about Him. Believers are brought not only to
redemption, but to the Redeemer Himself.

the power of his resurrection--assuring believers of their justification
([Rom 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Co1
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017).md), and raising them up
spiritually with Him, by virtue of their identification with Him in
this, as in all the acts of His redeeming work for us ([Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001).md). The power of the Divine Spirit,
which raised Him from literal death, is the same which raises believers
from spiritual death now ([Eph
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019).md), and shall raise their bodies
from literal death hereafter ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md).

the fellowship of his sufferings--by identification with Him in His
sufferings and death, by imputation; also, in actually bearing the cross
whatever is laid on us, after His example, and so "filling up that which
is behind of the afflictions of Christ" ([Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024).md); and in the will to bear aught
for His sake ([Mat 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#038.md); [Mat
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md); [Ti2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011).md). As He bore all our sufferings
([Isa 53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004).md), so we participate in His.

made conformable unto his death--"conformed to the likeness of His
death," namely, by continued sufferings for His sake, and mortifying of
the carnal self ([Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Co1
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031.md); [Co2
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020).md).

[Philippians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">phi 3:11</span></span>

If by any means--not implying uncertainty of the issue, but the
earnestness of the struggle of faith ([Co1
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026).md), and the urgent need of
jealous self-watchfulness ([Co1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012).md).

attain unto the resurrection of the dead--The oldest manuscripts read,
"the resurrection from (out of) the dead," namely, the first
resurrection; that of believers at Christ's coming ([Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md); [Th1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015.md); [Rev
20:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005).md). The Greek word occurs nowhere
else in the New Testament. "The power of Christ's resurrection" ([Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004).md), ensures the believer's
attainment of the "resurrection from the (rest of the) dead" (compare
[Phi 3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md). Compare "accounted
worthy to obtain the resurrection from the dead" ([Luk
20:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035).md). "The resurrection of the just"
([Luk 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014).md).

[Philippians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">phi 3:12</span></span>

Translate, "Not that I," &c. (I do not wish to be understood as saying
that, &c.).

attained--"obtained," namely, a perfect knowledge of Christ, and of the
power of His death, and fellowship of His sufferings, and a conformity
to His death.

either were already perfect--"or am already perfected," that is, crowned
with the garland of victory, my course completed, and perfection
absolutely reached. The image is that of a race course throughout. See
[Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md). See TRENCH \[Greek Synonyms of
the New Testament\].

I follow after--"I press on."

apprehend . . . apprehended--"If so be that I may lay hold on that
(namely, the prize, [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014).md) for
which also I was laid hold on by Christ" (namely, at my conversion, [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md).

Jesus--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Paul was close to
"apprehending" the prize ([Ti2 4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007).md).
Christ the Author, is also the Finisher of His people's "race."

[Philippians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">phi 3:13</span></span>

I--whatever others count as to themselves. He who counts himself
perfect, must deceive himself by calling sin infirmity ([Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).md); at the same time, each must aim
at perfection, to be a Christian at all ([Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048).md).

forgetting those things . . . behind--Looking back is sure to end in
going back ([Luk 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062).md): So Lot's wife
([Luk 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032).md). If in stemming a current
we cease pulling the oar against it, we are carried back. God's word to
us is as it was to Israel, "Speak unto the children of Israel that they
go forward" ([Exo 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#015).md). The Bible is
our landmark to show us whether we are progressing or retrograding.

reaching forth--with hand and foot, like a runner in a race, and the
body bent forward. The Christian is always humbled by the contrast
between what he is and what he desires to be. The eye reaches before and
draws on the hand, the hand reaches before and draws on the foot
\[BENGEL\].

unto--towards ([Heb 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#001).md).

[Philippians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">phi 3:14</span></span>

high calling--literally, "the calling that is above" ([Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001).md): "the heavenly calling" ([Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md). "The prize" is "the crown of
righteousness" ([Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md). [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md), "crown of life." [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004.md), "a crown of glory that fadeth not
away." "The high," or "heavenly calling," is not restricted, as ALFORD
thinks, to Paul's own calling as an apostle by the summons of God from
heaven; but the common calling of all Christians to salvation in Christ,
which coming from heaven invites us to heaven, whither accordingly our
minds ought to be uplifted.

[Philippians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">phi 3:15</span></span>

therefore--resuming [Phi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md). "As many
of us then, as are perfect," that is, full grown (no longer "babes") in
the Christian life ([Phi 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md),
"worshipping God in the Spirit, and having no confidence in the flesh"),
[Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), fully established in things
of God. Here, by "perfect," he means one fully fit for running
\[BENGEL\]; knowing and complying with the laws of the course ([Ti2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005).md). Though "perfect" in this sense,
he was not yet "made perfect" (Greek) in the sense intended in [Phi
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md), namely, "crowned with complete
victory," and having attained absolute perfection.

thus minded--having the mind which he had described, [Phi
3:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007.md).

otherwise minded--having too high an opinion of yourselves as to your
attainment of Christian perfection. "He who thinks that he has attained
everything, hath nothing" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Probably, too, he refers to
those who were tempted to think to attain to perfection by the law ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003).md): who needed the warning ([Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).md), "Beware of the concision,"
though on account of their former piety, Paul hopes confidently (as in
[Gal 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010).md) that God will reveal the
path of right-mindedness to them. Paul taught externally God "reveals"
the truth internally by His Spirit ([Mat
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025.md); [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md); [Co1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006).md).

unto you--who sincerely strive to do God's will ([Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md); [Eph

[Philippians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">phi 3:16</span></span>

The expectation of a new revelation is not to make you less careful in
walking according to whatever degree of knowledge of divine things and
perfection you have already attained. God makes further revelations to
those who walk up to the revelations they already have ([Hos
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#003).md).

rule, let us mind the same thing--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.
Perhaps partly inserted from [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md), and [Phi
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002.md). Translate then, "Whereunto we
have attained, let us walk on (a military term, march in order) in the
same (the measure of knowledge already attained)."

[Philippians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">phi 3:17</span></span>

followers--Greek, "imitators together."

of me--as I am an imitator of Christ ([Co1
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001).md): Imitate me no farther than as I
imitate Christ. Or as BENGEL "My fellow imitators of God" or "Christ";
"imitators of Christ together with me" (see on [Phi
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022.md); [Eph
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001).md).

mark--for imitation.

which walk so as ye have us for an ensample--In English Version of the
former clause, the translation of this clause is, "those who are walking
so as ye have an example in us." But in BENGEL'S translation, "inasmuch
as," or "since," instead of "as."

[Philippians 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">phi 3:18</span></span>

many walk--in such a manner. Follow not evildoers, because they are
"many" ([Exo 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002).md). Their numbers are
rather a presumption against their being Christ's "little flock" ([Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032).md).

often--There is need of constant warning.

weeping-- ([Rom 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002).md). A hard tone in
speaking of the inconsistencies of professors is the very opposite of
Paul's spirit, and David's ([Psa
119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136).md), and Jeremiah's ([Jer
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017).md). The Lord and His apostles, at
the same time, speak more strongly against empty professors (as the
Pharisees), than against open scoffers.

enemies of the cross of Christ--in their practice, not in doctrine ([Gal
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md); [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006.md); [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md).

[Philippians 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">phi 3:19</span></span>

destruction--everlasting at Christ's coming. [Phi
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#028.md), "perdition"; the opposite word
is "Saviour" ([Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020).md).

end--fixed doom.

whose god is their belly-- ([Rom
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018).md); hereafter to be destroyed by
God ([Co1 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013).md). In contrast to our
"body" ([Phi 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).md), which our God, the
Lord Jesus, shall "fashion like unto His glorious body." Their belly is
now pampered, our body now wasted; then the respective states of both
shall be reversed.

glory is in their shame--As "glory" is often used in the Old Testament
for God ([Psa 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020).md), so here it
answers to "whose God," in the parallel clause; and "shame" is the Old
Testament term contemptuously given to an idol ([Jdg
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032), Margin.md). [Hos
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md) seems to be referred to by Paul
(compare [Rom 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032).md). There seems no
allusion to circumcision, as no longer glorious, but a shame to them
([Phi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002).md). The reference of the
immediate context is to sensuality, and carnality in general.

mind earthly things-- ([Rom 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005).md). In
contrast to [Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Col
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002.md).

[Philippians 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">phi 3:20</span></span>

our conversation--rather, "our state" or "country"; our citizenship: our
life as citizens. We are but pilgrims on earth; how then should we "mind
earthly things?" ([Phi 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md); [Heb
11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009.md), [Heb
11:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013).md). Roman citizenship was then
highly prized; how much more should the heavenly citizenship ([Act
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028.md); compare [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020).md)?

is--Greek, "has its existence."

in heaven--Greek, "in the heavens."

look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ--"We wait for (so the same
Greek is translated, [Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019).md) the
Lord Jesus as a (that is, in the capacity of a) Saviour" ([Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). That He is "the Lord," now
exalted above every name, assures our expectation ([Phi
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009).md). Our High Priest is gone up
into the Holy of Holies not made with hands, there to atone for us; and
as the Israelites stood outside the tabernacle, expecting Aaron's return
(compare [Luk 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#021).md), so must we look
unto the heavens expecting Christ thence.

[Philippians 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">phi 3:21</span></span>

Greek, "Who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation (namely, in
which our humiliation has place, [Co2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010.md); [Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019.md); [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012).md), that it may be conformed unto
the body of His glory (namely, in which His glory is manifested),
according to the effectual working whereby," &c. Not only shall He come
as our "Saviour," but also as our Glorifier.

even--not only to make the body like His own, but "to subdue all
things," even death itself, as well as Satan and sin. He gave a sample
of the coming transfiguration on the mount ([Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001), &c..md). Not a change of identity,
but of fashion or form ([Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md);
[Co1 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051).md). Our spiritual
resurrection now is the pledge of our bodily resurrection to glory
hereafter ([Phi 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020.md); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011).md). As Christ's glorified body was
essentially identical with His body of humiliation; so our resurrection
bodies as believers, since they shall be like His, shall be identical
essentially with our present bodies, and yet "spiritual bodies" ([Co1
15:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042).md). Our "hope" is, that Christ,
by His rising from the dead, hath obtained the power, and is become the
pattern, of our resurrection ([Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md).
