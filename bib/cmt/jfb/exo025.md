### [Exodus Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001)

[Exodus 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 25:1</span></span>

CONCERNING AN OFFERING. (Exo. 25:1-40)

the Lord spake unto Moses, &c.--The business that chiefly occupied Moses
on the mount, whatever other disclosures were made to him there, was in
receiving directions about the tabernacle, and they are here recorded as
given to him.

[Exodus 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 25:2</span></span>

bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly, &c.--Having
declared allegiance to God as their sovereign, they were expected to
contribute to His state, as other subjects to their kings; and the
"offering" required of them was not to be imposed as a tax, but to come
from their own loyal and liberal feelings.

[Exodus 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 25:3</span></span>

this is the offering which ye shall take of them--the articles of which
the offerings should consist.

brass--rather copper, brass being a composite metal.

[Exodus 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 25:4</span></span>

goats' hair--or leather of goats' skin.

[Exodus 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 25:5</span></span>

badgers' skins--The badger was an unclean animal, and is not a native of
the East--rather some kind of fish, of the leather of which sandals are
made in the East. \[See on [Exo 39:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#034)
and [Eze 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#010).\]

shittim wood--or Shittah ([Isa 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019)),
the acacia, a shrub which grows plentifully in the deserts of Arabia,
yielding a light, strong, and beautiful wood, in long planks.

[Exodus 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 25:7</span></span>

ephod--a square cloak, hanging down from the shoulders, and worn by
priests.

[Exodus 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 25:8</span></span>

a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them--In one sense the tabernacle
was to be a palace, the royal residence of the King of Israel, in which
He was to dwell among His people, receive their petitions, and issue His
responses. But it was also to be a place of worship, in which God was to
record His name and to enshrine the mystic symbols of His presence.

[Exodus 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 25:9</span></span>

According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the
tabernacle--The proposed erection could be, in the circumstances of the
Israelites, not of a fixed and stable but of a temporary and movable
description, capable of being carried about with them in their various
sojournings. It was made after "the pattern" shown to Moses, by which is
now generally understood, not that it was an unheard-of novelty, or an
entirely original structure, for it is ascertained to have borne
resemblance in form and arrangements to the style of an Egyptian temple,
but that it was so altered, modified, and purified from all idolatrous
associations, as to be appropriated to right objects, and suggestive of
ideas connected with the true God and His worship.

[Exodus 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 25:10</span></span>

an ark--a coffer or chest, overlaid with gold, the dimensions of which,
taking the cubit at eighteen inches, are computed to be three feet nine
inches in length, two feet three inches in breadth.

[Exodus 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 25:11</span></span>

a crown--a rim or cornice.

[Exodus 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 25:12</span></span>

rings--staples for the poles, with which it was to be carried from place
to place.

[Exodus 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 25:15</span></span>

staves shall be in the rings of the ark--that is, always remain in the
rings, whether the ark be at rest or in motion.

[Exodus 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">exo 25:16</span></span>

the testimony--that is, the two tables of stone, containing the ten
commandments, and called "the testimony," because by it God did testify
His sovereign authority over Israel as His people, His selection of them
as the guardians of His will and worship, and His displeasure in the
event of their transgressing His laws; while on their part, by receiving
and depositing this law in its appointed place, they testified their
acknowledgment of God's right to rule over them, and their submission to
the authority of His law. The superb and elaborate style of the ark that
contained "the testimony" was emblematic of the great treasure it held;
in other words, the incomparable value and excellence of the Word of
God, while its being placed in this chest further showed the great care
which God has ever taken for preserving it.

[Exodus 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">exo 25:17</span></span>

thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold--to serve as a lid, covering
it exactly. It was "the propitiatory cover," as the term may be
rendered, denoting that Christ, our great propitiation \[[Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002); [Jo1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)\], has fully answered all the
demands of the law, covers our transgressions, and comes between us and
the curse of a violated law.

[Exodus 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 25:18</span></span>

two cherubim--The real meaning of these figures, as well as the shape or
form of them, is not known with certainty--probably similar to what was
afterwards introduced into the temple, and described in [Eze
10:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008). They stretched out their
wings, and their faces were turned towards the mercy seat \[[Exo
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#020)\], probably in a bowing
attitude. The prevailing opinion now is, that those splendid figures
were symbolical not of angelic but of earthly and human beings--the
members of the Church of God interested in the dispensation of grace,
the redeemed in every age--and that these hieroglyphic forms symbolized
the qualities of the true people of God--courage, patience,
intelligence, and activity.

[Exodus 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 25:22</span></span>

there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the
mercy seat--The Shekinah, or symbol of the Divine Presence, rested on
the mercy seat, and was indicated by a cloud, from the midst of which
responses were audibly given when God was consulted on behalf of His
people. Hence God is described as "dwelling" or "sitting" between the
cherubim.

[Exodus 25:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 25:23</span></span>

table of shittim wood--of the same material and decorations as the ark
\[see on [Exo 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#005)\], and like it,
too, furnished with rings for the poles on which it was carried \[[Exo
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#026)\]. The staves, however, were
taken out of it when stationary, in order not to encumber the priests
while engaged in their services at the table. It was half a cubit less
than the ark in length and breadth, but of the same height. \[See on
[Exo 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#010).\]

[Exodus 25:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">exo 25:24</span></span>

crown--the moulding or ornamental rim, which is thought to have been
raised above the level of the table, to prevent anything from falling
off.

[Exodus 25:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">exo 25:29</span></span>

dishes--broad platters.

spoons--cups or concave vessels, used for holding incense.

covers--both for bread and incense.

bowls--cups; for though no mention is made of wine, libations were
undoubtedly made to God, according to JOSEPHUS and the rabbins, once a
week, when the bread was changed.

to cover withal--rather, "to pour out withal."

[Exodus 25:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 25:30</span></span>

showbread--literally, presence bread, so called because it was
constantly exhibited before the Lord, or because the bread of His
presence, like the angel of His presence, pointed symbolically to
Christ. It consisted of twelve unleavened loaves, said traditionally to
have been laid in piles of six each. This bread was designed to be a
symbol of the full and never-failing provision which is made in the
Church for the spiritual sustenance and refreshment of God's people.

[Exodus 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">exo 25:31</span></span>

candlestick--literally, "a lamp bearer." It was so constructed as to be
capable of being taken to pieces for facility in removal. The shaft or
stock rested on a pedestal. It had seven branches, shaped like reeds or
canes--three on each side, with one in the center--and worked out into
knobs, flowers, and bowls, placed alternately \[[Exo
25:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#032)\]. The figure represented on
the arch of Titus gives the best idea of this candlestick.

[Exodus 25:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">exo 25:33</span></span>

knops--old spelling for "knobs"--bosses.

[Exodus 25:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 25:37</span></span>

they shall light the lamps . . . that they may give light--The light was
derived from pure olive oil, and probably kept continually burning
(compare [Exo 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#007); [Lev
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#002)).

[Exodus 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">exo 25:38</span></span>

tongs--snuffers.

[Exodus 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">exo 25:39</span></span>

a talent of pure gold--in weight equivalent to 125 lbs. troy.

[Exodus 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">exo 25:40</span></span>

look that thou make them after their pattern--This caution, which is
repeated with no small frequency in other parts of the narrative, is an
evidence of the deep interest taken by the Divine King in the erection
of His palace or sanctuary; and it is impossible to account for the
circumstance of God's condescending to such minute details, except on
the assumption that this tabernacle was to be of a typical character,
and eminently subservient to the religious instruction and benefit of
mankind, by shadowing forth in its leading features the grand truths of
the Christian Church.
