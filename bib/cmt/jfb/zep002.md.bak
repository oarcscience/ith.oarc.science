### [Zephaniah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 2:1</span></span>

EXHORTATION TO REPENT BEFORE THE CHALDEAN INVADERS COME. DOOM OF JUDAH'S
FOES, THE PHILISTINES, MOAB, AMMON, WITH THEIR IDOLS, AND ETHIOPIA AND
ASSYRIA. ([Zep 2:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001).md)

Gather yourselves--to a religious assembly, to avert the judgment by
prayers ([Joe 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016).md) \[GROTIUS\]. Or,
so as not to be dissipated "as chaff" ([Zep
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002).md). The Hebrew is akin to a root
meaning "chaff." Self-confidence and corrupt desires are the dissipation
from which they are exhorted to gather themselves \[CALVIN\]. The foe
otherwise, like the wind, will scatter you "as the chaff." Repentance is
the gathering of themselves meant.

nation not desired--(Compare [Ch2
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#020).md), that is, not desirable;
unworthy of the grace or favor of God; and yet God so magnifies that
grace as to be still solicitous for their safety, though they had
destroyed themselves and forfeited all claims on His grace \[CALVIN\].
The Margin from Chaldee Version has, "not desirous," namely of returning
to God. MAURER and GESENIUS translate, "Not waxing pale," that is, dead
to shame. English Version is best.

[Zephaniah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zep 2:2</span></span>

Before the decree bring forth--that is, Before God's decree against you
announced by me (Zep. 1:1-18) have its fulfilment. As the embryo lies
hid in the womb, and then emerges to light in its own due time, so
though God for a time hides His vengeance, yet He brings it forth at the
proper season.

before the day pass as the chaff--that is, before the day for repentance
pass, and with it you, the ungodly, pass away as the chaff ([Job
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#018.md); [Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004).md). MAURER puts it parenthetically,
"the day (that is, time) passes as the chaff (that is, most quickly)."
CALVIN, "before the decree bring forth" (the predicted vengeance),
(then) the chaff (the Jews) shall pass in a day, that is, in a moment,
though they thought that it would be long before they could be
overthrown. English Version is best; the latter clause being explanatory
of the former, and so the before being understood, not expressed.

[Zephaniah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 2:3</span></span>

As in [Zep 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md) (compare Note, see on
[Zep 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012).md) he had warned the hardened
among the people to humble themselves, so now he admonishes "the meek"
to proceed in their right course, that so they may escape the general
calamity ([Psa 76:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#009).md). The meek bow
themselves under God's chastisements to God's will, whereas the ungodly
become only the more hardened by them.

Seek ye the Lord--in contrast to those that "sought not the Lord" ([Zep
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#006).md). The meek are not to regard what
the multitudes do, but seek God at once.

his judgment--that is, law. The true way of "seeking the Lord" is to
"work judgment," not merely to be zealous about outward ordinances.

seek meekness--not perversely murmuring against God's dealings, but
patiently submitting to them, and composedly waiting for deliverance.

it may be ye shall be hid-- ([Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md); [Amo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006).md). This phrase does not imply doubt
of the deliverance of the godly, but expresses the difficulty of it, as
well that the ungodly may see the certainty of their doom, as also that
the faithful may value the more the grace of God in their case ([Pe1
4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017).md) \[CALVIN\]. Compare [Kg2
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012.md).

[Zephaniah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 2:4</span></span>

For--He makes the punishment awaiting the neighboring states an argument
why the ungodly should repent ([Zep
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001).md) and the godly persevere, namely,
that so they may escape from the general calamity.

Gaza shall be forsaken--In the Hebrew there is a play of similar sounds,
Gaza Gazubah; Gaza shall be forsaken, as its name implies. So the Hebrew
of the next clause, Ekron teeakeer.

at the noonday--when on account of the heat Orientals usually sleep, and
military operations are suspended ([Sa2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#005).md). Hence an attack at noon implies
one sudden and unexpected ([Jer 6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md);
[Jer 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).md).

Ekron--Four cities of the Philistines are mentioned, whereas five was
the normal number of their leading cities. Gath is omitted, being at
this time under the Jews' dominion. David had subjugated it ([Ch1
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#001).md). Under Joram the Philistines
almost regained it ([Ch2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016).md), but
Uzziah ([Ch2 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006).md) and Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008).md) having conquered them, it
remained under the Jews. [Amo 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#006.md);
[Zac 9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#005.md); [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md), similarly mention only four
cities of the Philistines.

[Zephaniah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 2:5</span></span>

inhabitants of the seacoast--the Philistines dwelling on the strip of
seacoast southwest of Canaan. Literally, the "cord" or "line" of sea
(compare [Jer 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#007.md); [Eze
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#016).md).

the Cherethites--the Cretans, a name applied to the Philistines as
sprung from Crete ([Deu 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md); [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md); [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md). Philistine means "an emigrant."

Canaan . . . land of the Philistines--They occupied the southwest of
Canaan ([Jos 13:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002).md); a name which
hints that they are doomed to the same destruction as the early
occupants of the land.

[Zephaniah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zep 2:6</span></span>

dwellings and cottages for shepherds--rather, "dwellings with cisterns"
(that is, water-tanks dug in the earth) for shepherds. Instead of a
thick population and tillage, the region shall become a pasturage for
nomad shepherds' flocks. The Hebrew for "dug cisterns," Ceroth, seems a
play on sounds, alluding to their name Cherethites ([Zep
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#005).md): Their land shall become what
their national name implies, a land of cisterns. MAURER translates,
"Feasts for shepherds' (flocks)," that is, one wide pasturage.

[Zephaniah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 2:7</span></span>

remnant of . . . Judah--those of the Jews who shall be left after the
coming calamity, and who shall return from exile.

feed thereupon--namely, in the pastures of that seacoast region ([Zep
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006).md).

visit--in mercy ([Exo 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#031).md).

[Zephaniah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 2:8</span></span>

I have heard--A seasonable consolation to Judah when wantonly assailed
by Moab and Ammon with impunity: God saith, "I have heard it all, though
I might seem to men not to have observed it because I did not
immediately inflict punishment."

magnified themselves--acted haughtily, invading the territory of Judah
([Jer 48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md); [Jer
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001.md); compare [Zep
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010.md); [Psa
35:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#026.md); [Oba
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012).md).

[Zephaniah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 2:9</span></span>

the breeding of nettles--or, the overspreading of nettles, that is, a
place overrun with them.

salt pits--found at the south of the Dead Sea. The water overflows in
the spring, and salt is left by the evaporation. Salt land is barren
([Jdg 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045.md); [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034), Margin.md).

possess them--that is, their land; in retribution for their having
occupied Judah's land.

[Zephaniah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 2:10</span></span>

(Compare [Zep 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008).md).

their pride--in antithesis to the meek ([Zep
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#003).md).

[Zephaniah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 2:11</span></span>

famish--bring low by taking from the idols their former fame; as beasts
are famished by their food being withheld. Also by destroying the
kingdoms under the tutelage of idols ([Psa
96:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#004.md); [Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md).

gods of the earth--who have their existence only on earth, not in heaven
as the true God.

every one from his place--each in his own Gentile home, taught by the
Jews in the true religion: not in Jerusalem alone shall men worship God,
but everywhere ([Psa 68:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029.md); [Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md); [Joh
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md); [Ti1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008).md). It does not mean, as in [Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Mic
4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md); [Zac
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022.md); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md) that they shall come from their
several places to Jerusalem to worship \[MAURER\].

all . . . isles of . . . heathen--that is, all the maritime regions,
especially the west, now being fulfilled in the gathering in of the
Gentiles to Messiah.

[Zephaniah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zep 2:12</span></span>

Fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar (God's sword, [Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md) conquered Egypt, with which
Ethiopia was closely connected as its ally ([Jer
46:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md); [Eze
30:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005).md).

Ye--literally, "They." The third person expresses estrangement; while
doomed before God's tribunal in the second person, they are spoken of in
the third as aliens from God.

[Zephaniah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zep 2:13</span></span>

Here he passes suddenly to the north. Nineveh was destroyed by Cyaxares
and Nabopolassar, 625 B.C. The Scythian hordes, by an inroad into Media
and thence in the southwest of Asia (thought by many to be the forces
described by Zephaniah, as the invaders of Judea, rather than the
Chaldeans), for a while interrupted Cyaxares' operations; but he finally
succeeded. Arbaces and Belesis previously subverted the Assyrian empire
under Sardanapalus (that is, Pul?),877 B.C.

[Zephaniah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 2:14</span></span>

flocks--of sheep; answering to "beasts" in the parallel clause. Wide
pastures for sheep and haunts for wild beasts shall be where once there
was a teeming population (compare [Zep
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#006).md). MAURER, needlessly for the
parallelism, makes it "flocks of savage animals."

beasts of the nations--that is, beasts of the earth ([Gen
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024).md). Not as ROSENMULLER, "all kinds
of beasts that form a nation," that is, gregarious beasts ([Pro
30:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025).md).

cormorant--rather, the "pelican" (so [Psa
102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md); [Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011), Margin.md).

bittern-- ([Isa 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023).md). MAURER
translates, "the hedgehog"; HENDERSON, "the porcupine."

upper lintels--rather, "the capitals of her columns," namely, in her
temples and palaces \[MAURER\]. Or, "on the pomegranate-like knops at
the tops of the houses" \[GROTIUS\].

their voice shall sing in the windows--The desert-frequenting birds'
"voice in the windows" implies desolation reigning in the upper parts of
the palaces, answering to "desolation . . . in the thresholds," that is,
in the lower.

he shall uncover the cedar work--laying the cedar wainscoting on the
walls, and beams of the ceiling, bare to wind and rain, the roof being
torn off, and the windows and doors broken through. All this is designed
as a consolation to the Jews that they may bear their calamities
patiently, knowing that God will avenge them.

[Zephaniah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 2:15</span></span>

Nothing then seemed more improbable than that the capital of so vast an
empire, a city sixty miles in compass, with walls one hundred feet high,
and so thick that three chariots could go abreast on them, and with
fifteen hundred towers, should be so totally destroyed that its site is
with difficulty discovered. Yet so it is, as the prophet foretold.

there is none beside me--This peculiar phrase, expressing
self-gratulation as if peerless, is plainly adopted from [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md). The later prophets, when the
spirit of prophecy was on the verge of departing, leaned more on the
predictions of their predecessors.

hiss--in astonishment at a desolation so great and sudden ([Kg1
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008).md); also in derision ([Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023.md); [Lam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015.md); [Eze
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#036).md).
