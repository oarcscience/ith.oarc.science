### [Isaiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001)

[Isaiah 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 16:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY AS TO MOAB. ([Isa
16:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001))

lamb--advice of the prophet to the Moabites who had fled southwards to
Idumea, to send to the king of Judah the tribute of lambs, which they
had formerly paid to Israel, but which they had given up ([Kg2
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#004)). David probably imposed this
tribute before the severance of Judah and Israel ([Sa2
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#002)). Therefore Moab is recommended to
gain the favor and protection of Judah, by paying it to the Jewish king.
Type of the need of submitting to Messiah ([Psa
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001)).

from Sela to--rather, "from Petra through (literally, 'towards') the
wilderness" \[MAURER\]. "Sela" means "a rock," Petra in Greek; the
capital of Idumea and Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a; the dwellings are mostly
hewn out of the rock. The country around was a vast common
("wilderness") or open pasturage, to which the Moabites had fled on the
invasion from the west ([Isa 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007)).

ruler of the land--namely, of Idumea, that is, the king of Judah;
Amaziah had become master of Idumea and Sela ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 16:2</span></span>

cast out of . . . nest--rather, "as a brood cast out" (in apposition
with "a wandering bird," or rather, wandering birds), namely, a brood
just fledged and expelled from the nest in which they were hatched
\[HORSLEY\]. Compare [Isa 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#014); [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).

daughters of Moab--that is, the inhabitants of Moab. So [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021); [Psa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011); [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011); [Lam
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022) \[MAURER\].

at the fords--trying to cross the boundary river of Moab, in order to
escape out of the land. EWALD and MAURER make "fords" a poetical
expression for "the dwellers on Arnon," answering to the parallel clause
of the same sense, "daughters of Moab."

[Isaiah 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 16:3</span></span>

GESENIUS, MAURER, &c., regard these verses as an address of the fugitive
Moabites to the Jews for protection; they translate [Isa
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004), "Let mine outcasts of Moab dwell
with thee, Judah"; the protection will be refused by the Jews, for the
pride of Moab ([Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)). VITRINGA
makes it an additional advice to Moab, besides paying tribute. Give
shelter to the Jewish outcasts who take refuge in thy land ([Isa
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#003)); so "mercy" will be shown thee
in turn by whatever king sits on the "throne" of "David" ([Isa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005)). Isaiah foresees that Moab will
be too proud to pay the tribute, or conciliate Judah by sheltering its
outcasts ([Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)); therefore
judgment shall be executed. However, as Moab just before is represented
as itself an outcast in Idumea, it seems incongruous that it should be
called on to shelter Jewish outcasts. So that it seems rather to
foretell the ruined state of Moab when its people should beg the Jews
for shelter, but be refused for their pride.

make . . . shadow as . . . night . . . in . . . noonday--emblem of a
thick shelter from the glaring noonday heat ([Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)).

bewray . . . wandereth--Betray not the fugitive to his pursuer.

[Isaiah 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 16:4</span></span>

Rather, "Let the outcasts of Moab dwell with thee" (Judah) \[HORSLEY\].

for the extortioner, &c.--The Assyrian oppressor probably.

is at an end--By the time that Moab begs Judah for shelter, Judah shall
be in a condition to afford it, for the Assyrian oppressor shall have
been "consumed out of the land."

[Isaiah 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 16:5</span></span>

If Judah shelters the suppliant Moab, allowing him to remain in Idumea,
a blessing will redound to Judah itself and its "throne."

truth . . . judgment . . . righteousness--language so divinely framed as
to apply to "the latter days" under King Messiah, when "the Lord shall
bring again the captivity of Moab" ([Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002); [Psa
96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013); [Psa
98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009); [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012)).

hasting--"prompt in executing."

[Isaiah 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 16:6</span></span>

We--Jews. We reject Moab's supplication for his pride.

lies--false boasts.

not be so--rather, "not right"; shall prove vain ([Isa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010); [Jer
48:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029); [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008)). "It shall not be so; his lies
shall not so effect it."

[Isaiah 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 16:7</span></span>

Therefore--all hope of being allowed shelter by the Jews being cut off.

foundations--that is, "ruins"; because, when houses are pulled down, the
"foundations" alone are left ([Isa
58:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#012)). Jeremiah, in the parallel
place ([Jer 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#031)), renders it "men,"
who are the moral foundations or stay of a city.

Kirhareseth--literally, "a citadel of brick."

surely they are stricken--rather, joined with "mourn"; "Ye shall mourn
utterly stricken" \[MAURER and HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 16:8</span></span>

fields--vine-fields ([Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032)).

vine of Sibmah--near Heshbon: namely, languishes.

lords of . . . heathen--The heathen princes, the Assyrians, &c., who
invaded Moab, destroyed his vines. So Jeremiah in the parallel place
([Jer 48:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032)). MAURER thinks the
following words require rather the rendering, "Its (the vine of Sibmah)
shoots (the wines got from them) overpowered (by its generous flavor and
potency) the lords of the nations" ([Gen
49:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011), [Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022)).

come . . . Jazer--They (the vine shoots) reached even to Jazer, fifteen
miles from Heshbon.

wandered--They overran in wild luxuriance the wilderness of Arabia,
encompassing Moab.

the sea--the Dead Sea; or else some lake near Jazer now dry; in [Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032) called "the sea of Jazer"; but
see on [Jer 48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032) ([Psa
80:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 16:9</span></span>

I--will bewail for its desolation, though I belong to another nation
(see on [Isa 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005)).

with . . . weeping of Jazer--as Jazer weeps.

shouting for . . . fallen--rather, "Upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
luxuriant vines the shouting (the battle shout, instead of the joyous
shout of the grape-gatherers, usual at the vintage) is fallen" ([Isa
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010); [Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030); [Jer
51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014)). In the parallel passage ([Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032)) the words substantially express
the same sense. "The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits."

[Isaiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 16:10</span></span>

gladness--such as is felt in gathering a rich harvest. There shall be no
harvest or vintage owing to the desolation; therefore no "gladness."

[Isaiah 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 16:11</span></span>

bowels--in Scripture the seat of yearning compassion. It means the
inward seat of emotion, the heart, &c. ([Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015); compare [Isa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005); [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036)).

sound . . . harp--as its strings vibrate when beaten with the plectrum
or hand.

[Isaiah 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 16:12</span></span>

when it is seen that--rather, "When Moab shall have appeared (before his
gods; compare [Exo 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015)), when he is
weary (that is, when he shall have fatigued himself with observing
burdensome rites; [Kg1 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026), &c.), on
the high place (compare [Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002)),
and shall come to his sanctuary (of the idol Chemosh on Mount Nebo) to
pray, he shall not prevail"; he shall effect nothing by his prayers
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 16:13</span></span>

since that time--rather, "respecting that time" \[HORSLEY\]. BARNES
translates it, "formerly" in contrast to "but now" ([Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014)): heretofore former prophecies
([Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015); [Num
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029)) have been given as to Moab, of
which Isaiah has given the substance: but now a definite and steady time
also is fixed.

[Isaiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 16:14</span></span>

three years . . . hireling--Just as a hireling has his fixed term of
engagement, which neither he nor his master will allow to be added to or
to be taken from, so the limit within which Moab is to fall is
unalterably fixed ([Isa 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016)).
Fulfilled about the time when the Assyrians led Israel into captivity.
The ruins of Elealeh, Heshbon, Medeba, Dibon, &c., still exist to
confirm the inspiration of Scripture. The accurate particularity of
specification of the places three thousand years ago, confirmed by
modern research, is a strong testimony to the truth of prophecy.

Already, Tiglath-pileser had carried away the people of Damascus to Kir,
in the fourth year of Ahaz ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009)); but now in Hezekiah's reign a
further overthrow is foretold ([Jer
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#023); [Zac
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#001)). Also, Shalmaneser carried away
Israel from Samaria to Assyria ([Kg2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006); [Kg2
18:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010)) in the sixth year of
Hezekiah of Judah (the ninth year of Hoshea of Israel). This prophecy
was, doubtless, given previously in the first years of Hezekiah when the
foreign nations came into nearer collision with Judah, owing to the
threatening aspect of Assyria.
