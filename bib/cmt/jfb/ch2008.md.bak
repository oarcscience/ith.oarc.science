[2 Chronicles 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#002.md)

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS. ([Ch2 8:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#001).md)

cities which Huram had restored . . . Solomon built them, &c.--These
cities lay in the northwest of Galilee. Though included within the
limits of the promised land, they had never been conquered. The right of
occupying them Solomon granted to Huram, who, after consideration,
refused them as unsuitable to the commercial habits of his subjects (see
on [Kg1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011).md). Solomon, having wrested
them from the possession of the Canaanite inhabitants, repaired them and
filled them with a colony of Hebrews.

[2 Chronicles 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#003.md)

And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah--Hamath was on the Orontes, in
CÅ“le-Syria. Its king, Toi, had been the ally of David; but from the
combination, Hamath and Zobah, it would appear that some revolution had
taken place which led to the union of these two petty kingdoms of Syria
into one. For what cause the resentment of Solomon was provoked against
it, we are not informed, but he sent an armed force which reduced it. He
made himself master also of Tadmor, the famous Palmyra in the same
region. Various other cities along the frontiers of his extended
dominions he repaired and fitted up, either to serve as store-places for
the furtherance of his commercial enterprises, or to secure his kingdom
from foreign invasion (see on [Ch2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#014.md); [Kg1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#015).md).

THE CANAANITES MADE TRIBUTARIES. ([Ch2
8:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#007).md)

all the people that were left, &c.--The descendants of the Canaanites
who remained in the country were treated as war prisoners, being obliged
to "pay tribute or to serve as galley slaves" ([Ch2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#018).md), while the Israelites were
employed in no works but such as were of an honorable character.

[2 Chronicles 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#010.md)

two hundred and fifty that bare rule--(Compare [Kg1
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#023).md). It is generally agreed that the
text of one of these passages is corrupt.

[2 Chronicles 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 8:11</span></span>

Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto
the house that he had built for her--On his marriage with the Egyptian
princess at the beginning of his reign, he assigned her a temporary
abode in the city of David, that is, Jerusalem, until a suitable palace
for his wife had been erected. While that palace was in progress, he
himself lodged in the palace of David, but he did not allow her to
occupy it, because he felt that she being a heathen proselyte, and
having brought from her own country an establishment of heathen
maid-servants, there would have been an impropriety in her being
domiciled in a mansion which was or had been hallowed by the reception
of the ark. It seems she was received on her arrival into his mother's
abode ([Sol 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#004.md); [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).md).

SOLOMON'S FESTIVAL SACRIFICES. ([Ch2
8:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#015).md)

they departed not from the commandment of the king--that is, David, in
any of his ordinances, which by divine authority he established.

unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the
treasures--either in regulating the courses of the priests and Levites,
or in the destination of his accumulated treasures to the construction
and adornment of the temple.

[2 Chronicles 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 8:17</span></span>

Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth--These two maritime ports
were situated at the eastern gulf of the Red Sea, now called the Gulf of
Akaba. Eloth is seen in the modern Akaba, Ezion-geber in El Gudyan
\[ROBINSON\]. Solomon, determined to cultivate the arts of peace, was
sagacious enough to perceive that his kingdom could become great and
glorious only by encouraging a spirit of commercial enterprise among his
subjects; and, accordingly, with that in mind he made a contract with
Huram for ships and seamen to instruct his people in navigation.

[2 Chronicles 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 8:18</span></span>

Huram sent him . . . ships--either sent him ship-men, able seamen,
overland; or, taking the word "sent" in a looser sense, supplied him,
that is, built him ships--namely, in docks at Eloth (compare [Kg1
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#026).md). This navy of Solomon was
manned by Tyrians, for Solomon had no seamen capable of performing
distant expeditions. The Hebrew fishermen, whose boats plied on the Sea
of Tiberias or coasted the shores of the Mediterranean, were not equal
to the conducting of large vessels laden with valuable cargoes on long
voyages and through the wide and unfrequented ocean.

four hundred and fifty talents of gold--(Compare [Kg1
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#028).md). The text in one of these
passages is corrupt.
