### [1 Corinthians Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 11:1</span></span>

CENSURE ON DISORDERS IN THEIR ASSEMBLIES: THEIR WOMEN NOT BEING VEILED,
AND ABUSES AT THE LOVE-FEASTS. (1Co. 11:1-34)

Rather belonging to the end of the tenth chapter, than to this chapter.

followers--Greek, "imitators."

of Christ--who did not please Himself ([Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003).md); but gave Himself, at the cost
of laying aside His divine glory, and dying as man, for us ([Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Phi
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#004).md). We are to follow Christ first,
and earthly teachers only so far as they follow Christ.

[1 Corinthians 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 11:2</span></span>

Here the chapter ought to begin.

ye remember me in all things--in your general practice, though in the
particular instances which follow ye fail.

ordinances--Greek, "traditions," that is, apostolic directions given by
word of mouth or in writing ([Co1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md); [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md); [Th2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015).md). The reference here is mainly to
ceremonies: for in [Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md), as to
the LORD'S SUPPER, which is not a mere ceremony, he says, not merely, "I
delivered unto you," but also, "I received of the Lord"; here he says
only, "I delivered to you." Romanists argue hence for oral traditions.
But the difficulty is to know what is a genuine apostolic tradition
intended for all ages. Any that can be proved to be such ought to be
observed; any that cannot, ought to be rejected ([Rev
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#018).md). Those preserved in the written
word alone can be proved to be such.

[1 Corinthians 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 11:3</span></span>

The Corinthian women, on the ground of the abolition of distinction of
sexes in Christ, claimed equality with the male sex, and, overstepping
the bounds of propriety, came forward to pray and prophesy without the
customary head-covering of females. The Gospel, doubtless, did raise
women from the degradation in which they had been sunk, especially in
the East. Yet, while on a level with males as to the offer of, and
standing in grace ([Gal 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028).md), their
subjection in point of order, modesty, and seemliness, is to be
maintained. Paul reproves here their unseemliness as to dress: in [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md), as to the retiring modesty in
public which becomes them. He grounds his reproof here on the subjection
of woman to man in the order of creation.

the head--an appropriate expression, when he is about to treat of
woman's appropriate headdress in public.

of every man . . . Christ-- ([Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023).md).

of . . . woman . . . man-- ([Co1 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#008.md);
[Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md); [Ti1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md); [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md), [Pe1
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#005).md).

head of Christ is God-- ([Co1 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md);
[Co1 15:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027.md); [Luk
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md), [Luk
3:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#038.md); [Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md); [Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017.md); [Eph
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009).md). "Jesus, therefore, must be of
the same essence as God: for, since the man is the head of the woman,
and since the head is of the same essence as the body, and God is the
head of the Son, it follows the Son is of the same essence as the
Father" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. "The woman is of the essence of the man, and not
made by the man; so, too, the Son is not made by the Father, but of the
essence of the Father" \[THEODORET, t. 3, p. 171\].

[1 Corinthians 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 11:4</span></span>

praying--in public ([Co1 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#017).md).

prophesying--preaching in the Spirit ([Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010).md).

having--that is, if he were to have: a supposed case to illustrate the
impropriety in the woman's case. It was the Greek custom (and so that at
Corinth) for men in worship to be uncovered; whereas the Jews wore the
Talith, or veil, to show reverence before God, and their unworthiness to
look on Him ([Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md); however,
MAIMONIDES \[Mishna\] excepts cases where (as in Greece) the custom of
the place was different.

dishonoureth his head--not as ALFORD, "Christ" ([Co1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003).md); but literally, as "his head" is
used in the beginning of the verse. He dishonoreth his head (the
principal part of the body) by wearing a covering or veil, which is a
mark of subjection, and which makes him look downwards instead of
upwards to his Spiritual Head, Christ, to whom alone he owes subjection.
Why, then, ought not man to wear the covering in token of his subjection
to Christ, as the woman wears it in token of her subjection to man?
"Because Christ is not seen: the man is seen; so the covering of him who
is under Christ is not seen; of her who is under the man, is seen"
\[BENGEL\]. (Compare [Co1 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 11:5</span></span>

woman . . . prayeth . . . prophesieth--This instance of women speaking
in public worship is an extraordinary case, and justified only by the
miraculous gifts which such women possessed as their credentials; for
instance, Anna the prophetess and Priscilla (so [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018).md). The ordinary rule to them is:
silence in public ([Co1 14:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md); [Ti1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011).md). Mental receptivity and
activity in family life are recognized in Christianity, as most
accordant with the destiny of woman. This passage does not necessarily
sanction women speaking in public, even though possessing miraculous
gifts; but simply records what took place at Corinth, without expressing
an opinion on it, reserving the censure of it till [Co1
14:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md). Even those women endowed
with prophecy were designed to exercise their gift, rather in other
times and places, than the public congregation.

dishonoureth . . . head--in that she acts against the divine ordinance
and the modest propriety that becomes her: in putting away the veil, she
puts away the badge of her subjection to man, which is her true "honor";
for through him it connects her with Christ, the head of the man.
Moreover, as the head-covering was the emblem of maiden modesty before
man ([Gen 24:65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065).md), and conjugal
chastity ([Gen 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#016).md); so, to uncover
the head indicated withdrawal from the power of the husband, whence a
suspected wife had her head uncovered by the priest ([Num
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#018).md). ALFORD takes "her head" to be
man, her symbolical, not her literal head; but as it is literal in the
former clause, it must be so in the latter one.

all one as if . . . shaven--As woman's hair is given her by nature, as
her covering ([Co1 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#015).md), to cut it
off like a man, all admit, would be indecorous: therefore, to put away
the head-covering, too, like a man, would be similarly indecorous. It is
natural to her to have long hair for her covering: she ought, therefore,
to add the other (the wearing of a head-covering) to show that she does
of her own will that which nature itself teaches she ought to do, in
token of her subjection to man.

[1 Corinthians 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 11:6</span></span>

A woman would not like to be "shorn" or (what is worse) "shaven"; but if
she chooses to be uncovered (unveiled) in front, let her be so also
behind, that is, "shorn."

a shame--an unbecoming thing (compare [Co1
11:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#013).md). Thus the shaving of nuns is
"a shame."

[1 Corinthians 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 11:7</span></span>

Argument, also, from man's more immediate relation to God, and the
woman's to man.

he is . . . image . . . glory of God--being created in God's "image,"
first and directly: the woman, subsequently, and indirectly, through the
mediation of man. Man is the representative of God's "glory" this ideal
of man being realized most fully in the Son of man ([Psa
8:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004.md); compare [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023).md). Man is declared in Scripture to
be both the "image," and in the "likeness," of God (compare [Jam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#009).md). But "image" alone is applied to
the Son of God ([Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); compare
[Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md). "Express image," Greek,
"the impress." The Divine Son is not merely "like" God, He is God of
God, "being of one substance (essence) with the Father." \[Nicene
Creed\].

woman . . . glory of . . . man--He does not say, also, "the image of the
man." For the sexes differ: moreover, the woman is created in the image
of God, as well as the man ([Gen
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026).md). But as the moon in relation
to the sun ([Gen 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009).md), so woman
shines not so much with light direct from God, as with light derived
from man, that is, in her order in creation; not that she does not in
grace come individually into direct communion with God; but even here
much of her knowledge is mediately given her through man, on whom she is
naturally dependent.

[1 Corinthians 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 11:8</span></span>

is of . . . of--takes his being from ("out of") . . . from: referring to
woman's original creation, "taken out of man" (compare [Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023).md). The woman was made by God
mediately through the man, who was, as it were, a veil or medium placed
between her and God, and therefore, should wear the veil or
head-covering in public worship, in acknowledgement of this
subordination to man in the order of creation. The man being made
immediately by God as His glory, has no veil between himself and God
\[FABER STAPULENSIS in BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 11:9</span></span>

Neither--rather, "For also"; Another argument: The immediate object of
woman's creation. "The man was not created for the sake of the woman;
but the woman for the sake of the man" ([Gen
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md), [Gen
2:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021).md). Just as the Church, the
bride, is made for Christ; and yet in both the natural and the spiritual
creations, the bride, while made for the bridegroom, in fulfilling that
end, attains her own true "glory," and brings "shame" and "dishonor" on
herself by any departure from it ([Co1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#004.md), [Co1
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#006).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 11:10</span></span>

power on her head--the kerchief: French couvre chef, head-covering, the
emblem of "power on her head"; the sign of her being under man's power,
and exercising delegated authority under him. Paul had before his mind
the root-connection between the Hebrew terms for "veil" (radid), and
"subjection" (radad).

because of the angels--who are present at our Christian assemblies
(compare [Psa 138:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md), "gods," that is,
angels), and delight in the orderly subordination of the several ranks
of God's worshippers in their respective places, the outward demeanor
and dress of the latter being indicative of that inward humility which
angels know to be most pleasing to their common Lord ([Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Ecc
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#006).md). HAMMOND quotes CHRYSOSTOM, "Thou
standest with angels; thou singest with them; thou hymnest with them;
and yet dost thou stand laughing?" BENGEL explains, "As the angels are
in relation to God, so the woman is in relation to man. God's face is
uncovered; angels in His presence are veiled ([Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md). Man's face is uncovered; woman
in His presence is to be veiled. For her not to be so, would, by its
indecorousness, offend the angels ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010.md), [Mat
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#031).md). She, by her weakness,
especially needs their ministry; she ought, therefore, to be the more
careful not to offend them."

[1 Corinthians 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 11:11</span></span>

Yet neither sex is insulated and independent of the other in the
Christian life \[ALFORD\]. The one needs the other in the sexual
relation; and in respect to Christ ("in the Lord"), the man and the
woman together (for neither can be dispensed with) realize the ideal of
redeemed humanity represented by the bride, the Church.

[1 Corinthians 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 11:12</span></span>

As the woman was formed out of (from) the man, even so is man born by
means of woman; but all things (including both man and woman) are from
God as their source ([Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md); [Co2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#018).md). They depend mutually each on
the other, and both on him.

[1 Corinthians 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 11:13</span></span>

Appeal to their own sense of decorum.

a woman . . . unto God--By rejecting the emblem of subjection (the
head-covering), she passes at one leap in praying publicly beyond both
the man and angels \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 11:14</span></span>

The fact that nature has provided woman, and not man, with long hair,
proves that man was designed to be uncovered, and woman covered. The
Nazarite, however, wore long hair lawfully, as being part of a vow
sanctioned by God ([Num 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#005).md). Compare
as to Absalom, [Sa2 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#026.md), and [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md).

[1 Corinthians 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 11:15</span></span>

her hair . . . for a covering--Not that she does not need additional
covering. Nay, her long hair shows she ought to cover her head as much
as possible. The will ought to accord with nature \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 11:16</span></span>

A summary close to the argument by appeal to the universal custom of the
churches.

if any . . . seem--The Greek also means "thinks" (fit) (compare [Mat
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009).md). If any man chooses (still after
all my arguments) to be contentious. If any be contentious and thinks
himself right in being so. A reproof of the Corinthians'
self-sufficiency and disputatiousness ([Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020).md).

we--apostles: or we of the Jewish nation, from whom ye have received the
Gospel, and whose usages in all that is good ye ought to follow: Jewish
women veiled themselves when in public, according to TERTULLIAN
\[ESTIUS\]. The former explanation is best, as the Jews are not referred
to in the context: but he often refers to himself and his fellow
apostles, by the expression, "we--us" ([Co1
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009).md).

no such custom--as that of women praying uncovered. Not as CHRYSOSTOM,
"that of being contentious." The Greek term implies a usage, rather than
a mental habit ([Joh 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#039).md). The usage
of true "churches (plural: not, as Rome uses it, 'the Church,' as an
abstract entity; but 'the churches,' as a number of independent
witnesses) of God" (the churches which God Himself recognizes), is a
valid argument in the case of external rites, especially, negatively,
for example, Such rites were not received among them, therefore, ought
not to be admitted among us: but in questions of doctrine, or the
essentials of worship, the argument is not valid \[SCLATER\] ([Co1
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#017.md); [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033).md).

neither--nor yet. Catholic usage is not an infallible test of truth, but
a general test of decency.

[1 Corinthians 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 11:17</span></span>

in this--which follows.

I declare--rather, "I enjoin"; as the Greek is always so used. The
oldest manuscripts read literally "This I enjoin (you) not praising
(you)."

that--inasmuch as; in that you, &c. Here he qualifies his praise ([Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002).md). "I said that I praised you for
keeping the ordinances delivered to you; but I must now give injunction
in the name of the Lord, on a matter in which I praise you not; namely,
as to the Lord's Supper ([Co1 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md);
[Co1 14:37](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#037).md).

not for the better--not so as to progress to what is better.

for the worse--so as to retrograde to what is worse. The result of such
"coming together" must be "condemnation" ([Co1
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#034).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 11:18</span></span>

first of all--In the first place. The "divisions" (Greek, "schisms")
meant, are not merely those of opinion ([Co1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010).md), but in outward acts at the
love-feasts (AgapÃ&brvbr;), ([Co1
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021).md). He does not follow up the
expression, "in the first place," by "in the second place." But though
not expressed, a second abuse was in his mind when he said, "In the
first place," namely, THE ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, which also created
disorder in their assemblies \[ALFORD\], ([Co1
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md); [Co1
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#023.md), [Co1
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026.md), [Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033.md), [Co1
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040).md).

in the church--not the place of worship; for ISIDORE OF PELUSIUM denies
that there were such places specially set apart for worship in the
apostles' times \[Epistle, 246.2\]. But, "in the assembly" or
"congregation"; in convocation for worship, where especially love,
order, and harmony should prevail. The very ordinance instituted for
uniting together believers in one body, was made an occasion of
"divisions" (schisms).

partly--He hereby excepts the innocent. "I am unwilling to believe all I
hear, but some I cannot help believing" \[ALFORD\]: while my love is
unaffected by it \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 11:19</span></span>

heresies--Not merely "schisms" or "divisions" ([Co1
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018).md), which are "recent dissensions
of the congregation through differences of opinion" \[AUGUSTINE, Con.
Crescon. Don. 2.7, quoted by TRENCH, Greek Synonyms of the New
Testament\], but also "heresies," that is, "schisms which have now
become inveterate"; "Sects" \[CAMPBELL, vol. 2, pp. 126, 127\]: so [Act
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#017.md); [Act
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#005.md) translate the same Greek. At
present there were dissensions at the love-feasts; but Paul, remembering
Jesus' words ([Mat 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007.md); [Mat
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010.md), [Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012.md); [Luk
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001)) foresees "there must be (come.md)
also" matured separations, and established parties in secession, as
separatists. The "must be" arises from sin in professors necessarily
bearing its natural fruits: these are overruled by God to the probation
of character of both the godly and the ungodly, and to the discipline of
the former for glory. "Heresies" had not yet its technical sense
ecclesiastically, referring to doctrinal errors: it means confirmed
schisms. ST. AUGUSTINE'S rule is a golden rule as regards questions of
heresy and catholicity: "In doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials,
unity; in all things, charity."

that . . . approved may be made manifest--through the disapproved
(reprobates) becoming manifested ([Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035.md); [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 11:20</span></span>

When . . . therefore--Resuming the thread of discourse from [Co1
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018.md).

this is not to--rather, "there is no such thing as eating the LORD'S
Supper"; it is not possible where each is greedily intent only on
devouring "HIS OWN supper," and some are excluded altogether, not having
been waited for ([Co1 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#033).md), where
some are "drunken," while others are "hungry" ([Co1
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021).md). The love-feast usually
preceded the Lord's Supper (as eating the Passover came before the
Lord's Supper at the first institution of the latter). It was a
club-feast, where each brought his portion, and the rich, extra portions
for the poor; from it the bread and wine were taken for the Eucharist;
and it was at it that the excesses took place, which made a true
celebration of the Lord's Supper during or after it, with true
discernment of its solemnity, out of the question.

[1 Corinthians 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 11:21</span></span>

one taketh before other--the rich "before" the poor, who had no supper
of their own. Instead of "tarrying for one another" ([Co1
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#033).md); hence the precept ([Co1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#021.md), [Co1
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#025).md).

his own supper--"His own" belly is his God ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md); "the Lord's Supper," the
spiritual feast, never enters his thoughts.

drunken--The one has more than is good for him, the other less
\[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 11:22</span></span>

What!--Greek, "For."

houses--(compare [Co1 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#034).md) --"at
home." That is the place to satiate the appetite, not the assembly of
the brethren \[ALFORD\].

despise ye the church of God--the congregation mostly composed of the
poor, whom "God hath chosen," however ye show contempt for them ([Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md); compare "of God" here, marking
the true honor of the Church.

shame them that have not--namely, houses to eat and drink in, and who,
therefore, ought to have received their portion at the love-feasts from
their wealthier brethren.

I praise you not--resuming the words ([Co1
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#017).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 11:23</span></span>

His object is to show the unworthiness of such conduct from the dignity
of the holy supper.

I--Emphatic in the Greek. It is not my own invention, but the Lord's
institution.

received of the Lord--by immediate revelation ([Gal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#012.md); compare [Act
22:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md); [Co2
12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#001).md). The renewal of the
institution of the Lord's Supper by special revelation to Paul enhances
its solemnity. The similarity between Luke's and Paul's account of the
institution, favors the supposition that the former drew his information
from the apostle, whose companion in travel he was. Thus, the undesigned
coincidence is a proof of genuineness.

night--the time fixed for the Passover ([Exo
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006).md): though the time for the Lord's
Supper is not fixed.

betrayed--With the traitor at the table, and death present before His
eyes, He left this ordinance as His last gift to us, to commemorate His
death. Though about to receive such an injury from man, He gave this
pledge of His amazing love to man.

[1 Corinthians 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 11:24</span></span>

brake--The breaking of the bread involves its distribution and reproves
the Corinthian mode at the love-feast, of "every one taking before other
his own supper."

my body . . . broken for you--"given" ([Luk
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019).md) for you (Greek, "in your
behalf"), and "broken," so as to be distributed among you. The oldest
manuscripts omit "broken," leaving it to be supplied from "brake." The
two old versions, Memphitic and Thebaic, read from Luke, "given." The
literal "body" could not have been meant; for Christ was still sensibly
present among His disciples when He said, "This is My body." They could
only have understood Him symbolically and analogically: As this bread is
to your bodily health, so My body is to the spiritual health of the
believing communicant. The words, "Take, eat," are not in the oldest
manuscripts.

in remembrance of me--(See on [Co1
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">co1 11:25</span></span>

when he had supped--Greek, "after the eating of supper," namely, the
Passover supper which preceded the Lord's Supper, as the love-feast did
subsequently. Therefore, you Corinthians ought to separate common meals
from the Lord's Supper \[BENGEL\].

the new testament--or "covenant." The cup is the parchment-deed, as it
were, on which My new covenant, or last will is written and sealed,
making over to you all blessings here and hereafter.

in my blood--ratified by MY blood: "not by the blood of goats and
calves" ([Heb 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md).

as oft as--Greek, "as many times soever": implying that it is an
ordinance often to be partaken of.

in remembrance of me--Luke ([Luk
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#019).md) expresses this, which is
understood by Matthew and Mark. Paul twice records it ([Co1
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024) and here.md) as suiting his
purpose. The old sacrifices brought sins continually to remembrance
([Heb 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md), [Heb
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003).md). The Lord's Supper brings to
remembrance Christ and His sacrifice once for all for the full and final
remission of sins.

[1 Corinthians 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 11:26</span></span>

For--in proof that the Lord's Supper is "in remembrance" of Him.

show--announce publicly. The Greek does not mean to dramatically
represent, but "ye publicly profess each of you, the Lord has died FOR
ME" \[WAHL\]. This word, as "is" in Christ's institution ([Co1
11:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#024).md), implies not literal
presence, but a vivid realization, by faith, of Christ in the Lord's
Supper, as a living person, not a mere abstract dogma, "bone of our
bone, and flesh of our flesh" ([Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md); compare [Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023).md); and ourselves "members of His
body, of His flesh, and of His bones," "our sinful bodies made clean by
His body (once for all offered), and our souls washed through His most
precious blood" \[Church of England Prayer Book\]. "Show," or
"announce," is an expression applicable to new things; compare "show" as
to the Passover ([Exo 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#008).md). So the
Lord's death ought always to be fresh in our memory; compare in heaven,
[Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md). That the Lord's Supper is in
remembrance of Him, implies that He is bodily absent, though spiritually
present, for we cannot be said to commemorate one absent. The fact that
we not only show the Lord's death in the supper, but eat and drink the
pledges of it, could only be understood by the Jews, accustomed to such
feasts after propitiatory sacrifices, as implying our personal
appropriation therein of the benefits of that death.

till he come--when there shall be no longer need of symbols of His body,
the body itself being manifested. The Greek expresses the certainly of
His coming. Rome teaches that we eat Christ present corporally, "till He
come" corporally; a contradiction in terms. The showbread, literally,
"bread of the presence," was in the sanctuary, but not in the Holiest
Place ([Heb 9:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001).md); so the Lord's
Supper in heaven, the antitype to the Holiest Place, shall be superseded
by Christ's own bodily presence; then the wine shall be drunk "anew" in
the Father's kingdom, by Christ and His people together, of which
heavenly banquet, the Lord's Supper is a spiritual foretaste and
specimen ([Mat 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029).md). Meantime, as
the showbread was placed anew, every sabbath, on the table before the
Lord ([Lev 24:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#005).md); so the Lord's
death was shown, or announced afresh at the Lord's table the first day
of every week in the primitive Church. We are now "priests unto God" in
the dispensation of Christ's spiritual presence, antitypical to the HOLY
PLACE: the perfect and eternal dispensation, which shall not begin till
Christ's coming, is antitypical to the HOLIEST PLACE, which Christ our
High Priest alone in the flesh as yet has entered ([Heb
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#006).md); but which, at His coming, we,
too, who are believers, shall enter ([Rev
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#015.md); [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md). The supper joins the two
closing periods of the Old and the New dispensations. The first and
second comings are considered as one coming, whence the expression is
not "return," but "come" (compare, however, [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 11:27</span></span>

eat and drink--So one of the oldest manuscripts reads. But three or four
equally old manuscripts, the Vulgate and CYPRIAN, read, "or." Romanists
quote this reading in favor of communion in one kind. This consequence
does not follow. Paul says, "Whosoever is guilty of unworthy conduct,
either in eating the bread, or in drinking the cup, is guilty of the
body and blood of Christ." Impropriety in only one of the two elements,
vitiates true communion in both. Therefore, in the end of the verse, he
says, not "body or blood," but "body and blood." Any who takes the bread
without the wine, or the wine without the bread, "unworthily"
communicates, and so "is guilty of Christ's body and blood"; for he
disobeys Christ's express command to partake of both. If we do not
partake of the sacramental symbol of the Lord's death worthily, we share
in the guilt of that death. (Compare "crucify to themselves the Son of
God afresh," [Heb 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006).md). Unworthiness
in the person, is not what ought to exclude any, but unworthily
communicating: However unworthy we be, if we examine ourselves so as to
find that we penitently believe in Christ's Gospel, we may worthily
communicate.

[1 Corinthians 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">co1 11:28</span></span>

examine--Greek, "prove" or "test" his own state of mind in respect to
Christ's death, and his capability of "discerning the Lord's body" ([Co1
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md), [Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031).md). Not auricular confession to a
priest, but self-examination is necessary.

so--after due self-examination.

of . . . of--In [Co1 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#027.md), where the
receiving was unworthily, the expression was, "eat this bread, drink . .
. cup" without "of." Here the "of" implies due circumspection in
communicating \[BENGEL\].

let him eat--His self-examination is not in order that he may stay away,
but that he may eat, that is, communicate.

[1 Corinthians 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">co1 11:29</span></span>

damnation--A mistranslation which has put a stumbling-block in the way
of many in respect to communicating. The right translation is
"judgment." The judgment is described ([Co1
11:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030).md) as temporal.

not discerning--not duty judging: not distinguishing in judgment (so the
Greek: the sin and its punishment thus being marked as corresponding)
from common food, the sacramental pledges of the Lord's body. Most of
the oldest manuscripts omit "Lord's" (see [Co1
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#027).md). Omitting also "unworthily,"
with most of the oldest manuscripts, we must translate, "He that eateth
and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, IF he discern not
the body" ([Heb 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md). The Church is
"the body of Christ" ([Co1 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027).md). The
Lord's body is His literal body appreciated and discerned by the soul in
the faithful receiving, and not present in the elements themselves.

[1 Corinthians 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">co1 11:30</span></span>

weak . . . sickly--He is "weak" who has naturally no strength: "sickly,"
who has lost his strength by disease \[TITTMANN, Greek Synonyms of the
New Testament\].

sleep--are being lulled in death: not a violent death; but one the
result of sickness, sent as the Lord's chastening for the individual's
salvation, the mind being brought to a right state on the sick bed ([Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">co1 11:31</span></span>

if we would judge ourselves--Most of the oldest manuscripts, read "But,"
not "For." Translate also literally "If we duly judged ourselves, we
should not be (or not have been) judged," that is, we should escape (or
have escaped) our present judgments. In order to duly judge or "discern
\[appreciate\] the Lord's body," we need to "duly judge ourselves." A
prescient warning against the dogma of priestly absolution after full
confession, as the necessary preliminary to receiving the Lord's Supper.

[1 Corinthians 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">co1 11:32</span></span>

chastened-- ([Rev 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#019).md).

with the world--who, being bastards, are without chastening ([Heb
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#008).md).

[1 Corinthians 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">co1 11:33</span></span>

tarry one for another--In contrast to [Co1
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021.md). The expression is not, "Give a
share to one another," for all the viands brought to the feast were
common property, and, therefore, they should "tarry" till all were met
to partake together of the common feast of fellowship \[THEOPHYLACT\].

[1 Corinthians 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">co1 11:34</span></span>

if any . . . hunger--so as not to be able to "tarry for others," let him
take off the edge of his hunger at home \[ALFORD\] ([Co1
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#022).md).

the rest--"the other questions you asked me as to the due celebration of
the Lord's Supper." Not other questions in general; for he does
subsequently set in order other general questions in this Epistle.
