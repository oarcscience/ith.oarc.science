JUDGES is the title given to the next book, from its containing the
history of those non-regal rulers who governed the Hebrews from the time
of Joshua to that of Eli, and whose functions in time of peace consisted
chiefly in the administration of justice, although they occasionally led
the people in their wars against their public enemies. The date and
authorship of this book are not precisely known. It is certain, however,
that it preceded the Second Book of Samuel (compare [Jdg
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#035.md) with [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021).md), as well as the conquest of
Jerusalem by David (compare [Jdg 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021.md)
with [Sa2 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006).md). Its author was in all
probability Samuel, the last of the judges (see [Jdg
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#001.md); [Jdg
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#025).md), and the date of the first part
of it is fixed in the reign of Saul, while the five chapters at the
close might not have been written till after David's establishment as
king in Israel (see [Jdg 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#031).md). It is
a fragmentary history, being a collection of important facts and signal
deliverances at different times and in various parts of the land, during
the intermediate period of three hundred years between Joshua and the
establishment of the monarchy. The inspired character of this book is
confirmed by allusions to it in many passages of Scripture (compare [Jdg
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#002.md); [Jdg
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#014.md) with [Sa1
12:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#009.md); [Jdg
9:53](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#053.md) with [Sa2
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#021.md); [Jdg
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025.md) with [Psa
83:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#011.md); compare [Jdg
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#004.md) with [Psa
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md); [Jdg
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md); [Jdg
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#017.md) with [Mat
2:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#013.md); [Act
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#020.md); [Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).md).
