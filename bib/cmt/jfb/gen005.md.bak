### [Genesis Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 5:1</span></span>

GENEALOGY OF THE PATRIARCHS. (Gen. 5:1-32)

book of the generations--(See [Gen
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004).md).

Adam--used here either as the name of the first man, or of the human
race generally.

[Genesis 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#005.md)

all the days . . . Adam lived--The most striking feature in this
catalogue is the longevity of Adam and his immediate descendants. Ten
are enumerated (Gen. 5:5-32) in direct succession whose lives far exceed
the ordinary limits with which we are familiar--the shortest being three
hundred sixty-five, \[[Gen 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#023.md)\] and
the longest nine hundred sixty-nine years \[[Gen
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#027.md)\]. It is useless to inquire
whether and what secondary causes may have contributed to this
protracted longevity--vigorous constitutions, the nature of their diet,
the temperature and salubrity of the climate; or, finally--as this list
comprises only the true worshippers of God--whether their great age
might be owing to the better government of their passions and the quiet,
even tenor of their lives. Since we cannot obtain satisfactory evidence
on these points, it is wise to resolve the fact into the sovereign will
of God. We can, however, trace some of the important uses to which, in
the early economy of Providence, it was subservient. It was the chief
means of reserving a knowledge of God, of the great truths of religion,
as well as the influence of genuine piety. So that, as their knowledge
was obtained by tradition, they would be in a condition to preserve it
in the greatest purity.

[Genesis 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 5:21</span></span>

Enoch . . . begat Methuselah--This name signifies, "He dieth, and the
sending forth," so that Enoch gave it as prophetical of the flood. It is
computed that Methuselah died in the year of that catastrophe.

[Genesis 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 5:24</span></span>

And Enoch walked with God--a common phrase in Eastern countries denoting
constant and familiar intercourse.

was not; for God took him--In [Heb
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md), we are informed that he was
translated to heaven--a mighty miracle, designed to effect what ordinary
means of instruction had failed to accomplish, gave a palpable proof to
an age of almost universal unbelief that the doctrines which he had
taught ([Jde 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md) were true and
that his devotedness to the cause of God and righteousness in the midst
of opposition was highly pleasing to the mind of God.

[Genesis 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 5:26</span></span>

Lamech--a different person from the one mentioned in the preceding
chapter \[[Gen 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#018.md)\]. Like his
namesake, however, he also spoke in numbers on occasion of the birth of
Noah--that is, "rest" or "comfort" \[[Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029.md), Margin\]. "The allusion is,
undoubtedly, to the penal consequences of the fall in earthly toils and
sufferings, and to the hope of a Deliverer, excited by the promise made
to Eve. That this expectation was founded on a divine communication we
infer from the importance attached to it and the confidence of its
expression" \[PETER SMITH\].

[Genesis 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">gen 5:32</span></span>

Noah was five hundred years old: and . . . begat--That he and the other
patriarchs were advanced in life before children were born to them is a
difficulty accounted for probably from the circumstance that Moses does
not here record their first-born sons, but only the succession from Adam
through Seth to Abraham.
