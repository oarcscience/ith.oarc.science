### [Jeremiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 2:2</span></span>

EXPOSTULATION WITH THE JEWS, REMINDING THEM OF THEIR FORMER DEVOTEDNESS,
AND GOD'S CONSEQUENT FAVOR, AND A DENUNCIATION OF GOD'S COMING JUDGMENTS
FOR THEIR IDOLATRY. (Jer. 2:1-37)

cry--proclaim.

Jerusalem--the headquarters and center of their idolatry; therefore
addressed first.

thee--rather, "I remember in regard to thee" \[HENDERSON\]; "for thee"
\[MAURER\].

kindness of thy youth--not so much Israel's kindness towards God, as the
kindness which Israel experienced from God in their early history
(compare [Eze 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008), [Eze
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022), [Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060); [Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003), [Eze
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008), [Eze
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#019); [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015)). For Israel from the first
showed perversity rather than kindness towards God (compare [Exo
14:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#011); [Exo
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#024); [Exo
32:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001), &c.). The greater were God's
favors to them from the first, the fouler was their ingratitude in
forsaking Him ([Jer 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003), [Jer
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005), &c.).

espousals--the intervals between Israel's betrothal to God at the exodus
from Egypt, and the formal execution of the marriage contract at Sinai.
EWALD takes the "kindness" and "love" to be Israel's towards God at
first ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008); [Exo
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003); [Exo
35:20-29](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020); [Exo
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#005); [Jos
24:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#016)). But compare [Deu
32:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016); [Eze
16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005), [Eze
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015), [Eze
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022) ("days of thy youth") implies
that the love here meant was on God's side, not Israel's.

thou wentest after me in . . . wilderness--the next act of God's love,
His leading them in the desert without needing any strange god, such as
they since worshipped, to help Him ([Deu
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#007); [Deu
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#012)). [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006) shows it is God's "leading" of
them, not their following after God in the wilderness, which is implied.

[Jeremiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 2:3</span></span>

holiness unto the Lord--that is, was consecrated to the service of
Jehovah ([Exo 19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005)). They thus
answered to the motto on their high priest's breastplate, "Holiness to
the Lord" ([Deu 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006); [Deu
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002), [Deu
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021)).

first-fruits of his increase--that is, of Jehovah's produce. As the
first-fruits of the whole produce of the land were devoted to God ([Exo
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019); [Num
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#012)), so Israel was devoted to
Him as the first-fruit and representative nation among all nations. So
the spiritual Israel ([Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004)).

devour--carrying on the image of first-fruits which were eaten before
the Lord by the priests as the Lord's representatives; all who ate
(injured) Jehovah's first-fruits (Israel), contracted guilt: for
example, Amalek, the Amorites, &c., were extirpated for their guilt
towards Israel.

shall come--rather, "came."

[Jeremiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 2:4</span></span>

Jacob . . . Israel--the whole nation.

families--(See on [Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015)). Hear
God's word not only collectively, but individually ([Zac
12:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 2:5</span></span>

iniquity--wrong done to them ([Isa
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004); [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003); compare [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004)).

walked after vanity--contrasted with "walkest after me in the
wilderness" ([Jer 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)): then I was
their guide in the barren desert; now they take idols as their guides.

vanity . . . vain--An idol is not only vain (impotent and empty), but
vanity itself. Its worshippers acquire its character, becoming vain as
it is ([Deu 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#026); [Psa
115:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008)). A people's character never
rises above that of its gods, which are its "better nature" \[BACON\]
([Kg2 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015); [Jon
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 2:6</span></span>

Neither said they, Where, &c.--The very words which God uses ([Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009), [Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011), [Isa
63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013)), when, as it were, reminding
Himself of His former acts of love to Israel as a ground for interposing
in their behalf again. When they would not say, Where is Jehovah, &c.,
God Himself at last said it for them (compare see on [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)).

deserts . . . pits--The desert between Mount Sinai and Palestine abounds
in chasms and pits, in which beasts of burden often sink down to the
knees. "Shadow of death" refers to the darkness of the caverns amidst
the rocky precipices ([Deu 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#015); [Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 2:7</span></span>

plentiful--literally, "a land of Carmel," or "well-cultivated land": a
garden land, in contrast to the "land of deserts" ([Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)).

defiled--by idolatries ([Jdg 2:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#010);
[Psa 78:58-59](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058); [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038)).

you . . . ye--change to the second person from the third, "they" ([Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)), in order to bring home the guilt
to the living generation.

[Jeremiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 2:8</span></span>

The three leading classes, whose very office under the theocracy was to
lead the people to God, disowned Him in the same language as the nation
at large, "Where is the Lord?" (See [Jer
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)).

priests--whose office it was to expound the law ([Mal
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#006)).

handle--are occupied with the law as the subject of their profession.

pastors--civil, not religious: princes ([Jer
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#015)), whose duty it was to tend their
people.

prophets--who should have reclaimed the people from their apostasy,
encouraged them in it by pretended oracles from Baal, the PhÅ“nician
false god.

by Baal--in his name and by his authority (compare [Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021)).

walked after things . . . not profit--answering to, "walked after
vanity," that is, idols ([Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005);
compare [Jer 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011); [Hab
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 2:9</span></span>

yet plead--namely, by inflicting still further judgments on you.

children's children--Three manuscripts and JEROME omit "children's";
they seem to have thought it unsuitable to read "children's children,"
when "children" had not preceded. But it is designedly so written, to
intimate that the final judgment on the nation would be suspended for
many generations \[HORSLEY\]. (Compare [Eze
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035); [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 2:10</span></span>

pass over the isles--rather, "cross over to the isles."

Chittim . . . Kedar--that is, the heathen nations, west and east. Go
where you will, you cannot find an instance of any heathen nation
forsaking their own for other gods. Israel alone does this. Yet the
heathen gods are false gods; whereas Israel, in forsaking Me for other
gods, forsake their "glory" for unprofitable idols.

Chittim--Cyprus, colonized by PhÅ“nicians, who built in it the city of
Citium, the modern Chitti. Then the term came to be applied to all
maritime coasts of the Mediterranean, especially Greece ([Num
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#024); [Isa
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#001); [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)).

Kedar--descended from Ishmael; the Bedouins and Arabs, east of
Palestine.

[Jeremiah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 2:11</span></span>

glory--Jehovah, the glory of Israel ([Psa
106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020); [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023)). The Shekinah, or cloud resting
on the sanctuary, was the symbol of "the glory of the Lord" ([Kg1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#011); compare [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)). The golden calf was intended as
an image of the true God (compare [Exo
32:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004)), yet it is called an "idol"
([Act 7:41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041)). It (like Roman Catholic
images) was a violation of the second commandment, as the heathen
multiplying of gods is a violation of the first.

not profit-- ([Jer 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 2:12</span></span>

Impassioned personification ([Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)).

horribly afraid--rather, be horrified."

be . . . very desolate--rather, "be exceedingly aghast" at the monstrous
spectacle. Literally, "to be dried up," or "devastated," (places
devastated have such an unsightly look) \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 2:13</span></span>

two evils--not merely one evil, like the idolaters who know no better;
besides simple idolatry, My people add the sin of forsaking the true God
whom they have known; the heathen, though having the sin of idolatry,
are free from the further sin of changing the true God for idols ([Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011)).

forsaken me--The Hebrew collocation brings out the only living God into
more prominent contrast with idol nonentities. "Me they have forsaken,
the Fountain," &c. ([Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013); [Psa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009); [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014)).

broken cisterns--tanks for rain water, common in the East, where wells
are scarce. The tanks not only cannot give forth an ever-flowing fresh
supply as fountains can, but cannot even retain the water poured into
them; the stonework within being broken, the earth drinks up the
collected water. So, in general, all earthly, compared with heavenly,
means of satisfying man's highest wants ([Isa
55:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001); compare [Luk
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#033)).

[Jeremiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 2:14</span></span>

is he a homeborn slave--No. "Israel is Jehovah's son, even His
first-born" ([Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)). [Jer
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016), [Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018), [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036), and the absence of any express
contrast of the two parts of the nation are against EICHORN'S view, that
the prophet proposes to Judah, as yet spared, the case of Israel (the
ten tribes) which had been carried away by Assyria as a warning of what
they might expect if they should still put their trust in Egypt. "Were
Israel's ten tribes of meaner birth than Judah? Certainly not. If, then,
the former fell before Assyria, what can Judah hope from Egypt against
Assyria? . . . Israel" is rather here the whole of the remnant still
left in their own land, that is, Judah. "How comes it to pass that the
nation which once was under God's special protection ([Jer
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003)) is now left at the mercy of the
foe as a worthless slave?" The prophet sees this event as if present,
though it was still future to Judah ([Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)).

[Jeremiah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 2:15</span></span>

lions--the Babylonian princes ([Jer
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007); compare [Amo
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#004)). The disaster from the
Babylonians in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign, and again three
years later when, relying on Egypt, he revolted from Nebuchadnezzar, is
here referred to ([Jer 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002); [Kg2
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001)).

[Jeremiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 2:16</span></span>

Noph . . . Tahapanes--Memphis, capital of Lower Egypt, on the west bank
of the Nile, near the pyramids of Gizeh, opposite the site of modern
Cairo. Daphne, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, near Pelusium, on the
frontier of Egypt towards Palestine. [Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004) contracts it, Hanes. These two
cities, one the capital, the other that with which the Jews came most in
contact, stand for the whole of Egypt. Tahapanes takes its name from a
goddess, Tphnet \[CHAMPOLLION\]. Memphis is from Man-nofri, "the abode
of good men"; written in Hebrew, Moph ([Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006)), or Noph. The reference is to the
coming invasion of Judah by Pharaoh-necho of Egypt, on his return from
the Euphrates, when he deposed Jehoahaz and levied a heavy tribute on
the land ([Kg2 23:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033)). Josiah's
death in battle with the same Pharaoh is probably included ([Kg2
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029)).

have broken--rather, shall feed down the crown, &c., that is, affect
with the greatest ignominy, such as baldness was regarded in the East
([Jer 48:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#037); [Kg2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#023)). Instead of "also," translate,
"even" the Egyptians, in whom thou dost trust, shall miserably
disappoint thy expectation \[MAURER\]. Jehoiakim was twice leagued with
them ([Kg2 23:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#034)): when he received
the crown from them, and when he revolted from Nebuchadnezzar ([Kg2
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#001), [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007)). The Chaldeans, having become
masters of Asia, threatened Egypt. Judea, situated between the
contending powers, was thus exposed to the inroads of the one or other
of the hostile armies; and unfortunately, except in Josiah's reign, took
side with Egypt, contrary to God's warnings.

[Jeremiah 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 2:17</span></span>

Literally, "Has not thy forsaking the Lord . . . procured this
(calamity) to thee?" So the Septuagint: the Masoretic accents make
"this" the subject of the verb, leaving the object to be understood.
"Has not this procured (it, that is, the impending calamity) unto thee,
that hast forsaken?" &c. ([Jer 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018)).

led-- ([Deu 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010)).

the way--The article expresses the right way, the way of the Lord:
namely, the moral training which they enjoyed in the Mosaic covenant.

[Jeremiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 2:18</span></span>

now--used in a reasoning sense, not of time.

the way of Egypt--What hast thou to do with the way, that is, with going
down to Egypt; or what . . . with going to Assyria?

drink . . . waters--that is, to seek reinvigorating aid from them; so
[Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013), [Jer
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036); compare "waters," meaning
numerous forces ([Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007)).

Sihor--that is, the black river, in Greek, Melas ("black"), the Nile: so
called from the black deposit or soil it leaves after the inundation
([Isa 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003)). The Septuagint identifies
it with Gihon, one of the rivers of Paradise.

the river--Euphrates, called by pre-eminence, the river; figurative for
the Assyrian power. In 625 B.C., the seventeenth year of Josiah, and the
fourth of Jeremiah's office, the kingdom of Assyria fell before Babylon,
therefore Assyria is here put for Babylon its successor: so in [Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029); [Lam
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006). There was doubtless a league
between Judea and Assyria (that is, Babylon), which caused Josiah to
march against Pharaoh-necho of Egypt when that king went against
Babylon: the evil consequences of this league are foretold in this verse
and [Jer 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036).

[Jeremiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 2:19</span></span>

correct . . . reprove--rather, in the severer sense, "chastise . . .
punish" \[MAURER\].

backslidings--"apostasies"; plural, to express the number and variety of
their defections. The very confederacies they entered into were the
occasion of their overthrow ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031); [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009); [Hos
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005)).

know . . . see--imperative for futures: Thou shalt know and see to thy
cost.

my fear--rather, "the fear of Me."

[Jeremiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 2:20</span></span>

I--the Hebrew should be pointed as the second person feminine, a form
common in Jeremiah: "Thou hast broken," &c. So the Septuagint, and the
sense requires it.

thy yoke . . . bands--the yoke and bands which I laid on thee, My laws
([Jer 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005)).

transgress--so the Keri, and many manuscripts read. But the Septuagint
and most authorities read, "I will not serve," that is, obey. The sense
of English Version is, "I broke thy yoke (in Egypt)," &c., "and (at that
time) thou saidst, I will not transgress; whereas thou hast (since then)
wandered (from Me)" ([Exo 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#008)).

hill . . . green tree--the scene of idolatries ([Deu
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002); [Isa
57:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#005), [Isa
57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007)).

wanderest--rather, "thou hast bowed down thyself" (for the act of
adultery: figurative of shameless idolatry, [Exo
34:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015); compare [Job
31:10](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 2:21</span></span>

The same image as in [Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032); [Psa
80:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008); [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), &c.

unto me--with respect to Me.

[Jeremiah 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 2:22</span></span>

nitre--not what is now so called, namely, saltpeter; but the natron of
Egypt, a mineral alkali, an incrustation at the bottom of the lakes,
after the summer heat has evaporated the water: used for washing
(compare [Job 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030); [Pro
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#020)).

soap--potash, the carbonate of which is obtained impure from burning
different plants, especially the kali of Egypt and Arabia. Mixed with
oil it was used for washing.

marked--deeply ingrained, indelibly marked; the Hebrew, catham, being
equivalent to cathab. Others translate, "is treasured up," from the
Arabic. MAURER from a Syriac root, "is polluted."

[Jeremiah 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 2:23</span></span>

([Pro 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#012)).

Baalim--plural, to express manifold excellency: compare Elohim.

see--consider.

the valley--namely, of Hinnom, or Tophet, south and east of Jerusalem:
rendered infamous by the human sacrifices to Moloch in it (compare [Jer
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#002), [Jer
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#006), [Jer
19:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013); [Jer
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#035); see on [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033)).

thou art--omit. The substantive that follows in this verse (and also
that in [Jer 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024)) is in apposition
with the preceding "thou."

dromedary--rather, a "young she-camel."

traversing--literally, "enfolding"; making its ways complicated by
wandering hither and thither, lusting after the male. Compare as to the
Jews' spiritual lust, [Hos 2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006).

[Jeremiah 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 2:24</span></span>

([Jer 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006); [Job
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#005)). "A wild ass," agreeing with
"thou" ([Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023)).

at her pleasure--rather, "in her ardor," namely, in pursuit of a male,
sniffing the wind to ascertain where one is to be found \[MAURER\].

occasion--either from a Hebrew root, "to meet"; "her meeting (with the
male for sexual intercourse), who can avert it?" Or better from an
Arabic root: "her heat (sexual impulse), who can allay it?" \[MAURER\].

all they--whichever of the males desire her company \[HORSLEY\].

will not weary themselves--have no need to weary themselves in searching
for her.

her month--in the season of the year when her sexual impulse is
strongest, she puts herself in the way of the males, so that they have
no difficulty in finding her.

[Jeremiah 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 2:25</span></span>

Withhold, &c.--that is, abstain from incontinence; figuratively for
idolatry \[HOUBIGANT\].

unshod, &c.--do not run so violently in pursuing lovers, as to wear out
thy shoes: do not "thirst" so incontinently after sexual intercourse.
HITZIG thinks the reference is to penances performed barefoot to idols,
and the thirst occasioned by loud and continued invocations to them.

no hope-- ([Jer 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#012); [Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010)). "It is hopeless," that is, I
am desperately resolved to go on in my own course.

strangers--that is, laying aside the metaphor, "strange gods" ([Jer
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#013); [Deu
32:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 2:26</span></span>

is ashamed--is put to shame.

thief-- ([Joh 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#001)).

Israel--that is, Judah ([Jer 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028)).

[Jeremiah 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 2:27</span></span>

Thou art my father--(Contrast [Jer
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#004); [Isa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008)).

in . . . trouble they will say--namely, to God ([Psa
78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034); [Isa
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#016)). Trouble often brings men to
their senses ([Luk 15:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 2:28</span></span>

But--God sends them to the gods for whom they forsook Him, to see if
they can help them ([Deu 32:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#037);
[Jdg 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#014)).

according to the number of thy cities--Besides national deities, each
city had its tutelary god ([Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 2:29</span></span>

plead with me--that is, contend with Me for afflicting you ([Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023), [Jer
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035)).

[Jeremiah 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 2:30</span></span>

([Jer 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003); [Jer
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029); [Isa
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#005); [Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013)).

your children--that is, your people, you.

your . . . sword . . . devoured . . . prophets-- ([Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016); [Neh
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#026); [Mat
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029), [Mat
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031)).

[Jeremiah 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 2:31</span></span>

The Hebrew collocation is, "O, the generation, ye," that is, "O ye who
now live." The generation needed only to be named, to call its
degeneracy to view, so palpable was it.

wilderness--in which all the necessaries of life are wanting. On the
contrary, Jehovah was a never-failing source of supply for all Israel's
wants in the wilderness, and afterwards in Canaan.

darkness--literally, "darkness of Jehovah," the strongest Hebrew term
for "darkness; the densest darkness"; compare "land of the shadow of
death" ([Jer 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006)).

We are lords--that is, We are our own masters. We will worship what gods
we like ([Psa 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004); [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006)). But it is better to translate
from a different Hebrew root: "We ramble at large," without restraint
pursuing our idolatrous lusts.

[Jeremiah 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 2:32</span></span>

Oriental women greatly pride themselves on their ornaments (compare [Isa
61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010)).

attire--girdles for the breast.

forgotten me-- ([Jer 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#025); [Hos
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 2:33</span></span>

Why trimmest--MAURER translates, "How skilfully thou dost prepare thy
way," &c. But see [Kg2 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).
"Trimmest" best suits the image of one decking herself as a harlot.

way--course of life.

therefore--accordingly. Or else, "nay, thou hast even," &c.

also . . . wicked ones--even the wicked harlots, that is, (laying aside
the metaphor) even the Gentiles who are wicked, thou teachest to be
still more so \[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 2:34</span></span>

Also--not only art thou polluted with idolatry, but also with the guilt
of shedding innocent blood \[MAURER\]. ROSENMULLER not so well
translates, "even in thy skirts," &c.; that is, there is no part of thee
(not even thy skirts) that is not stained with innocent blood ([Jer
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004); [Kg2
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016); [Psa
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038)). See as to innocent blood
shed, not as here in honor of idols, but of prophets for having reproved
them ([Jer 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030); [Jer
26:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#020)).

souls--that is, persons.

search--I did not need to "search deep" to find proof of thy guilt; for
it was "upon all these" thy skirts. Not in deep caverns didst thou
perpetrate these atrocities, but openly in the vale of Hinnom and within
the precincts of the temple.

[Jeremiah 2:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 2:35</span></span>

([Jer 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023), [Jer
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#029)).

[Jeremiah 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">jer 2:36</span></span>

gaddest--runnest to and fro, now seeking help from Assyria ([Ch2
28:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016)), now from Egypt ([Jer
37:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007); [Isa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#003)).

[Jeremiah 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">jer 2:37</span></span>

him--Egypt.

hands upon . . . head--expressive of mourning ([Sa2
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)).

in them--in those stays in which thou trustest.

Contrary to all precedent in the case of adultery, Jehovah offers a
return to Judah, the spiritual adulteress ([Jer
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001)). A new portion of the book,
ending with the sixth chapter. Judah worse than Israel; yet both shall
be restored in the last days (Jer. 3:6-25).
