### [Judges Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

[Judges 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 13:1</span></span>

ISRAEL SERVES THE PHILISTINES FORTY YEARS. ([Jdg
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#001).md)

the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty
years--The Israelites were represented ([Jdg
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#006).md) as having fallen universally
into a state of gross and confirmed idolatry, and in chastisement of
this great apostasy, the Lord raised up enemies that harassed them in
various quarters, especially the Ammonites and Philistines. The
invasions and defeat of the former were narrated in the two chapters
immediately preceding this; and now the sacred historian proceeds to
describe the inroads of the latter people. The period of Philistine
ascendency comprised forty years, reckoning from the time of Elon till
the death of Samson.

[Judges 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 13:2</span></span>

AN ANGEL APPEARS TO MANOAH'S WIFE. ([Jdg
13:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#002).md)

Zorah--a Danite town ([Jos 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033).md)
lying on the common boundary of Judah and Dan, so that it was near the
Philistine border.

[Judges 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 13:3</span></span>

the angel of the Lord--The messenger of the covenant, the divine
personage who made so many remarkable appearances of a similar kind
already described.

[Judges 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 13:5</span></span>

thou shalt conceive, and bear a son--This predicted child was to be a
Nazarite. The mother was, therefore, for the sake of her promised
offspring, required to practice the rigid abstinence of the Nazarite law
(see on [Num 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002).md).

he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines--a
prophecy encouraging to a patriotic man; the terms of it, however,
indicated that the period of deliverance was still to be distant.

[Judges 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 13:6</span></span>

then Manoah entreated the Lord--On being informed by his wife of the
welcome intimation, the husband made it the subject of earnest prayer to
God. This is a remarkable instance, indicative of the connection which
God has established between prayer and the fulfilment of His promises.

[Judges 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 13:11</span></span>

THE ANGEL APPEARS TO MANOAH. ([Jdg
13:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#011).md)

Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman?--Manoah's intense desire
for the repetition of the angel's visit was prompted not by doubts or
anxieties of any kind, but was the fruit of lively faith, and of his
great anxiety to follow out the instructions given. Blessed was he who
had not seen, yet had believed.

[Judges 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 13:15</span></span>

MANOAH'S SACRIFICE. ([Jdg 13:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#015).md)

Manoah said unto the angel . . ., I pray thee, let us detain thee, until
we shall have made ready a kid--The stranger declined the intended
hospitality and intimated that if the meat were to be an offering, it
must be presented to the Lord \[[Jdg
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#006.md)\]. Manoah needed this
instruction, for his purpose was to offer the prepared viands to him,
not as the Lord, but as what he imagined him to be, not even an angel
([Jdg 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#016).md), but a prophet or merely
human messenger. It was on this account, and not as rejecting divine
honors, that he spoke in this manner to Manoah. The angel's language was
exactly similar to that of our Lord ([Mat
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017).md).

[Judges 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 13:17</span></span>

Manoah said unto the angel . . ., What is thy name?--Manoah's request
elicited the most unequivocal proofs of the divinity of his supernatural
visitor--in his name "secret" (in the Margin, "wonderful"), and in the
miraculous flame that betokened the acceptance of the sacrifice.

[Judges 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 13:24</span></span>

SAMSON BORN. ([Jdg 13:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024).md)

the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson--The birth of this
child of promise, and the report of the important national services he
was to render, must, from the first, have made him an object of peculiar
interest and careful instruction.

[Judges 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jdg 13:25</span></span>

the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times--not, probably, as it
moved the prophets, who were charged with an inspired message, but
kindling in his youthful bosom a spirit of high and devoted patriotism.

Eshtaol--the free city. It, as well as Zorah, stood on the border
between Judah and Dan.
