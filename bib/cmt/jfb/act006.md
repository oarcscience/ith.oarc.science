*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Acts Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

[Acts 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 6:1</span></span>

FIRST ELECTION OF DEACONS. ([Act
6:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001))

the Grecians--the Greek-speaking Jews, mostly born in the provinces.

the Hebrews--those Jews born in Palestine who used their native tongue,
and were wont to look down on the "Grecians" as an inferior class.

were neglected--"overlooked" by those whom the apostles employed, and
who were probably of the Hebrew class, as being the most numerous. The
complaint was in all likelihood well founded, though we cannot suspect
the distributors of intentional partiality. "It was really just an
emulation of love, each party wishing to have their own poor taken care
of in the best manner" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

the daily ministration--the daily distribution of alms or of food,
probably the latter.

[Acts 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 6:2</span></span>

the multitude--the general body of the disciples.

It is not reason--The word expresses dislike; that is "We cannot
submit."

to leave the word of God--to have our time and attention withdrawn from
preaching; which, it thus appears, they regarded as their primary duty.

to serve tables--oversee the distribution of provisions.

[Acts 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 6:3</span></span>

look ye out among you--that is, ye, "the multitude," from among
yourselves.

seven men of honest report--good reputation ([Act
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#022); [Ti1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007)).

full of the Holy Ghost--not full of miraculous gifts, which would have
been no qualification for the duties required, but spiritually gifted
(although on two of them miraculous power did rest).

and wisdom--discretion, aptitude for practical business.

whom we may appoint--for while the election was vested in the Christian
people, the appointment lay with the apostles, as spiritual rulers.

[Acts 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 6:4</span></span>

we will give ourselves to prayer--public prayer, as along with preaching
their great work.

[Acts 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 6:5</span></span>

Stephen, &c.--As this and the following names are all Greek, it is
likely they were all of the "Grecian" class, which would effectually
restore mutual confidence.

[Acts 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 6:6</span></span>

when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them--the one proclaiming
that all official gifts flowed from the Church's glorified Head, the
other symbolizing the communication of these to the chosen
office-bearers through the recognized channels.

[Acts 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 6:7</span></span>

word of God increased . . . disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
greatly--prosperity crowning the beautiful spirit which reigned in this
mother community.

a great company of the priests were obedient, &c.--This was the crowning
triumph of the Gospel, whose peaceful prosperity was now at its greatest
height. After Stephen's teaching and trial made it clear that sacerdotal
interests could not stand with the Gospel, such priestly accessions
became rare indeed. Note (1) how easily misunderstandings may arise
among the most loving and devoted followers of the Lord Jesus: but (2)
How quickly and effectually such misunderstandings may be healed, where
honest intentions, love, and wisdom reign: (3) What a beautiful model
for imitation is furnished by the class here complained of, who, though
themselves the majority, chose the new office-bearers from amongst the
complaining minority! (4) How superior to the lust of power do the
apostles here show themselves to be, in not only divesting themselves of
the immediate superintendence of temporal affairs in the Christian
community, but giving the choice of those who were to be entrusted with
it to the disciples at large! (5) How little of formal organization did
the apostles give to the Church at first, and when an emergency arose
which demanded something more, how entirely was the remedy suggested by
the reason of the thing! (6) Though the new office-bearers are not
expressly called Deacons here, it is universally admitted that this was
the first institution of that order in the Church; the success of the
expedient securing its permanency, and the qualifications for "the
office of a Deacon" being laid down in one of the apostolical Epistles
immediately after those of "a Bishop" ([Ti1
3:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)).

[Acts 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 6:8</span></span>

STEPHEN ARRAIGNED BEFORE THE SAMHEDRIM. ([Act
6:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008))

And Stephen, &c.--The foregoing narrative seems to be only an
introduction to what follows.

full of faith--rather, "of grace," as the best manuscripts read.

[Acts 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 6:9</span></span>

synagogue of the Libertines--Jewish freedmen; manumitted Roman captives,
or the children of such, expelled from Rome (as appears from JOSEPHUS
and TACITUS), and now residing at Jerusalem.

Cyrenians--Jews of Cyrene, in Libya, on the coast of Africa.

them of Cilicia--amongst whom may have been Saul of Tarsus ([Act
7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058); [Act
21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039)).

and of Asia--(See on [Act 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006)).

[Acts 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 6:10</span></span>

not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake--What he
said, and the power with which he spake it, were alike resistless.

[Acts 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 6:11</span></span>

blasphemous words against Moses--doubtless referring to the impending
disappearance of the whole Mosaic system.

and against God--This must refer to the supreme dignity and authority
which he claimed for Christ, as the head of that new economy which was
so speedily to supersede the old (compare [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056), [Act
7:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059)).

[Acts 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 6:15</span></span>

as . . . the face of an angel--a play of supernatural radiance attesting
to all who beheld his countenance the divine calm of the spirit within.
