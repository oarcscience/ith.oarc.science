*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Isaiah Chapter 41](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 41:1</span></span>

ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY THE JEWS SHOULD PLACE CONFIDENCE IN GOD'S
PROMISES OF DELIVERING THEM; HE WILL RAISE UP A PRINCE AS THEIR
DELIVERER, WHEREAS THE IDOLS COULD NOT DELIVER THE HEATHEN NATIONS FROM
THAT PRINCE. (Isa. 41:1-29)

([Zac 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013).md). God is about to argue the
case; therefore let the nations listen in reverential silence. Compare
[Gen 28:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md), as to the spirit in
which we ought to behave before God.

before me--rather (turning), "towards me" \[MAURER\].

islands--including all regions beyond sea ([Jer
25:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#022).md), maritime regions, not merely
isles in the strict sense.

renew . . . strength--Let them gather their strength for the argument;
let them adduce their strongest arguments (compare [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Job
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#032).md). "Judgment" means here, to
decide the point at issue between us.

[Isaiah 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 41:2</span></span>

Who--else but God? The fact that God "raiseth up" Cyrus and qualifies
him for becoming the conqueror of the nations and deliverer of God's
people, is a strong argument why they should trust in Him. The future is
here prophetically represented as present or past.

the righteous man--Cyrus; as [Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); [Isa
45:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md); [Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md), "from the East," prove. Called
"righteous," not so much on account of his own equity \[HERODOTUS,
3.89\], as because he fulfilled God's righteous will in restoring the
Jews from their unjust captivity. Raised him up in righteousness. The
Septuagint takes the Hebrew as a noun "righteousness." MAURER
translates, "Who raised up him whom salvation (national and temporal,
the gift of God's 'righteousness' to the good, [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017.md); compare [Isa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005).md) meets at his foot" (that is,
wherever he goes). Cyrus is said to come from the East, because Persia
is east of Babylon; but in [Isa 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md),
from the north, in reference to Media. At the same time the full sense
of righteousness, or righteous, and of the whole passage, is realized
only in Messiah, Cyrus' antitype (Cyrus knew not God, [Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004).md). He goes forth as the Universal
Conqueror of the "nations," in righteousness making war ([Psa
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Rev
19:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md); [Rev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002.md); [Rev
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026).md). "The idols He shall utterly
abolish" (compare [Isa 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023.md), with [Isa
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018).md). Righteousness was always raised
up from the East. Paradise was east of Eden. The cherubim were at the
east of the garden. Abraham was called from the East. Judea, the
birthplace of Messiah, was in the East.

called . . . to . . . foot--called him to attend His (God's) steps, that
is, follow His guidance. In [Ezr 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002.md),
Cyrus acknowledges Jehovah as the Giver of his victories. He subdued the
nations from the Euxine to the Red Sea, and even Egypt (says XENOPHON).

dust-- ([Isa 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md); [Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005.md); [Psa
18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042).md). Persia, Cyrus' country, was
famed for the use of the "bow" ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md). "Before him" means "gave them
into his power" ([Jos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md). MAURER
translates, "Gave his (the enemy's) sword to be dust, and his (the
enemy's) bow to be as stubble" ([Job
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#026.md), [Job
41:29](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#029).md).

[Isaiah 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 41:3</span></span>

Cyrus had not visited the regions of the Euphrates and westward until he
visited them for conquest. So the gospel conquests penetrated regions
where the name of God was unknown before.

[Isaiah 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 41:4</span></span>

Who--else but God?

calling . . . generations from . . . beginning--The origin and position
of all nations are from God ([Deu
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md); [Act
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#026).md); what is true of Cyrus and his
conquests is true of all the movements of history from the first; all
are from God.

with the last--that is, the last ([Isa
44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006.md); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 41:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 41:5</span></span>

feared--that they would be subdued.

drew near, and came--together, for mutual defense.

[Isaiah 41:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 41:6</span></span>

Be of good courage--Be not alarmed because of Cyrus, but make new images
to secure the favor of the gods against him.

[Isaiah 41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 41:7</span></span>

One workman encourages the other to be quick in finishing the idol, so
as to avert the impending danger.

nails--to keep it steady in its place. Wisdom 13:15, 16, gives a similar
picture of the folly of idolatry.

[Isaiah 41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 41:8</span></span>

Contrast between the idolatrous nations whom God will destroy by Cyrus,
and Israel whom God will deliver by the same man for their forefathers'
sake.

servant--so termed as being chosen by God to worship Him themselves, and
to lead other peoples to do the same ([Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004).md).

Jacob . . . chosen-- ([Psa 135:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#004).md).

my friend--literally, "loving me."

[Isaiah 41:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 41:9</span></span>

Abraham, the father of the Jews, taken from the remote Ur of the
Chaldees. Others take it of Israel, called out of Egypt ([Deu
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md).

from the chief men--literally, "the elbows"; so the joints; hence the
root which joins the tree to the earth; figuratively, those of ancient
and noble stock. But the parallel clause "ends of the earth" favors
GESENIUS, who translates, "the extremities of the earth"; so JEROME.

[Isaiah 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 41:10</span></span>

be not dismayed--literally, anxiously to look at one another in dismay.

right hand of my righteousness--that is, My right hand prepared in
accordance with My righteousness (faithfulness to My promises) to uphold
thee.

[Isaiah 41:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 41:11</span></span>

ashamed--put to the shame of defeat (compare [Isa
54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017.md); [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033).md).

[Isaiah 41:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 41:12</span></span>

seek . . . and . . . not find--said of one so utterly put out of the way
that not a trace of him can be found ([Psa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036).md).

thing of naught--shall utterly perish.

[Isaiah 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 41:13</span></span>

([Deu 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md), [Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029).md).

[Isaiah 41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 41:14</span></span>

worm--in a state of contempt and affliction, whom all loathe and tread
on, the very expression which Messiah, on the cross, applies to Himself
([Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006).md), so completely are the
Lord and His people identified and assimilated. God's people are as
'worms' in humble thoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty
thoughts of them; worms, but not vipers, or of the serpent's seed."
\[HENRY\].

men--The parallelism requires the word "men" here to have associated
with it the idea of fewness or feebleness. LOWTH translates, "Ye mortals
of Israel." The Septuagint, "altogether diminutive." MAURER supports
English Version, which the Hebrew text best accord with.

the Lord--in general.

and thy redeemer--in particular; a still stronger reason why He should
"help" them.

[Isaiah 41:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 41:15</span></span>

God will make Israel to destroy their enemies as the Eastern corn-drag
([Isa 28:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027).md) bruises out the grain
with its teeth, and gives the chaff to the winds to scatter.

teeth--serrated, so as to cut up the straw for fodder and separate the
grain from the chaff.

mountains . . . hills--kingdoms more or less powerful that were hostile
to Israel ([Isa 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 41:16</span></span>

fan--winnowed (compare [Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md).

whirlwind . . . scatter them-- ([Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021.md); [Job
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 41:17</span></span>

poor and needy--primarily, the exiles in Babylon.

water--figuratively, refreshment, prosperity after their affliction. The
language is so constructed as only very partially to apply to the local
and temporary event of the restoration from Babylon; but fully to be
realized in the waters of life and of the Spirit, under the Gospel ([Isa
30:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#025.md); [Isa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#003.md); [Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037.md); [Joh
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014).md). God wrought no miracles that we
read of, in any wilderness, during the return from Babylon.

faileth--rather, "is rigid" or parched \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 41:18</span></span>

Alluding to the waters with which Israel was miraculously supplied in
the desert after having come out of Egypt.

high places--bare of trees, barren, and unwatered ([Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md); [Jer
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#006).md). "High places . . . valleys"
spiritually express that in all circumstances, whether elevated or
depressed, God's people will have refreshment for their souls, however
little to be expected it might seem.

[Isaiah 41:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 41:19</span></span>

([Isa 32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md); [Isa
55:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#013).md).

shittah--rather, the "acacia," or Egyptian thorn, from which the gum
Arabic is obtained \[LOWTH\].

oil tree--the olive.

fir tree--rather, the "cypress": grateful by its shade.

pine--GESENIUS translates, "the holm."

box tree--not the shrub used for bordering flower beds, but \[GESENIUS\]
a kind of cedar, remarkable for the smallness of its cones, and the
upward direction of its branches.

[Isaiah 41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 41:20</span></span>

consider--literally, "lay it (to hear)"; turn (their attention) to it.
"They" refers to all lands ([Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md);
[Psa 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009.md); [Psa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003).md). The effect on the Gentiles of
God's open interposition hereafter in behalf of Israel shall be, they
shall seek Israel's God ([Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md);
[Zac 8:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 41:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 41:21</span></span>

A new challenge to the idolaters (see [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001.md), [Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007).md) to say, can their idols predict
future events as Jehovah can ([Isa
41:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022), &c..md)?

your strong reasons--the reasons for idol-worship which you think
especially strong.

[Isaiah 41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 41:22</span></span>

what shall happen--"Let them bring near and declare future
contingencies" \[HORSLEY\].

former things . . . the latter end of them--show what former predictions
the idols have given, that we may compare the event ("latter end") with
them; or give new prophecies ("declare things to come") ([Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009).md), \[MAURER\]. BARNES explains it
more reconditely, "Let them foretell the entire series of events,
showing, in their order, the things which shall first occur, as well as
those which shall finally happen"; the false prophets tried to predict
isolated events, having no mutual dependency; not a long series of
events mutually and orderly connected, and stretching far into futurity.
They did not even try to do this. None but God can do it ([Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md); [Isa
44:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md). "Or . . . things to come"
will, in this view, mean, Let them, if they cannot predict the series,
even predict plainly any detached events.

[Isaiah 41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 41:23</span></span>

do good . . . evil--give any proof at all of your power, either to
reward your friends or punish your enemies ([Psa
115:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#002).md).

that we may be dismayed, and behold it together--MAURER translates,
"That we (Jehovah and the idols) may look one another in the face (that
is, encounter one another, [Kg2 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md),
[Kg2 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011).md), and see" our respective
powers by a trial. HORSLEY translates, "Then the moment we behold, we
shall be dismayed." "We" thus, and in English Version, refers to Jehovah
and His worshippers.

[Isaiah 41:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 41:24</span></span>

of nothing--(See on [Isa 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017).md). The
Hebrew text is here corrupt; so English Version treats it.

abomination--abstract for concrete: not merely abominable, but the
essence of whatever is so ([Deu
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#012).md).

chooseth you--as an object of worship.

[Isaiah 41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 41:25</span></span>

raised up--in purpose: not fulfilled till a hundred fifty years
afterwards.

north--In [Isa 41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md), "from the East";
both are true: see the note there.

call . . . my name--acknowledge Me as God, and attribute his success to
Me; this he did in the proclamation ([Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002).md). This does not necessarily imply
that Cyrus renounced idolatry, but hearing of Isaiah's prophecy given a
hundred fifty years before, so fully realized in his own acts, he
recognized God as the true God, but retained his idol (so Naaman, 2Ki.
5:1-27; compare [Kg2 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#033.md), [Kg2
17:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#041.md); [Dan
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md); [Dan
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001.md), [Dan
4:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034).md).

princes--the Babylonian satraps or governors of provinces.

mortar--"mire"; He shall tread them under foot as dirt ([Isa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 41:26</span></span>

Who--of the idolatrous soothsayers? When this prophecy shall be
fulfilled, all shall see that God foretold as to Cyrus, which none of
the soothsayers have.

beforetime--before the event occurred.

He is righteous--rather, "It is true"; it was a true prophecy, as the
event shows. "He is righteous," in English Version, must be interpreted,
The fulfilment of the idol's words proves that he is faithful.

showeth, &c.--rather, "there was none (of the soothsayers) that showed .
. . declared--no one has heard your words" foretelling the event.

[Isaiah 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 41:27</span></span>

Rather, "I first will give to Zion and to Jerusalem the messenger of
good tidings, Behold, behold them!" The clause, "Behold . . . them" (the
wished-for event is now present) is inserted in the middle of the
sentence as a detached exclamation, by an elegant transposition, the
language being framed abruptly, as one would speak in putting vividly as
it were, before the eyes of others, some joyous event which he had just
learned \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\] (compare [Isa
40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009).md). None of the idols had foretold
these events. Jehovah was the "first" to do so (see [Isa
41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 41:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 41:28</span></span>

no counsellor--no one of the idolatrous soothsayers who could inform
([Num 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#014).md) those who consulted them
what would take place. Compare "counsel of His messenger" ([Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md).

when I asked--that is, challenged them, in this chapter.

[Isaiah 41:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 41:29</span></span>

confusion--"emptiness" \[BARNES\].

God's description of His character ([Isa
42:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md). God addresses Him directly
([Isa 42:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005).md). Address to the people
to attend to the subject ([Isa
42:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008).md). Call to all, and especially
the exile Jews to rejoice in the coming deliverance (Isa. 42:10-25).
