### [Ezekiel Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 12:1</span></span>

EZEKIEL'S TYPICAL MOVING TO EXILE: PROPHECY OF ZEDEKIAH'S CAPTIVITY AND
PRIVATION OF SIGHT: THE JEWS' UNBELIEVING SURMISE AS TO THE DISTANCE OF
THE EVENT REPROVED. (Eze. 12:1-28)

eyes to see, and see not, . . . ears to hear, and hear not--fulfilling
the prophecy of [Deu 29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md), here quoted
by Ezekiel (compare [Isa 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md); [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021).md). Ezekiel needed often to be
reminded of the people's perversity, lest he should be discouraged by
the little effect produced by his prophecies. Their "not seeing" is the
result of perversity, not incapacity. They are wilfully blind. The
persons most interested in this prophecy were those dwelling at
Jerusalem; and it is among them that Ezekiel was transported in spirit,
and performed in vision, not outwardly, the typical acts. At the same
time, the symbolical prophecy was designed to warn the exiles at Chebar
against cherishing hopes, as many did in opposition to God's revealed
word, of returning to Jerusalem, as if that city was to stand;
externally living afar off, their hearts dwelt in that corrupt and
doomed capital.

[Ezekiel 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 12:3</span></span>

stuff for removing--rather, "an exile's outfit," the articles proper to
a person going as an exile, a staff and knapsack, with a supply of food
and clothing; so "instruments of captivity," [Jer
46:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#019.md), Margin, that is, the needful
equipments for it. His simple announcements having failed, he is
symbolically to give them an ocular demonstration conveyed by a
word-painting of actions performed in vision.

consider-- ([Deu 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029).md).

[Ezekiel 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 12:4</span></span>

by day--in broad daylight, when all can see thee.

at even--not contradicting the words "by day." The baggage was to be
sent before by day, and Ezekiel was to follow at nightfall \[GROTIUS\];
or, the preparations were to be made by day, the actual departure was to
be effected at night \[HENDERSON\].

as they that go forth into captivity--literally, "as the goings forth of
the captivity," that is, of the captive band of exiles, namely, amid the
silent darkness: typifying Zedekiah's flight by night on the taking of
the city ([Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md); [Jer
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 12:5</span></span>

Dig--as Zedekiah was to escape like one digging through a wall,
furtively to effect an escape ([Eze
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012).md).

carry out--namely, "thy stuff" ([Eze
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#004).md).

thereby--by the opening in the wall. Zedekiah escaped "by the gate
betwixt the two walls" ([Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 12:6</span></span>

in . . . twilight--rather, "in the dark." So in [Gen
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md), "it" refers to "thy stuff."

cover thy face--as one who muffles his face, afraid of being recognized
by anyone meeting him. So the Jews and Zedekiah should make their exit
stealthily and afraid to look around, so hurried should be their fight
\[CALVIN\].

sign--rather, "a portent," namely, for evil.

[Ezekiel 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 12:9</span></span>

What doest thou?--They ask not in a docile spirit, but making a jest of
his proceedings.

[Ezekiel 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 12:10</span></span>

burden--that is, weighty oracle.

the prince--The very man Zedekiah, in whom they trust for safety, is to
be the chief sufferer. JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 10.7\] reports that
Ezekiel sent a copy of this prophecy to Zedekiah. As Jeremiah had sent a
letter to the captives at the Chebar, which was the means of calling
forth at first the agency of Ezekiel, so it was natural for Ezekiel to
send a message to Jerusalem confirming the warnings of Jeremiah. The
prince, however, fancying a contradiction between [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md); "he shall not see Babylon," and
[Jer 24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md), declaring he should be
carried to Babylon, believed neither. Seeming discrepancies in Scripture
on deeper search prove to be hidden harmonies.

[Ezekiel 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 12:11</span></span>

sign--portent of evil to come ([Eze
24:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#027.md); [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008), Margin.md). Fulfilled ([Kg2
25:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#001.md); [Jer
52:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001).md).

[Ezekiel 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 12:12</span></span>

prince . . . among them--literally, "that is in the midst of them," that
is, on whom the eyes of all are cast, and "under whose shadow" they hope
to live ([Lam 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020).md).

shall bear--namely, his "stuff for removing"; his equipments for his
journey.

cover his face, that he see not the ground--See on [Eze
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006.md); the symbol in [Eze
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006.md) is explained in this verse. He
shall muffle his face so as not to be recognized: a humiliation for a
king!

[Ezekiel 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 12:13</span></span>

My net--the Chaldean army. He shall be inextricably entangled in it, as
in the meshes of a net. It is God's net ([Job
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006).md). Babylon was God's instrument
([Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md). Called "a net" ([Hab
1:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014).md).

bring him to Babylon . . . ; yet shall he not see it--because he should
be deprived of sight before he arrived there ([Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 12:14</span></span>

all . . . about him--his satellites: his bodyguard.

bands--literally, "the wings" of an army ([Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008).md).

draw out . . . sword after them--(See on [Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md); [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 12:16</span></span>

I will leave a few . . . that they may declare . . . abominations--God's
purpose in scattering a remnant of Jews among the Gentiles; namely, not
only that they themselves should be weaned from idolatry (see [Eze
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#015).md), but that by their own word, as
also by their whole state as exiles, they should make God's
righteousness manifest among the Gentiles, as vindicated in their
punishment for their sins (compare [Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md); [Zac
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013).md).

[Ezekiel 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 12:18</span></span>

Symbolical representation of the famine and fear with which they should
eat their scanty morsel, in their exile, and especially at the siege.

[Ezekiel 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 12:19</span></span>

people of the land--the Jews "in the land" of Chaldea who thought
themselves miserable as being exiles and envied the Jews left in
Jerusalem as fortunate.

land of Israel--contrasted with "the people in the land" of Chaldea. So
far from being fortunate as the exiles in Chaldea regarded them, the
Jews in Jerusalem are truly miserable, for the worst is before them,
whereas the exiles have escaped the miseries of the coming siege.

land . . . desolate from all that is therein--literally "that the land
(namely, Judea) may be despoiled of the fulness thereof"; emptied of the
inhabitants and abundance of flocks and corn with which it was filled.

because of . . . violence-- ([Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034).md).

[Ezekiel 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 12:20</span></span>

the cities--left in Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem.

[Ezekiel 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 12:22</span></span>

proverb--The infidel scoff, that the threatened judgment was so long in
coming, it would not come at all, had by frequent repetition come to be
a "proverb" with them. This skeptical habit contemporary prophets
testify to ([Jer 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md); [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md); [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012).md). Ezekiel, at the Chebar, thus
sympathizes with Jeremiah and strengthens his testimony at Jerusalem.
The tendency to the same scoff showed itself in earlier times, but had
not then developed into a settled "proverb" ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018).md). It shall again be the
characteristic of the last times, when "faith" shall be regarded as an
antiquated thing ([Luk 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008).md), seeing
that it remains stationary, whereas worldly arts and sciences progress,
and when the "continuance of all things from creation" will be the
argument against the possibility of their being suddenly brought to a
standstill by the coming of the Lord ([Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md); [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003).md). The very long-suffering of
God, which ought to lead men to repentance, is made an argument against
His word ([Ecc 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md); [Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003).md).

days . . . prolonged . . . vision faileth--their twofold argument: (1)
The predictions shall not come to pass till long after our time. (2)
They shall fail and prove vain shadows. God answers both in [Eze
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023.md), [Eze
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#025.md).

[Ezekiel 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 12:23</span></span>

effect--literally, "the word," namely, fulfilled; that is, the effective
fulfilment of whatever the prophets have spoken is at hand.

[Ezekiel 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 12:24</span></span>

no more . . . vain vision . . . flattering divination--All those false
prophets ([Lam 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#014).md), who "flattered"
the people with promises of peace and safety, shall be detected and
confounded by the event itself.

[Ezekiel 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 12:25</span></span>

word . . . shall come to pass--in opposition to their scoff "the vision
faileth" ([Eze 12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022).md). The repetition,
"I will speak . . . speak," &c. (or as FAIRBAIRN, "For I, Jehovah, will
speak whatever word I shall speak, and it shall be done") implies that
whenever God speaks, the effect must follow; for God, who speaks, is not
divided in Himself ([Eze 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#028.md); [Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011.md); [Dan
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012.md); [Luk
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#033).md).

no more prolonged--in opposition to the scoff ([Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022).md), "The days are prolonged."

in your days--while you are living (compare [Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034).md).

[Ezekiel 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 12:27</span></span>

Not a mere repetition of the scoff ([Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022).md); there the scoffers asserted
that the evil was so often threatened and postponed, it must have no
reality; here formalists do not go so far as to deny that a day of evil
is coming, but assert it is still far off ([Amo
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003).md). The transition is easy from this
carnal security to the gross infidelity of the former class.
