### [Psalms Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 28:1</span></span>

An earnest cry for divine aid against his enemies, as being also those
of God, is followed by the Psalmist's praise in assurance of a favorable
answer, and a prayer for all God's people. ([Psa
28:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#001).md)

my rock-- ([Psa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md), [Psa
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#031).md).

be not silent to me--literally, "from me," deaf or inattentive.

become like them, &c.--share their fate.

go down into the pit--or, "grave" ([Psa
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 28:2</span></span>

lift up my hands--a gesture of prayer ([Psa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#004.md); [Psa
141:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#002).md).

oracle--place of speaking ([Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022.md);
[Num 7:89](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#089).md), where God answered His
people (compare [Psa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 28:3</span></span>

Draw me not away--implies punishment as well as death (compare [Psa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009).md). Hypocrisy is the special
wickedness mentioned.

[Psalms 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 28:4</span></span>

The imprecation is justified in [Psa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md). The force of the passage is
greatly enhanced by the accumulation of terms describing their sin.

endeavours--points out their deliberate sinfulness.

[Psalms 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 28:5</span></span>

Disregard of God's judgments brings a righteous punishment.

destroy . . . build . . . up--The positive strengthened by the negative
form.

[Psalms 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 28:6</span></span>

supplications--or, "cries for mercy."

[Psalms 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 28:7</span></span>

The repetition of "heart" denotes his sincerity.

[Psalms 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 28:8</span></span>

The distinction made between the people.

their strength--and the anointed--may indicate Absalom's rebellion as
the occasion.

[Psalms 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 28:9</span></span>

The special prayer for the people sustains this view.

feed them--as a shepherd ([Psa 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md),
&c.).
