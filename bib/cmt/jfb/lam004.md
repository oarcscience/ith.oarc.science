### [Lamentations Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 4:1</span></span>

THE SAD CAPTURE OF JERUSALEM, THE HOPE OF RESTORATION, AND THE
RETRIBUTION AWAITING IDUMEA FOR JOINING BABYLON AGAINST JUDEA. (Lam.
4:1-22)

gold--the splendid adornment of the temple \[CALVIN\] ([Lam
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010.md); [Kg1
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#022.md); [Jer
52:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#019).md); or, the principal men of Judea
\[GROTIUS\] ([Lam 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002).md).

stones of . . . sanctuary--the gems on the breastplate of the high
priest; or, metaphorically, the priests and Levites.

[Lamentations 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 4:2</span></span>

comparable to . . . gold-- ([Job
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md), [Job
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#019).md).

earthen pitchers-- ([Isa 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#014.md); [Jer
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011).md).

[Lamentations 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 4:3</span></span>

sea monsters . . . breast--Whales and other cetaceous monsters are
mammalian. Even they suckle their young; but the Jewish women in the
siege, so desperate was their misery, ate theirs ([Lam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md); [Lam
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020).md). Others translate, "jackals."

ostriches--see on [Job 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#014.md); [Job
39:16](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#016.md), on their forsaking their young.

[Lamentations 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 4:4</span></span>

thirst--The mothers have no milk to give through the famine.

[Lamentations 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 4:5</span></span>

delicately--on dainties.

are desolate--or, "perish."

in scarlet embrace dunghills--Instead of the scarlet couches on which
the grandees were nursed, they must lie on dunghills.

embrace--They who once shrank sensitively from any soil, gladly cling
close to heaps of filth as their only resting-place. Compare "embrace
the rock" ([Job 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#008).md).

[Lamentations 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 4:6</span></span>

greater than . . . Sodom-- ([Mat
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#023).md). No prophets had been sent to
Sodom, as there had been to Judea; therefore the punishment of the
latter was heavier than that of the former.

overthrown . . . in a moment--whereas the Jews had to endure the
protracted and manifold hardships of a siege.

no hands stayed on her--No hostile force, as the Chaldeans in the case
of Jerusalem, continually pressed on her before her overthrow. Jeremiah
thus shows the greater severity of Jerusalem's punishment than that of
Sodom.

[Lamentations 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 4:7</span></span>

Nazarites--literally, "separated ones" ([Num
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#002).md). They were held once in the
highest estimation, but now they are degraded. God's blessing formerly
caused their body not to be the less fair and ruddy for their abstinence
from strong drink. Compare the similar case of Daniel, &c. ([Dan
1:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008).md). Also David ([Sa1
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md); [Sa1
17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042).md). Type of Messiah ([Sol
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010).md).

rubies--GESENIUS translates, "corals," from a Hebrew root, "to divide
into branches," from the branching form of corals.

polishing--They were like exquisitely cut and polished sapphires. The
"sapphires" may represent the blue veins of a healthy person.

[Lamentations 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 4:8</span></span>

blacker than . . . coal--or, "than blackness" itself ([Joe
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006.md); [Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010).md).

like a stick--as withered as a dry stick.

[Lamentations 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 4:9</span></span>

The speedy death by the sword is better than the lingering death by
famine.

pine away--literally, "flow out"; referring to the flow of blood. This
expression, and "stricken through," are drawn from death by "the sword."

want of . . . fruits--The words in italics have to be supplied in the
original ([Gen 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#028.md); [Psa
109:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024).md).

[Lamentations 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 4:10</span></span>

([Lam 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#020.md); [Deu
28:56-57](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056).md).

pitiful--naturally at other times compassionate ([Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015).md). JOSEPHUS describes the
unnatural act as it took place in the siege under Titus.

sodden--boiled.

[Lamentations 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 4:11</span></span>

fire . . . devoured . . . foundations-- ([Deu
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022.md); [Jer
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#014).md). A most rare event. Fire
usually consumes only the surface; but this reached even to the
foundation, cutting off all hope of restoration.

[Lamentations 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 4:12</span></span>

Jerusalem was so fortified that all thought it impregnable. It therefore
could only have been the hand of God, not the force of man, which
overthrew it.

[Lamentations 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 4:13</span></span>

prophets--the false prophets ([Jer
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md), [Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021).md). Supply the sense thus: "For
the sins . . . these calamities have befallen her."

shed the blood of the just-- ([Mat
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031.md), [Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md). This received its full
fulfilment in the slaying of Messiah and the Jews' consequent dispersion
([Jam 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#006).md).

[Lamentations 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 4:14</span></span>

blind--with mental aberration.

polluted . . . with blood--both with blood of one another mutually shed
(for example, [Jer 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#034).md), and with
their blood shed by the enemy \[GLASSIUS\].

not touch . . . garments--as being defiled with blood ([Num
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#016).md).

[Lamentations 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 4:15</span></span>

They . . . them--"They," that is, "men" ([Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014).md). Even the very Gentiles,
regarded as unclean by the Jews, who were ordered most religiously to
avoid all defilements, cried unto the latter, "depart," as being
unclean: so universal was the defilement of the city by blood.

wandered--As the false prophets and their followers had "wandered" blind
with infatuated and idolatrous crime in the city ([Lam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014).md), so they must now "wander" among
the heathen in blind consternation with calamity.

they said--that is, the Gentiles said: it was said among the heathen,
"The Jews shall no more sojourn in their own land" \[GROTIUS\]; or,
wheresoever they go in their wandering exile, "they shall not stay long"
\[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\], ([Deu 28:65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065).md).

[Lamentations 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 4:16</span></span>

Ain and Pe are here transposed ([Lam
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016).md), as in [Lam
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016.md); [Lam
3:46-51](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#046.md).

anger--literally, "face"; it is the countenance which, by its
expression, manifests anger ([Psa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016).md). GESENIUS translates, "the
person of Jehovah"; Jehovah present; Jehovah Himself ([Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); [Sa2
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#011).md).

divided--dispersed the Jews.

they respected not . . . priests--This is the language of the Gentiles.
"The Jews have no hope of a return: for they respected not even good
priests" ([Ch2 24:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#019).md) \[GROTIUS\].
MAURER explains it, "They (the victorious foe) regard not the (Jewish)
priests when imploring their pity" ([Lam
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#012).md). The evident antithesis to "As
for us" ([Lam 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017).md) and the language
of "the heathen" at the close of [Lam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md), of which [Lam
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#016.md) is the continuation, favor the
former view.

[Lamentations 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 4:17</span></span>

As for us--This translation forms the best antithesis to the language of
the heathen ([Lam 4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015).md). CALVIN
translates, "While as yet we stood as a state, our eyes failed," &c.

watched for a nation that could not save us--Egypt ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md); [Isa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#007.md); [Jer
37:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005).md).

[Lamentations 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 4:18</span></span>

They--the Chaldeans.

cannot go--without danger.

[Lamentations 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 4:19</span></span>

The last times just before the taking of the city. There was no place of
escape; the foe intercepted those wishing to escape from the
famine-stricken city, "on the mountains and in the wilderness."

swifter . . . than . . . eagles--the Chaldean cavalry ([Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013).md).

pursued--literally, "to be hot"; then, "to pursue hotly" ([Gen
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#036).md). Thus they pursued and overtook
Zedekiah ([Jer 52:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#008).md).

[Lamentations 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 4:20</span></span>

breath . . . anointed of . . . Lord--our king, with whose life ours was
bound up. The original reference seems to have been to Josiah ([Ch2
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025).md), killed in battle with
Pharaoh-necho; but the language is here applied to Zedekiah, who, though
worthless, was still lineal representative of David, and type of
Messiah, the "Anointed." Viewed personally the language is too favorable
to apply to him.

live among the heathen--Under him we hoped to live securely, even in
spite of the surrounding heathen nations \[GROTIUS\].

[Lamentations 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 4:21</span></span>

Rejoice--at our calamities ([Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md). This is a prophecy that Edom
should exult over the fall of Jerusalem. At the same time it is implied,
Edom's joy shall be short-lived. Ironically she is told, Rejoice while
thou mayest ([Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009).md).

cup--for this image of the confounding effects of God's wrath, see [Jer
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md); [Jer
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md), [Jer
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md); as to Edom, Jer. 49:7-22.

[Lamentations 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 4:22</span></span>

([Isa 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002).md). Thou hast been punished
enough: the end of thy punishment is at hand.

no more carry thee . . . into captivity--that is, by the Chaldeans. The
Romans carried them away subsequently. The full accomplishment of this
prophecy must therefore refer to the Jews' final restoration.

discover--By the severity of His punishments on thee, God shall let men
see how great was thy sin ([Jer
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010).md). God "covers" sin when He
forgives it ([Psa 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001.md), [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005).md). He "discovers," or "reveals,"
it, when He punishes it ([Job 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#027).md).
[Jer 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#010.md) shows that Margin is wrong,
"carry captive" (this rendering is as in [Nah
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007); compare "discovered," Margin.md).
