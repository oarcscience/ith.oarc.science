### [Revelation Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 14:1</span></span>

THE LAMB SEEN ON ZION WITH THE 144,000. THEIR SONG. THE GOSPEL
PROCLAIMED BEFORE THE END BY ONE ANGEL: THE FALL OF BABYLON, BY ANOTHER:
THE DOOM OF THE BEAST WORSHIPPERS, BY A THIRD. THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE
DEAD IN THE LORD. THE HARVEST. THE VINTAGE. (Rev. 14:1-20)

a--A, B, C, Coptic, and ORIGEN read, "the."

Lamb . . . on . . . Sion--having left His position "in the midst of the
throne," and now taking His stand on Sion.

his Father's name--A, B, and C read, "His name and His Father's name."

in--Greek, "upon." God's and Christ's name here answers to the seal
"upon their foreheads" in [Rev 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md). As
the 144,000 of Israel are "the first-fruits" ([Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004).md), so "the harvest" ([Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015).md) is the general assembly of
Gentile saints to be translated by Christ as His first act in assuming
His kingdom, prior to His judgment ([Rev
16:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017), the last seven vials.md) on the
Antichristian world, in executing which His saints shall share. As Noah
and Lot were taken seasonably out of the judgment, but exposed to the
trial to the last moment \[DE BURGH\], so those who shall reign with
Christ shall first suffer with Him, being delivered out of the
judgments, but not out of the trials. The Jews are meant by "the saints
of the Most High": against them Antichrist makes war, changing their
times and laws; for true Israelites cannot join in the idolatry of the
beast, any more than true Christians. The common affliction will draw
closely together, in opposing the beast's worship, the Old Testament and
New Testament people of God. Thus the way is paved for Israel's
conversion. This last utter scattering of the holy people's power leads
them, under the Spirit, to seek Messiah, and to cry at His approach,
"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord."

[Revelation 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 14:2</span></span>

from--Greek, "out of."

voice of many waters--as is the voice of Himself, such also is the voice
of His people.

I heard the voice of harpers--A, B, C, and ORIGEN read, "the voice which
I heard (was) as of harpers."

[Revelation 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 14:3</span></span>

sung--Greek, "sing."

as it were--So A, C, and Vulgate read. It is "as it were" a new song;
for it is, in truth, as old as God's eternal purpose. But B, Syriac,
Coptic, ORIGEN, and ANDREAS omit these words.

new song-- ([Rev 5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).md). The song is
that of victory after conflict with the dragon, beast, and false
prophet: never sung before, for such a conflict had never been fought
before; therefore new: till now the kingdom of Christ on earth had been
usurped; they sing the new song in anticipation of His blood-bought
kingdom with His saints.

four beasts--rather, as Greek, "four living creatures." The harpers and
singers evidently include the 144,000: so the parallel proves ([Rev
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002).md), where the same act is
attributed to the general company of the saints, the harvest ([Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015).md) from all nations. Not as
ALFORD, "the harpers and song are in heaven, but the 144,000 are on
earth."

redeemed--literally, "purchased." Not even the angels can learn that
song, for they know not experimentally what it is to have "come out of
the great tribulation, and washed their robes white in the blood of the
Lamb" ([Rev 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014).md).

[Revelation 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 14:4</span></span>

virgins--spiritually ([Mat 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001).md); in
contrast to the apostate Church, Babylon ([Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008).md), spiritually "a harlot" ([Rev
17:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md); [Isa
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021.md); contrast [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md); [Eph
5:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025).md). Their not being defiled with
women means they were not led astray from Christian faithfulness by the
tempters who jointly constitute the spiritual "harlot."

follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth--in glory, being especially near
His person; the fitting reward of their following Him so fully on earth.

redeemed--"purchased."

being the--rather, "as a first-fruit." Not merely a "first-fruit" in the
sense in which all believers are so, but Israel's 144,000 elect are the
first-fruit, the Jewish and Gentile elect Church is the harvest; in a
further sense, the whole of the transfigured and translated Church which
reigns with Christ at His coming, is the first-fruit, and the consequent
general ingathering of Israel and the nations, ending in the last
judgment, is the full and final harvest.

[Revelation 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 14:5</span></span>

guile--So ANDREAS in one copy. But A, B, C, ORIGEN, and ANDREAS in other
copies read, "falsehood." Compare with English Version reading [Psa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md); [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md); [Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md).

for--So B, Syriac, Coptic, ORIGEN, and ANDREAS read. But A and C omit.

without fault--Greek, "blameless": in respect to the sincerity of their
fidelity to Him. Not absolutely, and in themselves blameless; but
regarded as such on the ground of His righteousness in whom alone they
trusted, and whom they faithfully served by His Spirit in them. The
allusion seems to be to [Psa 15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md).
Compare [Rev 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), "stood on Mount
Sion."

before the throne of God--A, B, C, Syriac, Coptic, ORIGEN, and ANDREAS
omit these words. The oldest Vulgate manuscript supports them.

[Revelation 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 14:6</span></span>

Here begins the portion relating to the Gentile world, as the former
portion related to Israel. Before the end the Gospel is to be preached
for a WITNESS unto all nations: not that all nations shall be converted,
but all nations shall have had the opportunity given them of deciding
whether they will be for, or against, Christ. Those thus preached to are
"they that dwell (so A, Coptic, and Syriac read. But B, C, ORIGEN,
Vulgate, CYPRIAN, 312, read, 'SIT,' compare [Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016.md); [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079), having their settled home.md) on
the earth," being of earth earthy: this last season of grace is given
them, if yet they may repent, before "judgment" ([Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007).md) descends: if not, they will be
left without excuse, as the world which resisted the preaching of Noah
in the the hundred twenty years "while the long-suffering of God
waited." "So also the prophets gave the people a last opportunity of
repentance before the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, and our Lord
and His apostles before the Roman destruction of the holy city"
\[AUBERLEN\]. The Greek for "unto" (epi, in A and C) means literally,
"upon," or "over," or "in respect to" ([Mar
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#012.md); [Heb
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#013).md). So also "TO every nation"
(Greek, "epi," in A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, ORIGEN, ANDREAS, CYPRIAN,
and PRIMASIUS). This, perhaps, implies that the Gospel, though diffused
over the globe, shall not come savingly unto any save the elect. The
world is not to be evangelized till Christ shall come: meanwhile, God's
purpose is "to take out of the Gentiles a people for His name," to be
witnesses of the effectual working of His Spirit during the
counter-working of "the mystery of iniquity."

everlasting gospel--the Gospel which announces the glad tidings of the
everlasting kingdom of Christ, about to ensue immediately after the
"judgment" on Antichrist, announced as imminent in [Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md). As the former angel "flying
through the midst of heaven" ([Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013).md) announced "woe," so this angel
"flying in the midst of heaven" announced joy. The three angels making
this last proclamation of the Gospel, the fall of Babylon ([Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008).md), the harlot, and the judgment on
the beast worshippers ([Rev 14:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009).md),
the voice from heaven respecting the blessed dead ([Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013).md), the vision of the Son of man
on the cloud ([Rev 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011).md), the harvest
([Rev 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015).md), and the vintage ([Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018).md), form the compendious summary,
amplified in detail in the rest of the book.

[Revelation 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 14:7</span></span>

Fear God--the forerunner to embracing the love of God manifested in the
Gospel. Repentance accompanies faith.

give glory to him--and not to the beast (compare [Rev
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#004.md); [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016).md).

the hour of his judgment--"The hour" implies the definite time.
"Judgment," not the general judgment, but that up on Babylon, the beast,
and his worshippers ([Rev 14:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008).md).

worship him that made heaven--not Antichrist (compare [Act
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015).md).

sea . . . fountains--distinguished also in [Rev
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#008.md), [Rev
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#010.md).

[Revelation 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 14:8</span></span>

another--So Vulgate. But A, B, Syriac, and ANDREAS add, "a second";
"another, a second angel."

Babylon--here first mentioned; identical with the harlot, the apostate
Church; distinct from the beast, and judged separately.

is fallen--anticipation of [Rev 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md).
A, Vulgate, Syriac, and ANDREAS support the second "is fallen." But B,
C, and Coptic omit it.

that great city--A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic omit "city." Then
translate, "Babylon the great." The ulterior and exhaustive fulfilment
of [Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md).

because--So ANDREAS. But A, C, Vulgate, and Syriac read, "which." B and
Coptic omit it. Even reading "which," we must understand it as giving
the reason of her fall.

all nations--A, B and C read, "all the nations."

the wine of the wrath of her fornication--the wine of the wrath of God,
the consequence of her fornication. As she made the nations drunk with
the wine of her fornication, so she herself shall be made drunk with the
wine of God's wrath.

[Revelation 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 14:9</span></span>

A, B, C, and ANDREAS read, "another, a third angel." Compare with this
verse [Rev 13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md).

[Revelation 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 14:10</span></span>

The same--Greek, "he also," as the just and inevitable retribution.

wine of . . . wrath of God-- ([Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008).md).

without mixture--whereas wine was so commonly mixed with water that to
mix wine is used in Greek for to pour out wine; this wine of God's wrath
is undiluted; there is no drop of water to cool its heat. Naught of
grace or hope is blended with it. This terrible threat may well raise us
above the fear of man's threats. This unmixed cup is already mingled and
prepared for Satan and the beast's followers.

indignation--Greek, "orges," "abiding wrath," But the Greek for "wrath"
above (Greek, "thumou") is boiling indignation, from (Greek, "thuo") a
root meaning "to boil"; this is temporary ebullition of anger; that is
lasting \[AMMONIUS\], and accompanied with a purpose of vengeance
\[ORIGEN on [Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md)\].

tormented . . . in the presence of . . . angels-- ([Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md); [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md); [Psa
139:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021.md); [Isa
66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024).md). God's enemies are regarded by
the saints as their enemies, and when the day of probation is past,
their mind shall be so entirely one with God's, that they shall rejoice
in witnessing visibly the judicial vindication of God's righteousness in
sinners' punishment.

[Revelation 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 14:11</span></span>

for ever and ever--Greek, "unto ages of ages."

no rest day nor night--Contrast the very different sense in which the
same is said of the four living creatures in heaven, "They rest not day
and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"; yet they do "rest" in another
sense; they rest from sin and sorrow, weariness and weakness, trial and
temptation ([Rev 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013).md); the lost have
no rest from sin and Satan, terror, torment, and remorse.

[Revelation 14:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 14:12</span></span>

Here, &c.--resumed from [Rev 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md);
see on [Rev 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#010.md). In the fiery ordeal
of persecution which awaits all who will not worship the beast, the
faith and patience of the followers of God and Jesus shall be put to the
test, and proved.

patience--Greek, "hupomene," "patient, persevering endurance." The
second "here" is omitted in A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and
PRIMASIUS. Translate, "Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep,"
&c.

the faith of Jesus--the faith which has Jesus for its object.

[Revelation 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 14:13</span></span>

Encouragement to cheer those persecuted under the beast.

Write--to put it on record for ever.

Blessed--in resting from their toils, and, in the case of the saints
just before alluded to as persecuted by the beast, in resting from
persecutions. Their full blessedness is now "from henceforth," that is,
FROM THIS TIME, when the judgment on the beast and the harvest
gatherings of the elect are imminent. The time so earnestly longed for
by former martyrs is now all but come; the full number of their fellow
servants is on the verge of completion; they have no longer to "rest
(the same Greek as here, anapausis) yet for a little season," their
eternal rest, or cessation from toils ([Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md); Greek, "anesis," relaxation after
hardships. [Heb 4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md), sabbatism of
rest; and Greek, "catapausis," akin to the Greek here) is close at hand
now. They are blessed in being about to sit down to the marriage supper
of the Lamb ([Rev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009).md), and in having
part in the first resurrection ([Rev
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006).md), and in having right to the tree
of life ([Rev 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014).md). In [Rev
14:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md) follows the explanation of
why they are pronounced "blessed" now in particular, namely, the Son of
man on the cloud is just coming to gather them in as the harvest ripe
for garner.

Yea, saith the Spirit--The words of God the Father (the "voice from
heaven") are echoed back and confirmed by the Spirit (speaking in the
Word, [Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md); [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md); and in the saints, [Co2
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#005.md); [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014).md). All "God's promises in Christ
are yea" ([Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md).

unto me--omitted in A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic.

that they may--The Greek includes also the idea, They are blessed, in
that they SHALL rest from their toils (so the Greek).

and--So B and ANDREAS read. But A, C, Vulgate, and Syriac read "for."
They rest from their toils because their time for toil is past; they
enter on the blessed rest because of their faith evinced by their works
which, therefore, "follow WITH (so the Greek) them." Their works are
specified because respect is had to the coming judgment, wherein every
man shall be "judged according to his works." His works do not go before
the believer, nor even go by his side, but follow him at the same time
that they go with him as a proof that he is Christ's.

[Revelation 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 14:14</span></span>

crown--Greek, "stephanon," "garland" of victory; not His diadem as a
king. The victory is described in detail, [Rev
19:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md).

one sat--"one sitting," Greek, "cathemenon homoion," is the reading of
A, B, C, Vulgate, and Coptic.

[Revelation 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 14:15</span></span>

Thrust in--Greek, "Send." The angel does not command the "Son of man"
([Rev 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014).md), but is the mere
messenger announcing to the Son the will of God the Father, in whose
hands are kept the times and the seasons.

thy sickle--alluding to [Mar 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#029.md),
where also it is "sendeth the sickle." The Son sends His sickle-bearing
angel to reap the righteous when fully ripe.

harvest--the harvest crop. By the harvest-reaping the elect righteous
are gathered out; by the vintage the Antichristian offenders are removed
out of the earth, the scene of Christ's coming kingdom. The Son of man
Himself, with a golden crown, is introduced in the harvest-gathering of
the elect, a mere angel in the vintage ([Rev
14:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018).md).

is ripe--literally, "is dried." Ripe for glory.

[Revelation 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 14:16</span></span>

thrust in--Greek, "cast."

[Revelation 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 14:17</span></span>

out of the temple . . . in heaven-- ([Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019).md).

[Revelation 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 14:18</span></span>

from the altar--upon which were offered the incense-accompanied prayers
of all saints, which bring down in answer God's fiery judgment on the
Church's foes, the fire being taken from the altar and cast upon the
earth.

fully ripe--Greek, "come to their acme"; ripe for punishment.

[Revelation 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 14:19</span></span>

"The vine" is what is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not
what God looked for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes"
(Isa. 5:1-30). The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of
heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment.
Compare the emblem, [Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md); [Isa
63:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md); [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md).

[Revelation 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 14:20</span></span>

without the city--Jerusalem. The scene of the blood-shedding of Christ
and His people shall be also the scene of God's vengeance on the
Antichristian foe. Compare the "horsemen," [Rev
9:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#016.md).

blood--answering to the red wine. The slaughter of the apostates is what
is here spoken of, not their eternal punishment.

even unto the horse bridles--of the avenging "armies of heaven."

by the space of a thousand . . . six hundred furlongs--literally, "a
thousand six hundred furlongs off" \[W. KELLY\]. Sixteen hundred is a
square number; four by four by one hundred. The four quarters, north,
south, east, and west, of the Holy Land, or else of the world (the
completeness and universality of the world-wide destruction being hereby
indicated). It does not exactly answer to the length of Palestine as
given by JEROME, one hundred sixty Roman miles. BENGEL thinks the valley
of Kedron, between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, is meant, the
torrent in that valley being about to be discolored with blood to the
extent of sixteen hundred furlongs. This view accords with Joel's
prophecy that the valley of Jehoshaphat is to be the scene of the
overthrow of the Antichristian foes.
