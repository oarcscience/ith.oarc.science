### [Exodus Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 24:3</span></span>

DELIVERY OF THE LAW AND COVENANT. (Exo. 24:1-18)

Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord--The rehearsal
of the foregoing laws and the ten commandments, together with the
promises of special blessings in the event of their obedience, having
drawn forth from the people a unanimous declaration of their consent, it
was forthwith recorded as the conditions of the national covenant. The
next day preparations were made for having it (the covenant) solemnly
ratified, by building an altar and twelve pillars; the altar
representing God, and the pillars the tribes of Israel--the two parties
in this solemn compact--while Moses acted as typical mediator.

[Exodus 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 24:5</span></span>

young men--priests ([Exo 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022).md),
probably the oldest sons of particular families, who acted under the
direction of Moses.

oxen--Other animals, though not mentioned, were offered in sacrifice
([Heb 9:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018).md).

[Exodus 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 24:6</span></span>

Moses took half of the blood . . . sprinkled--Preliminary to this was
the public reading of the law and the renewed acceptance of the terms by
the people; then the sprinkling of the blood was the sign of solemn
ratification--half on each party in the transaction.

[Exodus 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">exo 24:8</span></span>

Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people--probably on the
twelve pillars, as representing the people (also the book, [Heb
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019).md), and the act was accompanied by
a public proclamation of its import. It was setting their seal to the
covenant (compare [Co1 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025).md). It must
have been a deeply impressive, as well as instructive scene, for it
taught the Israelites that the covenant was made with them only through
the sprinkling of blood--that the divine acceptance of themselves and
services, was only by virtue of an atoning sacrifice, and that even the
blessings of the national covenant were promised and secured to them
only through grace. The ceremonial, however, had a further and higher
significance, as is shown by the apostle (see as above).

[Exodus 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 24:9</span></span>

Then went up Moses, and Aaron--in obedience to a command given ([Exo
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md); also [Exo
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#024).md), previous to the religious
engagement of the people, now described.

Nadab, and Abihu--the two oldest sons of Aaron \[[Exo
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#023.md)\].

seventy of the elders--a select number; what was the principle of
selection is not said; but they were the chief representatives, the most
conspicuous for official rank and station, as well as for their probity
and weight of character in their respective tribes.

[Exodus 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">exo 24:10</span></span>

And they saw the God of Israel--That there was no visible form or
representation of the divine nature, we have expressly intimated ([Deu
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015).md). But a symbol or emblem of His
glory was distinctly, and at a distance, displayed before those chosen
witnesses. Many think, however, that in this private scene was
discovered, amid the luminous blaze, the faint adumbrated form of the
humanity of Christ ([Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md); compare
[Gal 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024).md).

sapphire--one of the most valuable and lustrous of the precious gems--of
a sky-blue or light azure color and frequently chosen to describe the
throne of God (see [Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026.md); [Eze
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001).md).

[Exodus 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">exo 24:11</span></span>

upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand--The
"nobles," that is, the elders, after the sprinkling of the blood, were
not inspired with terror in presence of the calm, benign, radiant symbol
of the divine majesty; so different from the terrific exhibitions at the
giving of the law. The report of so many competent witnesses would tend
to confirm the people's faith in the divine mission of Moses.

eat and drink--feasted on the peace offering--on the remnants of the
late sacrifices and libations. This feast had a prophetic bearing,
intimating God's dwelling with men.

[Exodus 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 24:12</span></span>

I will give thee tables of stone--The ten commandments, which had
already been spoken, were to be given in a permanent form. Inscribed on
stone, for greater durability, by the hand of God Himself, they were
thus authenticated and honored above the judicial or ceremonial parts of
the law.

[Exodus 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">exo 24:13</span></span>

Moses went up into the mount of God--He was called to receive the divine
transcript. Joshua was taken a little higher, and it would be a great
comfort for the leader to have his company during the six days he was in
patient waiting for the call on the seventh or sabbath day.

[Exodus 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 24:14</span></span>

he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us--There is a circular
valley or hollow a good way up on the brow of Jebel Musa, which was
their halting place, while he alone was privileged to ascend the highest
peak. The people stood below, as in the "outer court," the elders in the
"holy place," Moses, as a type of Christ, in "the holy of holies."

[Exodus 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 24:18</span></span>

Moses went into the midst of the cloud--the visible token of God's
presence. Divine grace animated and supported him to enter with holy
boldness.

Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights--The six days spent
in waiting are not included. During that protracted period he was
miraculously supported ([Deu 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#009).md), on
a peak scarcely thirty paces in compass.
