### [1 Peter Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 2:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS. (1Pe. 2:1-25)

laying aside--once for all: so the Greek aorist expresses as a garment
put off. The exhortation applies to Christians alone, for in none else
is the new nature existing which, as "the inward man" ([Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016).md) can cast off the old as an
outward thing, so that the Christian, through the continual renewal of
his inward man, can also exhibit himself externally as a new man. But to
unbelievers the demand is addressed, that inwardly, in regard to the
nous (mind), they must become changed, meta-noeisthai (re-pent)
\[STEIGER\]. The "therefore" resumes the exhortation begun in [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md). Seeing that ye are born again of
an incorruptible seed, be not again entangled in evil, which "has no
substantial being, but is an acting in contrariety to the being formed
in us" \[THEOPHYLACT\]. "Malice," &c., are utterly inconsistent with the
"love of the brethren," unto which ye have "purified your souls" ([Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md). The vices here are those which
offend against the BROTHERLY LOVE inculcated above. Each succeeding one
springs out of that which immediately precedes, so as to form a
genealogy of the sins against love. Out of malice springs guile; out of
guile, hypocrises (pretending to be what we are not, and not showing
what we really are; the opposite of "love unfeigned," and "without
dissimulation"); out of hypocrisies, envies of those to whom we think
ourselves obliged to play the hypocrite; out of envies, evil-speaking,
malicious, envious detraction of others. Guile is the permanent
disposition; hypocrisies the acts flowing from it. The guileless knows
no envy. Compare [Pe1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md), "sincere,"
Greek, "guileless." "Malice delights in another's hurt; envy pines at
another's good; guile imparts duplicity to the heart; hypocrisy
(flattery) imparts duplicity to the tongue; evil-speakings wound the
character of another" \[AUGUSTINE\].

[1 Peter 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 2:2</span></span>

new-born babes--altogether without "guile" ([Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001).md). As long as we are here we are
"babes," in a specially tender relation to God ([Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md). The childlike spirit is
indispensable if we would enter heaven. "Milk" is here not elementary
truths in contradistinction to more advanced Christian truths, as in
[Co1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002.md); [Heb
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md); but in contrast to "guile,
hypocrisies," &c. ([Pe1 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001).md); the
simplicity of Christian doctrine in general to the childlike spirit. The
same "word of grace" which is the instrument in regeneration, is the
instrument also of building up. "The mother of the child is also its
natural nurse" \[STEIGER\]. The babe, instead of chemically analyzing,
instinctively desires and feeds on the milk; so our part is not
self-sufficient rationalizing and questioning, but simply receiving the
truth in the love of it ([Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025).md).

desire--Greek, "have a yearning desire for," or "longing after," a
natural impulse to the regenerate, "for as no one needs to teach
new-born babes what food to take, knowing instinctively that a table is
provided for them in their mother's breast," so the believer of himself
thirsts after the word of God (Psa. 119:1-176). Compare TATIUS' language
as to Achilles.

sincere--Greek, "guileless." Compare [Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md), "laying aside guile." IRENÃ†US
says of heretics. They mix chalk with the milk. The article, "the,"
implies that besides the well-known pure milk, the Gospel, there is no
other pure, unadulterated doctrine; it alone can make us guileless ([Pe1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001).md).

of the word--Not as ALFORD, "spiritual," nor "reasonable," as English
Version in [Rom 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md). The Greek
"logos" in Scripture is not used of the reason, or mind, but of the
WORD; the preceding context requires that "the word" should be meant
here; the adjective "logikos" follows the meaning of the noun logos,
"word." [Jam 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#021.md), "Lay apart all
filthiness . . . and receive with meekness the engrafted WORD," is
exactly parallel, and confirms English Version here.

grow--The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "grow unto salvation."
Being BORN again unto salvation, we are also to grow unto salvation. The
end to which growth leads is perfected salvation. "Growth is the measure
of the fulness of that, not only rescue from destruction, but positive
blessedness, which is implied in salvation" \[ALFORD\].

thereby--Greek, "in it"; fed on it; in its strength ([Act
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#014).md). "The word is to be desired
with appetite as the cause of life, to be swallowed in the hearing, to
be chewed as cud is by rumination with the understanding, and to be
digested by faith" \[TERTULLIAN\].

[1 Peter 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 2:3</span></span>

Peter alludes to [Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md). The first
"tastes" of God's goodness are afterwards followed by fuller and happier
experiences. A taste whets the appetite \[BENGEL\].

gracious--Greek, "good," benignant, kind; as God is revealed to us in
Christ, "the Lord" ([Pe1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md), we who
are born again ought so to be good and kind to the brethren ([Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md). "Whosoever has not tasted the
word to him it is not sweet it has not reached the heart; but to them
who have experienced it, who with the heart believe, 'Christ has been
sent for me and is become my own: my miseries are His, and His life
mine,' it tastes sweet" \[LUTHER\].

[1 Peter 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 2:4</span></span>

coming--drawing near (same Greek as here, [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md) by faith continually; present
tense: not having come once for all at conversion.

stone--Peter (that is, a stone, named so by Christ) desires that all
similarly should be living stones BUILT ON CHRIST, THE TRUE
FOUNDATION-STONE; compare his speech in [Act
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md). An undesigned coincidence and
mark of genuineness. The Spirit foreseeing the Romanist perversion of
[Mat 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md) (compare [Mat
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#016.md), "Son of the LIVING God," which
coincides with his language here, "the LIVING stone"), presciently makes
Peter himself to refuse it. He herein confirms Paul's teaching. Omit the
as unto of English Version. Christ is positively termed the "living
stone"; living, as having life in Himself from the beginning, and as
raised from the dead to live evermore ([Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018).md) after His rejection by men, and
so the source of life to us. Like no earthly rock, He lives and gives
life. Compare [Co1 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004.md), and the type,
[Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md); [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md).

disallowed--rejected, reprobated; referred to also by Christ Himself:
also by Paul; compare the kindred prophecies, [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md).

chosen of God--literally, "with (or 'in the presence and judgment of')
God elect," or, "chosen out" ([Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md). Many are alienated from the
Gospel, because it is not everywhere in favor, but is on the contrary
rejected by most men. Peter answers that, though rejected by men, Christ
is peculiarly the stone of salvation honored by God, first so designated
by Jacob in his deathbed prophecy.

[1 Peter 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 2:5</span></span>

Ye also, as lively stones--partaking of the name and life which is in
"THE LIVING STONE" ([Pe1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md); [Co1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011).md). Many names which belong to
Christ in the singular are assigned to Christians in the plural. He is
"THE SON," "High Priest," "King," "Lamb"; they, "sons," "priests,"
"kings," "sheep," "lambs." So the Shulamite called from Solomon
\[BENGEL\].

are built up--Greek, "are being built up," as in [Eph
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#022.md). Not as ALFORD, "Be ye built up."
Peter grounds his exhortations, [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md), [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md), &c., on their conscious sense of
their high privileges as living stones in the course of being built up
into a spiritual house (that is, "the habitation of the Spirit").

priesthood--Christians are both the spiritual temple and the priests of
the temple. There are two Greek words for "temple"; hieron (the sacred
place), the whole building, including the courts wherein the sacrifice
was killed; and naos (the dwelling, namely, of God), the inner shrine
wherein God peculiarly manifested Himself, and where, in the holiest
place, the blood of the slain sacrifice was presented before Him. All
believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the dwelling of God
(and are called the "naos," Greek, not the hieron) and priests unto God
([Rev 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md). The minister is not, like
the Jewish priest (Greek, "hiercus"), admitted nearer to God than the
people, but merely for order's sake leads the spiritual services of the
people. Priest is the abbreviation of presbyter in the Church of England
Prayer Book, not corresponding to the Aaronic priest (hiereus, who
offered literal sacrifices). Christ is the only literal hiereus-priest
in the New Testament through whom alone we may always draw near to God.
Compare [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md), "a royal
priesthood," that is, a body of priest-kings, such as was Melchisedec.
The Spirit never, in New Testament, gives the name hiereus, or
sacerdotal priest, to ministers of the Gospel.

holy--consecrated to God.

spiritual sacrifices--not the literal one of the mass, as the Romish
self-styled disciples of Peter teach. Compare [Isa
56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007.md), which compare with "acceptable
to God" here; [Psa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md); [Psa
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md); [Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017.md), [Psa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md); [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md); [Phi
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md). "Among spiritual sacrifices the
first place belongs to the general oblation of ourselves. For never can
we offer anything to God until we have offered ourselves ([Co2
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#005).md) in sacrifice to Him. There follow
afterwards prayers, giving of thanks, alms deeds, and all exercises of
piety" \[CALVIN\]. Christian houses of worship are never called temples
because the temple was a place for sacrifice, which has no place in the
Christian dispensation; the Christian temple is the congregation of
spiritual worshippers. The synagogue (where reading of Scripture and
prayer constituted the worship) was the model of the Christian house of
worship (compare Note, see on [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md), Greek, "synagogue"; [Act
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021).md). Our sacrifices are those of
prayer, praise, and self-denying services in the cause of Christ ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009), end.md).

by Jesus Christ--as our mediating High Priest before God. Connect these
words with "offer up." Christ is both precious Himself and makes us
accepted \[BENGEL\]. As the temple, so also the priesthood, is built on
Christ ([Pe1 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md) \[BEZA\].
Imperfect as are our services, we are not with unbelieving timidity,
which is close akin to refined self-righteousness, to doubt their
acceptance THROUGH CHRIST. After extolling the dignity of Christians he
goes back to CHRIST as the sole source of it.

[1 Peter 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 2:6</span></span>

Wherefore also--The oldest manuscripts read, "Because that." The
statement above is so "because it is contained in Scripture."

Behold--calling attention to the glorious announcement of His eternal
counsel.

elect--so also believers ([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md),
"chosen," Greek, "elect generation").

precious--in Hebrew, [Isa 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), "a
corner-stone of preciousness." See on [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md). So in [Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md), Christ is said to be, to
believers, "precious," Greek, "preciousness."

confounded--same Greek as in [Rom 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md)
(Peter here as elsewhere confirming Paul's teaching. See Introduction;
also [Rom 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011).md), "ashamed." In [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), "make haste," that is, flee in
sudden panic, covered with the shame of confounded hopes.

[1 Peter 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 2:7</span></span>

Application of the Scripture just quoted first to the believer, then to
the unbeliever. On the opposite effects of the same Gospel on different
classes, compare [Joh 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md); [Co2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md).

precious--Greek, "THE preciousness" ([Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006).md). To you believers belongs the
preciousness of Christ just mentioned.

disobedient--to the faith, and so disobedient in practice.

the stone which . . . head of . . . corner-- ([Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022).md). Those who rejected the STONE
were all the while in spite of themselves unconsciously contributing to
its becoming Head of the corner. The same magnet has two poles, the one
repulsive, the other attractive; so the Gospel has opposite effects on
believers and unbelievers respectively.

[1 Peter 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 2:8</span></span>

stone of stumbling, &c.--quoted from [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md). Not merely they stumbled, in
that their prejudices were offended; but their stumbling implies the
judicial punishment of their reception of Messiah; they hurt themselves
in stumbling over the corner-stone, as "stumble" means in [Jer
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#016.md); [Dan
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#019.md).

at the word--rather, join "being disobedient to the word"; so [Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md).

whereunto--to penal stumbling; to the judicial punishment of their
unbelief. See above.

also--an additional thought; God's ordination; not that God ordains or
appoints them to sin, but they are given up to "the fruit of their own
ways" according to the eternal counsel of God. The moral ordering of the
world is altogether of God. God appoints the ungodly to be given up unto
sin, and a reprobate mind, and its necessary penalty. "Were appointed,"
Greek, "set," answers to "I lay," Greek, "set," [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md). God, in the active, is said to
appoint Christ and the elect (directly). Unbelievers, in the passive,
are said to be appointed (God acting less directly in the appointment of
the sinner's awful course) \[BENGEL\]. God ordains the wicked to
punishment, not to crime \[J. CAPPEL\]. "Appointed" or "set" (not here
"FORE-ordained") refers, not to the eternal counsel so directly, as to
the penal justice of God. Through the same Christ whom sinners rejected,
they shall be rejected; unlike believers, they are by God appointed unto
wrath as FITTED for it. The lost shall lay all the blame of their ruin
on their own sinful perversity, not on God's decree; the saved shall
ascribe all the merit of their salvation to God's electing love and
grace.

[1 Peter 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 2:9</span></span>

Contrast in the privileges and destinies of believers. Compare the
similar contrast with the preceding context.

chosen--"elect" of God, even as Christ your Lord is.

generation--implying the unity of spiritual origin and kindred of
believers as a class distinct from the world.

royal--kingly. Believers, like Christ, the antitypical Melchisedec, are
at once kings and priests. Israel, in a spiritual sense, was designed to
be the same among the nations of the earth. The full realization on
earth of this, both to the literal and the spiritual Israel, is as yet
future.

holy nation--antitypical to Israel.

peculiar people--literally, "a people for an acquisition," that is, whom
God chose to be peculiarly His: [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md), "purchased," literally,
"acquired." God's "peculiar treasure" above others.

show forth--publish abroad. Not their own praises but His. They have no
reason to magnify themselves above others for once they had been in the
same darkness, and only through God's grace had been brought to the
light which they must henceforth show forth to others.

praises--Greek, "virtues," "excellencies": His glory, mercy ([Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010).md), goodness (Greek, [Pe1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003.md); [Num
14:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#017.md); [Isa
63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007).md). The same term is applied to
believers, [Pe2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md).

of him who hath called you-- ([Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).md).

out of darkness--of heathen and even Jewish ignorance, sin, and misery,
and so out of the dominion of the prince of darkness.

marvellous--Peter still has in mind [Psa
118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023.md).

light--It is called "His," that is, God's. Only the (spiritual) light is
created by God, not darkness. In [Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md), it is physical darkness and
evil, not moral, that God is said to create, the punishment of sin, not
sin itself. Peter, with characteristic boldness, brands as darkness what
all the world calls light; reason, without the Holy Spirit, in spite of
its vaunted power, is spiritual darkness. "It cannot apprehend what
faith is: there it is stark blind; it gropes as one that is without
eyesight, stumbling from one thing to another, and knows not what it
does" \[LUTHER\].

[1 Peter 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 2:10</span></span>

Adapted from [Hos 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md); [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md). Peter plainly confirms Paul, who
quotes the passage as implying the call of the Gentiles to become
spiritually that which Israel had been literally, "the people of God."
Primarily, the prophecy refers to literal Israel, hereafter to be fully
that which in their best days they were only partially, God's people.

not obtained mercy--literally, "who were men not compassionated."
Implying that it was God's pure mercy, not their merits, which made the
blessed change in their state; a thought which ought to kindle their
lively gratitude, to be shown with their life, as well as their lips.

[1 Peter 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 2:11</span></span>

As heretofore he exhorted them to walk worthily of their calling, in
contradistinction to their own former walk, so now he exhorts them to
glorify God before unbelievers.

Dearly beloved--He gains their attention to his exhortation by assuring
them of his love.

strangers and pilgrims-- ([Pe1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017).md).
Sojourners, literally, settlers having a house in a city without being
citizens in respect to the rights of citizenship; a picture of the
Christian's position on earth; and pilgrims, staying for a time in a
foreign land. FLACIUS thus analyzes the exhortation: (1) Purify your
souls (a) as strangers on earth who must not allow yourselves to be kept
back by earthly lusts, and (b) because these lusts war against the
soul's salvation. (2) Walk piously among unbelievers (a) so that they
may cease to calumniate Christians, and (b) may themselves be converted
to Christ.

fleshly lusts--enumerated in [Gal
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md), &c. Not only the gross appetites
which we have in common with the brutes, but all the thoughts of the
unrenewed mind.

which--Greek, "the which," that is, inasmuch as being such as "war." &c.
Not only do they impede, but they assail \[BENGEL\].

the soul--that is, against the regenerated soul; such as were those now
addressed. The regenerated soul is besieged by sinful lusts. Like Samson
in the lap of Delilah, the believer, the moment that he gives way to
fleshly lusts, has the locks of his strength shorn, and ceases to
maintain that spiritual separation from the world and the flesh of which
the Nazarite vow was the type.

[1 Peter 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 2:12</span></span>

conversation--"behavior"; "conduct." There are two things in which
"strangers and pilgrims" ought to bear themselves well: (1) the
conversation or conduct, as subjects ([Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013).md), servants ([Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018).md), wives ([Pe1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001).md), husbands ([Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007).md), all persons under all
circumstances ([Pe1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008)); (2.md)
confession of the faith ([Pe1
3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015).md). Each of the two is derived
from the will of God. Our conversation should correspond to our
Saviour's condition; this is in heaven, so ought that to be.

honest--honorable, becoming, proper ([Pe1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016).md). Contrast "vain conversation,"
[Pe1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md). A good walk does not make
us pious, but we must first be pious and believe before we attempt to
lead a good course. Faith first receives from God, then love gives to
our neighbor \[LUTHER\].

whereas they speak against you--now ([Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015).md), that they may, nevertheless, at
some time or other hereafter glorify God. The Greek may be rendered,
"Wherein they speak against you . . . that (herein) they may, by your
good works, which on a closer inspection they shall behold, glorify
God." The very works "which on more careful consideration, must move the
heathen to praise God, are at first the object of hatred and raillery"
\[STEIGER\].

evildoers--Because as Christians they could not conform to heathenish
customs, they were accused of disobedience to all legal authority; in
order to rebut this charge, they are told to submit to every ordinance
of man (not sinful in itself).

by--owing to.

they shall behold--Greek, "they shall be eye-witnesses of"; "shall
behold on close inspection"; as opposed to their "ignorance" ([Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015).md) of the true character of
Christians and Christianity, by judging on mere hearsay. The same Greek
verb occurs in a similar sense in [Pe1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#002.md). "Other men narrowly look at (so
the Greek implies) the actions of the righteous" \[BENGEL\]. TERTULLIAN
contrasts the early Christians and the heathen: these delighted in the
bloody gladiatorial spectacles of the amphitheater, whereas a Christian
was excommunicated if he went to it at all. No Christian was found in
prison for crime, but only for the faith. The heathen excluded slaves
from some of their religious services, whereas Christians had some of
their presbyters of the class of slaves. Slavery silently and gradually
disappeared by the power of the Christian law of love, "Whatsoever ye
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." When the pagans
deserted their nearest relatives in a plague, Christians ministered to
the sick and dying. When the Gentiles left their dead unburied after a
battle and cast their wounded into the streets, the disciples hastened
to relieve the suffering.

glorify--forming a high estimate of the God whom Christians worship,
from the exemplary conduct of Christians themselves. We must do good,
not with a view to our own glory, but to the glory of God.

the day of visitation--of God's grace; when God shall visit them in
mercy.

[1 Peter 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 2:13</span></span>

every ordinance of man--"every human institution" \[ALFORD\], literally,
"every human creation." For though of divine appointment, yet in the
mode of nomination and in the exercise of their authority, earthly
governors are but human institutions, being of men, and in relation to
men. The apostle speaks as one raised above all human things. But lest
they should think themselves so ennobled by faith as to be raised above
subordination to human authorities, he tells them to submit themselves
for the sake of Christ, who desires you to be subject, and who once was
subject to earthly rulers Himself, though having all things subject to
Him, and whose honor is at stake in you as His earthly representatives.
Compare [Rom 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005.md), "Be subject for
conscience' sake."

king--The Roman emperor was "supreme" in the Roman provinces to which
this Epistle was addressed. The Jewish zealots refused obedience. The
distinction between "the king as supreme" and "governors sent by him"
implies that "if the king command one thing, and the subordinate
magistrate another, we ought rather to obey the superior" \[AUGUSTINE in
GROTIUS\]. Scripture prescribes nothing upon the form of government, but
simply subjects Christians to that everywhere subsisting, without
entering into the question of the right of the rulers (thus the Roman
emperors had by force seized supreme authority, and Rome had, by
unjustifiable means, made herself mistress of Asia), because the de
facto governors have not been made by chance, but by the providence of
God.

[1 Peter 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 2:14</span></span>

governors--subordinate to the emperor, "sent," or delegated by
CÃ&brvbr;sar to preside over the provinces.

for the punishment--No tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as that
some appearance of equity was not maintained in it; however corrupt a
government be, God never suffers it to be so much so as not to be better
than anarchy \[CALVIN\]. Although bad kings often oppress the good, yet
that is scarcely ever done by public authority (and it is of what is
done by public authority that Peter speaks), save under the mask of
right. Tyranny harasses many, but anarchy overwhelms the whole state
\[HORNEIUS\]. The only justifiable exception is in cases where obedience
to the earthly king plainly involves disobedience to the express command
of the King of kings.

praise of them that do well--Every government recognizes the excellence
of truly Christian subjects. Thus PLINY, in his letter to the Emperor
Trajan, acknowledges, "I have found in them nothing else save a perverse
and extravagant superstition." The recognition in the long run mitigates
persecution ([Pe1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013).md).

[1 Peter 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 2:15</span></span>

Ground of his directing them to submit themselves ([Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013).md).

put to silence--literally, "to muzzle," "to stop the mouth."

ignorance--spiritual not having "the knowledge of God," and therefore
ignorant of the children of God, and misconstruing their acts;
influenced by mere appearances, and ever ready to open their mouths,
rather than their eyes and ears. Their ignorance should move the
believer's pity, not his anger. They judge of things which they are
incapable of judging through unbelief (compare [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012).md). Maintain such a walk that they
shall have no charge against you, except touching your faith; and so
their minds shall be favorably disposed towards Christianity.

[1 Peter 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 2:16</span></span>

As free--as "the Lord's freemen," connected with [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md), doing well as being free.
"Well-doing" ([Pe1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015).md) is the
natural fruit of being freemen of Christ, made free by "the truth" from
the bondage of sin. Duty is enforced on us to guard against
licentiousness, but the way in which it is to be fulfilled, is by love
and the holy instincts of Christian liberty. We are given principles,
not details.

not using--Greek, "not as having your liberty for a veil (cloak) of
badness, but as the servants of God," and therefore bound to submit to
every ordinance of man ([Pe1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013).md)
which is of God's appointment.

[1 Peter 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 2:17</span></span>

Honour all men--according to whatever honor is due in each case. Equals
have a respect due to them. Christ has dignified our humanity by
assuming it; therefore we should not dishonor, but be considerate to and
honor our common humanity, even in the very humblest. The first "honor"
is in the Greek aorist imperative, implying, "In every case render
promptly every man's due" \[ALFORD\]. The second is in the present
tense, implying, Habitually and continually honor the king. Thus the
first is the general precept; the three following are its three great
divisions.

Love--present: Habitually love with the special and congenial affection
that you ought to feel to brethren, besides the general love to all men.

Fear God . . . the king--The king is to be honored; but God alone, in
the highest sense, feared.

[1 Peter 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 2:18</span></span>

Servants--Greek, "household servants": not here the Greek for "slaves."
Probably including freedmen still remaining in their master's house.
Masters were not commonly Christians: he therefore mentions only the
duties of the servants. These were then often persecuted by their
unbelieving masters. Peter's special object seems to be to teach them
submission, whatever the character of the masters might be. Paul not
having this as his prominent design, includes masters in his monitions.

be subject--Greek, "being subject": the participle expresses a
particular instance of the general exhortation to good conduct, [Pe1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md), of which the first particular
precept is given [Pe1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md), "Submit
yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake." The general
exhortation is taken up again in [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md); and so the participle [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018.md), "being subject," is joined to
the hortatory imperatives going before, namely, "abstain," "submit
yourselves." "honor all men."

with--Greek, "in."

all--all possible: under all circumstances, such as are presently
detailed.

fear--the awe of one subject: God, however, is the ultimate object of
the "fear": fear "for the Lord's sake" ([Pe1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013).md), not merely slavish fear of
masters.

good--kind.

gentle--indulgent towards errors: considerate: yielding, not exacting
all which justice might demand.

froward--perverse: harsh. Those bound to obey must not make the
disposition and behavior of the superior the measure of the fulfilment
of their obligations.

[1 Peter 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 2:19</span></span>

Reason for subjection even to froward masters.

thankworthy-- ([Luk 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#033).md). A course
out of the common, and especially praiseworthy in the eyes of God: not
as Rome interprets, earning merit, and so a work of supererogation
(compare [Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md).

for conscience toward God--literally, "consciousness of God": from a
conscientious regard to God, more than to men.

endure--Greek, "patiently bear up under": as a superimposed burden
\[ALFORD\].

grief--Greek, "griefs."

[1 Peter 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe1 2:20</span></span>

what--Greek, "what kind of."

glory--what peculiar merit.

buffeted--the punishment of slaves, and suddenly inflicted \[BENGEL\].

this is--Some oldest manuscripts read, "for." Then the translation is,
"But if when . . . ye take it patiently (it is a glory), for this is
acceptable."

acceptable--Greek, "thankworthy," as in [Pe1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019.md).

[1 Peter 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 2:21</span></span>

Christ's example a proof that patient endurance under undeserved
sufferings is acceptable with God.

hereunto--to the patient endurance of unmerited suffering ([Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009).md). Christ is an example to
servants, even as He was once in "the form of a servant."

called--with a heavenly calling, though slaves.

for us--His dying for us is the highest exemplification of "doing well"
([Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md). Ye must patiently suffer,
being innocent, as Christ also innocently suffered (not for Himself, but
for us). The oldest manuscripts for "us . . . us," read, "you . . . for
you." Christ's sufferings, while they are for an example, were also
primarily sufferings "for us," a consideration which imposes an
everlasting obligation on us to please Him.

leaving--behind: so the Greek: on His departure to the Father, to His
glory.

an example--Greek, "a copy," literally, "a writing copy" set by masters
for their pupils. Christ's precepts and sermons were the transcript of
His life. Peter graphically sets before servants those features
especially suited to their case.

follow--close upon: so the Greek.

his steps--footsteps, namely, of His patience combined with innocence.

[1 Peter 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 2:22</span></span>

Illustrating Christ's well-doing ([Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md) though suffering.

did--Greek aorist. "Never in a single instance did" \[ALFORD\]. Quoted
from [Isa 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md), end, Septuagint.

neither--nor yet: not even \[ALFORD\]. Sinlessness as to the mouth is a
mark of perfection. Guile is a common fault of servants. "If any boast
of his innocency, Christ surely did not suffer as an evildoer"
\[CALVIN\], yet He took it patiently ([Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md). On Christ's sinlessness,
compare [Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026.md).

[1 Peter 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pe1 2:23</span></span>

Servants are apt to "answer again" ([Tit
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009).md). Threats of divine judgment
against oppressors are often used by those who have no other arms, as
for instance, slaves. Christ, who as Lord could have threatened with
truth, never did so.

committed himself--or His cause, as man in His suffering. Compare the
type, [Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020.md). In this Peter seems
to have before his mind [Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md).
Compare [Rom 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md), on our
corresponding duty. Leave your case in His hands, not desiring to make
Him executioner of your revenge, but rather praying for enemies. God's
righteous judgment gives tranquillity and consolation to the oppressed.

[1 Peter 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pe1 2:24</span></span>

his own self--there being none other but Himself who could have done it.
His voluntary undertaking of the work of redemption is implied. The
Greek puts in antithetical juxtaposition, OUR, and His OWN SELF, to mark
the idea of His substitution for us. His "well-doing" in His sufferings
is set forth here as an example to servants and to us all ([Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md).

bare--to sacrifice: carried and offered up: a sacrificial term. [Isa
53:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md), "He bare the sin of many":
where the idea of bearing on Himself is the prominent one; here the
offering in sacrifice is combined with that idea. So the same Greek
means in [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005.md).

our sins--In offering or presenting in sacrifice (as the Greek for
"bare" implies) His body, Christ offered in it the guilt of our sins
upon the cross, as upon the altar of God, that it might be expiated in
Him, and so taken away from us. Compare [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md), "Thou shalt make His soul an
offering for sin." Peter thus means by "bare" what the Syriac takes two
words to express, to bear and to offer: (1) He hath borne our sins laid
upon Him \[namely, their guilt, curse, and punishment\]; (2) He hath so
borne them that He offered them along with Himself on the altar. He
refers to the animals upon which sins were first laid, and which were
then offered thus laden \[VITRINGA\]. Sin or guilt among the Semitic
nations is considered as a burden lying heavily upon the sinner
\[GESENIUS\].

on the tree--the cross, the proper place for One on whom the curse was
laid: this curse stuck to Him until it was legally (through His death as
the guilt-bearer) destroyed in His body: thus the handwriting of the
bond against us is cancelled by His death.

that we being dead to sins--the effect of His death to "sin" in the
aggregate, and to all particular "sins," namely, that we should be as
entirely delivered from them, as a slave that is dead is delivered from
service to his master. This is our spiritful standing through faith by
virtue of Christ's death: our actual mortification of particular sins is
in proportion to the degree of our effectually being made conformable to
His death. "That we should die to the sins whose collected guilt Christ
carried away in His death, and so LIVE TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS (compare
[Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md). 'My righteous servant
shall justify many'), the gracious relation to God which He has brought
in" \[STEIGER\].

by whose stripes--Greek, "stripe."

ye were healed--a paradox, yet true. "Ye servants (compare 'buffeted,'
'the tree,' [Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020.md), [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md) often bear the strife; but it is
not more than your Lord Himself bore; learn from Him patience in
wrongful sufferings.

[1 Peter 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pe1 2:25</span></span>

([Isa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006)..md)

For--Assigning their natural need of healing ([Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024).md).

now--Now that the atonement for all has been made, the foundation is
laid for individual conversion: so "ye are returned," or "have become
converted to," &c.

Shepherd and Bishop--The designation of the pastors and elders of the
Church belongs in its fullest sense to the great Head of the Church,
"the good Shepherd." As the "bishop" oversees (as the Greek term means),
so "the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous" ([Pe1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#012).md). He gives us His spirit and
feeds and guides us by His word. "Shepherd," Hebrew, "Parnas," is often
applied to kings, and enters into the composition of names, as
"Pharnabazus."
