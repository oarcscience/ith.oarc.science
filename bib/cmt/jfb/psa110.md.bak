### [Psalms Chapter 110](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 110:1</span></span>

The explicit application of this Psalm to our Saviour, by Him ([Mat
22:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042).md) and by the apostles ([Act
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#034.md); [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md); [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013).md), and their frequent reference to
its language and purport ([Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Phi
2:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md), leave no doubt of its
purely prophetic character. Not only was there nothing in the position
or character, personal or official, of David or any other descendant, to
justify a reference to either, but utter severance from the royal office
of all priestly functions (so clearly assigned the subject of this
Psalm) positively forbids such a reference. The Psalm celebrates the
exaltation of Christ to the throne of an eternal and increasing kingdom,
and a perpetual priesthood ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013).md), involving the subjugation of
His enemies and the multiplication of His subjects, and rendered
infallibly certain by the word and oath of Almighty God. ([Psa
110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md)

The Lord said--literally, "A saying of the Lord," (compare [Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001).md), a formula, used in prophetic or
other solemn or express declarations.

my Lord--That the Jews understood this term to denote the Messiah their
traditions show, and Christ's mode of arguing on such an assumption
([Mat 22:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#044).md) also proves.

Sit . . . at my right hand--not only a mark of honor ([Kg1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019).md), but also implied participation
of power ([Psa 45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009.md); [Mar
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md).

Sit--as a king ([Psa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#010).md), though
the position rather than posture is intimated (compare [Act
7:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055).md).

until I make, &c.--The dominion of Christ over His enemies, as
commissioned by God, and entrusted with all power ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md) for their subjugation, will
assuredly be established ([Co1
15:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024).md). This is neither His
government as God, nor that which, as the incarnate Saviour, He
exercises over His people, of whom He will ever be Head.

thine enemies thy footstool--an expression taken from the custom of
Eastern conquerors (compare [Jos
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md); [Jdg
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007).md) to signify a complete subjection.

[Psalms 110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 110:2</span></span>

the rod of thy strength--the rod of correction ([Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md); [Isa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#015.md); [Jer
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012).md), by which Thy strength will be
known. This is His Word of truth ([Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md), converting some and confounding
others (compare [Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008).md).

out of Zion--or, the Church, in which God dwells by His Spirit, as once
by a visible symbol in the tabernacle on Zion (compare [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md).

rule thou, &c.--over enemies now conquered.

in the midst--once set upon, as by ferocious beasts ([Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016).md), now humbly, though
reluctantly, confessed as Lord ([Phi
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 110:3</span></span>

Thy people . . . willing--literally, "Thy people (are) free will
offerings"; for such is the proper rendering of the word "willing,"
which is a plural noun, and not an adjective (compare [Exo
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#002.md); [Psa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#006).md), also a similar form ([Jdg
5:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#002).md).

in the day of thy power--Thy people freely offer themselves ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).md) in Thy service, enlisting under
Thy banner.

in the beauties of holiness--either as in [Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md), the loveliness of a spiritual
worship, of which the temple service, in all its material splendors, was
but a type; or more probably, the appearance of the worshippers, who, in
this spiritual kingdom, are a nation of kings and priests ([Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005).md), attending this Priest and King,
clothed in those eminent graces which the beautiful vestments of the
Aaronic priests ([Lev 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004).md) typified.
The last very obscure clause--

from the womb . . . youth--may, according to this view, be thus
explained: The word "youth" denotes a period of life distinguished for
strength and activity (compare [Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009).md) --the "dew" is a constant emblem
of whatever is refreshing and strengthening ([Pro
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#012.md); [Hos
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005).md). The Messiah, then, as leading
His people, is represented as continually in the vigor of youth,
refreshed and strengthened by the early dew of God's grace and Spirit.
Thus the phrase corresponds as a member of a parallelism with "the day
of thy power" in the first clause. "In the beauties of holiness" belongs
to this latter clause, corresponding to "Thy people" in the first, and
the colon after "morning" is omitted. Others prefer: Thy youth, or
youthful vigor, or body, shall be constantly refreshed by successive
accessions of people as dew from the early morning; and this accords
with the New Testament idea that the Church is Christ's body (compare
[Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 110:4</span></span>

The perpetuity of the priesthood, here asserted on God's oath,
corresponds with that of the kingly office just explained.

after the order-- ([Heb 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#015).md) after
the similitude of Melchisedek, is fully expounded by Paul, to denote not
only perpetuity, appointment of God, and a royal priesthood, but also
the absence of priestly descent and succession, and superiority to the
Aaronic order.

[Psalms 110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 110:5</span></span>

at thy right hand--as [Psa 109:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#031.md),
upholding and aiding, which is not inconsistent with [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), where the figure denotes
participation of power, for here He is presented in another aspect, as a
warrior going against enemies, and sustained by God.

strike through--smite or crush.

kings--not common men, but their rulers, and so all under them ([Psa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md), [Psa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 110:6</span></span>

The person is again changed. The Messiah's conquests are described,
though His work and God's are the same. As after a battle, whose field
is strewn with corpses, the conqueror ascends the seat of empire, so
shall He "judge," or "rule," among many nations, and subdue

the head--or (as used collectively for "many") "the heads," over many
lands.

wound--literally, "smite," or "crush" (compare [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 110:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 110:7</span></span>

As a conqueror, "faint, yet pursuing" \[[Jdg
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#004.md)\], He shall be refreshed by the
brook in the way, and pursue to completion His divine and glorious
triumphs.
