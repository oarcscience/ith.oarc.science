<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 22:1</span></span>

(Pro. 22:1-29)

A good name-- ([Job 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008), Hebrew.md);
"good" is supplied here from [Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md).

loving favour--kind regard, that is, of the wise and good.

[Proverbs 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 22:2</span></span>

Before God all are on the same footing ([Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031.md); [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005).md).

[Proverbs 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 22:3</span></span>

are punished--that is, for their temerity; for the evil is not
necessarily punitive, as the prudent might otherwise be its objects.

[Proverbs 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 22:4</span></span>

humility and the fear of the Lord--are in apposition; one produces the
other. On the results, compare [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016.md); [Pro
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018.md).

[Proverbs 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 22:5</span></span>

he that . . . them--Those who properly watch over their own souls are
thus preserved from the dangers which attend the way of perverse men
([Pro 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017).md).

[Proverbs 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 22:6</span></span>

Train--initiate, or early instruct.

the way--literally, "his way," that selected for him in which he should
go; for early training secures habitual walking in it.

[Proverbs 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 22:7</span></span>

The influence of wealth sets aside moral distinctions is implied, and,
of course, disapproved (compare [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006.md); [Pro
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014), &c..md).

[Proverbs 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 22:8</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018.md); [Psa
109:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016.md); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md).

the rod . . . fail--His power to do evil will be destroyed.

[Proverbs 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 22:9</span></span>

a bountiful eye--that is, a beneficent disposition.

for he giveth . . . poor--His acts prove it.

[Proverbs 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 22:10</span></span>

Cast out--or drive away. Scorners foster strife by taunts and revilings.

[Proverbs 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 22:11</span></span>

(Compare Margin).

pureness of heart--and gentle, kind words win favor, even from kings.

[Proverbs 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 22:12</span></span>

knowledge--its principles and possessors.

overthroweth--utterly confounds and destroys the wicked.

[Proverbs 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 22:13</span></span>

Frivolous excuses satisfy the indolent man's conscience.

[Proverbs 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 22:14</span></span>

The mouth--or flattering speeches ([Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md); [Pro
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005).md) ensnare man, as pits, beasts. God

expressed in two verses instead of one (see Introduction).

[Proverbs 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 22:18</span></span>

These lessons must be laid up in the mind, and

fitted--or better, "fixed" in the lips so as to be ever ready.

[Proverbs 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 22:19</span></span>

That . . . Lord--This is the design of the instruction.

[Proverbs 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 22:22</span></span>

Here follow ten precepts of two verses each. Though men fail to defend
the poor, God will ([Pro 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005.md); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005).md).

in the gate--place of public gathering ([Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004.md); [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012).md).

[Proverbs 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 22:24</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012.md); [Pro
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014).md).

[Proverbs 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 22:25</span></span>

a snare . . . soul--The unsuspecting are often misled by bad company.

[Proverbs 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 22:26</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001.md); [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018).md).

[Proverbs 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 22:27</span></span>

should he take, &c.--that is, the creditor.

[Proverbs 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 22:28</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010).md). Do not entrench
on others ([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md); [Deu
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017).md).

[Proverbs 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 22:29</span></span>

Success rewards diligence ([Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004.md);
[Pro 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005).md).
