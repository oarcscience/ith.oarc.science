### [Proverbs Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001)

[Proverbs 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 22:1</span></span>

(Pro. 22:1-29)

A good name-- ([Job 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008), Hebrew);
"good" is supplied here from [Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001).

loving favour--kind regard, that is, of the wise and good.

[Proverbs 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 22:2</span></span>

Before God all are on the same footing ([Pro
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#031); [Pro
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005)).

[Proverbs 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 22:3</span></span>

are punished--that is, for their temerity; for the evil is not
necessarily punitive, as the prudent might otherwise be its objects.

[Proverbs 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 22:4</span></span>

humility and the fear of the Lord--are in apposition; one produces the
other. On the results, compare [Pro
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#016); [Pro
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#018).

[Proverbs 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 22:5</span></span>

he that . . . them--Those who properly watch over their own souls are
thus preserved from the dangers which attend the way of perverse men
([Pro 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 22:6</span></span>

Train--initiate, or early instruct.

the way--literally, "his way," that selected for him in which he should
go; for early training secures habitual walking in it.

[Proverbs 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 22:7</span></span>

The influence of wealth sets aside moral distinctions is implied, and,
of course, disapproved (compare [Pro
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006); [Pro
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#014), &c.).

[Proverbs 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 22:8</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018); [Psa
109:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#016); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

the rod . . . fail--His power to do evil will be destroyed.

[Proverbs 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 22:9</span></span>

a bountiful eye--that is, a beneficent disposition.

for he giveth . . . poor--His acts prove it.

[Proverbs 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 22:10</span></span>

Cast out--or drive away. Scorners foster strife by taunts and revilings.

[Proverbs 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 22:11</span></span>

(Compare Margin).

pureness of heart--and gentle, kind words win favor, even from kings.

[Proverbs 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 22:12</span></span>

preserve--or guard.

knowledge--its principles and possessors.

overthroweth--utterly confounds and destroys the wicked.

[Proverbs 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 22:13</span></span>

Frivolous excuses satisfy the indolent man's conscience.

[Proverbs 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 22:14</span></span>

The mouth--or flattering speeches ([Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003); [Pro
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#005)) ensnare man, as pits, beasts. God
makes their own sin their punishment.

[Proverbs 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 22:15</span></span>

is bound--or firmly fixed. Chastisement deters from crime and so leads
to reformation of principle.

[Proverbs 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 22:16</span></span>

These two vices pertain to the same selfish feeling. Both are deservedly
odious to God and incur punishment.

[Proverbs 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 22:17</span></span>

Here begins another division of the book, marked by those encouragements
to the pursuit of wisdom, which are found in the earlier chapters. It
will be observed that at Pro. 22:22-24:12, the proverbs are generally
expressed in two verses instead of one (see Introduction).

[Proverbs 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 22:18</span></span>

These lessons must be laid up in the mind, and

fitted--or better, "fixed" in the lips so as to be ever ready.

[Proverbs 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 22:19</span></span>

That . . . Lord--This is the design of the instruction.

[Proverbs 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 22:20</span></span>

excellent things--or probably of former times.

counsels and knowledge--both advice and instruction.

[Proverbs 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 22:21</span></span>

Specially he desires to secure accuracy, so that his pupil may teach
others.

[Proverbs 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 22:22</span></span>

Here follow ten precepts of two verses each. Though men fail to defend
the poor, God will ([Pro 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#005); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005)).

in the gate--place of public gathering ([Job
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#004); [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)).

[Proverbs 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 22:24</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 2:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#012); [Pro
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014)).

[Proverbs 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 22:25</span></span>

a snare . . . soul--The unsuspecting are often misled by bad company.

[Proverbs 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 22:26</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001); [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018)).

[Proverbs 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 22:27</span></span>

should he take, &c.--that is, the creditor.

[Proverbs 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">pro 22:28</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010)). Do not entrench
on others ([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014); [Deu
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017)).

[Proverbs 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">pro 22:29</span></span>

Success rewards diligence ([Pro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#004);
[Pro 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#005)).
