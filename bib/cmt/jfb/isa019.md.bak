Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 19:1</span></span>

(Isa. 19:1-25)

burden--(See on [Isa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001).md).

upon . . . cloud-- ([Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md); [Psa
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010).md).

come into Egypt--to inflict vengeance. "Egypt," in Hebrew, Misraim,
plural form, to express the two regions of Egypt. BUNSEN observes, The
title of their kings runs thus: "Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt."

idols--the bull, crocodile, &c. The idols poetically are said to be
"moved" with fear at the presence of one mightier than even they were
supposed to be ([Exo 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012.md); [Jer
43:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 19:2</span></span>

set--stir up. GESENIUS translates, "arm."

Egyptians against the Egyptians--Lower against Upper: and Saitic against
both. (See [Isa 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010).md). NEWTON refers
it to the civil wars between Apries and Amasis at the time of
Nebuchadnezzar's invasion; also between Tachos, Nectanebus, and the
Mendesians, just before Ochus subdued Egypt.

kingdom against kingdom--The Septuagint has "nome against nome"; Egypt
was divided into forty-two nomes or districts.

[Isaiah 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 19:3</span></span>

spirit--wisdom, for which Egypt was famed ([Isa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#002.md); [Kg1
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#030.md); [Act
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022).md); answering to "counsel" in the
parallel clause.

fail--literally, "be poured out," that is, be made void ([Jer
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007).md). They shall "seek" help from
sources that can afford none, "charmers," &c. ([Isa
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md).

charmers--literally, "those making a faint sound"; the soothsayers
imitated the faint sound which was attributed to the spirits of the dead
(see on [Isa 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 19:4</span></span>

cruel lord--"Sargon," in Hebrew it is lords; but plural is often used to
express greatness, where, one alone is meant ([Gen
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#002).md). The parallel word "king"
(singular) proves it. NEWTON makes the general reference to be to
Nebuchadnezzar, and a particular reference to Cambyses, son of Cyrus
(who killed the Egyptian god, Apis), and Ochus, Persian conquerors of
Egypt, noted for their "fierce cruelty." GESENIUS refers it to
Psammetichus, who had brought into Egypt Greek and other foreign
mercenaries to subdue the other eleven princes of the dodecarchy.

[Isaiah 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 19:5</span></span>

the sea--the Nile. Physical calamities, it is observed in history, often
accompany political convulsions ([Eze
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#012).md). The Nile shall "fail" to rise
to its wonted height, the result of which will be barrenness and famine.
Its "waters" at the time of the overflow resemble "a sea" \[PLINY,
Natural History, 85.11\]; and it is still called El-Bahr," "the sea," by
the Egyptians ([Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md); [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036).md). A public record is kept at
Cairo of the daily rise of the water at the proper time of overflow,
namely, August: if it rises to a less height than twelve cubits, it will
not overflow the land, and famine must be the result. So, also, when it
rises higher than sixteen; for the waters are not drained off in time
sufficient to sow the seed.

[Isaiah 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 19:6</span></span>

they shall turn the rivers--rather, "the streams shall become putrid";
that is, the artificial streams made for irrigation shall become
stagnant and offensive when the waters fail \[MAURER\]. HORSLEY, with
the Septuagint, translates, "And waters from the sea shall be drunk"; by
the failure of the river water they shall be reduced to sea water.

brooks of defence--rather, "canals of Egypt"; "canals," literally,
"Niles," Nile canals, the plural of the Egyptian term for the great
river. The same Hebrew word, Matzor, whence comes Mitzraim, expresses
Egypt, and a place of "defense." HORSLEY, as English Version translates
it, "embanked canals,"

reeds . . . flags--the papyrus. "Reed and rush"; utter withering.

[Isaiah 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 19:7</span></span>

paper-reeds--rather, pastures, literally, "places naked" of wood, and
famed for rich herbage, on the banks of the Nile \[GESENIUS\]. Compare
[Gen 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#010.md); [Deu
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#010.md). HORSLEY translates, "nakedness
upon the river," descriptive of the appearance of a river when its
bottom is bare and its banks stripped of verdure by long drought: so
Vulgate.

the brooks--the river.

mouth--rather, "the source" \[Vulgate\]. "Even close to the river's side
vegetation shall be so withered as to be scattered in the shape of
powder by the wind" (English Version, "driven away") \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 19:8</span></span>

fishers--The Nile was famed for fish ([Num
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#005).md); many would be thrown out of
employment by the failure of fishes.

angle--a hook. Used in the "brooks" or canals, as the "net" was in "the
waters" of the river itself.

[Isaiah 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 19:9</span></span>

fine flax--GESENIUS, for "fine," translates, "combed"; fine "linen" was
worn by the rich only ([Luk 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019).md).
Egypt was famous for it ([Exo 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#031.md);
[Kg1 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#028.md); [Pro
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#016.md); [Eze
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#007).md). The processes of its
manufacture are represented on the Egyptian tombs. Israel learned the
art in Egypt ([Exo 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036).md). The cloth
now found on the mummies was linen, as is shown by the microscope.
WILKINSON mentions linen from Egypt which has five hundred forty (or two
hundred seventy double) threads in one inch in the warp; whereas some
modern cambric has but a hundred sixty \[BARNES\].

networks--rather, white cloth ([Est
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#006.md); [Est
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 19:10</span></span>

in the purposes--rather, "the foundations," that is, "the nobles shall
be broken" or brought low: so [Isa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001.md); [Psa
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#003.md); compare [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md), "The princes--the stay of the
tribes. The Arabs call a prince "a pillar of the people" \[MAURER\].
"Their weaving-frames" \[HORSLEY\]. "Dykes" \[BARNES\].

all that make sluices, &c.--"makers of dams," made to confine the waters
which overflow from the Nile in artificial fish-ponds \[HORSLEY\].
"Makers of gain," that is, the common people who have to earn their
livelihood, as opposed to the "nobles" previously \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 19:11</span></span>

Zoan--The Greeks called it Tanis, a city of Lower Egypt, east of the
Tanitic arms of the Nile, now San; it was one the Egyptian towns nearest
to Palestine ([Num 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022).md), the scene
of Moses' miracles ([Psa 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md), [Psa
78:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043).md). It, or else Memphis, was the
capital under Sethos.

I am . . . son of the wise . . . kings--Ye have no advice to suggest to
Pharaoh in the crisis, notwithstanding that ye boast of descent from
wise and royal ancestors. The priests were the usual "counsellors" of
the Egyptian king. He was generally chosen from the priestly caste, or,
if from the warrior caste, he was admitted into the sacred order, and
was called a priest. The priests are, therefore, meant by the
expression, "son of the wise, and of ancient kings"; this was their
favorite boast (HERODOTUS, 2.141; compare [Amo
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014.md); [Act
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md); [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005).md). "Pharaoh" was the common name of
all the kings: Sethos, probably, is here meant.

[Isaiah 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 19:12</span></span>

let them know--that is, How is it that, with all their boast of knowing
the future \[DIODORUS, 1.81\], they do not know what Jehovah of hosts .
. .

[Isaiah 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 19:13</span></span>

Noph--called also Moph; Greek, Memphis ([Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006).md); on the western bank of the Nile,
capital of Lower Egypt, second only to Thebes in all Egypt: residence of
the kings, until the Ptolemies removed to Alexandria; the word means the
"port of the good" \[PLUTARCH\]. The military caste probably ruled in
it: "they also are deceived," in fancying their country secure from
Assyrian invasion.

stay of . . . tribes--rather, "corner-stone of her castes" \[MAURER\],
that is, the princes, the two ruling castes, the priests and the
warriors: image from a building which rests mainly on its corner-stones
(see on [Isa 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#010.md); [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md); [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md); [Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017.md), Margin; [Jdg
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#002.md); [Sa1
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#028.md), Margin; [Zac
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 19:14</span></span>

err in every work thereof--referring to the anarchy arising from their
internal feuds. HORSLEY translates, "with respect to all His (God's)
work"; they misinterpreted God's dealings at every step. "Mingled"
contains the same image as "drunken"; as one mixes spices with wine to
make it intoxicating ([Isa 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md); [Pro
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005).md), so Jehovah has poured among them
a spirit of giddiness, so that they are as helpless as a "drunken man."

[Isaiah 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 19:15</span></span>

work for Egypt--nothing which Egypt can do to extricate itself from the
difficulty.

head or tail--high or low ([Isa
19:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md), and [Isa
19:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008).md).

branch or rush--the lofty palm branch or the humble reed ([Isa
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md); [Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033).md).

[Isaiah 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 19:16</span></span>

like . . . women--timid and helpless ([Jer
51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md); [Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013).md).

shaking of . . . hand--His judgments by means of the invaders ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md), [Isa
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#032.md); [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 19:17</span></span>

Judah . . . terror unto Egypt--not by itself: but at this time Hezekiah
was the active subordinate ally of Assyria in its invasion of Egypt
under Sargon. Similarly to the alliance of Judah with Assyria here is
[Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md), where Josiah takes the
field against Pharaoh-nechoh of Egypt, probably as ally of Assyria
against Egypt \[G. V. SMITH\]. VITRINGA explains it that Egypt in its
calamities would remember that prophets of Judah had foretold them, and
so Judah would be "a terror unto Egypt."

thereof--of Judah.

it--Egypt.

[Isaiah 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 19:18</span></span>

In that day, &c.--Suffering shall lead to repentance. Struck with
"terror" and "afraid" ([Isa 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#017).md)
because of Jehovah's judgments, Egypt shall be converted to Him: nay,
even Assyria shall join in serving Him; so that Israel, Assyria, and
Egypt, once mutual foes, shall be bound together by the tie of a common
faith as one people. So a similar issue from other prophecies ([Isa
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#007.md); [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018).md).

five cities--that is, several cities, as in [Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md); [Isa
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#017.md); [Gen
43:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#034.md); [Lev
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#008.md). Rather, five definite cities of
Lower Egypt ([Isa 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011.md), [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013.md); [Isa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#004).md), which had close intercourse
with the neighboring Jewish cities \[MAURER\]; some say, Heliopolis,
Leontopolis (else Diospolis), Migdol, Daphne (Tahpanes), and Memphis.

language of Canaan--that is, of the Hebrews in Canaan, the language of
revelation; figuratively for, They shall embrace the Jewish religion: so
"a pure language" and conversion to God are connected in [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md); as also the first confounding and
multiplication of languages was the punishment of the making of gods at
Babel, other than the One God. Pentecost ([Act
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#004).md) was the counterpart of Babel: the
separation of nations is not to hinder the unity of faith; the full
realization of this is yet future ([Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009.md); [Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021).md). The next clause, "swear to the
Lord of Hosts," agrees with this view; that is, bind themselves to Him
by solemn covenant ([Isa 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md); [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013).md).

city of destruction--Onias; "city of the sun," that is, On, or
Heliopolis; he persuaded Ptolemy Philometer (149 B.C.) to let him build
a temple in the prefecture (nome) of Heliopolis, on the ground that it
would induce Jews to reside there, and that the very site was foretold
by Isaiah six hundred years before. The reading of the Hebrew text is,
however, better supported, "city of destruction"; referring to
Leontopolis, the site of Onias' temple: which casts a reproach on that
city because it was about to contain a temple rivalling the only
sanctioned temple, that at Jerusalem. MAURER, with some manuscripts,
reads "city of defense" or "deliverance"; namely, Memphis, or some such
city, to which God was about to send "a saviour" ([Isa
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020).md), to "deliver them."

[Isaiah 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 19:19</span></span>

altar--not for sacrifice, but as the "pillar" for memorial and worship
([Jos 22:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#022).md). Isaiah does not
contemplate a temple in Egypt: for the only legal temple was at
Jerusalem; but, like the patriarchs, they shall have altars in various
places.

pillar--such as Jacob reared ([Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018.md); [Gen
35:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#014).md); it was a common practice in
Egypt to raise obelisks commemorating divine and great events.

at the border--of Egypt and Judah, to proclaim to both countries the
common faith. This passage shows how the Holy Spirit raised Isaiah above
a narrow-minded nationality to a charity anticipatory of gospel
catholicity.

[Isaiah 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 19:20</span></span>

it--the altar and pillar.

a sign--(of the fulfilment of prophecy) to their contemporaries.

a witness--to their descendants.

unto the Lord--no longer, to their idols, but to Jehovah.

for they shall cry--or, "a sign . . . that they cried, . . . and He sent
to them a saviour"; probably, Alexander the Great (so "a great one"),
whom the Egyptians welcomed as a deliverer (Greek, Soter, a title of the
Ptolemies) out of the hands of the Persians, who under Cambyses had been
their "oppressors." At Alexandria, called from him, the Old Testament
was translated into Greek for the Greek-speaking Jews, who in large
numbers dwelt in Egypt under the Ptolemies, his successors. Messiah is
the antitype ultimately intended (compare [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010), "Egypt".md).

[Isaiah 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 19:21</span></span>

oblation--unbloody.

[Isaiah 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 19:22</span></span>

return--for heathen sin and idolatry are an apostasy from primitive
truth.

heal--as described ([Isa 19:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 19:23</span></span>

highway--free communication, resting on the highest basis, the common
faith of both ([Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Isa
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016).md). Assyria and Egypt were joined
under Alexander as parts of his empire: Jews and proselytes from both
met at the feasts of Jerusalem. A type of gospel times to come.

serve with--serve Jehovah with the Assyrians. So "serve" is used
absolutely ([Job 36:11](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 19:24</span></span>

third--The three shall be joined as one nation.

blessing--the source of blessings to other nations, and the object of
their benedictions.

in the midst of the land--rather, "earth" ([Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md). Judah is designed to be the
grand center of the whole earth ([Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 19:25</span></span>

Whom--rather, "Which," namely, "the land," or "earth," that is, the
people of it \[MAURER\].

my people--the peculiar designation of Israel, the elect people, here
applied to Egypt to express its entire admission to religious privileges
([Rom 9:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024.md); [Pe1
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md).

work of my hands--spiritually ([Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010).md).

In the reign of Sargon (722-715 B.C.), the successor of Shalmaneser, an
Assyrian invasion of Egypt took place. Its success is here foretold, and
hence a party among the Jews is warned of the folly of their
"expectation" of aid from Egypt or Ethiopia. At a later period ([Isa
18:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001).md), when Tirhakah of Ethiopia was
their ally, the Ethiopians are treated as friends, to whom God announces
the overthrow of the common Assyrian foe, Sennacherib. Egypt and
Ethiopia in this chapter ([Isa 20:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003).md)
are represented as allied together, the result no doubt of fear of the
common foe; previously they had been at strife, and the Ethiopian king
had, just before Sethos usurpation, withdrawn from occupation of part of
Lower Egypt. Hence, "Egypt" is mentioned alone in Isa. 19:1-25, which
refers to a somewhat earlier stage of the same event: a delicate mark of
truth. Sargon seems to have been the king who finished the capture of
Samaria which Shalmaneser began; the alliance of Hoshea with So or
Sabacho II of Ethiopia, and his refusal to pay the usual tribute,
provoked Shalmaneser to the invasion. On clay cylindrical seals found in
Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik, the name of Sabacho is deciphered; the
two seals are thought, from the inscriptions, to have been attached to
the treaty of peace between Egypt and Assyria, which resulted from the
invasion of Egypt by Sargon, described in this chapter; [Kg2
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#010.md) curiously confirms the view
derived from Assyrian inscriptions, that though Shalmaneser began,
Sargon finished the conquest of Samaria; "they took it" (compare [Kg2
17:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md). In Sargon's palace at
Khorsabad, inscriptions state that 27,280 Israelites were led captive by
the founder of the palace. While Shalmaneser was engaged in the siege of
Samaria, Sargon probably usurped the supreme power and destroyed him;
the siege began in 723 B.C., and ended in 721 B.C., the first year of
Sargon's reign. Hence arises the paucity of inscriptions of the two
predecessors of Sargon, Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser; the usurper
destroyed them, just as Tiglath-pileser destroyed those of Pul
(Sardanapalus), the last of the old line of Ninus; the names of his
father and grandfather, which have been deciphered in the palace of his
son Sennacherib, do not appear in the list of Assyrian kings, which
confirms the view that he was a satrap who usurped the throne. He was so
able a general that Hezekiah made no attempt to shake off the tribute
until the reign of Sennacherib; hence Judah was not invaded now as the
lands of the Philistines and Egypt were. After conquering Israel he sent
his general, Tartan, to attack the Philistine cities, "Ashdod," &c.,
preliminary to his invasion of Egypt and Ethiopia; for the line of march
to Egypt lay along the southwest coast of Palestine. The inscriptions
confirm the prophecy; they tell us he received tribute from a Pharaoh of
"Egypt"; besides destroying in part the Ethiopian "No-ammon," or Thebes
([Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008).md); also that he warred with
the kings of "Ashdod," Gaza, &c., in harmony with Isaiah here; a
memorial tablet of him is found in Cyprus also, showing that he extended
his arms to that island. His reign was six or seven years in duration,
722-715 B.C. \[G. V. SMITH\].
