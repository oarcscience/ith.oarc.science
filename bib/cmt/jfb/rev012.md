### [Revelation Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 12:1</span></span>

VISION OF THE WOMAN, HER CHILD, AND THE PERSECUTING DRAGON. (Rev.
12:1-17)

This episode (Rev. 12:1-15:8) describes in detail the persecution of
Israel and the elect Church by the beast, which had been summarily
noticed, [Rev 11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md), and the triumph
of the faithful, and torment of the unfaithful. So also the sixteenth
through twentieth chapters are the description in detail of the judgment
on the beast, &c., summarily noticed in [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013.md), [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md). The beast in [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md), &c., is shown not to be alone,
but to be the instrument in the hand of a greater power of darkness,
Satan. That this is so, appears from the time of the eleventh chapter
being the period also in which the events of the twelfth and thirteenth
chapters take place, namely, 1260 days ([Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md), [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md); [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md); compare [Rev
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002).md).

great--in size and significance.

wonder--Greek, "sign": significant of momentous truths.

in heaven--not merely the sky, but the heaven beyond just mentioned,
[Rev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md); compare [Rev
12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md).

woman clothed with the sun . . . moon under her feet--the Church, Israel
first, and then the Gentile Church; clothed with Christ, "the Sun of
righteousness." "Fair as the moon, clear as the sun." Clothed with the
Sun, the Church is the bearer of divine supernatural light in the world.
So the seven churches (that is, the Church universal, the woman) are
represented as light-bearing candlesticks ([Rev
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#012.md), [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020).md). On the other hand, the moon,
though standing above the sea and earth, is altogether connected with
them and is an earthly light: sea, earth, and moon represent the worldly
element, in opposition to the kingdom of God--heaven, the sun. The moon
cannot disperse the darkness and change it into-day: thus she represents
the world religion (heathenism) in relation to the supernatural world.
The Church has the moon, therefore, under her feet; but the stars, as
heavenly lights, on her head. The devil directs his efforts against the
stars, the angels of the churches, about hereafter to shine for ever.
The twelve stars, the crown around her head, are the twelve tribes of
Israel \[AUBERLEN\]. The allusions to Israel before accord with this:
compare [Rev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md), "the temple of
God"; "the ark of His testament." The ark lost at the Babylonian
captivity, and never since found, is seen in the "temple of God opened
in heaven," signifying that God now enters again into covenant with His
ancient people. The woman cannot mean, literally, the virgin mother of
Jesus, for she did not flee into the wilderness and stay there for 1260
days, while the dragon persecuted the remnant of her seed ([Rev
12:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013).md) \[DE BURGH\]. The sun, moon,
and twelve stars, are emblematical of Jacob, Leah, or else Rachel, and
the twelve patriarchs, that is, the Jewish Church: secondarily, the
Church universal, having under her feet, in due subordination, the ever
changing moon, which shines with a borrowed light, emblem of the Jewish
dispensation, which is now in a position of inferiority, though
supporting the woman, and also of the changeful things of this world,
and having on her head the crown of twelve stars, the twelve apostles,
who, however, are related closely to Israel's twelve tribes. The Church,
in passing over into the Gentile world, is (1) persecuted; (2) then
seduced, as heathenism begins to react on her. This is the key to the
meaning of the symbolic woman, beast, harlot, and false prophet. Woman
and beast form the same contrast as the Son of man and the beasts in
Daniel. As the Son of man comes from heaven, so the woman is seen in
heaven ([Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md). The two beasts
arise respectively out of the sea (compare [Dan
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003).md) and the earth ([Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md), [Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011).md): their origin is not of heaven,
but of earth earthy. Daniel beholds the heavenly Bridegroom coming
visibly to reign. John sees the woman, the Bride, whose calling is
heavenly, in the world, before the Lord's coming again. The
characteristic of woman, in contradistinction to man, is her being
subject, the surrendering of herself, her being receptive. This
similarly is man's relation to God, to be subject to, and receive from,
God. All autonomy of the human spirit reverses man's relation to God.
Woman-like receptivity towards God constitutes faith. By it the
individual becomes a child of God; the children collectively are viewed
as "the woman." Humanity, in so far as it belongs to God, is the woman.
Christ, the Son of the woman, is in [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md) emphatically called "the
MAN-child" (Greek, "huios arrheen," "male-child"). Though born of a
woman, and under the law for man's sake, He is also the Son of God, and
so the HUSBAND of the Church. As Son of the woman, He is "'Son of man";
as male-child, He is Son of God, and Husband of the Church. All who
imagine to have life in themselves are severed from Him, the Source of
life, and, standing in their own strength, sink to the level of
senseless beasts. Thus, the woman designates universally the kingdom of
God; the beast, the kingdom of the world. The woman of whom Jesus was
born represents the Old Testament congregation of God. The woman's
travail-pains ([Rev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002).md) represent
the Old Testament believers' ardent longings for the promised Redeemer.
Compare the joy at His birth ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md). As new Jerusalem (called also
"the woman," or "wife," [Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md),
[Rev 21:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009).md), with its twelve gates,
is the exalted and transfigured Church, so the woman with the twelve
stars is the Church militant.

[Revelation 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 12:2</span></span>

pained--Greek, "tormented" (basanizomene). DE BURGH explains this of the
bringing in of the first-begotten into the world AGAIN, when Israel
shall at last welcome Him, and when "the man-child shall rule all
nations with the rod of iron." But there is a plain contrast between the
painful travailing of the woman here, and Christ's second coming to the
Jewish Church, the believing remnant of Israel, "Before she travailed
she brought forth . . . a MAN-CHILD," that is, almost without
travail-pangs, she receives (at His second advent), as if born to her,
Messiah and a numerous seed.

[Revelation 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 12:3</span></span>

appeared--"was seen."

wonder--Greek, "semeion," "sign."

red--So A and Vulgate read. But B, C, and Coptic read, "of fire." In
either case, the color of the dragon implies his fiery rage as a
murderer from the beginning. His representative, the beast, corresponds,
having seven heads and ten horns (the number of horns on the fourth
beast of [Dan 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md); [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001).md). But there, ten crowns are on
the ten horns (for before the end, the fourth empire is divided into ten
kingdoms); here, seven crowns (rather, "diadems," Greek, "diademata,"
not stephanoi, "wreaths") are upon his seven heads. In [Dan
7:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md) the Antichristian powers up to
Christ's second coming are represented by four beasts, which have among
them seven heads, that is, the first, second, and fourth beasts having
one head each, the third, four heads. His universal dominion as prince
of this fallen world is implied by the seven diadems (contrast the "many
diadems on Christ's head," [Rev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md),
when coming to destroy him and his), the caricature of the seven Spirits
of God. His worldly instruments of power are marked by the ten horns,
ten being the number of the world. It marks his self-contradictions that
he and the beast bear both the number seven (the divine number) and ten
(the world number).

[Revelation 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 12:4</span></span>

drew--Greek, present tense, "draweth," "drags down." His dragging down
the stars with his tail (lashed back and forward in his fury) implies
his persuading to apostatize, like himself, and to become earthy, those
angels and also once eminent human teachers who had formerly been
heavenly (compare [Rev 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md); [Rev
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020.md); [Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012).md).

stood--"stands" \[ALFORD\]: perfect tense, Greek, "hesteken."

ready to be delivered--"about to bring forth."

for to devour, &c.--"that when she brought forth, he might devour her
child." So the dragon, represented by his agent Pharaoh (a name common
to all the Egyptian kings, and meaning, according to some, crocodile, a
reptile like the dragon, and made an Egyptian idol), was ready to devour
Israel's males at the birth of the nation. Antitypically the true
Israel, Jesus, when born, was sought for destruction by Herod, who slew
all the males in and around Bethlehem.

[Revelation 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 12:5</span></span>

man-child--Greek, "a son, a male." On the deep significance of this
term, see on [Rev 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001.md).

rule--Greek, "poimainein," "tend as a shepherd"; (see on [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).md).

rod of iron--A rod is for long-continued obstinacy until they submit
themselves to obedience \[BENGEL\]: [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md); [Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md), which passages prove the Lord
Jesus to be meant. Any interpretation which ignores this must be wrong.
The male son's birth cannot be the origin of the Christian state
(Christianity triumphing over heathenism under Constantine), which was
not a divine child of the woman, but had many impure worldly elements.
In a secondary sense, the ascending of the witnesses up to heaven
answers to Christ's own ascension, "caught up unto God, and unto His
throne": as also His ruling the nations with a rod of iron is to be
shared in by believers ([Rev 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027).md).
What took place primarily in the case of the divine Son of the woman,
shall take place also in the case of those who are one with Him, the
sealed of Israel ([Rev 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001).md), and the
elect of all nations, about to be translated and to reign with Him over
the earth at His appearing.

[Revelation 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 12:6</span></span>

woman fled--Mary's flight with Jesus into Egypt is a type of this.

where she hath--So C reads. But A and B add "there."

a place--that portion of the heathen world which has received
Christianity professedly, namely, mainly the fourth kingdom, having its
seat in the modern Babylon, Rome, implying that all the heathen world
would not be Christianized in the present order of things.

prepared of God--literally, "from God." Not by human caprice or fear,
but by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, the woman, the
Church, fled into the wilderness.

they should feed her--Greek, "nourish her." Indefinite for, "she should
be fed." The heathen world, the wilderness, could not nourish the
Church, but only afford her an outward shelter. Here, as in [Dan
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#026.md), and elsewhere, the third person
plural refers to the heavenly powers who minister from God nourishment
to the Church. As Israel had its time of first bridal love, on its first
going out of Egypt into the wilderness, so the Christian Church's
wilderness-time of first love was the apostolic age, when it was
separate from the Egypt of this world, having no city here, but seeking
one to come; having only a place in the wilderness prepared of God ([Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md), [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014).md). The harlot takes the world
city as her own, even as Cain was the first builder of a city, whereas
the believing patriarchs lived in tents. Then apostate Israel was the
harlot and the young Christian Church the woman; but soon spiritual
fornication crept in, and the Church in the seventeenth chapter is no
longer the woman, but the harlot, the great Babylon, which, however, has
in it hidden the true people of God ([Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004).md). The deeper the Church
penetrated into heathendom, the more she herself became heathenish.
Instead of overcoming, she was overcome by the world \[AUBERLEN\]. Thus,
the woman is "the one inseparable Church of the Old and New Testament"
\[HENGSTENBERG\], the stock of the Christian Church being Israel (Christ
and His apostles being Jews), on which the Gentile believers have been
grafted, and into which Israel, on her conversion, shall be grafted, as
into her own olive tree. During the whole Church-historic period, or
"times of the Gentiles," wherein "Jerusalem is trodden down of the
Gentiles," there is no believing Jewish Church, and therefore, only the
Christian Church can be "the woman." At the same time there is meant,
secondarily, the preservation of the Jews during this Church-historic
period, in order that Israel, who was once "the woman," and of whom the
man-child was born, may become so again at the close of the Gentile
times, and stand at the head of the two elections, literal Israel, and
spiritual Israel, the Church elected from Jews and Gentiles without
distinction. [Eze 20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035.md), "I will
bring you into the wilderness of the people (Hebrew, 'peoples'), and
there will I plead with you . . . like as I pleaded with your fathers in
the wilderness of Egypt" (compare Notes, see on [Eze
20:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#035).md): not a wilderness literally
and locally, but spiritually a state of discipline and trial among the
Gentile "peoples," during the long Gentile times, and one finally
consummated in the last time of unparalleled trouble under Antichrist,
in which the sealed remnant ([Rev
7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001).md) who constitute "the woman," are
nevertheless preserved "from the face of the serpent" ([Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014).md).

thousand two hundred and threescore days--anticipatory of [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md), where the persecution which
caused her to flee is mentioned in its place: [Rev
13:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md) gives the details of the
persecution. It is most unlikely that the transition should be made from
the birth of Christ to the last Antichrist, without notice of the long
intervening Church-historical period. Probably the 1260 days, or
periods, representing this long interval, are RECAPITULATED on a shorter
scale analogically during the last Antichrist's short reign. They are
equivalent to three and a half years, which, as half of the divine
number seven, symbolize the seeming victory of the world over the
Church. As they include the whole Gentile times of Jerusalem's being
trodden of the Gentiles, they must be much longer than 1260 years; for,
above several centuries more than 1260 years have elapsed since
Jerusalem fell.

[Revelation 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 12:7</span></span>

In [Job 1:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md); [Job
2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001.md), Satan appears among the sons of
God, presenting himself before God in heaven, as the accuser of the
saints: again in [Zac 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md). But at
Christ's coming as our Redeemer, he fell from heaven, especially when
Christ suffered, rose again, and ascended to heaven. When Christ
appeared before God as our Advocate, Satan, the accusing adversary,
could no longer appear before God against us, but was cast out
judicially ([Rom 8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md). He and his
angels henceforth range through the air and the earth, after a time
(namely, the interval between the ascension and the second advent) about
to be cast hence also, and bound in hell. That "heaven" here does not
mean merely the air, but the abode of angels, appears from [Rev
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md), [Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md); [Kg1
22:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019.md).

there was--Greek, "there came to pass," or "arose."

war in heaven--What a seeming contradiction in terms, yet true! Contrast
the blessed result of Christ's triumph, [Luk
19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038.md), "peace in heaven." [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md), "made peace through the blood of
His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; whether . . .
things in earth, or things in heaven."

Michael and his angels . . . the dragon . . . and his angels--It was
fittingly ordered that, as the rebellion arose from unfaithful angels
and their leader, so they should be encountered and overcome by faithful
angels and their archangel, in heaven. On earth they are fittingly
encountered, and shall be overcome, as represented by the beast and
false prophet, by the Son of man and His armies of human saints ([Rev
19:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014).md). The conflict on earth, as
in [Dan 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md), has its correspondent
conflict of angels in heaven. Michael is peculiarly the prince, or
presiding angel, of the Jewish nation. The conflict in heaven, though
judicially decided already against Satan from the time of Christ's
resurrection and ascension, receives its actual completion in the
execution of judgment by the angels who cast out Satan from heaven. From
Christ's ascension he has no standing-ground judicially against the
believing elect. [Luk 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#018.md), "I beheld
(in the earnest of the future full fulfilment given in the subjection of
the demons to the disciples) Satan as lightning fall from heaven." As
Michael fought before with Satan about the body of the mediator of the
old covenant ([Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009).md), so now the
mediator of the new covenant, by offering His sinless body in sacrifice,
arms Michael with power to renew and finish the conflict by a complete
victory. That Satan is not yet actually and finally cast out of heaven,
though the judicial sentence to that effect received its ratification at
Christ's ascension, appears from [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md), "spiritual wickedness in high
(Greek, 'heavenly') places." This is the primary Church-historical sense
here. But, through Israel's unbelief, Satan has had ground against that,
the elect nation, appearing before God as its accuser. At the eve of its
restoration, in the ulterior sense, his standing-ground in heaven
against Israel, too, shall be taken from him, "the Lord that hath chosen
Jerusalem" rebuking him, and casting him out from heaven actually and
for ever by Michael, the prince, or presiding angel of the Jews. Thus
[Zac 3:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md) is strictly parallel,
Joshua, the high priest, being representative of his nation Israel, and
Satan standing at God's fight hand as adversary to resist Israel's
justification. Then, and not till then, fully ([Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010), "NOW," &c..md) shall ALL things be
reconciled unto Christ IN HEAVEN ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020).md), and there shall be peace in
heaven ([Luk 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#038).md).

against--A, B, and C read, "with."

[Revelation 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 12:8</span></span>

prevailed not--A and Coptic read, "He prevailed not." But B and C read
as English Version.

neither--A, B, and C read, "not even" (Greek, "oude"): a climax. Not
only did they not prevail, but not even their place was found any more
in heaven. There are four gradations in the ever deeper downfall of
Satan: (1) He is deprived of his heavenly excellency, though having
still access to heaven as man's accuser, up to Christ's first coming. As
heaven was not fully yet opened to man ([Joh
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#013).md), so it was not yet shut against
Satan and his demons. The Old Testament dispensation could not overcome
him. (2) From Christ, down to the millennium, he is judicially cast out
of heaven as the accuser of the elect, and shortly before the millennium
loses his power against Israel, and has sentence of expulsion fully
executed on him and his by Michael. His rage on earth is consequently
the greater, his power being concentrated on it, especially towards the
end, when "he knoweth that he hath but a short time" ([Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012)). (3.md) He is bound during the
millennium ([Rev 20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)). (4.md) After
having been loosed for a while, he is cast for ever into the lake of
fire.

[Revelation 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 12:9</span></span>

that old serpent--alluding to [Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md), [Gen
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#004.md).

Devil--the Greek, for "accuser," or "slanderer."

Satan--the Hebrew for "adversary," especially in a court of justice. The
twofold designation, Greek and Hebrew, marks the twofold objects of his
accusations and temptations, the elect Gentiles and the elect Jews.

world--Greek, "habitable world."

[Revelation 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 12:10</span></span>

Now--Now that Satan has been cast out of heaven. Primarily fulfilled in
part at Jesus' resurrection and ascension, when He said ([Mat
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018).md), "All power \[Greek, 'exousia,'
'authority,' as here; see below\] is given unto Me in heaven and in
earth"; connected with [Rev 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005.md), "Her
child was caught up unto God and to His throne." In the ulterior sense,
it refers to the eve of Christ's second coming, when Israel is about to
be restored as mother-church of Christendom, Satan, who had resisted her
restoration on the ground of her unworthiness, having been cast out by
the instrumentality of Michael, Israel's angelic prince (see on [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007).md). Thus this is parallel, and the
necessary preliminary to the glorious event similarly expressed, [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md), "The kingdom of this world is
become (the very word here, Greek, 'egeneto,' 'is come,' 'hath come to
pass') our Lord's and His Christ's," the result of Israel's resuming her
place.

salvation, &c.--Greek, "the salvation (namely, fully, finally, and
victoriously accomplished, [Heb 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md);
compare [Luk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006.md), yet future; hence,
not till now do the blessed raise the fullest hallelujah for salvation
to the Lamb, [Rev 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md); [Rev
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)) the power (Greek, 'dunamis'.md),
and the authority (Greek, 'exousia'; 'legitimate power'; see above) of
His Christ."

accused them before our God day and night--Hence the need that the
oppressed Church, God's own elect (like the widow, continually coming,
so as even to weary the unjust judge), should cry day and night unto
Him.

[Revelation 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 12:11</span></span>

they--emphatic in the Greek. "They" in particular. They and they alone.
They were the persons who overcame.

overcame-- ([Rom 8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md), [Rom
8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md); [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020).md).

him-- ([Jo1 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014).md). It is the same
victory (a peculiarly Johannean phrase) over Satan and the world which
the Gospel of John describes in the life of Jesus, his Epistle in the
life of each believer, and his Apocalypse in the life of the Church.

by, &c.--Greek (dia to haima; accusative, not genitive case, as English
Version would require, compare [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md), "on account of (on the ground
of) the blood of the Lamb"; "because of"; on account of and by virtue of
its having been shed. Had that blood not been shed, Satan's accusations
would have been unanswerable; as it is, that blood meets every charge.
SCHOTTGEN mentions the Rabbinical tradition that Satan accuses men all
days of the year, except the day of atonement. TITTMANN takes the Greek
"dia," as it often means, out of regard to the blood of the Lamb; this
was the impelling cause which induced them to undertake the contest for
the sake of it; but the view given above is good Greek, and more in
accordance with the general sense of Scripture.

by the word of their testimony--Greek, "on account of the word of their
testimony." On the ground of their faithful testimony, even unto death,
they are constituted victors. Their testimony evinced their victory over
him by virtue of the blood of the Lamb. Hereby they confess themselves
worshippers of the slain Lamb and overcome the beast, Satan's
representative; an anticipation of [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md), "them that had gotten the
victory over the beast" (compare [Rev
13:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015).md).

unto--Greek, "achri," "even as far as." They carried their not-love of
life as far as even unto death.

[Revelation 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 12:12</span></span>

Therefore--because Satan is cast out of heaven ([Rev
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009).md).

dwell--literally, "tabernacle." Not only angels and the souls of the
just with God, but also the faithful militant on earth, who already in
spirit tabernacle in heaven, having their home and citizenship there,
rejoice that Satan is cast out of their home. "Tabernacle" for dwell is
used to mark that, though still on the earth, they in spirit are hidden
"in the secret of God's tabernacle." They belong not to the world, and,
therefore, exult in judgment having been passed on the prince of this
world.

the inhabiters of--So ANDREAS reads. But A, B, and C omit. The words
probably, were inserted from [Rev
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#013.md).

is come down--rather as Greek, "catebee," "is gone down"; John regarding
the heaven as his standing-point of view whence he looks down on the
earth.

unto you--earth and sea, with their inhabitants; those who lean upon,
and essentially belong to, the earth (contrast [Joh
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#007.md), Margin, with [Joh
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md); [Joh
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#023.md); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019.md), end; [Jo1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#005).md) and its sea-like troubled
politics. Furious at his expulsion from heaven, and knowing that his
time on earth is short until he shall be cast down lower, when Christ
shall come to set up His kingdom ([Rev
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001).md), Satan concentrates all his
power to destroy as many souls as he can. Though no longer able to
accuse the elect in heaven, he can tempt and persecute on earth. The
more light becomes victorious, the greater will be the struggles of the
powers of darkness; whence, at the last crisis, Antichrist will manifest
himself with an intensity of iniquity greater than ever before.

short time--Greek, "kairon," "season": opportunity for his assaults.

[Revelation 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 12:13</span></span>

Resuming from [Rev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md) the thread of
the discourse, which had been interrupted by the episode, [Rev
12:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007.md) (giving in the invisible world
the ground of the corresponding conflict between light and darkness in
the visible world), this verse accounts for her flight into the
wilderness ([Rev 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md).

[Revelation 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md)

were given--by God's determinate appointment, not by human chances ([Act
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011).md).

two--Greek, "the two wings of the great eagle." Alluding to [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md) : proving that the Old Testament
Church, as well as the New Testament Church, is included in "the woman."
All believers are included ([Isa
40:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#030).md). The great eagle is the
world power; in [Eze 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003.md), [Eze
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007.md), Babylon and Egypt: in early
Church history, Rome, whose standard was the eagle, turned by God's
providence from being hostile into a protector of the Christian Church.
As "wings" express remote parts of the earth, the two wings may here
mean the east and west divisions of the Roman empire.

wilderness--the land of the heathen, the Gentiles: in contrast to
Canaan, the pleasant and glorious land. God dwells in the glorious land;
demons (the rulers of the heathen world, [Rev
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#020.md); [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020).md), in the wilderness. Hence
Babylon is called the desert of the sea, [Isa
21:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001.md) (referred to also in [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002).md). Heathendom, in its essential
nature, being without God, is a desolate wilderness. Thus, the woman's
flight into the wilderness is the passing of the kingdom of God from the
Jews to be among the Gentiles (typified by Mary's flight with her child
from Judea into Egypt). The eagle flight is from Egypt into the
wilderness. The Egypt meant is virtually stated ([Rev
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008).md) to be Jerusalem, which has
become spiritually so by crucifying our Lord. Out of her the New
Testament Church flees, as the Old Testament Church out of the literal
Egypt; and as the true Church subsequently is called to flee out of
Babylon (the woman become an harlot, that is, the Church become
apostate) \[AUBERLEN\].

her place--the chief seat of the then world empire, Rome. The Acts of
the Apostles describe the passing of the Church from Jerusalem to Rome.
The Roman protection was the eagle wing which often shielded Paul, the
great instrument of this transmigration, and Christianity, from Jewish
opponents who stirred up the heathen mobs. By degrees the Church had
"her place" more and more secure, until, under Constantine, the empire
became Christian. Still, all this Church-historical period is regarded
as a wilderness time, wherein the Church is in part protected, in part
oppressed, by the world power, until just before the end the enmity of
the world power under Satan shall break out against the Church worse
than ever. As Israel was in the wilderness forty years, and had
forty-two stages in her journey, so the Church for forty-two months,
three and a half years or times \[literally, seasons, used for years in
Hellenistic Greek (MOERIS, the Atticist), Greek, "kairous," [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md)\], or 1260 days ([Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md) between the overthrow of
Jerusalem and the coming again of Christ, shall be a wilderness
sojourner before she reaches her millennial rest (answering to Canaan of
old). It is possible that, besides this Church-historical fulfilment,
there may be also an ulterior and narrower fulfilment in the restoration
of Israel to Palestine, Antichrist for seven times (short periods
analogical to the longer ones) having power there, for the former three
and a half times keeping covenant with the Jews, then breaking it in the
midst of the week, and the mass of the nation fleeing by a second Exodus
into the wilderness, while a remnant remains in the land exposed to a
fearful persecution (the "144,000 sealed of Israel," [Rev
7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), standing with the Lamb, after
the conflict is over, on Mount Zion: "the first-fruits" of a large
company to be gathered to Him) \[DE BURGH\]. These details are very
conjectural. In [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md), the subject, as perhaps here, is
the time of Israel's calamity. That seven times do not necessarily mean
seven years, in which each day is a year, that is, 2520 years, appears
from Nebuchadnezzar's seven times ([Dan
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#023).md), answering to Antichrist, the
beast's duration.

[Revelation 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 12:15</span></span>

flood--Greek, "river" (compare [Exo
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#003.md); [Mat
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#020); and especially Exo. 14:1-31.md).
The flood, or river, is the stream of Germanic tribes which, pouring on
Rome, threatened to destroy Christianity. But the earth helped the
woman, by swallowing up the flood. The earth, as contradistinguished
from water, is the world consolidated and civilized. The German masses
were brought under the influence of Roman civilization and Christianity
\[AUBERLEN\]. Perhaps it includes also, generally, the help given by
earthly powers (those least likely, yet led by God's overruling
providence to give help) to the Church against persecutions and also
heresies, by which she has been at various times assailed.

wroth with--Greek, "at."

went--Greek, "went away."

the remnant of her seed--distinct in some sense from the woman herself.
Satan's first effort was to root out the Christian Church, so that there
should be no visible profession of Christianity. Foiled in this, he wars
([Rev 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md); [Rev
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#007).md) against the invisible Church,
namely, "those who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus" (A, B, and C omit "Christ"). These are "the remnant," or rest
of her seed, as distinguished from her seed, "the man-child" ([Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005).md), on one hand, and from mere
professors on the other. The Church, in her beauty and unity (Israel at
the head of Christendom, the whole forming one perfect Church), is now
not manifested, but awaiting the manifestations of the sons of God at
Christ's coming. Unable to destroy Christianity and the Church as a
whole, Satan directs his enmity against true Christians, the elect
remnant: the others he leaves unmolested.
