### [John Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001)

[John 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">joh 9:1</span></span>

THE OPENING OF THE EYES OF ONE BORN BLIND, AND WHAT FOLLOWED ON IT.
(John 9:1-41)

as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from birth--and who
"sat begging" ([Joh 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008)).

[John 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">joh 9:2</span></span>

who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind--not in a
former state of existence, in which, as respects the wicked, the Jews
did not believe; but, perhaps, expressing loosely that sin somewhere had
surely been the cause of this calamity.

[John 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">joh 9:3</span></span>

Neither . . . this man, &c.--The cause was neither in himself nor his
parents, but, in order to the manifestation of "the works of God," in
his cure.

[John 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">joh 9:4</span></span>

I must work the works of him that sent me, &c.--a most interesting
statement from the mouth of Christ; intimating, (1) that He had a
precise work to do upon earth, with every particular of it arranged and
laid out to Him; (2) that all He did upon earth was just "the works of
God"--particularly "going about doing good," though not exclusively by
miracles; (3) that each work had its precise time and place in His
programme of instructions, so to speak; hence, (4) that as His period
for work had definite termination, so by letting any one service pass by
its allotted time, the whole would be disarranged, marred, and driven
beyond its destined period for completion; (5) that He acted ever under
the impulse of these considerations, as man--"the night cometh when no
man (or no one) can work." What lessons are here for others, and what
encouragement from such Example!

[John 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">joh 9:5</span></span>

As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world--not as if He
would cease, after that, to be so; but that He must make full proof of
His fidelity while His earthly career lasted by displaying His glory.
"As before the raising of Lazarus ([Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025)), He announces Himself as the
Resurrection and the Life, so now He sets Himself forth as the source of
the archetypal spiritual light, of which the natural, now about to be
conferred, is only a derivation and symbol" \[ALFORD\].

[John 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">joh 9:6</span></span>

he spat on the ground, and made clay . . . and he anointed the eyes of
the blind man--These operations were not so incongruous in their nature
as might appear, though it were absurd to imagine that they contributed
in the least degree to the effect which followed. (See [Mar
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#013) and see on [Joh
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#033).)

[John 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">joh 9:7</span></span>

Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, . . . Sent, &c.--(See [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010), [Kg2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#014)). As the prescribed action was
purely symbolical in its design, so in connection with it the Evangelist
notices the symbolical name of the pool as in this case bearing
testimony to him who was sent to do what it only symbolized. (See [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006), where this same pool is used
figuratively to denote "the streams that make glad the city of God," and
which, humble though they be, betoken a present God of Israel.)

[John 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">joh 9:8</span></span>

The neighbours therefore . . . said, Is not this he that sat and
begged--Here are a number of details to identify the newly seeing with
the long-known blind beggar.

[John 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">joh 9:13</span></span>

They brought to the Pharisees--sitting probably in council, and chiefly
of that sect ([Joh 7:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#047)).

[John 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">joh 9:16</span></span>

This man is not of God, &c.--(See on [Joh
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#009); [Joh
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#016)).

Others said, &c.--such as Nicodemus and Joseph.

[John 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">joh 9:17</span></span>

the blind man . . . said, He is a prophet--rightly viewing the miracle
as but a "sign" of His prophetic commission.

[John 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">joh 9:18</span></span>

the Jews did not believe . . . he had been born blind . . . till they
called the parents of him that had received his sight--Foiled by the
testimony of the young man himself, they hope to throw doubt on the fact
by close questioning his parents, who, perceiving the snare laid for
them, ingeniously escape it by testifying simply to the identity of
their son, and his birth-blindness, leaving it to himself, as a
competent witness, to speak as to the cure. They prevaricated, however,
in saying they "knew not who had opened his eyes," for "they feared the
Jews," who had come to an understanding (probably after what is
recorded, [Joh 7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050), &c.; but by this
time well known), that whoever owned Him as the Christ would be put out
of the synagogue--that is, not simply excluded, but excommunicated.

[John 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">joh 9:24</span></span>

Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner--not wishing him
to own, even to the praise of God, that a miracle had been wrought upon
him, but to show more regard to the honor of God than ascribe any such
act to one who was a sinner.

[John 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">joh 9:25</span></span>

He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, &c.--Not that the
man meant to insinuate any doubt in his own mind on the point of His
being "a sinner," but as his opinion on such a point would be of no
consequence to others, he would speak only to what he knew as fact in
his own case.

[John 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">joh 9:26</span></span>

Then said they . . . again, What did he to thee? &c.--hoping by repeated
questions to ensnare him, but the youth is more than a match for them.

[John 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">joh 9:27</span></span>

I have told you already . . . will ye also be his disciples?--In a vein
of keen irony he treats their questions as those of anxious inquirers,
almost ready for discipleship! Stung by this, they retort upon him as
the disciple (and here they plainly were not wrong); for themselves,
they fall back upon Moses; about him there could be no doubt; but who
knew about this upstart?

[John 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">joh 9:30</span></span>

The man answered, Herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from
whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes--He had no need to say
another word; but waxing bolder in defense of his Benefactor, and his
views brightening by the very courage which it demanded, he puts it to
them how they could pretend inability to tell whether one who opened the
eyes of a man born blind was "of God" or "a sinner"--from above or from
beneath--and proceeds to argue the case with remarkable power. So
irresistible was his argument that their rage burst forth in a speech of
intense Pharisaism, "Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou
teach us?"--thou, a base-born, uneducated, impudent youth, teach us, the
trained, constituted, recognized guides of the people in the things of
God! Out upon thee!

[John 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">joh 9:31</span></span>

they cast him out--judicially, no doubt, as well in fact. The allusion
to his being "born in sins" seems a tacit admission of his being blind
from birth--the very thing they had been so unwilling to own. But rage
and enmity to truth are seldom consistent in their outbreaks. The
friends of this excommunicated youth, crowding around him with their
sympathy, would probably express surprise that One who could work such a
cure should be unable to protect his patient from the persecution it had
raised against him, or should possess the power without using it. Nor
would it be strange if such thoughts should arise in the youth's own
mind. But if they did, it is certain, from what follows, that they made
no lodgment there, conscious as he was that "whereas he was blind, now
he saw," and satisfied that if his Benefactor "were not of God, He could
do nothing" ([Joh 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#033)). There was a
word for him too, which, if whispered in his ear from the oracles of
God, would seem expressly designed to describe his case, and prepare him
for the coming interview with his gracious Friend. "Hear the word of the
Lord, ye that tremble at His word. Your brethren that hated you, that
cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; BUT HE
SHALL APPEAR TO YOUR JOY, and they shall be ashamed" ([Isa
66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005)). But how was He engaged to whom
such noble testimony had been given, and for whom such persecution had
been borne? Uttering, perhaps, in secret, "with strong crying and
tears," the words of the prophetic psalm, "Let not them that wait on
Thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; let none that seek
Thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel; because for Thy sake I
have borne reproach . . . and the reproaches of them that reproached
Thee are fallen upon me" ([Psa 69:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#006),
[Psa 69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)).

[John 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">joh 9:35</span></span>

Jesus heard--that is, by intelligence brought Him.

that they had cast him out; and when he had found him--by accident? Not
very likely. Sympathy in that breast could not long keep aloof from its
object.

he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?--A question
stretching purposely beyond his present attainments, in order the more
quickly to lead him--in his present teachable frame--into the highest
truth.

[John 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">joh 9:36</span></span>

He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?--"His
reply is affirmative, and believing by anticipation, promising faith as
soon as Jesus shall say who He is" \[STIER\].

[John 9:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">joh 9:37</span></span>

Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him--the new sense of sight
having at that moment its highest exercise, in gazing upon "the Light of
the world."

[John 9:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">joh 9:38</span></span>

he said, Lord, I believe: and he worshipped him--a faith and a worship,
beyond doubt, meant to express far more than he would think proper to
any human "prophet" ([Joh 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#017)) --the
unstudied, resistless expression, probably of SUPREME faith and
adoration, though without the full understanding of what that implied.

[John 9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">joh 9:39</span></span>

Jesus said--perhaps at the same time, but after a crowd, including some
of the skeptical and scornful rulers, had, on seeing Jesus talking with
the healed youth, hastened to the spot.

that they which see not might see, &c.--rising to that sight of which
the natural vision communicated to the youth was but the symbol. (See on
[Joh 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#005), and compare [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018)).

that they which see might be made blind--judicially incapable of
apprehending and receiving the truth, to which they have wilfully shut
their eyes.

[John 9:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">joh 9:40</span></span>

Are we blind also?--We, the constituted, recognized guides of the people
in spiritual things? pride and rage prompting the question.

[John 9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">joh 9:41</span></span>

If ye were blind--wanted light to discern My claims, and only waited to
receive it.

ye should have no sin--none of the guilt of shutting out the light.

ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth--Your claim to possess
light, while rejecting Me, is that which seals you up in the guilt of
unbelief.
