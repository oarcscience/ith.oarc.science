### [Joshua Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 10:1</span></span>

FIVE KINGS WAR AGAINST GIBEON. ([Jos
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#001).md)

Adoni-zedek--"lord of righteousness"--nearly synonymous with
Melchizedek, "king of righteousness." These names were common titles of
the Jebusite kings.

Jerusalem--The original name, "Salem" ([Gen
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md); [Psa
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002).md), was superseded by that here
given, which signifies "a peaceful possession," or "a vision of peace,"
in allusion, as some think, to the strikingly symbolic scene ([Gen
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#014).md) represented on the mount
whereon that city was afterwards built.

inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among
them--that is, the Israelites; had made an alliance with that people,
and acknowledging their supremacy, were living on terms of friendly
intercourse with them.

[Joshua 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 10:2</span></span>

they feared greatly--The dread inspired by the rapid conquests of the
Israelites had been immensely increased by the fact of a state so
populous and so strong as Gibeon having found it expedient to submit to
the power and the terms of the invaders.

as one of the royal cities--Although itself a republic ([Jos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#003).md), it was large and well-fortified,
like those places in which the chiefs of the country usually established
their residence.

[Joshua 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 10:3</span></span>

Wherefore Adoni-zedek . . . sent, . . . saying, Come up unto me, and
help me--A combined attack was meditated on Gibeon, with a view not only
to punish its people for their desertion of the native cause, but by its
overthrow to interpose a barrier to the farther inroads of the
Israelites. This confederacy among the mountaineers of Southern
Palestine was formed and headed by the king of Jerusalem, because his
territory was most exposed to danger, Gibeon being only six miles
distant, and because he evidently possessed some degree of pre-eminence
over his royal neighbors.

[Joshua 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 10:5</span></span>

the five kings of the Amorites--The settlement of this powerful and
warlike tribe lay within the confines of Moab; but having also acquired
extensive possessions on the southwest of the Jordan, their name, as the
ruling power, seems to have been given to the region generally ([Sa2
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2021.htm#002).md), although Hebron was inhabited
by Hittites or Hivites ([Jos 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#019).md),
and Jerusalem by Jebusites ([Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md).

[Joshua 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 10:6</span></span>

JOSHUA RESCUES IT. ([Jos 10:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#006).md)

the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua--Their appeal was urgent and their
claim to protection irresistible, on the ground, not only of kindness
and sympathy, but of justice. In attacking the Canaanites, Joshua had
received from God a general assurance of success ([Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005).md). But the intelligence of so
formidable a combination among the native princes seems to have
depressed his mind with the anxious and dispiriting idea that it was a
chastisement for the hasty and inconsiderate alliance entered into with
the Gibeonites. It was evidently to be a struggle of life and death, not
only to Gibeon, but to the Israelites. And in this view the divine
communication that was made to him was seasonable and animating. He
seems to have asked the counsel of God and received an answer, before
setting out on the expedition.

[Joshua 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 10:9</span></span>

Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly--This is explained in the
following clause, where he is described as having accomplished, by a
forced march of picked men, in one night, a distance of twenty-six
miles, which, according to the slow pace of Eastern armies and caravans,
had formerly been a three days' journey ([Jos
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#017).md).

[Joshua 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 10:10</span></span>

GOD FIGHTS AGAINST THEM WITH HAILSTONES. ([Jos
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010).md)

the Lord discomfited them--Hebrew, "terrified," confounded the Amorite
allies, probably by a fearful storm of lightning and thunder. So the
word is usually employed ([Sa1 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#010.md);
[Psa 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md); [Psa
144:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#006).md).

and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon--This refers to the
attack of the Israelites upon the besiegers. It is evident that there
had been much hard fighting around the heights of Gibeon, for the day
was far spent before the enemy took to flight.

chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon--that is, "the
House of Caves," of which there are still traces existing. There were
two contiguous villages of that name, upper and nether. Upper Beth-horon
was nearest Gibeon--about ten miles distant, and approached by a gradual
ascent through a long and precipitous ravine. This was the first stage
of the flight. The fugitives had crossed the high ridge of Upper
Beth-horon, and were in full flight down the descent to Beth-horon the
Nether. The road between the two places is so rocky and rugged that
there is a path made by means of steps cut in the rock \[ROBINSON\].
Down this pass Joshua continued his victorious rout. Here it was that
the Lord interposed, assisting His people by means of a storm, which,
having been probably gathering all day, burst with such irresistible
fury, that "they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
children of Israel slew with the sword." The Oriental hailstorm is a
terrific agent; the hailstones are masses of ice, large as walnuts, and
sometimes as two fists; their prodigious size, and the violence with
which they fall, make them always very injurious to property, and often
fatal to life. The miraculous feature of this tempest, which fell on the
Amorite army, was the entire preservation of the Israelites from its
destructive ravages.

[Joshua 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 10:12</span></span>

THE SUN AND MOON STAND STILL AT THE WORD OF JOSHUA. ([Jos
10:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012).md)

Then spake Joshua to the Lord . . . and . . . he said in the sight of
Israel, Sun, stand thou still . . . and thou, Moon--The inspired author
here breaks off the thread of his history of this miraculous victory to
introduce a quotation from an ancient poem, in which the mighty acts of
that day were commemorated. The passage, which is parenthetical,
contains a poetical description of the victory which was miraculously
gained by the help of God, and forms an extract from "the book of
Jasher," that is, "the upright"--an anthology, or collection of national
songs, in honor of renowned and eminently pious heroes. The language of
a poem is not to be literally interpreted; and therefore, when the sun
and moon are personified, addressed as intelligent beings, and
represented as standing still, the explanation is that the light of the
sun and moon was supernaturally prolonged by the same laws of refraction
and reflection that ordinarily cause the sun to appear above the
horizon, when it is in reality below it \[KEIL, BUSH\]. Gibeon ("a
hill") was now at the back of the Israelites, and the height would soon
have intercepted the rays of the setting sun. The valley of Ajalon
("stags") was before them, and so near that it was sometimes called "the
valley of Gibeon" ([Isa 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021).md). It
would seem, from [Jos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#014.md), that the
command of Joshua was in reality a prayer to God for the performance of
this miracle; and that, although the prayers of eminently good men like
Moses often prevailed with God, never was there on any other occasion so
astonishing a display of divine power made in behalf of His people, as
in answer to the prayer of Joshua. [Jos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#015.md) is the end of the quotation from
Jasher; and it is necessary to notice this, as the fact described in it
is recorded in due course, and the same words, by the sacred historian
([Jos 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#043).md).

[Joshua 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 10:16</span></span>

THE FIVE KINGS HANGED. ([Jos 10:16-27](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#016).md)

these five kings . . . hid themselves in a cave--Hebrew, "the cave."

at Makkedah--The pursuit was continued, without interruption, to
Makkedah at the foot of the western mountains, where Joshua seems to
have halted with the main body of his troops while a detachment was sent
forward to scour the country in pursuit of the remaining stragglers, a
few of whom succeeded in reaching the neighboring cities. The last act,
probably the next day, was the disposal of the prisoners, among whom the
five kings were consigned to the infamous doom of being slain ([Deu
20:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#016).md); and then their corpses were
suspended on five trees till the evening.

[Joshua 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 10:24</span></span>

put your feet upon the necks of these kings--not as a barbarous insult,
but a symbolical action, expressive of a complete victory ([Deu
33:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#029.md); [Psa
110:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md); [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003).md).

[Joshua 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 10:28</span></span>

SEVEN MORE KINGS CONQUERED. ([Jos
10:28-42](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#028).md)

that day Joshua took Makkedah--In this and the following verses is
described the rapid succession of victory and extermination which swept
the whole of southern Palestine into the hands of Israel. "All these
kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the Lord God
of Israel fought for Israel. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with
him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
