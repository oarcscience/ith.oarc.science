### [Romans Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

[Romans 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 4:1</span></span>

THE FOREGOING DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH ILLUSTRATED FROM THE
OLD TESTAMENT. (Rom. 4:1-25)

What shall we say then that Abraham, our father as pertaining to the
flesh, hath found?--that is, (as the order in the original shows), "hath
found, as pertaining to ('according to,' or 'through') the flesh";
meaning, "by all his natural efforts or legal obedience."

[Romans 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 4:2</span></span>

For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but
not before God--"If works were the ground of Abraham's justification, he
would have matter for boasting; but as it is perfectly certain that he
hath none in the sight of God, it follows that Abraham could not have
been justified by works." And to this agree the words of Scripture.

[Romans 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 4:3</span></span>

For what saith the, Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it--his faith.

was counted to him for righteousness-- ([Gen
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006).md). Romish expositors and Arminian
Protestants make this to mean that God accepted Abraham's act of
believing as a substitute for complete obedience. But this is at
variance with the whole spirit and letter of the apostle's teaching.
Throughout this whole argument, faith is set in direct opposition to
works, in the matter of justification--and even in [Rom
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md). The meaning, therefore, cannot
possibly be that the mere act of believing--which is as much a work as
any other piece of commanded duty ([Joh
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#029.md); [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023).md) --was counted to Abraham for all
obedience. The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises
which embraced Christ ([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md); [Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005), &c..md), as we believe in Christ
Himself; and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us
in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed.

[Romans 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 4:4</span></span>

Now to him that worketh--as a servant for wages.

is the reward not reckoned of grace--as a matter of favor.

but of debt--as a matter of right.

[Romans 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 4:5</span></span>

But to him that worketh not--who, despairing of acceptance with God by
"working" for it the work of obedience, does not attempt it.

but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly--casts himself upon the
mercy of Him that justifieth those who deserve only condemnation.

his faith, &c.--(See on [Rom 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003).md).

Second: David sings of the same justification.

[Romans 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 4:6</span></span>

David also describeth--"speaketh," "pronounceth."

the blessedness of the man unto whom the Lord imputeth righteousness
without works--whom, though void of all good works, He, nevertheless,
regards and treats as righteous.

[Romans 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 4:7</span></span>

Saying, Blessed, &c.-- ([Psa 32:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).md).
David here sings in express terms only of "transgression forgiven, sin
covered, iniquity not imputed"; but as the negative blessing necessarily
includes the positive, the passage is strictly in point.

[Romans 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 4:9</span></span>

Cometh this blessedness then, &c.--that is, "Say not, All this is spoken
of the circumcised, and is therefore no evidence of God's general way of
justifying men; for Abraham's justification took place long before he
was circumcised, and so could have no dependence upon that rite: nay,
'the sign of circumcision' was given to Abraham as 'a seal' (or token)
of the (justifying) righteousness which he had before he was
circumcised; in order that he might stand forth to every age as the
parent believer--the model man of justification by faith--after whose
type, as the first public example of it, all were to be moulded, whether
Jew or Gentile, who should thereafter believe to life everlasting."

[Romans 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 4:13</span></span>

For the promise, &c.--This is merely an enlargement of the foregoing
reasoning, applying to the law what had just been said of circumcision.

that he should be the heir of the world--or, that "all the families of
the earth should be blessed in him."

was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law--in virtue of
obedience to the law.

but through the righteousness of faith--in virtue of his simple faith in
the divine promises.

[Romans 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 4:14</span></span>

For if they which are of the law be heirs--If the blessing is to be
earned by obedience to the law.

faith is made void--the whole divine method is subverted.

[Romans 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 4:15</span></span>

Because the law worketh wrath--has nothing to give to those who break is
but condemnation and vengeance.

for where there is no law, there is no transgression--It is just the law
that makes transgression, in the case of those who break it; nor can the
one exist without the other.

[Romans 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 4:16</span></span>

Therefore, &c.--A general summary: "Thus justification is by faith, in
order that its purely gracious character may be seen, and that all who
follow in the steps of Abraham's faith--whether of his natural seed or
no--may be assured of the like justification with the parent believer."

[Romans 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 4:17</span></span>

As it is written, &c.-- ([Gen 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005).md).
This is quoted to justify his calling Abraham the "father of us all,"
and is to be viewed as a parenthesis.

before--that is, "in the reckoning of."

him whom he believed--that is, "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him
whom he believed, is the father of us all, in order that all may be
assured, that doing as he did, they shall be treated as he was."

even God, quickeneth the dead--The nature and greatness of that faith of
Abraham which we are to copy is here strikingly described. What he was
required to believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon
God's power to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what
did not then exist. But God having made the promise, Abraham believed
Him in spite of those obstacles. This is still further illustrated in
what follows.

[Romans 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 4:18</span></span>

Who against hope--when no ground for hope appeared.

believed in hope--that is, cherished the believing expectation.

that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which
was spoken, So shall thy seed be--that is, Such "as the stars of
heaven," [Gen 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md).

[Romans 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 4:19</span></span>

he considered not, &c.--paid no attention to those physical obstacles,
both in himself and in Sarah, which might seem to render the fulfilment
hopeless.

[Romans 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 4:20</span></span>

He staggered--hesitated

not . . . but was strong in faith, giving glory to God--as able to make
good His own word in spite of all obstacles.

[Romans 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 4:21</span></span>

And being fully persuaded, &c.--that is, the glory which Abraham's faith
gave to God consisted in this, that, firm in the persuasion of God's
ability to fulfil his promise, no difficulties shook him.

[Romans 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 4:22</span></span>

And therefore it was imputed, &c.--"Let all then take notice that this
was not because of anything meritorious in Abraham, but merely because
he so believed."

[Romans 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 4:23</span></span>

Now, &c.--Here is the application of this whole argument about Abraham:
These things were not recorded as mere historical facts, but as
illustrations for all time of God's method of justification by faith.

[Romans 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 4:24</span></span>

to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus
our Lord from the dead--in Him that hath done this, even as Abraham
believed that God would raise up a seed in whom all nations should be
blessed.

[Romans 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 4:25</span></span>

Who was delivered for--"on account of."

our offences--that is, in order to expiate them by His blood.

and raised again for--"on account of," that is, in order to.

our justification--As His resurrection was the divine assurance that He
had "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself," and the crowning of His
whole work, our justification is fitly connected with that glorious act.

Note, (1) The doctrine of justification by works, as it generates
self-exaltation, is contrary to the first principles of all true
religion ([Rom 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002.md); and see on [Rom
3:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021), Note 1). (2.md) The way of a
sinner's justification has been the same in all time, and the testimony
of the Old Testament on this subject is one with that of the New ([Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), &c., and see on [Rom
3:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027), Note 1). (3.md) Faith and works,
in the matter of justification, are opposite and irreconcilable, even as
grace and debt ([Rom 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md); and see on
[Rom 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006).md). If God "justifies the
ungodly," works cannot be, in any sense or to any degree, the ground of
justification. For the same reason, the first requisite, in order to
justification, must be (under the conviction that we are "ungodly") to
despair of it by works; and the next, to "believe in Him that justifieth
the ungodly"--that hath a justifying righteousness to bestow, and is
ready to bestow it upon those who deserve none, and to embrace it
accordingly. (4) The sacraments of the Church were never intended, and
are not adapted, to confer grace, or the blessings of salvation, upon
men. Their proper use is to set a divine seal upon a state already
existing, and so, they presuppose, and do not create it ([Rom
4:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#008).md). As circumcision merely
"sealed" Abraham's already existing acceptance with God, so with the
sacraments of the New Testament. (5) As Abraham is "the heir of the
world," all nations being blessed in him, through his Seed Christ Jesus,
and justified solely according to the pattern of his faith, so the
transmission of the true religion and all the salvation which the world
will ever experience shall yet be traced back with wonder, gratitude,
and joy, to that morning dawn when "the God of glory appeared unto our
father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,"
[Act 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md) ([Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013)). (6.md) Nothing gives more glory to
God than simple faith in His word, especially when all things seem to
render the fulfilment of it hopeless ([Rom
4:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018)). (7.md) All the Scripture
examples of faith were recorded on purpose to beget and encourage the
like faith in every succeeding age ([Rom
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023.md); and compare [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)). (8.md) Justification, in this
argument, cannot be taken--as Romanists and other errorists insist--to
mean a change upon men's character; for besides that this is to confound
it with Sanctification, which has its appropriate place in this Epistle,
the whole argument of the present chapter--and nearly all its more
important clauses, expressions, and words--would in that case be
unsuitable, and fitted only to mislead. Beyond all doubt it means
exclusively a change upon men's state or relation to God; or, in
scientific language, it is an objective, not a subjective change--a
change from guilt and condemnation to acquittal and acceptance. And the
best evidence that this is the key to the whole argument is, that it
opens all the wards of the many-chambered lock with which the apostle
has enriched us in this Epistle.
