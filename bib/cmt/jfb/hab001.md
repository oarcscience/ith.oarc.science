### [Habakkuk Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

[Habakkuk 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hab 1:1</span></span>

HABAKKUK'S EXPOSTULATION WITH JEHOVAH ON ACCOUNT OF THE PREVALENCE OF
INJUSTICE: JEHOVAH SUMMONS ATTENTION TO HIS PURPOSE OF SENDING THE
CHALDEANS AS THE AVENGERS. THE PROPHET COMPLAINS, THAT THESE ARE WORSE
THAN THOSE ON WHOM VENGEANCE WAS TO BE TAKEN. (Hab. 1:1-17)

burden--the prophetic sentence.

[Habakkuk 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hab 1:2</span></span>

violence . . . Why dost thou show me iniquity?--Similar language is used
of the Chaldeans ([Hab 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009.md), [Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013).md), as here is used of the Jews:
implying, that as the Jews sinned by violence and injustice, so they
should be punished by violence and injustice ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md). Jehoiakim's reign was marked by
injustice, treachery, and bloodshed ([Jer
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#003.md), [Jer
22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md). Therefore the Chaldeans
should be sent to deal with him and his nobles according to their
dealings with others ([Hab 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md), [Hab
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010.md), [Hab
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017).md). Compare Jeremiah's
expostulation with Jehovah, [Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001.md);
[Jer 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008.md); and [Job
19:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#007.md).

[Habakkuk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hab 1:3</span></span>

cause me to behold grievance--MAURER denies that the Hebrew verb is ever
active; he translates, "(Wherefore) dost Thou behold (without doing
aught to check) grievance?" The context favors English Version.

there are that raise up strife and contention--so CALVIN. But MAURER,
not so well, translates, "There is strife, and contention raises
itself."

[Habakkuk 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hab 1:4</span></span>

Therefore--because Thou dost suffer such crimes to go unpunished.

law is slacked--is chilled. It has no authority and secures no respect.

judgment--justice.

wrong judgment proceedeth--Decisions are given contrary to right.

[Habakkuk 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hab 1:5</span></span>

Behold . . . marvellously . . . a work--(Compare [Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014).md). Quoted by Paul ([Act
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041).md).

among the heathen--In [Act 13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041.md), "ye
despisers," from the Septuagint. So the Syriac and Arabic versions;
perhaps from a different Hebrew reading. In the English Version reading
of Habakkuk, God, in reply to the prophet's expostulation, addresses the
Jews as about to be punished, "Behold ye among the heathen (with whom ye
deserve to be classed, and by whom ye shall be punished, as despisers;
the sense implied, which Paul expresses): learn from them what ye
refused to learn from Me!" For "wonder marvellously," Paul, in [Act
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#041.md), has, "wonder and perish," which
gives the sense, not the literal wording, of the Hebrew, "Wonder,
wonder," that is, be overwhelmed in wonder. The despisers are to be
given up to their own stupefaction, and so perish. The Israelite
unbelievers would not credit the prophecy as to the fearfulness of the
destruction to be wrought by the Chaldeans, nor afterwards the
deliverance promised from that nation. So analogously, in Paul's day,
the Jews would not credit the judgment coming on them by the Romans, nor
the salvation proclaimed through Jesus. Thus the same Scripture applied
to both.

ye will not believe, though it be told you--that is, ye will not believe
now that I foretell it.

[Habakkuk 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hab 1:6</span></span>

I raise up--not referring to God's having brought the Chaldeans from
their original seats to Babylonia (see on [Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013).md), for they had already been
upwards of twenty years (since Nabopolassar's era) in political power
there; but to His being about now to raise them up as the instruments of
God's "work" of judgment on the Jews ([Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006).md). The Hebrew is future, "I will
raise up."

bitter--that is, cruel ([Jer 50:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#042.md);
compare [Jdg 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#025.md), Margin; [Sa1
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008).md).

hasty--not passionate, but "impetuous."

[Habakkuk 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hab 1:7</span></span>

their judgment and . . . dignity . . . proceed of themselves--that is,
they recognize no judge save themselves, and they get for themselves and
keep their own "dignity" without needing others' help. It will be vain
for the Jews to complain of their tyrannical judgments; for whatever the
Chaldeans decree they will do according to their own will, they will not
brook anyone attempting to interfere.

[Habakkuk 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hab 1:8</span></span>

swifter than the leopards--OPPIAN \[Cynegeticks, 3.76\], says of the
leopard, "It runs most swiftly straight on: you would fancy it was
flying through the air."

more fierce--rather, "more keen"; literally, "sharp."

evening wolves--wolves famished with fasting all day and so most keen in
attacking the fold under covert of the approaching night ([Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Zep
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); compare [Gen
49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027).md). Hence "twilight" is termed in
Arabic and Persian "the wolf's tail"; and in French, entre chien et
loup.

spread themselves--proudly; as in [Jer
50:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#011.md), and [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md), it implies strength and vigor. So
also the Arabic cognate word \[MAURER\].

their horsemen . . . come from far--and yet are not wearied by the long
journey.

[Habakkuk 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hab 1:9</span></span>

all for violence--The sole object of all is not to establish just
rights, but to get all they can by violence.

their faces shall sup up as the east wind--that is, they shall, as it
were, swallow up all before them; so the horse in [Job
39:24](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#024.md) is said to "swallow the ground
with fierceness and rage." MAURER takes it from an Arabic root, "the
desire of their faces," that is, the eager desire expressed by their
faces. HENDERSON, with SYMMACHUS and Syriac, translates, "the aspect."

as the east wind--the simoon, which spreads devastation wherever it
passes ([Isa 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md). GESENIUS
translates, "(is) forwards." The rendering proposed, eastward, as if it
referred to the Chaldeans' return home eastward from Judea, laden with
spoils, is improbable. Their "gathering the sand" accords with the
simoon being meant, as it carries with it whirlwinds of sand collected
in the desert.

[Habakkuk 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hab 1:10</span></span>

scoff at . . . kings--as unable to resist them.

they shall heap dust, and take it--"they shall heap" earth mounds
outside, and so "take every stronghold" (compare [Sa2
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#015.md); [Kg2
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032).md) \[GROTIUS\].

[Habakkuk 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hab 1:11</span></span>

Then--when elated by his successes.

shall his mind change--He shall lose whatever of reason or moderation
ever was in him, with pride.

he shall pass over--all bounds and restraints: his pride preparing the
sure way for his destruction ([Pro
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018).md). The language is very similar
to that describing Nebuchadnezzar's "change" from man's heart
(understanding) to that of a beast, because of pride (see on [Dan
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016.md); [Dan
4:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#030.md); [Dan
4:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#033).md). An undesigned coincidence
between the two sacred books written independently.

imputing this his power unto his god-- ([Dan
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#004).md). Sacrilegious arrogance, in
ascribing to his idol Bel the glory that belongs to God \[CALVIN\].
GROTIUS explains, "(saying that) his power is his own as one who is a
god to himself" (compare [Hab 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016.md),
and Dan. 3:1-30). So MAURER, "He shall offend as one to whom his power
is his god" ([Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006.md); see on [Mic
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#001).md).

[Habakkuk 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hab 1:12</span></span>

In opposition to the impious deifying of the Chaldeans power as their
god (MAURER, or, as the English Version, their attributing of their
successes to their idols), the prophet, in an impassioned address to
Jehovah, vindicates His being "from everlasting," as contrasted with the
Chaldean so-called "god."

my God, mine Holy One--Habakkuk speaks in the name of his people. God
was "the Holy One of Israel," against whom the Chaldean was setting up
himself ([Isa 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023).md).

we shall not die--Thou, as being our God, wilt not permit the Chaldeans
utterly to destroy us. This reading is one of the eighteen called by the
Hebrews "the appointment of the scribes"; the Rabbis think that Ezra and
his colleagues corrected the old reading, "Thou shalt not die."

thou hast ordained them for judgment--that is, to execute Thy judgments.

for correction--to chastise transgressors ([Isa
10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005).md). But not that they may deify
their own power ([Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md), for their
power is from Thee, and but for a time); nor that they may destroy
utterly Thy people. The Hebrew for "mighty God" is Rock ([Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004).md). However the world is shaken, or
man's faith wavers, God remains unshaken as the Rock of Ages ([Isa
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004), Margin.md).

[Habakkuk 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hab 1:13</span></span>

purer . . . than to behold evil--without being displeased at it.

canst not look on iniquity--unjust injuries done to Thy people. The
prophet checks himself from being carried too far in his expostulatory
complaint, by putting before himself honorable sentiments of God.

them that deal treacherously--the Chaldeans, once allies of the Jews,
but now their violent oppressors. Compare "treacherous dealers," ([Isa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#002.md); [Isa
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#016).md). Instead of speaking evil
against God, he goes to God Himself for the remedy for his perplexity
([Psa 73:11-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011).md).

devoureth the man that is more righteous--The Chaldean oppresses the
Jew, who with all his faults, is better than his oppressor (compare [Eze
16:51-52](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#051).md).

[Habakkuk 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hab 1:14</span></span>

And--that is, And so, by suffering oppressors to go unpunished, "Thou
makest men as the fishes . . . that have no ruler"; that is, no
defender. All may fish in the sea with impunity; so the Chaldeans with
impunity afflict Thy people, as these have no longer the God of the
theocracy, their King, to defend them. Thou reducest men to such a state
of anarchy, by wrong going unpunished, as if there were no God. He
compares the world to the sea; men to fishes; Nebuchadnezzar to a
fisherman ([Hab 1:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015).md).

[Habakkuk 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hab 1:15</span></span>

they take up all of them--all kinds of fishes, that is, men, as
captives, and all other prey that comes in their way.

with the angle--that is, the hook. Some they take up as with the hook,
one by one; others in shoals, as in a "net" and "drag" or enclosing net.

therefore--because of their successes.

they rejoice--They glory in their crimes because attended with success
(compare [Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011).md).

[Habakkuk 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hab 1:16</span></span>

sacrifice unto their net--that is, their arms, power, and military
skill, wherewith they gained their victories; instead of to God. Compare
[Hab 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#011.md), MAURER'S interpretation.
They idolize themselves for their own cleverness and might ([Deu
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#017.md); [Isa
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#013.md); [Isa
37:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024).md).

by them--by their net and dragnet.

their portion--image from a banquet: the prey which they have gotten.

[Habakkuk 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hab 1:17</span></span>

Shall they . . . empty their net?--Shall they be allowed without
interruption to enjoy the fruits of their violence?

therefore--seeing that they attribute all their successes to themselves,
and not to Thee. The answer to the prophet's question, he by inspiration
gives himself in the second chapter.
