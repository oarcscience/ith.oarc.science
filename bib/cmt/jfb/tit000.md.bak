### [Titus Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

[Titus](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">tit 0:0</span></span>

GENUINENESS.--CLEMENT OF ROME quotes it \[Epistle to the Corinthians,
2\]; IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 3.3.4\] refers to it as Paul's;
THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH \[To Autolychus, 3.14\], quotes it as Scripture.
Compare CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA \[Miscellanies, 1, p. 299\]; TERTULLIAN
\[The Prescription against Heretics, 6\].

TIME AND PLACE OF WRITING.--This Epistle seems to have been written from
Corinth \[BIRKS\], subsequently to his first imprisonment, when Paul was
on his way to Nicopolis ([Tit 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012).md) in
Epirus, where he purposed passing the winter, shortly before his
martyrdom, A.D. 67. BIRKS thinks, from the similarity of the Epistle to
Titus and First Timothy, that both were written from the same place,
Corinth, and at dates not widely apart; First Timothy shortly after
coming to Corinth, before he had planned a journey to Epirus, the
Epistle to Titus afterwards. The journey to Crete and Ephesus for the
bearers of his letters would be easy from Corinth, and he could himself
thence easily pass into Epirus. He had shortly before visited Crete,
wherein a Church existed (though without due organization), the first
foundation of which he may have partly laid at his former visit ([Act
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#007), &c..md), when on his way to his
first imprisonment at Rome. That he returned to the East after his first
imprisonment appears most probable from [Phi
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024.md); [Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022.md). However, there may have been
seeds of Christianity sown in Crete, even before his first visit, by the
Cretans who heard Peter's preaching on Pentecost ([Act
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#011).md).

OCCASION OF WRITING.--Corrupt elements soon showed themselves in the
Cretan Church, similar to those noticed in the Epistles to Timothy, as
existing in the Ephesian Church, Judaism, false pretensions to science,
and practical ungodliness. Paul, on his late visit, had left Titus in
Crete to establish Church government, and ordain presbyters (deacons are
not mentioned). Titus had been several times employed by Paul on a
mission to the Corinthian Churches, and had probably thence visited
Crete, which was within easy reach of Corinth. Hence the suitableness of
his selection by the apostle for the superintendence of the Cretan
Church. Paul now follows up with instructions by letter those he had
already given to Titus in person on the qualifications of elders, and
the graces becoming the old, the young, and females, and warns him
against the unprofitable speculations so rife in Crete. The national
character of the Cretans was low in the extreme, as EPIMENIDES, quoted
in [Tit 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012.md), paints it. LIVY
\[History, 44.45\], stigmatizes their avarice; POLYBIUS \[Histories,
6.46.9\], their ferocity and fraud; and \[Histories, 6.47.5\], their
mendacity, so much so, that "to Cretanize" is another name for to lie:
they were included in the proverbial three infamous initials "K" or "C,"
"Cappadocia, Crete, Cilicia."

NOTICES OF TITUS.--It is strange that he is never mentioned by this name
in Acts, and there seems none of those mentioned in that book who
exactly answers to him. He was a Greek, and therefore a Gentile ([Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md), [Gal
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#003).md), and converted by Paul ([Tit
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004).md). He accompanied the apostle on
the deputation sent from the Church of Antioch to Jerusalem, to consult
the apostles respecting the circumcision of Gentile converts ([Act
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002).md); and, agreeably to the decree of
the council there, was not circumcised. He was in company with Paul at
Ephesus, whence he was sent to Corinth to commence the collection for
the Jerusalem saints, and to ascertain the effect of the First Epistle
on the Corinthians ([Co2 7:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006.md); [Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006.md); [Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018).md), and there showed an
unmercenary spirit. He next proceeded to Macedon, where he joined Paul,
who had been already eagerly expecting him at Troas ([Co2
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md), "Titus my brother," [Co2
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006).md). He was then employed by the
apostle in preparing the collection for the poor saints in Judea, and
became the bearer of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians ([Co2
8:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md), [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023).md). Paul in it calls him "my
partner and fellow helper concerning you." His being located in Crete
([Tit 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005).md) was subsequent to Paul's
first imprisonment, and shortly before the second, about A.D. 67, ten
years subsequent to the last notice of him in Second Corinthians ([Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018).md), A.D. 57. He probably met Paul,
as the apostle desired, at Nicopolis; for his subsequent journey into
Dalmatia, thence (or else from Rome, whither he may have accompanied
Paul) would be more likely, than from the distant Crete ([Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md), written subsequently to the
Epistle to Titus). In the unsettled state of things then, Titus'
episcopal commission in Crete was to be but temporary, Paul requiring
the presence of Titus with himself, whenever Artemas or Tychicus should
arrive in Crete and set him free from his duties there.

Tradition represents him to have died peaceably in Crete, as archbishop
of Gortyna, at an advanced age.
