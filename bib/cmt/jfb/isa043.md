Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 43](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)

[Isaiah 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 43:1</span></span>

A SUCCESSION OF ARGUMENTS WHEREIN ISRAEL MAY BE ASSURED THAT,
NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR PERVERSITY TOWARDS GOD ([Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025)), HE WILL DELIVER AND RESTORE
THEM. (Isa. 43:1-28)

But now--notwithstanding God's past just judgments for Israel's sins.

created--not only in the general sense, but specially created as a
peculiar people unto Himself ([Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007), [Isa
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015), [Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021); [Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002), [Isa
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#021), [Isa
44:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#024)). So believers, "created in
Christ Jesus" ([Eph 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)), "a peculiar
people" ([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)).

redeemed--a second argument why they should trust Him besides creation.
The Hebrew means to ransom by a price paid in lieu of the captives
(compare [Isa 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003)). Babylon was to be
the ransom in this case, that is, was to be destroyed, in order that
they might be delivered; so Christ became a curse, doomed to death, that
we might be redeemed.

called . . . by . . . name--not merely "called" in general, as in [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006); [Isa
48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012); [Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002), but designated as His own
peculiar people (compare [Isa 45:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#003);
[Exo 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001); [Exo
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#012); [Joh
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#003)).

[Isaiah 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 43:2</span></span>

rivers . . . not overflow thee--so in passing Jordan, though at its
"overflow," when its "swellings" were especially dangerous ([Jos
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015); [Jer
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005)).

waters . . . fire--a proverbial phrase for the extremest perils ([Psa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012); also [Psa
138:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#007)). Literally fulfilled at the Red
Sea ([Exo 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021)), and in the case
of the three youths cast into the fiery furnace for conscience' sake
([Dan 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#025), [Dan
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 43:3</span></span>

Egypt for thy ransom--Either Egypt or Israel must perish; God chose that
Egypt, though so much more mighty, should be destroyed, in order that
His people might be delivered; thus Egypt stood, instead of Israel, as a
kind of "ransom." The Hebrew, kopher, means properly "that with which
anything is overlaid," as the pitch with which the ark was overlaid;
hence that which covers over sins, an atonement. Nebuchadnezzar had
subdued Egypt, Ethiopia (Hebrew, Cush), and Saba (descended from Cush,
[Gen 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007), probably Meroe of Ethiopia,
a great island formed by the Astaboras and the Nile, conquered by
Cambyses, successor of Cyrus). Cyrus received these from God with the
rest of the Babylonian dominions, in consideration of his being about to
deliver Israel. However, the reference may be to the three years' war in
which Sargon overcame these countries, and so had his attention diverted
from Israel (see on [Isa 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001))
\[VITRINGA\]. But the reference is probably more general, namely, to all
the instances in which Jehovah sacrificed mighty heathen nations, when
the safety of Israel required it.

[Isaiah 43:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 43:4</span></span>

Since--All along from the beginning; for there was never a time when
Israel was not Jehovah's people. The apodosis should be at, "I will
give." "Since ever thou wast precious in My sight, honorable, and that I
loved thee, I will give," &c. \[MAURER\]. GESENIUS, as English Version,
takes "Since" to mean, "Inasmuch as." If the apodosis be as in English
Version, "Since thou wast precious" will refer to the time when God
called His people out of Egypt, manifesting then first the love which He
had from everlasting towards them ([Jer
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#003); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)); "honorable" and "loved," refer
to outward marks of honor and love from God.

men . . . people--other nations for thee (so [Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003)).

thy life--thy person.

[Isaiah 43:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 43:5</span></span>

([Deu 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#003)).

seed--descendants scattered in all lands. VITRINGA understands it of the
spiritual "seed" of the Church produced by mystical regeneration: for
the expression is, "bring," not "bring back." This sense is perhaps
included, but not to the exclusion of the literal Israel's restoration
([Jer 30:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010); [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009); [Zac
2:6-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 43:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 43:6</span></span>

Give up--namely, My people.

sons . . . daughters--The feminine joined to the masculine expresses the
complete totality of anything ([Zac
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 43:7</span></span>

called by my name--belong to Israel, whose people, as sons of God, bear
the name of their Father ([Isa 44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005);
[Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001)).

for my glory-- ([Isa 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021); [Isa
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 43:8</span></span>

Solemn challenge given by God to the nations to argue with Him the
question of His superiority to their idols, and His power to deliver
Israel ([Isa 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)).

blind people--the Gentiles, who also, like Israel ([Isa
42:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#019)), are blind (spiritually),
though having eyes; that is, natural faculties, whereby they might know
God ([Rom 1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)) \[LOWTH\]. Or else,
the Jews \[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 43:9</span></span>

who . . . can declare this--who among the idolatrous soothsayers hath
predicted this; that is, as to Cyrus being the deliverer of Israel?

former--predictions, as in [Isa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009)
\[MAURER\]. Or, things that shall first come to pass (see on [Isa
41:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#021)) \[BARNES\].

let them bring forth their witnesses--as I do mine ([Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010)).

justified--declared veracious in their pretended prophecies.

or--rather, "and"; let men hear their prediction and say, from the
event, It is verified (see on [Isa
41:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 43:10</span></span>

Ye--the Jews, to whom I have given predictions, verified by the event;
and in delivering whom I have so often manifested MY power (see [Isa
43:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003); [Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008)).

and my servant--that is, the whole Jewish people ([Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008)).

believe--trust in.

formed--before I existed none of the false gods were formed. "Formed"
applies to the idols, not to God. [Rev
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#011) uses the same language to prove
the Godhead of Jesus, as Isaiah here to prove the Godhead of Jehovah.

[Isaiah 43:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 43:11</span></span>

Lord--Jehovah.

saviour--temporally, from Babylon: eternally, from sin and hell ([Hos
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004); [Act
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012)). The same titles as are applied
to God are applied to Jesus.

[Isaiah 43:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 43:12</span></span>

declared--predicted the future ([Isa
41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022)).

saved--the nation, in past times of danger.

showed--namely, that I was God.

when . . . no strange god, &c.--to whom the predictions uttered by Me
could be assigned. "Strange" means foreign, introduced from abroad.

[Isaiah 43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 43:13</span></span>

before--literally, from the time of the first existence of day.

let--Old English for "hinder" ([Isa
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#027)). Rather, translate, "undo it"
\[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 43:14</span></span>

sent--namely, the Medes and Persians ([Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005); [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003)).

brought down--"made to go down" to the sea ([Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010)), in order to escape the
impending destruction of Babylon.

nobles--rather, "fugitives," namely, the foreigners who sojourned in
populous Babylon ([Isa 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#014)),
distinct from the Chaldeans \[MAURER\].

whose cry is in the ships--exulting in their ships with the joyous
sailors--cry, boastingly; their joy heretofore in their ships contrasts
sadly with their present panic in fleeing to them ([Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002); [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015)). Babylon was on the Euphrates,
which was joined to the Tigris by a canal, and flowed into the Persian
Gulf. Thus it was famed for ships and commerce until the Persian
monarchs, to prevent revolt or invasion, obstructed navigation by dams
across the Tigris and Euphrates.

[Isaiah 43:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 43:15</span></span>

creator of Israel-- ([Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001)).

your--proved to be specially yours by delivering you.

[Isaiah 43:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 43:16</span></span>

Allusion to the deliverance of Israel and overthrow of Pharaoh in the
Red Sea, the standing illustration of God's unchanging character towards
His people ([Exo 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021), [Exo
14:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 43:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 43:17</span></span>

the power--the might of the enemies host, every mighty warrior.

they shall lie down together--as Pharaoh's army sank "together" in a
watery grave.

[Isaiah 43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 43:18</span></span>

So wonderful shall be God's future interpositions in your behalf, that
all past ones shall be forgotten in comparison. Plainly the future
restoration of Israel is the event ultimately meant. Thus the "former
things" are such events as the destruction of Sennacherib and the return
from Babylon. "Things of old" are events still more ancient, the
deliverance from Egypt and at the Red Sea, and entry into Canaan
\[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 43:19</span></span>

new--unprecedented in its wonderful character ([Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009)).

spring forth--as a germinating herb: a beautiful image of the silent but
certain gradual growth of events in God's providence ([Mar
4:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)).

way in . . . wilderness--just as Israel in the wilderness, between the
Red Sea and Canaan, was guided, and supplied with water by Jehovah; but
the "new" deliverance shall be attended with manifestations of God's
power and love, eclipsing the old (compare [Isa
41:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017)). "I will open a way, not
merely in the Red Sea, but in the wilderness of the whole world; and not
merely one river shall gush out of the rock, but many, which shall
refresh, not the bodies as formerly, but the souls of the thirsty, so
that the prophecy shall be fulfilled: 'With joy shall ye draw water out
of the wells of salvation'" \[JEROME\]. "A way" often stands for the
true religion ([Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002); [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)). "Rivers" express the
influences of the Holy Spirit ([Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037)). Israel's literal restoration
hereafter is included, as appears by comparing [Isa
11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).

[Isaiah 43:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 43:20</span></span>

beast--image of idolaters, defiled with blood and pollutions, dwelling
like dragons, &c., in the wastes of Gentile ignorance: even they shall
be converted. Or else, literally, such copious floods of water shall be
given by God in the desert, that the very beasts shall (in poetic
language) praise the Lord ([Psa
148:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#010)) \[JEROME\].

dragons--"serpents," or else jackals (see on [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)).

owls--rather, "ostriches."

[Isaiah 43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 43:21</span></span>

This people--namely, The same as "My people, My chosen" (see [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001), [Isa
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#007); [Psa
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018)).

my praise--on account of the many and great benefits conferred on them,
especially their restoration.

[Isaiah 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 43:22</span></span>

But--Israel, however, is not to think that these divine favors are due
to their own piety towards God. So the believer ([Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005)).

but--rather, "for."

weary of me-- ([Amo 8:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#005); [Mal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013)), though "I have not wearied
thee" ([Isa 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023)), yet "thou hast
been weary of Me."

[Isaiah 43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 43:23</span></span>

small cattle--rather, the "lamb" or "kid," required by the law to be
daily offered to God ([Exo 29:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#038); [Num
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#003)).

sacrifices--offered any way; whereas the Hebrew for "holocaust," or
"burnt offering," denotes that which ascends as an offering consumed by
fire.

I have not caused thee to serve--that is, to render the the service of a
slave ([Mat 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030); [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018); [Jo1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003)).

offering--bloodless ([Lev 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#001)).

wearied--antithetical to [Isa 43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022),
"Thou hast been weary of Me." Though God in the law required such
offerings, yet not so as to "weary" the worshipper, or to exact them in
cases where, as in the Babylonish captivity, they were physically unable
to render them; God did not require them, save in subordination to the
higher moral duties ([Psa 50:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#008);
[Psa 51:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016); [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003), [Mic
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 43:24</span></span>

bought--for "sweet cane" (aromatic calamus) was not indigenous to
Palestine, but had to be bought from foreign countries ([Jer
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020)). It was used among the Hebrews
to make the sacred ointment ([Exo
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#023)). It is often offered as a mark
of hospitality.

filled--satiated ([Jer 31:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#014)). God
deigns to use human language to adapt Himself to human modes of thought.

made me to serve--though "I have not caused thee to serve" ([Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023)). Our sin made the Son of God to
become "a servant." He served to save us from servile bondage ([Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007); [Heb
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)).

wearied me--Though I have "not wearied thee" ([Isa
43:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#023); see [Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014)).

[Isaiah 43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 43:25</span></span>

I, even I--the God against whom your sin is committed, and who alone can
and will pardon. ([Isa 44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022)).

for mine own sake-- ([Isa 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009), [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011)). How abominable a thing sin is,
since it is against such a God of grace! "Blotted out" is an image from
an account-book, in which, when a debt is paid, the charge is cancelled
or blotted out.

not remember . . . sins-- ([Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034)). When God forgives, He forgets;
that is, treats the sinner as if He had forgotten his sins.

[Isaiah 43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 43:26</span></span>

Put me in remembrance--Remind Me of every plea which thou hast to urge
before Me in thy defense. Image from a trial ([Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018); [Isa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#001)). Our strongest plea is to remind
God of His own promises. So Jacob did at Mahanaim and Peniel ([Gen
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#009), [Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012)). God, then, instead of
"pleading against us with His great power," "will put His strength" in
us ([Job 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006)); we thus become "the
Lord's remembrancers" ([Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006),
Margin). "Declare God's righteousness" vindicated in Jesus Christ "that
thou mayest be justified" ([Rom 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026);
compare [Isa 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001), and [Psa
143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 43:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 43:27</span></span>

first father--collectively for "most ancient ancestors," as the
parallelism ("teachers") proves \[MAURER\]. Or, thy chief religious
ministers or priests \[GESENIUS\]. Adam, the common father of all
nations, can hardly be meant here, as it would have been irrelevant to
mention his sin in an address to the Jews specially. Abraham is equally
out of place here, as he is everywhere cited as an example of
faithfulness, not of "sin." However, taking the passage in its ultimate
application to the Church at large, Adam may be meant.

teachers--literally, "interpreters" between God and man, the priests
([Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)).

[Isaiah 43:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 43:28</span></span>

profaned the princes-- ([Psa 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039);
[Lam 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#002), [Lam
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#006)). I have esteemed, or treated,
them as persons not sacred. I have left them to suffer the same
treatment as the common people, stripped of their holy office and in
captivity.

princes of the sanctuary--"governors of" it ([Ch1
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005)); directing its holy services;
priests.

curse--Hebrew, cherim, a "solemn anathema," or "excommunication."

reproaches-- ([Psa 123:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003)).
