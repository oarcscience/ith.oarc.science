### [Isaiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)

[Isaiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 28:1</span></span>

(Isa. 28:1-29)

crown of pride--Hebrew for "proud crown of the drunkards," &c.
\[HORSLEY\], namely, Samaria, the capital of Ephraim, or Israel.
"Drunkards," literally ([Isa 28:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007);
[Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011), [Isa
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001); [Amo
6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)) and metaphorically, like
drunkards, rushing on to their own destruction.

beauty . . . flower--"whose glorious beauty or ornament is a fading
flower." Carrying on the image of "drunkards"; it was the custom at
feasts to wreathe the brow with flowers; so Samaria, "which is (not as
English Version, 'which are') upon the head of the fertile valley," that
is, situated on a hill surrounded with the rich valleys as a garland
([Kg1 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024)); but the garland is
"fading," as garlands often do, because Ephraim is now close to ruin
(compare [Isa 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#008)); fulfilled 721
B.C. ([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006), [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024)).

[Isaiah 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 28:2</span></span>

strong one--the Assyrian ([Isa 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005)).

cast down--namely, Ephraim ([Isa 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001))
and Samaria, its crown.

with . . . hand--with violence ([Isa
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 28:3</span></span>

crown . . . the drunkards--rather, "the crown of the drunkards."

[Isaiah 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 28:4</span></span>

Rather, "the fading flower, their glorious beauty ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)), which is on the head of the fat
(fertile) valley, shall be as the early fig" \[G. V. SMITH\]. Figs
usually ripened in August; but earlier ones (Hebrew bikkurah, Spanish
bokkore) in June, and were regarded as a delicacy ([Jer
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002); [Hos
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#010); [Mic
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001)).

while it is yet--that is, immediately, without delay; describing the
eagerness of the Assyrian Shalmaneser, not merely to conquer, but to
destroy utterly Samaria; whereas other conquered cities were often
spared.

[Isaiah 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 28:5</span></span>

The prophet now turns to Judah; a gracious promise to the remnant
("residue"); a warning lest through like sins Judah should share the
fate of Samaria.

crown--in antithesis to the "fading crown" of Ephraim ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001), [Isa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#003)).

the residue--primarily, Judah, in the prosperous reign of Hezekiah ([Kg2
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007)), antitypically, the elect of
God; as He here is called their "crown and diadem," so are they called
His ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003)); a beautiful
reciprocity.

[Isaiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 28:6</span></span>

Jehovah will inspire their magistrates with justice, and their soldiers
with strength of spirit.

turn . . . battle to . . . gate--the defenders of their country who not
only repel the foe from themselves, but drive him to the gates of his
own cities ([Sa2 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#023); [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 28:7</span></span>

Though Judah is to survive the fall of Ephraim, yet "they also" (the men
of Judah) have perpetrated like sins to those of Samaria ([Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003), [Isa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011)), which must be chastised by God.

erred . . . are out of the way--"stagger . . . reel." Repeated, to
express the frequency of the vice.

priest . . . prophet--If the ministers of religion sin so grievously,
how much more the other rulers ([Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010), [Isa
56:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#012))!

vision--even in that most sacred function of the prophet to declare
God's will revealed to them.

judgment--The priests had the administration of the law committed to
them ([Deu 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009); [Deu
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#017)). It was against the law for the
priests to take wine before entering the tabernacle ([Lev
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009); [Eze
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 28:9</span></span>

Here the drunkards are introduced as scoffingly commenting on Isaiah's
warnings: "Whom will he (does Isaiah presume to) teach knowledge? And
whom will He make to understand instruction? Is it those (that is, does
he take us to be) just weaned, &c.? For (he is constantly repeating, as
if to little children) precept upon precept," &c.

line--a rule or law. \[MAURER\]. The repetition of sounds in Hebrew tzav
latzav, tzav latzav, qav laqav, qav laquav, expresses the scorn of the
imitators of Isaiah's speaking; he spoke stammering ([Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011)). God's mode of teaching offends
by its simplicity the pride of sinners ([Kg2
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#011); [Co1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)). Stammerers as they were by
drunkenness, and children in knowledge of God, they needed to be spoken
to in the language of children, and "with stammering lips" (compare [Mat
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013)). A just and merciful
retribution.

[Isaiah 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 28:11</span></span>

For--rather, "Truly." This is Isaiah's reply to the scoffers: Your
drunken questions shall be answered by the severe lessons from God
conveyed through the Assyrians and Babylonians; the dialect of these,
though Semitic, like the Hebrew, was so far different as to sound to the
Jews like the speech of stammerers (compare [Isa
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#019); [Isa
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#011)). To them who will not
understand God will speak still more unintelligibly.

[Isaiah 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 28:12</span></span>

Rather, "He (Jehovah) who hath said to them."

this . . . the rest--Reference may be primarily to "rest" from national
warlike preparations, the Jews being at the time "weary" through various
preceding calamities, as the Syro-Israelite invasion ([Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008); compare [Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015); [Isa
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#008); [Isa
39:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#002); [Isa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#001); [Kg2
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#008)). But spiritually, the "rest"
meant is that to be found in obeying those very "precepts" of God ([Isa
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#010)) which they jeered at (compare
[Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016); [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)).

[Isaiah 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 28:13</span></span>

But--rather, "Therefore," namely, because "they would not hear" ([Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012)).

that they might go--the designed result to those who, from a defect of
the will, so far from profiting by God's mode of instructing, "precept
upon precept," &c., made it into a stumbling-block ([Hos
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005); [Hos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#012); [Mat
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014)).

go, and fall--image appropriately from "drunkards" ([Isa
28:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007), which they were) who in trying
to "go forward fall backward."

[Isaiah 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 28:14</span></span>

scornful--(See on [Isa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)).

[Isaiah 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 28:15</span></span>

said--virtually, in your conduct, if not in words.

covenant--There may be a tacit reference to their confidence in their
"covenant" with the Assyrians in the early part of Hezekiah's prosperous
reign, before he ceased to pay tribute to them, as if it ensured Judah
from evil, whatever might befall the neighboring Ephraim ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001)). The full meaning is shown by
the language ("covenant with death--hell," or sheol) to apply to all
lulled in false security spiritually ([Psa
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004); [Ecc
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#008); [Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011)); the godly alone are in covenant
with death ([Job 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#023); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018); [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022)).

overflowing scourge--two metaphors: the hostile Assyrian armies like an
overwhelming flood.

pass through--namely, through Judea on their way to Egypt, to punish it
as the protector of Samaria ([Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004)).

lies--They did not use these words, but Isaiah designates their
sentiments by their true name ([Amo
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#004)).

[Isaiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 28:16</span></span>

Literally, "Behold Me as Him who has laid"; namely, in My divine counsel
([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)); none save I could lay it
([Isa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)).

stone--Jesus Christ; Hezekiah \[MAURER\], or the temple \[EWALD\], do
not realize the full significancy of the language; but only in type
point to Him, in whom the prophecy receives its exhaustive
accomplishment; whether Isaiah understood its fulness or not ([Pe1
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011)), the Holy Ghost plainly
contemplated its fulfilment in Christ alone; so in [Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001); compare [Gen
49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024); [Psa
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022); [Mat
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042); [Rom
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011); [Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020).

tried--both by the devil ([Luk 4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001))
and by men (Luke 20:1-38), and even by God ([Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046)); a stone of tested solidity to
bear the vast superstructure of man's redemption. The tested
righteousness of Christ gives its peculiar merit to His vicarious
sacrifice. The connection with the context is, though a "scourge" shall
visit Judea ([Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015)), yet God's
gracious purpose as to the elect remnant, and His kingdom of which
"Zion" shall be the center, shall not fail, because its rests on Messiah
([Mat 7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)).

precious--literally, "of preciousness," so in the Greek, ([Pe1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007)). He is preciousness.

corner-stone-- ([Kg1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017); [Kg1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009); [Job
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#006)); the stone laid at the corner
where two walls meet and connecting them; often costly.

make haste--flee in hasty alarm; but the Septuagint has "be ashamed"; so
[Rom 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033), and [Pe1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006), "be confounded," substantially
the same idea; he who rests on Him shall not have the shame of
disappointment, nor flee in sudden panic (see [Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015); [Isa
32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 28:17</span></span>

line--the measuring-line of the plummet. HORSLEY translates, "I will
appoint judgment for the rule, and justice for the plummet." As the
corner-stone stands most perpendicular and exactly proportioned, so
Jehovah, while holding out grace to believers in the Foundation-stone,
will judge the scoffers ([Isa 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015))
according to the exact justice of the law (compare [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)).

hail--divine judgment ([Isa 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030);
[Isa 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 28:18</span></span>

disannulled--obliterated, as letters traced on a waxen tablet are
obliterated by passing the stylus over it.

trodden down--passing from the metaphor in "scourge" to the thing meant,
the army which treads down its enemies.

[Isaiah 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 28:19</span></span>

From the time, &c.--rather, "As often as it comes over (that is, passes
through), it shall overtake you" \[HORSLEY\]; like a flood returning
from time to time, frequent hostile invasions shall assail Judah, after
the deportation of the ten tribes.

vexation . . . understand . . . report--rather, "It shall be a terror
even to hear the mere report of it" \[MAURER\], ([Sa1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#011)). But G. V. SMITH, "Hard
treatment (HORSLEY, 'dispersion') only shall make you to understand
instruction"; they scorned at the simple way in which the prophet
offered it ([Isa 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)); therefore,
they must be taught by the severe teachings of adversity.

[Isaiah 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 28:20</span></span>

Proverbial, for they shall find all their sources of confidence fail
them; all shall be hopeless perplexity in their affairs.

[Isaiah 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 28:21</span></span>

Perazim--In the valley of Rephaim ([Sa2
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#018), [Sa2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020); [Ch1
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011)), there Jehovah, by David, broke
forth as waters do, and made a breach among the Philistines, David's
enemies, as Perazim means, expressing a sudden and complete overthrow.

Gibeon-- ([Ch1 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#016); [Sa2
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#025), Margin); not Joshua's victory
([Jos 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#010)).

strange--as being against His own people; judgment is not what God
delights in; it is, though necessary, yet strange to Him ([Lam
3:33](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#033)).

work--punishing the guilty ([Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 28:22</span></span>

mockers--a sin which they had committed ([Isa
28:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#009)).

bands--their Assyrian bondage ([Isa
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#027)); Judah was then tributary to
Assyria; or, "lest your punishment be made still more severe" ([Isa
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#022)).

consumption--destruction ([Isa
10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022); [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)).

[Isaiah 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 28:23</span></span>

Calling attention to the following illustration from husbandry ([Psa
49:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001)). As the husbandman does his
different kinds of work, each in its right time and due proportion, so
God adapts His measures to the varying exigencies of the several cases:
now mercy, now judgments; now punishing sooner, now later (an answer to
the scoff that His judgments, being put off so long, would never come at
all, [Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019)); His object being not
to destroy His people any more than the farmer's object in threshing is
to destroy his crop; this vindicates God's "strange work" ([Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021)) in punishing His people.
Compare the same image, [Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006);
[Hos 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023); [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).

[Isaiah 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 28:24</span></span>

all day--emphatic; he is not always ploughing: he also "sows," and that,
too, in accordance with sure rules ([Isa
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#025)).

doth he open--supply "always." Is he always harrowing?

[Isaiah 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 28:25</span></span>

face--the "surface" of the ground: "made plain," or level, by harrowing.

fitches--rather, "dill," or "fennel"; Nigella romana, with black seed,
easily beaten out, used as a condiment and medicine in the East. So the
Septuagint, "cummin" was used in the same way.

cast in . . . principal wheat--rather, plant the wheat in rows (for
wheat was thought to yield the largest crop, by being planted sparingly
\[PLINY, Natural History, 18.21\]); \[MAURER\]; "sow the wheat
regularly" \[HORSLEY\]. But GESENIUS, like English Version, "fat," or
"principal," that is, excellent wheat.

appointed barley--rather, "barley in its appointed place" \[MAURER\].

in their place--rather, "in its (the field's) border" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 28:26</span></span>

to discretion--in the due rules of husbandry; God first taught it to man
([Gen 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 28:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 28:27</span></span>

The husbandman uses the same discretion in threshing. The dill
("fitches") and cummin, leguminous and tender grains, are beaten out,
not as wheat, &c., with the heavy corn-drag ("threshing instrument"),
but with "a staff"; heavy instruments would crush and injure the seed.

cart wheel--two iron wheels armed with iron teeth, like a saw, joined
together by a wooden axle. The "corn-drag" was made of three or four
wooden cylinders, armed with iron teeth or flint stones fixed
underneath, and joined like a sledge. Both instruments cut the straw for
fodder as well as separated the corn.

staff--used also where they had but a small quantity of corn; the flail
([Rut 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 28:28</span></span>

Bread corn--corn of which bread is made.

bruised--threshed with the corn-drag (as contrasted with dill and
cummin, "beaten with the staff"), or, "trodden out" by the hoofs of
cattle driven over it on the threshing-floor \[G. V. SMITH\], ([Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004); [Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013)).

because--rather, "but" \[HORSLEY\]; though the corn is threshed with the
heavy instrument, yet he will not always be thus threshing it.

break it--"drive over it (continually) the wheel" \[MAURER\].

cart--threshing-drag.

horsemen--rather, "horses"; used to tread out corn.

[Isaiah 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">isa 28:29</span></span>

This also--The skill wherewith the husbandman duly adjusts his modes of
threshing is given by God, as well as the skill ([Isa
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#026)) wherewith he tills and sows
([Isa 28:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#024)). Therefore He must
also be able to adapt His modes of treatment to the several moral needs
of His creatures. His object in sending tribulation (derived from the
Latin tribulum, a "threshing instrument," [Luk
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031); [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)) is to sever the moral chaff from
the wheat, not to crush utterly; "His judgments are usually in the line
of our offenses; by the nature of the judgments we may usually ascertain
the nature of the sin" \[BARNES\].

This chapter opens the series of prophecies as to the invasion of Judea
under Sennacherib, and its deliverance.
