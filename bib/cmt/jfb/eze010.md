### [Ezekiel Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 10:1</span></span>

VISION OF COALS OF FIRE SCATTERED OVER THE CITY: REPETITION OF THE
VISION OF THE CHERUBIM. (Eze. 10:1-22)

The throne of Jehovah appearing in the midst of the judgments implies
that whatever intermediate agencies be employed, He controls them, and
that the whole flows as a necessary consequence from His essential
holiness ([Eze 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#022.md), [Eze
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026).md).

cherubim--in [Eze 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005.md), called "living
creatures." The repetition of the vision implies that the judgments are
approaching nearer and nearer. These two visions of Deity were granted
in the beginning of Ezekiel's career, to qualify him for witnessing to
God's glory amidst his God-forgetting people and to stamp truth on his
announcements; also to signify the removal of God's manifestation from
the visible temple ([Eze 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018).md) for a
long period ([Eze 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002).md). The feature
([Eze 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012).md) mentioned as to the
cherubim that they were "full of eyes," though omitted in the former
vision, is not a difference, but a more specific detail observed by
Ezekiel now on closer inspection. Also, here, there is no rainbow (the
symbol of mercy after the flood of wrath) as in the former; for here
judgment is the prominent thought, though the marking of the remnant in
[Eze 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md), [Eze
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md) shows that there was mercy in the
background. The cherubim, perhaps, represent redeemed humanity combining
in and with itself the highest forms of subordinate creaturely life
(compare [Rom 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020).md). Therefore they
are associated with the twenty-four elders and are distinguished from
the angels ([Rev 5:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001).md). They stand
on the mercy seat of the ark, and on that ground become the habitation
of God from which His glory is to shine upon the world. The different
forms symbolize the different phases of the Church. So the quadriform
Gospel, in which the incarnate Saviour has lodged the revelation of
Himself in a fourfold aspect, and from which His glory shines on the
Christian world, answers to the emblematic throne from which He shone on
the Jewish Church.

[Ezekiel 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 10:2</span></span>

he--Jehovah; He who sat on the "throne."

the man--the Messenger of mercy becoming the Messenger of judgment (see
on [Eze 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002).md). Human agents of
destruction shall fulfil the will of "the Man," who is Lord of men.

wheels--Hebrew, galgal, implying quick revolution; so the impetuous
onset of the foe (compare [Eze 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#024.md);
[Eze 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#010).md); whereas "ophan," in [Eze
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015.md) implies mere revolution.

coals of fire--the wrath of God about to burn the city, as His sword had
previously slain its guilty inhabitants. This "fire," how different from
the fire on the altar never going out ([Lev
6:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012).md), whereby, in type, peace was
made with God! Compare [Isa 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#012.md),
[Isa 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014.md). It is therefore not taken
from the altar of reconciliation, but from between the wheels of the
cherubim, representing the providence of God, whereby, and not by
chance, judgment is to fall.

[Ezekiel 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 10:3</span></span>

right . . . of . . . house--The scene of the locality whence judgment
emanates is the temple, to mark God's vindication of His holiness
injured there. The cherubim here are not those in the holy of holies,
for the latter had not "wheels." They stood on "the right of the house,"
that is, the south, for the Chaldean power, guided by them, had already
advanced from the north (the direction of Babylon), and had destroyed
the men in the temple, and was now proceeding to destroy the city, which
lay south and west.

the cherubim . . . the man--There was perfect concert of action between
the cherubic representative of the angels and "the Man," to minister to
whom they "stood" there ([Eze 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#007).md).

cloud--emblem of God's displeasure; as the "glory" or "brightness" ([Eze
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004).md) typifies His majesty and
clearness in judgment.

[Ezekiel 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 10:4</span></span>

The court outside was full of the Lord's brightness, while it was only
the cloud that filled the house inside, the scene of idolatries, and
therefore of God's displeasure. God's throne was on the threshold. The
temple, once filled with brightness, is now darkened with cloud.

[Ezekiel 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 10:5</span></span>

sound of . . . wings--prognostic of great and awful changes.

voice of . . . God--the thunder ([Psa
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003), &c..md).

[Ezekiel 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 10:6</span></span>

went in--not into the temple, but between the cherubim. Ezekiel sets
aside the Jews' boast of the presence of God with them. The cherubim,
once the ministers of grace, are now the ministers of vengeance. When
"commanded," He without delay obeys ([Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md); [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 10:7</span></span>

See on [Eze 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#003.md).

one cherub--one of the four cherubim.

his hand-- ([Eze 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#008).md).

went out--to burn the city.

[Ezekiel 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 10:8</span></span>

The "wings" denote alacrity, the "hands" efficacy and aptness, in
executing the functions assigned to them.

[Ezekiel 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 10:9</span></span>

wheels--(See on [Eze 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#015).md). The
things which, from [Eze 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#008.md) to the
end of the chapter, are repeated from the first chapter are expressed
more decidedly, now that he gets a nearer view: the words "as it were,"
and "as if," so often occurring in the first chapter, are therefore
mostly omitted. The "wheels" express the manifold changes and
revolutions in the world; also that in the chariot of His providence God
transports the Church from one place to another and everywhere can
preserve it; a truth calculated to alarm the people in Jerusalem and to
console the exiles \[POLANUS\].

[Ezekiel 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 10:10</span></span>

four had one likeness--In the wonderful variety of God's works there is
the greatest harmony:--

"In human works, though labored on with pain,

One thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;

In God's one single doth its end produce,

Yet serves to second, too, some other use.

(See on [Eze 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016).md).

wheel . . . in . . . a wheel--cutting one another at fight angles, so
that the whole might move in any of the four directions or quarters of
the world. God's doings, however involved they seem to us, cohere, so
that lower causes subserve the higher.

[Ezekiel 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 10:11</span></span>

(See on [Eze 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#017).md).

turned not--without accomplishing their course ([Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011).md) \[GROTIUS\]. Rather, "they
moved straight on without turning" (so [Eze
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#009).md). Having a face towards each of
the four quarters, they needed not to turn around when changing their
direction.

whither . . . head looked--that is, "whither the head" of the animal
cherub-form, belonging to and directing each wheel, "looked," thither
the wheel "followed." The wheels were not guided by some external
adventitious impetus, but by some secret divine impulse of the cherubim
themselves.

[Ezekiel 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 10:12</span></span>

body--literally, "flesh," because a body consists of flesh.

wheels . . . full of eyes--The description ([Eze
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#018).md) attributes eyes to the "wheels"
alone; here there is added, on closer observation, that the cherubim
themselves had them. The "eyes" imply that God, by His wisdom,
beautifully reconciles seeming contrarieties (compare [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009.md); [Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003.md); [Zac
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 10:13</span></span>

O wheel--rather, "they were called, whirling," that is, they were most
rapid in their revolutions \[MAURER\]; or, better, "It was cried unto
them, The whirling" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. Galgal here used for "wheel," is
different from ophan, the simple word for "wheel." Galgal is the whole
wheelwork machinery with its whirlwind-like rotation. Their being so
addressed is in order to call them immediately to put themselves in
rapid motion.

[Ezekiel 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 10:14</span></span>

cherub--but in [Eze 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#010.md) it is an ox.
The chief of the four cherubic forms was not the ox, but man. Therefore
"cherub" cannot be synonymous with "ox." Probably Ezekiel, standing in
front of one of the cherubim (namely, that which handed the coals to the
man in linen), saw of him, not merely the ox-form, but the whole
fourfold form, and therefore calls him simply "cherub"; whereas of the
other three, having only a side view, he specifies the form of each
which met his eye \[FAIRBAIRN\]. As to the likelihood of the lower
animals sharing in "the restoration of all things," see [Isa
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md); [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025.md); [Rom
8:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md); this accords with the animal
forms combined with the human to typify redeemed man.

[Ezekiel 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 10:15</span></span>

The repeated declaration of the identity of the vision with that at the
Chebar is to arouse attention to it ([Eze
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#022.md); [Eze
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023).md).

the living creature--used collectively, as in [Eze
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#017.md), [Eze
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020.md); [Eze
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020.md).

[Ezekiel 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 10:16</span></span>

(See on [Eze 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#011.md); [Eze
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#019).md).

lifted up . . . wings--to depart, following "the glory of the Lord"
which was on the point of departing ([Eze
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 10:17</span></span>

([Eze 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#012.md), [Eze
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#020).md).

stood--God never stands still ([Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017).md), therefore neither do the
angels; but to human perceptions He seems to do so.

[Ezekiel 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 10:18</span></span>

The departure of the symbol of God's presence from the temple
preparatory to the destruction of the city. Foretold in [Deu
31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017.md). Woe be to those from whom God
departs ([Hos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012).md)! Compare [Sa1
28:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#015.md); [Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021.md) : "I-chabod, Thy glory is
departed." Successive steps are marked in His departure; so slowly and
reluctantly does the merciful God leave His house. First He leaves the
sanctuary ([Eze 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003).md); He elevates His
throne above the threshold of the house ([Eze
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#001).md); leaving the cherubim He sits on
the throne ([Eze 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004).md); He and the
cherubim, after standing for a time at the door of the east gate (where
was the exit to the lower court of the people), leave the house
altogether ([Eze 10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#018).md), not to
return till [Eze 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002.md).

[Ezekiel 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 10:20</span></span>

I knew . . . cherubim--By the second sight of the cherubim, he learned
to identify them with the angelic forms situated above the ark of the
covenant in the temple, which as a priest, he "knew" about from the high
priest.

[Ezekiel 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 10:21</span></span>

The repetition is in order that the people about to live without the
temple might have, instead, the knowledge of the temple mysteries, thus
preparing them for a future restoration of the covenant. So perverse
were they that they would say, "Ezekiel fancies he saw what has no
existence." He, therefore, repeats it over and over again.

[Ezekiel 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 10:22</span></span>

straight forward--intent upon the object they aimed at, not deviating
from the way nor losing sight of the end ([Luk
9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052).md).
