### [Genesis Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 48:1</span></span>

JOSEPH'S VISIT TO HIS SICK FATHER. (Gen. 48:1-22)

one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick--Joseph was hastily sent
for, and on this occasion he took with him his two sons.

[Genesis 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 48:2</span></span>

Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed--In the chamber where
a good man lies, edifying and spiritual discourse may be expected.

[Genesis 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 48:3</span></span>

God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz--The object of Jacob, in thus
reverting to the memorable vision at Beth-el \[[Gen
28:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#010.md)\] --one of the great
landmarks in his history--was to point out the splendid promises in
reserve for his posterity--to engage Joseph's interest and preserve his
continued connection with the people of God, rather than with the
Egyptians.

[Genesis 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 48:4</span></span>

Behold, I will make thee fruitful--This is a repetition of the covenant
([Gen 28:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#013.md); [Gen
35:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#012).md). Whether these words are to be
viewed in a limited sense, as pointing to the many centuries during
which the Jews were occupiers of the Holy Land, or whether the words
bear a wider meaning and intimate that the scattered tribes of Israel
are to be reinstated in the land of promise, as their "everlasting
possession," are points that have not yet been satisfactorily
determined.

[Genesis 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 48:5</span></span>

thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh--It was the intention of the aged
patriarch to adopt Joseph's sons as his own, thus giving him a double
portion. The reasons for this procedure are stated ([Ch1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001).md).

are mine--Though their connections might have attached them to Egypt and
opened to them brilliant prospects in the land of their nativity, they
willingly accepted the adoption ([Heb
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#025).md).

[Genesis 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 48:9</span></span>

Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them--The apostle
([Heb 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021).md) selected the blessing of
Joseph's son as the chief, because the most comprehensive, instance of
the patriarch's faith which his whole history furnishes.

[Genesis 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 48:13</span></span>

Joseph took them both--The very act of pronouncing the blessing was
remarkable, showing that Jacob's bosom was animated by the spirit of
prophecy.

[Genesis 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 48:21</span></span>

Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die--The patriarch could speak of
death with composure, but he wished to prepare Joseph and the rest of
the family for the shock.

but God shall be with you--Jacob, in all probability, was not authorized
to speak of their bondage--he dwelt only on the certainty of their
restoration to Canaan.

[Genesis 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 48:22</span></span>

moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren--This was
near Shechem ([Gen 33:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md); [Joh
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005.md); also [Jos
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001.md); [Jos
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md). And it is probable that the
Amorites, having seized upon it during one of his frequent absences, the
patriarch, with the united forces of his tribe, recovered it from them
by his sword and his bow.
