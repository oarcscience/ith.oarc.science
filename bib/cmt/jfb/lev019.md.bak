### [Leviticus Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 19:2</span></span>

A REPETITION OF SUNDRY LAWS. (Lev. 19:1-37)

Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel--Many of the
laws enumerated in this chapter had been previously announced. As they
were, however, of a general application, not suited to particular
classes, but to the nation at large, so Moses seems, according to divine
instructions, to have rehearsed them, perhaps on different occasions and
to successive divisions of the people, till "all the congregation of the
children of Israel" were taught to know them. The will of God in the Old
as well as the New Testament Church was not locked up in the
repositories of an unknown tongue, but communicated plainly and openly
to the people.

Ye shall be holy: for I . . . am holy--Separated from the world, the
people of God were required to be holy, for His character, His laws, and
service were holy. (See [Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015).md).

[Leviticus 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 19:3</span></span>

Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
sabbaths--The duty of obedience to parents is placed in connection with
the proper observance of the Sabbaths, both of them lying at the
foundation of practical religion.

[Leviticus 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 19:5</span></span>

if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye shall offer
it at your own will--Those which included thank offerings, or offerings
made for vows, were always freewill offerings. Except the portions
which, being waved and heaved, became the property of the priests (see
Lev. 3:1-17), the rest of the victim was eaten by the offerer and his
friend, under the following regulations, however, that, if thank
offerings, they were to be eaten on the day of their presentation; and
if a freewill offering, although it might be eaten on the second day,
yet if any remained of it till the third day, it was to be burnt, or
deep criminality was incurred by the person who then ventured to partake
of it. The reason of this strict prohibition seems to have been to
prevent any mysterious virtue being superstitiously attached to meat
offered on the altar.

[Leviticus 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lev 19:9</span></span>

And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap
the corners of thy field--The right of the poor in Israel to glean after
reapers, as well as to the unreaped corners of the field, was secured by
a positive statute; and this, in addition to other enactments connected
with the ceremonial law, formed a beneficial provision for their
support. At the same time, proprietors were not obliged to admit them
into the field until the grain had been carried off the field; and they
seem also to have been left at liberty to choose the poor whom they
deemed the most deserving or needful ([Rut
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#002.md), [Rut
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rut002.htm#008).md). This was the earliest law for
the benefit of the poor that we read of in the code of any people; and
it combined in admirable union the obligation of a public duty with the
exercise of private and voluntary benevolence at a time when the hearts
of the rich would be strongly inclined to liberality.

[Leviticus 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lev 19:11</span></span>

Ye shall not steal--A variety of social duties are inculcated in this
passage, chiefly in reference to common and little-thought-of vices to
which mankind are exceedingly prone; such as committing petty frauds, or
not scrupling to violate truth in transactions of business, ridiculing
bodily infirmities, or circulating stories to the prejudice of others.
In opposition to these bad habits, a spirit of humanity and brotherly
kindness is strongly enforced.

[Leviticus 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 19:17</span></span>

thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour--Instead of cherishing
latent feelings of malice or meditating purposes of revenge against a
person who has committed an insult or injury against them, God's people
were taught to remonstrate with the offender and endeavor, by calm and
kindly reason, to bring him to a sense of his fault.

not suffer sin upon him--literally, "that ye may not participate in his
sin."

[Leviticus 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 19:18</span></span>

thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself--The word "neighbour" is used
as synonymous with "fellow creature." The Israelites in a later age
restricted its meaning as applicable only to their own countrymen. This
narrow interpretation was refuted by our Lord in a beautiful parable
([Luk 10:30-37](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030).md).

[Leviticus 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 19:19</span></span>

Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind--This
prohibition was probably intended to discourage a practice which seemed
to infringe upon the economy which God has established in the animal
kingdom.

thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed--This also was directed
against an idolatrous practice, namely, that of the ancient Zabians, or
fire-worshippers, who sowed different seeds, accompanying the act with
magical rites and invocations; and commentators have generally thought
the design of this and the preceding law was to put an end to the
unnatural lusts and foolish superstitions which were prevalent among the
heathen. But the reason of the prohibition was probably deeper: for
those who have studied the diseases of land and vegetables tell us, that
the practice of mingling seeds is injurious both to flowers and to
grains. "If the various genera of the natural order GramineÃ&brvbr;,
which includes the grains and the grasses, should be sown in the same
field, and flower at the same time, so that the pollen of the two
flowers mix, a spurious seed will be the consequence, called by the
farmers chess. It is always inferior and unlike either of the two grains
that produced it, in size, flavor, and nutritious principles.
Independently of contributing to disease the soil, they never fail to
produce the same in animals and men that feed on them" \[WHITLAW\].

neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon
thee--Although this precept, like the other two with which it is
associated, was in all probability designed to root out some
superstition, it seems to have had a further meaning. The law, it is to
be observed, did not prohibit the Israelites wearing many different
kinds of cloths together, but only the two specified; and the
observations and researches of modern science have proved that "wool,
when combined with linen, increases its power of passing off the
electricity from the body. In hot climates, it brings on malignant
fevers and exhausts the strength; and when passing off from the body, it
meets with the heated air, inflames and excoriates like a blister"
\[WHITLAW\]. (See [Eze 44:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#017).md).

[Leviticus 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 19:23</span></span>

ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised; three years . . . it
shall not be eaten of--"The wisdom of this law is very striking. Every
gardener will teach us not to let fruit trees bear in their earliest
years, but to pluck off the blossoms: and for this reason, that they
will thus thrive the better, and bear more abundantly afterwards. The
very expression, 'to regard them as uncircumcised,' suggests the
propriety of pinching them off; I do not say cutting them off, because
it is generally the hand, and not a knife, that is employed in this
operation" \[MICHAELIS\].

[Leviticus 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 19:26</span></span>

shall not eat any thing with the blood--(See on [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md).

neither . . . use enchantment, nor observe times--The former refers to
divination by serpents--one of the earliest forms of enchantment, and
the other means the observation, literally, of clouds, as a study of the
appearance and motion of clouds was a common way of foretelling good or
bad fortune. Such absurd but deep-rooted superstitions often put a stop
to the prosecution of serious and important transactions, but they were
forbidden especially as implying a want of faith in the being, or of
reliance on the providence of God.

[Leviticus 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 19:27</span></span>

Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, &c.--It seems probable
that this fashion had been learned by the Israelites in Egypt, for the
ancient Egyptians had their dark locks cropped short or shaved with
great nicety, so that what remained on the crown appeared in the form of
a circle surrounding the head, while the beard was dressed into a square
form. This kind of coiffure had a highly idolatrous meaning; and it was
adopted, with some slight variations, by almost all idolaters in ancient
times. ([Jer 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#025.md); [Jer
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#023.md), where "in the utmost corners"
means having the corners of their hair cut.) Frequently a lock or tuft
of hair was left on the hinder part of the head, the rest being cut
round in the form of a ring, as the Turks, Chinese, and Hindus do at the
present day.

neither shalt thou mar, &c.--The Egyptians used to cut or shave off
their whiskers, as may be seen in the coffins of mummies, and the
representations of divinities on the monuments. But the Hebrews, in
order to separate them from the neighboring nations, or perhaps to put a
stop to some existing superstition, were forbidden to imitate this
practice. It may appear surprising that Moses should condescend to such
minutiÃ&brvbr; as that of regulating the fashion of the hair and the
beard--matters which do not usually occupy the attention of a
legislator--and which appear widely remote from the province either of
government or of a religion. A strong presumption, therefore, arises
that he had in mind by these regulations to combat some superstitious
practices of the Egyptians.

[Leviticus 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">lev 19:28</span></span>

Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead--The practice
of making deep gashes on the face and arms and legs, in time of
bereavement, was universal among the heathen, and it was deemed a
becoming mark of respect for the dead, as well as a sort of propitiatory
offering to the deities who presided over death and the grave. The Jews
learned this custom in Egypt, and though weaned from it, relapsed in a
later and degenerate age into this old superstition ([Isa
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md); [Jer
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md); [Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005).md).

nor print any marks upon you--by tattooing, imprinting figures of
flowers, leaves, stars, and other fanciful devices on various parts of
their person. The impression was made sometimes by means of a hot iron,
sometimes by ink or paint, as is done by the Arab females of the present
day and the different castes of the Hindus. It is probable that a strong
propensity to adopt such marks in honor of some idol gave occasion to
the prohibition in this verse; and they were wisely forbidden, for they
were signs of apostasy; and, when once made, they were insuperable
obstacles to a return. (See allusions to the practice, [Isa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#005.md); [Rev
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#017.md); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001).md).

[Leviticus 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 19:30</span></span>

Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary--This precept is
frequently repeated along with the prohibition of idolatrous practices,
and here it stands closely connected with the superstitions forbidden in
the previous verses.

[Leviticus 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 19:31</span></span>

Regard not them that have familiar spirits--The Hebrew word, rendered
"familiar spirit," signifies the belly, and sometimes a leathern bottle,
from its similarity to the belly. It was applied in the sense of this
passage to ventriloquists, who pretended to have communication with the
invisible world. The Hebrews were strictly forbidden to consult them as
the vain but high pretensions of those impostors were derogatory to the
honor of God and subversive of their covenant relations with Him as His
people.

neither seek after wizards--fortunetellers, who pretended, as the Hebrew
word indicates, to prognosticate by palmistry (or an inspection of the
lines of the hand) the future fate of those who applied to them.

[Leviticus 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 19:33</span></span>

if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him--The
Israelites were to hold out encouragement to strangers to settle among
them, that they might be brought to the knowledge and worship of the
true God; and with this in view, they were enjoined to treat them not as
aliens, but as friends, on the ground that they themselves, who were
strangers in Egypt, were at first kindly and hospitably received in that
country.

[Leviticus 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">lev 19:37</span></span>

I am the Lord--This solemn admonition, by which these various precepts
are repeatedly sanctioned, is equivalent to "I, your Creator--your
Deliverer from bondage, and your Sovereign, who have wisdom to establish
laws, have power also to punish the violation of them." It was well
fitted to impress the minds of the Israelites with a sense of their duty
and God's claims to obedience.
