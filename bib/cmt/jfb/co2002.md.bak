### [2 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 2:1</span></span>

REASON WHY HE HAD NOT VISITED THEM ON HIS WAY TO MACEDONIA; THE
INCESTUOUS PERSON OUGHT NOW TO BE FORGIVEN; HIS ANXIETY TO HEAR TIDINGS
OF THEIR STATE FROM TITUS, AND HIS JOY WHEN AT LAST THE GOOD NEWS
REACHES HIM. (2Co. 2:1-17)

with myself--in contrast to "you" ([Co2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023).md). The same antithesis between
Paul and them appears in [Co2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002.md).

not come again . . . in heaviness--"sorrow"; implying that he had
already paid them one visit in sorrow since his coming for the first
time to Corinth. At that visit he had warned them "he would not spare if
he should come again" (see on [Co2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002.md); compare [Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001).md). See Introduction to the first
Epistle. The "in heaviness" implies mutual pain; they grieving him, and
he them. Compare [Co2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002.md), "I make you
sorry," and [Co2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md), "If any have
caused grief (sorrow)." In this verse he accounts for having postponed
his visit, following up [Co2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023.md).

[2 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 2:2</span></span>

For--proof that he shrinks from causing them sorrow ("heaviness").

if I--The "I" is emphatic. Some detractor may say that this ([Co2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001).md) is not my reason for not coming
as I proposed; since I showed no scruple in causing "heaviness," or
sorrow, in my Epistle (the first Epistle to the Corinthians). But I
answer, If I be the one to cause you sorrow, it is not that I have any
pleasure in doing so. Nay, my object was that he "who was made sorry by
me" (namely, the Corinthians in general, [Co2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003.md); but with tacit reference to the
incestuous person in particular) should repent, and so "make me glad,"
as has actually taken place; "for . . . who is he then that?" &c.

[2 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 2:3</span></span>

I wrote this same unto you--namely, that I would not come to you then
([Co2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001).md), as, if I were to come
then, it would have to be "in heaviness" (causing sorrow both to him and
them, owing to their impenitent state). He refers to the first Epistle
(compare [Co1 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007.md); compare [Co1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019.md), [Co1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021.md); [Co1
5:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002.md), [Co1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#013).md).

sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice--that is, sorrow from their
impenitence, when he ought, on the contrary, to have joy from their
penitent obedience. The latter happy effect was produced by his first
Epistle, whereas the former would have been the result, had he then
visited them as he had originally proposed.

having confidence . . . that my joy is the joy of you all--trusting that
you, too, would feel that there was sufficient reason for the
postponement, if it interfered with our mutual joy \[ALFORD\]. The
communion of saints, he feels confident in them "ALL" (his charity
overlooking, for the moment the small section of his detractors at
Corinth, [Co1 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007).md), will make his joy
([Co2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002).md) their joy.

[2 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 2:4</span></span>

So far from my change of purpose being due to "lightness" ([Co2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017).md), I wrote my letter to you ([Co2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#003).md) "out of much affliction (Greek,
'trouble') and anguish of heart, and with many tears."

not that ye should be grieved--Translate, "be made sorry," to accord
with the translation, [Co2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002.md). My
ultimate and main object was, "not that ye might be made sorry," but
that through sorrow you might be led to repentance, and so to joy,
redounding both to you and me ([Co2
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#002).md). I made you sorry before going
to you, that when I went it might not be necessary. He is easily made
sorry, who is admonished by a friend himself weeping \[BENGEL\].

that ye might know the love--of which it is a proof to rebuke sins
openly and in season \[ESTIUS\], ([Psa
141:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#005.md); [Pro
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#006).md). "Love" is the source from which
sincere reproof springs; that the Corinthians might ultimately recognize
this as his motive, was the apostle's aim.

which I have more abundantly unto you--who have been particularly
committed to me by God ([Act 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#010.md);
[Co1 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md); [Co1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002).md).

[2 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 2:5</span></span>

grief . . . grieved--Translate as before, "sorrow . . . made sorry." The
"any" is a delicate way of referring to the incestuous person.

not . . . me, but in part--He has grieved me only in part (compare [Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md), that is, I am not the sole
party aggrieved; most of you, also, were aggrieved.

that I may not overcharge--that I may not unduly lay the weight of the
charge on you all, which I should do, if I made myself to be the sole
party aggrieved. ALFORD punctuates, "He hath not made sorry me, but in
part (that I press not too heavily; namely, on him) you all." Thus "you
all" is in contrast to "me"; and "in part" is explained in the
parenthetical clause.

[2 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 2:6</span></span>

Sufficient--without increasing it, which would only drive him to despair
([Co2 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007).md), whereas the object of the
punishment was, "that (his) spirit might be saved" in the last day.

to such a man--a milder designation of the offender than if he had been
named \[MEYER\]. Rather, it expresses estrangement from such a one who
had caused such grief to the Church, and scandal to religion ([Act
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md); [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005).md).

this punishment--His being "delivered to Satan for the destruction of
the flesh"; not only excommunication, but bodily disease (see on [Co1
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004).md).

inflicted of many--rather, "by the majority" (the more part of you). Not
by an individual priest, as in the Church of Rome, nor by the bishops
and clergy alone, but by the whole body of the Church.

[2 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 2:7</span></span>

with overmuch sorrow--Greek, "with HIS overmuch sorrow."

[2 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 2:8</span></span>

confirm your love toward him--by giving effect in act, and showing in
deeds your love; namely, by restoring him to your fellowship and praying
for his recovering from the sickness penally inflicted on him.

[2 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 2:9</span></span>

For--Additional reason why they should restore the offender, namely, as
a "proof" of their obedience "in all things"; now in love, as previously
in punishing ([Co2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006).md), at the
apostle's desire. Besides his other reasons for deferring his visit, he
had the further view, though, perhaps, unperceived by them, of making an
experiment of their fidelity. This accounts for his deferring to give,
in his Epistle, the reason for his change of plan (resolved on before
writing it). This full discovery of his motive comes naturally from him
now, in the second Epistle, after he had seen the success of his
measures, but would not have been a seasonable communication before. All
this accords with reality, and is as remote as possible from imposture
\[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. The interchange of feeling is
marked ([Co2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004).md), "I wrote . . . that
ye might know the love," &c.: here, "I did write, that I might know the
proof of you."

[2 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 2:10</span></span>

Another encouragement to their taking on themselves the responsibility
of restoring the offender. They may be assured of Paul's apostolic
sanction to their doing so.

for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it--The oldest manuscripts
read, "For even what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything."

for your sakes forgave I it--He uses the past tense, as of a thing
already determined on; as in [Co1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003.md),
"I have judged already"; or, as speaking generally of forgiveness
granted, or to be granted. It is for your sakes I have forgiven, and do
forgive, that the Church (of which you are constituent members) may
suffer no hurt by the loss of a soul, and that ye may learn leniency as
well as faithfulness.

in the person of Christ--representing Christ, and acting by His
authority: answering to [Co1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004.md), "In
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . my spirit, with the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ."

[2 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 2:11</span></span>

Literally, "That we may have no advantage gained over us by Satan,"
namely, by letting one of our members be lost to us through despair, we
ourselves furnishing Satan with the weapon, by our repulsive harshness
to one now penitent. The loss of a single sinner is a common loss;
therefore, in [Co2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#010.md), he said, "for
your sakes." Paul had "delivered" the offender "to Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit might be saved" ([Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005).md). Satan sought to destroy the
spirit also: to let him do so, would be to give him an advantage, and
let him overreach us.

not ignorant of his devices--"Ignorant" and "devices" are words akin in
sound and root in Greek: we are not without knowledge of his knowing
schemes.

[2 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 2:12</span></span>

Paul expected to meet Titus at Troas, to receive the tidings as to the
effect of his first Epistle on the Corinthian Church; but, disappointed
in his expectation there, he passed on to Macedonia, where he met him at
last ([Co2 7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)) The history (Acts.md)
does not record his passing through Troas, in going from Ephesus to
Macedonia; but it does in coming from that country ([Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006).md); also, that he had disciples
there ([Act 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007).md), which accords with
the Epistle ([Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md), "a door was
opened unto me of the Lord"). An undesigned coincidence marking
genuineness \[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. Doubtless Paul had
fixed a time with Titus to meet him at Troas; and had desired him, if
detained so as not to be able to be at Troas at that time, to proceed at
once to Macedonia to Philippi, the next station on his own journey.
Hence, though a wide door of Christian usefulness opened to him at
Troas, his eagerness to hear from Titus the tidings from Corinth, led
him not to stay longer there when the time fixed was past, but he
hastened on to Macedonia to meet him there \[BIRKS\].

to preach--literally, "for the Gospel." He had been at Troas before, but
the vision of a man from Macedonia inviting him to come over, prevented
his remaining there ([Act 16:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#008).md). On
his return to Asia, after the longer visit mentioned here, he stayed
seven days ([Act 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006).md).

and--that is, though Paul would, under ordinary circumstances, have
gladly stayed in Troas.

door . . . opened . . . of the Lord--Greek, "in the Lord," that is, in
His work, and by His gracious Providence.

[2 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 2:13</span></span>

no rest in my spirit--rather, "no rest for my spirit" ([Gen
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#009).md). As here his "spirit" had no
rest; so in [Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005.md), his "flesh." His
"spirit" under the Holy Spirit, hence, concluded that it was not
necessary to avail himself of the "door" of usefulness at Troas any
longer.

taking . . . leave of them--the disciples at Troas.

[2 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 2:14</span></span>

Now--Greek, "But." Though we left Troas disappointed in not meeting
Titus there, and in having to leave so soon so wide a door, "thanks be
unto God," we were triumphantly blessed in both the good news of you
from Titus, and in the victories of the Gospel everywhere in our
progress. The cause of triumph cannot be restricted (as ALFORD explains)
to the former; for "always," and "in every place," show that the latter
also is intended.

causeth us to triumph--The Greek, is rather, as in [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md), "triumphs over us": "leadeth us
in triumph." Paul regarded himself as a signal trophy of God's
victorious power in Christ. His Almighty Conqueror was leading him
about, through all the cities of the Greek and Roman world, as an
illustrious example of His power at once to subdue and to save. The foe
of Christ was now the servant of Christ. As to be led in triumph by man
is the most miserable, so to be led in triumph by God is the most
glorious, lot that can befall any \[TRENCH\]. Our only true triumphs are
God's triumphs over us. His defeats of us are our only true victories
\[ALFORD\]. The image is taken from the triumphal procession of a
victorious general. The additional idea is perhaps included, which
distinguishes God's triumph from that of a human general, that the
captive is brought into willing obedience ([Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005).md) to Christ, and so joins in the
triumph: God "leads him in triumph" as one not merely triumphed over,
but also as one triumphing over God's foes with God (which last will
apply to the apostle's triumphant missionary progress under the leading
of God). So BENGEL: "Who shows us in triumph, not \[merely\] as
conquered, but as the ministers of His victory. Not only the victory,
but the open 'showing' of the victory is marked: for there follows, Who
maketh manifest."

savour--retaining the image of a triumph. As the approach of the
triumphal procession was made known by the odor of incense scattered far
and wide by the incense-bearers in the train, so God "makes manifest by
us" (His now at once triumphed over and triumphing captives, compare
[Luk 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md), "Catch," literally, "Take
captive so as to preserve alive") the sweet savor of the knowledge of
Christ, the triumphant Conqueror ([Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015).md), everywhere. As the triumph
strikes the eyes, so the savor the nostrils; thus every sense feels the
power of Christ's Gospel. This manifestation (a word often recurring in
his Epistles to the Corinthians, compare [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005).md) refutes the Corinthian suspicions
of his dishonestly, by reserve, hiding anything from them ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002).md).

[2 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 2:15</span></span>

The order is in Greek, "For (it is) of Christ (that) we are a sweet
savor unto God"; thus, the "for" justifies his previous words ([Co2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014)), "the savor of HIS (Christ's.md)
knowledge." We not only scatter the savor; but "we are the sweet savor"
itself ([Sol 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md); compare [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), [Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002.md); [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).md).

in them that are saved--rather, "that are being saved . . . that are
perishing" (see on [Co1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018).md). As the
light, though it blinds in darkness the weak, is for all that still
light; and honey, though it taste bitter to the sick, is in itself still
sweet; so the Gospel is still of a sweet savor, though many perish
through unbelief \[CHRYSOSTOM, Homilies, 5.467\], ([Co2
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003.md), [Co2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006).md). As some of the conquered foes
led in triumph were put to death when the procession reached the
capitol, and to them the smell of the incense was the "savor of death
unto death," while to those saved alive, it was the "savor of life," so
the Gospel was to the different classes respectively.

and in them--in the case of them. "Those being saved" (2Co. 3:1-4:2):
"Those that are perishing" ([Co2
4:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003).md).

[2 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 2:16</span></span>

savour of death unto death . . . of life unto life--an odor arising out
of death (a mere announcement of a dead Christ, and a virtually lifeless
Gospel, in which light unbelievers regard the Gospel message), ending
(as the just and natural consequence) in death (to the unbeliever); (but
to the believer) an odor arising out of life (that is, the announcement
of a risen and living Saviour), ending in life (to the believer) ([Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md); [Luk
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034.md); [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039).md).

who is sufficient for these things?--namely, for diffusing aright
everywhere the savor of Christ, so diverse in its effects on believers
and unbelievers. He here prepares the way for one purpose of his
Epistle, namely, to vindicate his apostolic mission from its detractors
at Corinth, who denied his sufficiency. The Greek order puts prominently
foremost the momentous and difficult task assigned to him, "For these
things, who is sufficient?" He answers his own question ([Co2
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005).md), "Not that we are sufficient of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, who hath made us able (Greek,
'sufficient') ministers," &c.

[2 Corinthians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 2:17</span></span>

not as many-- ([Co2 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#018.md); [Phi
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#021).md). Rather, "the many," namely, the
false teachers of whom he treats (tenth through twelfth chapters,
especially [Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013.md); [Th1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003).md).

which corrupt--Greek, "adulterating, as hucksters do wine for gain"
([Co2 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Isa
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022.md); [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003), "Make merchandise of you".md).

as of sincerity . . . as of God--as one speaking from (out of)
sincerity, as from (that is, by the command of, and so in dependence on)
God.

in Christ's--as united to Him in living membership, and doing His work
(compare [Co2 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#019).md). The whole Gospel
must be delivered such as it is, without concession to men's
corruptions, and without selfish aims, if it is to be blessed with
success ([Act 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027).md).
