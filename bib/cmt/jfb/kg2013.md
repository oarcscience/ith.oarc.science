[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001.md)

JEHOAHAZ'S WICKED REIGN OVER ISRAEL. ([Kg2
13:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#001).md)

Jehoahaz . . . reigned seventeen years--Under his government, which
pursued the policy of his predecessors regarding the support of the
calf-worship, Israel's apostasy from the true God became greater and
more confirmed than in the time of his father Jehu. The national
chastisement, when it came, was consequently the more severe and the
instruments employed by the Lord in scourging the revolted nation were
Hazael and his son and general Ben-hadad, in resisting whose successive
invasions the Israelitish army was sadly reduced and weakened. In the
extremity of his distress, Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and was heard,
not on his own account ([Psa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md);
[Pro 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md); [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008).md), but that of the ancient
covenant with the patriarchs ([Kg2
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg2 13:4</span></span>

he saw the oppression of Israel--that is, commiserated the fallen
condition of His chosen people. The divine honor and the interests of
true religion required that deliverance should be granted them to check
the triumph of the idolatrous enemy and put an end to their blasphemous
taunts that God had forsaken Israel ([Deu
32:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#027.md); [Psa
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 13:5</span></span>

a saviour--This refers neither to some patriotic defender nor some
signal victory, but to the deliverance obtained for Israel by the two
successors of Jehoahaz, namely, Joash, who regained all the cities which
the Syrians had taken from his father ([Kg2
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#025).md); and Jeroboam, who restored the
former boundaries of Israel ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 13:6</span></span>

there remained the grove--Asherah--the idol set up by Ahab ([Kg1
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#033).md), which ought to have been
demolished ([Deu 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#005).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 13:7</span></span>

made them like the dust in threshing--Threshing in the East is performed
in the open air upon a level plot of ground, daubed over with a covering
to prevent, as much as possible, the earth, sand, or gravel from rising;
a great quantity of them all, notwithstanding this precaution, must
unavoidably be taken up with the grain; at the same time the straw is
shattered to pieces. Hence it is a most significant figure, frequently
employed by Orientals to describe a state of national suffering, little
short of extermination ([Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md);
[Mic 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md); [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033).md). The figure originated in a
barbarous war custom, which Hazael literally followed ([Amo
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#003.md); compare [Sa2
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#031.md); [Jdg
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#007).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 13:8</span></span>

JOASH SUCCEEDS HIM. (2Ki. 13:8-25)

his might--This is particularly noticed in order to show that the
grievous oppression from foreign enemies, by which the Israelites were
ground down, was not owing to the cowardice or imbecility of their king,
but solely to the righteous and terrible judgment of God for their foul
apostasy.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 13:12</span></span>

his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah--(See on [Kg2
14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008).md). The usual summary of his
life and reign occurs rather early, and is again repeated in the account
given of the reign of the king of Judah ([Kg2
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#015).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">kg2 13:14</span></span>

Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died--Every man's
death is occasioned by some disease, and so was Elisha's. But in
intimating it, there seems a contrast tacitly made between him and his
prophetic predecessor, who did not die.

Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face--He
visited him where he was lying ill of this mortal sickness, and
expressed deep sorrow, not from the personal respect he bore for the
prophet, but for the incalculable loss his death would occasion to the
kingdom.

my father, my father! &c.--(See on [Kg2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012).md). These words seem to have been a
complimentary phrase applied to one who was thought an eminent guardian
and deliverer of his country. The particular application of them to
Elisha, who, by his counsels and prayer, had obtained many glorious
victories for Israel, shows that the king possessed some measure of
faith and trust, which, though weak, was accepted, and called forth the
prophet's dying benediction.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">kg2 13:15</span></span>

Take bow and arrows--Hostilities were usually proclaimed by a herald,
sometimes by a king or general making a public and formal discharge of
an arrow into the enemy's country. Elisha directed Joash to do this, as
a symbolical act, designed to intimate more fully and significantly the
victories promised to the king of Israel over the Syrians. His laying
his hands upon the king's hands was to represent the power imparted to
the bow shot as coming from the Lord through the medium of the prophet.
His shooting the first arrow eastward--to that part of his kingdom which
the Syrians had taken and which was east of Samaria--was a declaration
of war against them for the invasion. His shooting the other arrows into
the ground was in token of the number of victories he was taken to gain;
but his stopping at the third betrayed the weakness of his faith; for,
as the discharged arrow signified a victory over the Syrians, it is
evident that the more arrows he shot the more victories he would gain.
As he stopped so soon, his conquests would be incomplete.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">kg2 13:20</span></span>

Elisha died--He had enjoyed a happier life than Elijah, as he possessed
a milder character, and bore a less hard commission. His rough garment
was honored even at the court.

coming in of the year--that is, the spring, the usual season of
beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab
generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The
bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands,
hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's
sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the mouth
of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his body, as
well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not laid in a
coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought into
contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's and
people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of
Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian
forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction ([Kg2
13:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022).md), in the defeat of the enemy,
in the recovery of the cities that had been taken, and their restoration
to the kingdom of Israel.
