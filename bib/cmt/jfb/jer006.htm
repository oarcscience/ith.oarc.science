<p>
<p>Benjamin--Jerusalem was situated in the tribe of Benjamin, which was here separated from that of Judah by the valley of Hinnom. Though it was inhabited partly by Benjamites, partly by men of Judah, he addresses the former as being his own countrymen. 
<p>
<p>blow . . . trumpet . . . Tekoa--Tikehu, Tekoa form a play on sounds. The birthplace of Amos. 
<p>
<p>Beth-haccerem--meaning in Hebrew, "vineyard-house." It and Tekoa were a few miles south of Jerusalem. As the enemy came from the north, the inhabitants of the surrounding country would naturally flee southwards. The fire-signal on the hills gave warning of danger approaching.

<p>
<p>Prepare--literally, "Sanctify" war, that is, Proclaim it formally with solemn rites; the invasion was solemnly ordered by God (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003">Isa 13:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>at noon--the hottest part of the day when attacks were rarely made (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008">Jer 15:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016">Jer 20:16</A>). Even at this time they wished to attack, such is their eagerness. 
<p>
<p>Woe unto us--The words of the invaders, mourning the approach of night which would suspend their hostile operations; still, even in spite of the darkness, at night they renew the attack (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005">Jer 6:5</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 6:6</A></FONT></span></p>cast--Hebrew, "pour out"; referring to the emptying of the baskets of earth to make the mound, formed of "trees" and earthwork, to overtop the city walls. The "trees" were also used to make warlike engines. 
<p>
<p>this--pointing the invaders to Jerusalem. 
<p>
<p>visited--that is, punished. 
<p>
<p>wholly oppression--or join "wholly" with "visited," that is, she is altogether (in her whole extent) to be punished [MAURER].

<p>
<p>depart--Hebrew, "be torn away"; Jehovah's affection making Him unwilling to depart; His attachment to Jerusalem was such that an effort was needed to tear Himself from it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018">Eze 23:18</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012">Hos 9:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008">Hos 11:8</A>).

<p>
<p>I will pour--or else imperative: the command of God (see <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012">Jer 6:12</A>), "Pour it out" [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>aged . . . full of days--The former means one becoming old; the latter a decrepit old man [MAURER] (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026">Job 5:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020">Isa 65:20</A>).

<p>slightly--as if it were but a slight wound; or, in a slight manner, pronouncing all sound where there is no soundness. 
<p>
<p>saying--namely, the prophets and priests (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013">Jer 6:13</A>). Whereas they ought to warn the people of impending judgments and the need of repentance, they say there is nothing to fear. 
<p>

All is sound in the nation's moral state, so all will be peace as to its political state (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010">Jer 4:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011">Jer 8:11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013">Jer 14:13</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017">Jer 23:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005">Eze 13:5</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010">Eze 13:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028">Eze 22:28</A>).

<p>
<p>old paths--Idolatry and apostasy are the modern way; the worship of God the old way. Evil is not coeval with good, but a modern degeneracy from good. The forsaking of God is not, in a true sense, a "way cast up" at all (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015">Jer 18:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024">Psa 139:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004">Mal 4:4</A>).

<p>
<p>what is among them--what deeds are committed by the Israelites (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016">Jer 6:16-17</A>) [MAURER]. Or, "what punishments are about to be inflicted on them" [CALVIN].

By a metaphor from metallurgy in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027">Jer 6:27-30</A>, Jehovah, in conclusion, confirms the prophet in his office, and the latter sums up the description of the reprobate people on whom he had to work. The Hebrew for "assayer" (English Version, "tower") is from a root "to try" metals. "Explorer" (English Version, "fortress") is from an Arabic root, "keen-sighted"; or a Hebrew root, "cutting," that is, separating the metal from the dross [EWALD]. GESENIUS translates as English Version, "fortress," which does not accord with the previous "assayer."

<p>lead--employed to separate the baser metal from the silver, as quicksilver is now used. In other words, the utmost pains have been used to purify Israel in the furnace of affliction, but in vain (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003">Jer 5:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007">Pe1 1:7</A>). 
<p>
<p>consumed of the fire--In the Chetib, or Hebrew text, the "consumed" is supplied out of the previous "burned." Translating as ROSENMULLER, "pant," this will be inadmissible; and the Keri (Hebrew Margin) division of the Hebrew words will have to be read, to get "is consumed of the fire." This is an argument for the translation, "are burned." 
<p>
<p>founder--the refiner. 
<p>
<p>wicked . . . not plucked away--answering to the dross which has no good metal to be separated, the mass being all dross.

<p>The prophet stood at the gate of the temple in order that the multitudes from the country might hear him. His life was threatened, it appears from <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001">Jer 26:1-9</A>, for this prophecy, denouncing the fate of Shiloh as about to befall the temple at Jerusalem. The prophecy given in detail here is summarily referred to there. After Josiah's death the nation relapsed into idolatry through Jehoiakim's bad influence; the worship of Jehovah was, however, combined with it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004">Jer 7:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010">Jer 7:10</A>).
