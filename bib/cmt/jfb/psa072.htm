<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_001">psa 72:1</A></FONT></span></p>For, or literally, "of Solomon." The closing verse rather relates to the second book of Psalms, of which this is the last, and was perhaps added by some collector, to intimate that the collection, to which, as chief author, David's name was appended, was closed. In this view, these may consistently be the productions of others included, as of Asaph, sons of Korah, and Solomon; and a few of David's may be placed in the latter series. The fact that here the usual mode of denoting authorship is used, is strongly conclusive that Solomon was the author, especially as no stronger objection appears than what has been now set aside. The Psalm, in highly wrought figurative style, describes the reign of a king as "righteous, universal, beneficent, and perpetual." By the older Jewish and most modern Christian interpreters, it has been referred to Christ, whose reign, present and prospective, alone corresponds with its statements. As the imagery of the second Psalm was drawn from the martial character of David's reign, that of this is from the peaceful and prosperous state of Solomon's. (Psa. 72:1-19)
<p>
<p>Give the king, &amp;c.--a prayer which is equivalent to a prediction. 
<p>
<p>judgments--the acts, and (figuratively) the principles of a right government (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022">Joh 5:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039">Joh 9:39</A>). 
<p>
<p>righteousness--qualifications for conducting such a government. 
<p>
<p>king's son--same person as a king--a very proper title for Christ, as such in both natures.

<p>
<p>children of the needy--for the needy (compare sons of strangers, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#045">Psa 18:45</A> [Margin]).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">psa 72:8</A></FONT></span></p>The foreign nations mentioned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009">Psa 72:9-10</A>) could not be included in the limits, if designed to indicate the boundaries of Solomon's kingdom. The terms, though derived from those used (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031">Exo 23:31</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024">Deu 11:24</A>) to denote the possessions of Israel, must have a wider sense. Thus, "ends of the earth" is never used of Palestine, but always of the world (compare Margin).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">psa 72:12</A></FONT></span></p>They are not the conquests of arms, but the influences of humane and peaceful principles (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007">Isa 9:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1-9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009">Zac 9:9-10</A>).

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#016">Psalms 72:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">psa 72:16</A></FONT></span></p>The spiritual blessings, as often in Scripture, are set forth by material, the abundance of which is described by a figure, in which a "handful" (or literally, "a piece," or small portion) of corn in the most unpropitious locality, shall produce a crop, waving in the wind in its luxuriant growth, like the forests of Lebanon. 
<p>
<p>they of the city . . . earth--This clause denotes the rapid and abundant increase of population-- 
<p>
<p>of--or, "from" 
<p>
<p>the city--Jerusalem, the center and seat of the typical kingdom. 
<p>
<p>flourish--or, glitter as new grass--that is, bloom. This increase corresponds with the increased productiveness. So, as the gospel blessings are diffused, there shall arise increasing recipients of them, out of the Church in which Christ resides as head.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017">Psalms 72:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">psa 72:17</A></FONT></span></p>His name--or, "glorious perfections." 
<p>
<p>as long as the sun--(Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005">Psa 72:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>men shall be blessed-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003">Gen 12:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#018">Gen 18:18</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">psa 72:18</A></FONT></span></p>These words close the Psalm in terms consistent with the style of the context, while <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020">Psa 72:20</A> is evidently, from its prosaic style, an addition for the purpose above explained [see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001">Psa 72:1</A>].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#020">Psalms 72:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">psa 72:20</A></FONT></span></p>ended--literally, "finished," or completed; the word never denotes fulfilment, except in a very late usage, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#001">Ezr 1:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007">Dan 12:7</A>.
