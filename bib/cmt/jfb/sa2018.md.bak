### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 18:1</span></span>

DAVID REVIEWING THE ARMIES. ([Sa2
18:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#001).md)

David numbered the people that were with him--The hardy mountaineers of
Gilead came in great numbers at the call of their chieftains, so that,
although without money to pay any troops, David soon found himself at
the head of a considerable army. A pitched battle was now inevitable.
But so much depending on the life of the king, he was not allowed to
take the field in person; and he therefore divided his forces into three
detachments under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the commander of the foreign
guards.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa2 18:5</span></span>

GIVES THEM CHARGE OF ABSALOM. ([Sa2
18:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005).md)

Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom--This
affecting charge, which the king gave to his generals, proceeded not
only from his overwhelming affection for his children, but from his
consciousness that this rebellion was the chastisement of his own
crimes, Absalom being merely an instrument in the hand of retributive
Providence;--and also from his piety, lest the unhappy prince should die
with his sins unrepented of.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 18:6</span></span>

wood of Ephraim--This wood, of course, was on the east of Jordan. Its
name was derived, according to some, from the slaughter of the
Ephraimites by Jephthah--according to others, from the connection of
blood with the trans-jordanic Manasseh.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa2 18:7</span></span>

the people of Israel were slain--This designation, together with the
immense slaughter mentioned later, shows the large extent to which the
people were enlisted in this unhappy civil contest.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa2 18:8</span></span>

the wood devoured more people than the sword--The thick forest of oaks
and terebinths, by obstructing the flight, greatly aided the victors in
the pursuit.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 18:9</span></span>

Absalom met the servants of David--or was overtaken. "It is necessary to
be continually on one's guard against the branches of trees; and when
the hair is worn in large locks floating down the back, as was the case
with a young man of the party to which I belonged, any thick boughs
interposing in the path might easily dislodge a rider from his seat, and
catch hold of his flowing hair" \[HARTLEY\]. Some, however, think that
the sacred historian points not so much to the hair, as to the head of
Absalom, which, being caught while running between two branches, was
enclosed so firmly that he could not disengage himself from the hold,
nor make use of his hands.

the mule that was under him went away--The Orientals, not having saddles
as we do, do not sit so firmly on the beasts they ride. Absalom quitting
his hold of the bridle, apparently to release himself when caught in the
oak, the mule escaped.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 18:11</span></span>

Joab said unto the man that told him, . . . I would have given thee ten
shekels of silver, and a girdle--that is, would have raised him from the
ranks to the status of a commissioned officer. Besides a sum of money, a
girdle, curiously and richly wrought, was among the ancient Hebrews a
mark of honor, and sometimes bestowed as a reward of military merit.
This soldier, however, who may be taken as a fair sample of David's
faithful subjects, had so great a respect for the king's wishes, that no
prospect of reward would have tempted him to lay violent hands on
Absalom. But Joab's stern sense of public duty, which satisfied him that
there could be neither safety to the king, nor peace to the kingdom, nor
security to him and other loyal subjects, so long as that turbulent
prince lived, overcame his sensibilities, and looking upon the charge
given to the generals as more befitting a parent than a prince, he
ventured to disobey it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 18:14</span></span>

HE IS SLAIN BY JOAB. (2Sa. 18:14-32)

he took three darts . . . and thrust them through the heart of
Absalom--The deed, partially done by Joab, was completed by his
bodyguard. Being a violation of the expressed wish, as well as of all
the fond paternal feelings of David, it must have been deeply offensive
to the king, nor was it ever forgotten ([Kg1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005).md); and yet there is the strongest
reason for believing that Joab, in doing it, was actuated by a sincere
regard to the interests of David, both as a man and a monarch.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sa2 18:16</span></span>

Joab blew the trumpet, . . . and held back the people--Knowing that by
the death of the usurper there was no occasion for further bloodshed, he
put an end to the pursuit and thereby evinced the temperate policy of
his conduct. However harsh and unfeeling to the king Joab may appear,
there can be no doubt that he acted the part of a wise statesman in
regarding the peace and welfare of the kingdom more than his master's
private inclinations, which were opposed to strict justice as well as
his own interests. Absalom deserved to die by the divine law ([Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018.md), [Deu
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#021).md), as well as being an enemy to
his king and country; and no time was more fitting than when he met that
death in open battle.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 18:17</span></span>

they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit . . . and laid a very
great heap of stones upon him--The people of the East indicate their
detestation of the memory of an infamous person by throwing stones at
the place where he is buried. The heap is increased by the gradual
accumulation of stones which passers-by add to it.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 18:18</span></span>

Absalom in his lifetime had reared up for himself a pillar--literally,
"hand." In the valley of Jehoshaphat, on the east of Jerusalem, is a
tomb or cenotaph, said to be this "pillar" or monument: it is
twenty-four feet square, dome-topped, and reaches forty feet in height.
This may occupy the spot, but cannot itself be the work of Absalom, as
it evidently bears the style of a later architecture.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 18:19</span></span>

Then said Ahimaaz . . . Let me . . . run and bear the king tidings--The
reasons why Joab declined to accept Ahimaaz' offer to bear intelligence
of the victory to David, and afterwards let him go along with another,
are variously stated by commentators--but they are of no importance. Yet
the alacrity of the messengers, as well as the eager excitement of the
expectants, is graphically described.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa2 18:23</span></span>

by the way of the plain--or ciccar, "circle." This word is only used
elsewhere in connection with the valley of the Jordan. It is possible
that there may have been a place or region so called on the tablelands
of Gilead, as the Septuagint seems to indicate. Or Mahanaim may have
been so situated, with the regard to the battlefield, as to be more
easily accessible by a descent to the plain of the Jordan, than over the
hills themselves. Or the word may signify (as EWALD explains) a manner
of quick running \[STANLEY\].

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">sa2 18:24</span></span>

David sat between the two gates--that is, in the tower-house on the wall
that overhung the gate of Mahanaim. Near it was a watchtower, on which a
sentinel was posted, as in times of war, to notify every occurrence. The
delicacy of Ahimaaz' communication was made up by the unmistakable
plainness of Cushi's. The death of Absalom was a heavy trial, and it is
impossible not to sympathize with the outburst of feeling by which David
showed that all thoughts of the victory he had won as a king were
completely sunk in the painful loss he had sustained as a father. The
extraordinary ardor and strength of his affection for this worthless son
break out in the redundancy and vehemence of his mournful ejaculations.
