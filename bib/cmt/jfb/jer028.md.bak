### [Jeremiah Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 28:1</span></span>

PROPHECIES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THOSE IN THE TWENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER.
HANANIAH BREAKS THE YOKES TO SIGNIFY THAT NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S YOKE SHALL BE
BROKEN. JEREMIAH FORETELLS THAT YOKES OF IRON ARE TO SUCCEED THOSE OF
WOOD, AND THAT HANANIAH SHALL DIE. (Jer. 28:1-17)

in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah--The Jews often divided any
period into two halves, the beginning and the end. As Zedekiah reigned
eleven years, the fourth year would be called the beginning of his
reign, especially as during the first three years affairs were in such a
disturbed state that he had little power or dignity, being a tributary;
but in the fourth year he became strong in power.

Hananiah--Another of this name was one of the three godly youths who
braved Nebuchadnezzar's wrath in the fear of God ([Dan
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#006.md); [Dan
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012).md). Probably a near relation, for
Azariah is associated with him; as Azur with the Hananiah here. The
godly and ungodly are often in the same family ([Eze
18:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014).md).

Gibeon--one of the cities of the priests, to which order he must have
belonged.

[Jeremiah 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 28:2</span></span>

broken the yoke--I have determined to break: referring to Jeremiah's
prophecy ([Jer 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 28:3</span></span>

two full years--literally, "years of days." So "a month of days," that
is, all its days complete ([Gen 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014.md),
Margin; [Gen 41:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#001).md). It was marvellous
presumption to speak so definitely without having any divine revelation.

[Jeremiah 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 28:4</span></span>

bring again . . . Jeconiah--not necessarily implying that Hananiah
wished Zedekiah to be superseded by Jeconiah. The main point intended
was that the restoration from Babylon should be complete. But,
doubtless, the false prophet foretold Jeconiah's return ([Kg2
24:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012).md), to ingratiate himself with
the populace, with whom Jeconiah was a favorite (see on [Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 28:5</span></span>

the prophet Jeremiah--the epithet, "the prophet," is prefixed to
"Jeremiah" throughout this chapter, to correspond to the same epithet
before "Hananiah"; except in [Jer
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012.md), where "the prophet" has been
inserted in English Version. The rival claims of the true and the false
prophet are thus put in the more prominent contrast.

[Jeremiah 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 28:6</span></span>

Amen--Jeremiah prays for the people, though constrained to prophesy
against them ([Kg1 1:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#036).md). The event
was the appointed test between contradictory predictions ([Deu
18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#021).md). "Would that what you say
were true!" I prefer the safety of my country even to my own estimation.
The prophets had no pleasure in announcing God's judgment, but did so as
a matter of stern duty, not thereby divesting themselves of their
natural feelings of sorrow for their country's woe. Compare [Exo
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md); [Rom
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003.md), as instances of how God's
servants, intent only on the glory of God and the salvation of the
country, forgot self and uttered wishes in a state of feeling
transported out of themselves. So Jeremiah wished not to diminish aught
from the word of God, though as a Jew he uttered the wish for his people
\[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 28:8</span></span>

prophets . . . before me--Hosea, Joel, Amos, and others.

evil--a few manuscripts, read "famine," which is more usually associated
with the specification of war and pestilence ([Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002.md); [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md); [Jer
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md), [Jer
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013).md). But evil here includes all the
calamities flowing from war, not merely famine, but also desolation, &c.
Evil, being the more difficult reading, is less likely to be the
interpolated one than famine, which probably originated in copying the
parallel passages.

[Jeremiah 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 28:9</span></span>

peace--Hananiah had given no warning as to the need of conversion, but
had foretold prosperity unconditionally. Jeremiah does not say that all
are true prophets who foretell truths in any instance (which [Deu
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001), disproves.md); but asserts only
the converse, namely, that whoever, as Hananiah, predicts what the event
does not confirm, is a false prophet. There are two tests of prophets:
(1) The event, [Deu 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#022). (2.md) The
word of God, [Isa 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md).

[Jeremiah 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 28:10</span></span>

the yoke-- ([Jer 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002).md). Impious
audacity to break what God had appointed as a solemn pledge of the
fulfilment of His word. Hence Jeremiah deigns no reply ([Jer
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011.md); [Mat
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 28:11</span></span>

neck of all nations--opposed to [Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md).

[Jeremiah 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 28:13</span></span>

Thou hast broken . . . wood . . . thou shalt make . . . iron--Not here,
"Thou hast broken . . . wood," and "I will make . . . iron" (compare
[Jer 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016).md). The same false prophets
who, by urging the Jews to rebel, had caused them to throw off the then
comparatively easy yoke of Babylon, thereby brought on them a more
severe yoke imposed by that city. "Yokes of iron," alluding to [Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048.md). It is better to take up a light
cross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. We may escape
destroying providences by submitting to humbling providences. So,
spiritually, contrast the "easy yoke" of Christ with the "yoke of
bondage" of the law ([Act 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 28:14</span></span>

I have put--Though Hananiah and those like him were secondary
instruments in bringing the iron yoke on Judea, God was the great First
Cause ([Jer 27:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 28:15</span></span>

makest . . . trust in a lie-- ([Jer
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031.md); [Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 28:16</span></span>

this year . . . die--The prediction was uttered in the fifth month ([Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001).md); Hananiah's death took place in
the seventh month, that is, within two months after the prediction,
answering with awful significance to the two years in which Hananiah had
foretold that the yoke imposed by Babylon would end.

rebellion--opposition to God's plain direction, that all should submit
to Babylon ([Jer 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032).md).
