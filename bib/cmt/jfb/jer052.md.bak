### [Jeremiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 52:3</span></span>

WRITTEN BY SOME OTHER THAN JEREMIAH (PROBABLY EZRA) AS AN HISTORICAL
SUPPLEMENT TO THE PREVIOUS PROPHECIES (Jer. 52:1-34)

through . . . anger of . . . Lord . . . Zedekiah rebelled--His "anger"
against Jerusalem, determining Him to "cast out" His people "from His
presence" heretofore manifested there, led Him to permit Zedekiah to
rebel ([Kg2 23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#026.md); compare [Exo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#012.md); [Exo
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#001.md); [Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018).md). That rebellion, being in
violation of his oath "by God," was sure to bring down God's vengeance
([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013.md); [Eze
17:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015.md), [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 52:4</span></span>

forts--rather, towers of wood \[KIMCHI\], for watching the movements of
the besieged from the height and annoying them with missiles.

[Jeremiah 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 52:7</span></span>

(See on [Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 52:9</span></span>

gave judgment upon him--as guilty of rebellion and perjury ([Jer
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#003.md); compare [Eze
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 52:11</span></span>

[Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013.md) : "I will bring him to
Babylon . . . yet shall he not see it."

prison--literally, "the house of visitations," or "punishments," that
is, where there was penal work enforced on the prisoners, such as
grinding. Hence the Septuagint renders it "the house of the mill." So
Samson, after his eyes were put out, "ground" in the Philistine
prison-house ([Jdg 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 52:12</span></span>

tenth day--But in [Kg2 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md), it is
said "the seventh day." Nebuzara-dan started from Riblah on the
"seventh" day and arrived in Jerusalem on the "tenth" day. Seeming
discrepancies, when cleared up, confirm the genuineness of Scripture;
for they show there was no collusion between the writers; as in all
God's works there is latent harmony under outward varieties.

[Jeremiah 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 52:13</span></span>

all the houses . . . and all the houses of the great--the "and" defines
what houses especially are meant, namely, the houses of the great men.

[Jeremiah 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 52:15</span></span>

poor of . . . people--added to the account in [Kg2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011.md). "The poor of the people" are of
the city, as distinguished from "the poor of the land," that is, of the
country.

[Jeremiah 52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 52:17</span></span>

brake--that they might be more portable. Fulfilling the prophecy ([Jer
27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019).md). See [Kg1
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#015.md), [Kg1
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023.md), [Kg1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md), [Kg1
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#050.md). Nothing is so particularly
related here as the carrying away of the articles in the temple. The
remembrance of their beauty and preciousness heightens the bitterness of
their loss and the evil of sin which caused it.

brass . . . brazen--rather "copper . . . of copper."

[Jeremiah 52:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 52:18</span></span>

([Exo 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 52:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 52:19</span></span>

of gold in gold--implying that the articles were of solid gold and
silver respectively, not of a different metal inside, or alloyed
\[GROTIUS\]. Whole: not breaking them as was done to the "brass" ([Jer
52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 52:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 52:20</span></span>

bulls . . . under the bases--But the bulls were not "under the bases,"
but under the sea ([Kg1 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#025.md), [Kg1
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027.md), [Kg1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038).md); the ten bases were not under
the sea, but under the ten lavers. In English Version, "bases,"
therefore, must mean the lower parts of the sea under which the bulls
were. Rather, translate, "the bulls were in the place of (that is, 'by
way of'; so the Hebrew, [Sa1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#009).md),
bases," or supports to the sea \[BUXTORF\]. So the Septuagint. [Kg2
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#016.md) omits the "bulls," and has "and
the bases"; so GROTIUS here reads "the bulls (which were) under (the
sea) and the bases."

[Jeremiah 52:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 52:21</span></span>

eighteen cubits--but in [Ch2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015.md), it
is "thirty-five cubits." The discrepancy is thus removed. Each pillar
was eighteen common cubits. The two together, deducting the base, were
thirty-five, as stated in [Ch2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#015.md)
\[GROTIUS\]. Other ways (for example, by reference to the difference
between the common and the sacred cubit) are proposed: though we are not
able positively to decide now which is the true way, at least those
proposed do show that the discrepancies are not irreconcilable.

[Jeremiah 52:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 52:22</span></span>

five cubits--so [Kg1 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016.md). But [Kg2
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017.md) has "three cubits." There were
two parts in the chapiter: the one lower and plain, of two cubits; the
other, higher and curiously carved, of three cubits. The former is
omitted in [Kg2 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#017.md), as belonging to
the shaft of the pillar; the latter alone is there mentioned. Here the
whole chapiter of five cubits is referred to.

[Jeremiah 52:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 52:23</span></span>

on a side--literally, (on the side) towards the air or wind, that is,
the outside of the capitals of the pillars conspicuous to the eye,
opposed to the four remaining pomegranates which were not seen from the
outside. The pomegranates here are ninety-six; but in [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020.md) they are two hundred on each
chapiter, and four hundred on the two ([Ch2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#013).md). It seems there were two rows of
them, one above the other, and in each row a hundred. They are here said
to be ninety-six, but immediately following one hundred, and so in [Kg1
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020.md). Four seem to have been unseen to
one looking from one point; and the ninety-six are only those that could
be seen \[VATABLUS\]; or, the four omitted here are those separating the
four sides, one pomegranate at each point of separation (or at the four
corners) between the four sides \[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 52:24</span></span>

Seraiah--different from the Seraiah ([Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059).md), son of Neriah; probably son of
Azariah ([Ch1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014).md).

Zephaniah--son of Maaseiah (see on [Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md); [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 52:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 52:25</span></span>

seven men--but in [Kg2 25:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019.md) it is
"five." Perhaps two were less illustrious persons and are therefore
omitted.

principal scribe of the host-- ([Isa
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018).md). His office was to preside over
the levy and enroll recruits. RAWLINSON observes that the Assyrian
records are free from the exaggerated expressions found in the Egyptian.
A minute account was taken of the spoil. Two "scribes of the host" are
seen in every bas-relief, writing down the various objects brought to
them: the heads of the slain, the prisoners, cattle, sheep, &c.

[Jeremiah 52:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 52:28</span></span>

seventh year--in [Kg2 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md), [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md), [Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016.md), it is said "the eighth year" of
Nebuchadnezzar. No doubt it was in part about the end of the seventh
year, in part about the beginning of the eighth. Also in 2Ki. 24:1-20,
ten thousand ([Jer 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#014).md), and seven
thousand men of might, and a thousand craftsmen ([Jer
52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016).md), are said to have been carried
away, But here three thousand twenty-three. Probably the latter three
thousand twenty-three were of the tribe of Judah, the remaining seven
thousand out of the ten thousand were of the other tribes, out of which
many Israelites still had been left in the land. The a thousand
"craftsmen" were exclusive of the ten thousand, as appears, by comparing
[Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md) with [Jer
52:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#016.md). Probably the three thousand
twenty-three of Judah were first removed in the end of "the seventh
year"; the seven thousand and a thousand craftsmen in the "eighth year."
This was at the first captivity under Jehoiachin.

[Jeremiah 52:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 52:29</span></span>

eighteenth year--when Jerusalem was taken. But in [Jer
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md), and [Kg2
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#008.md), "the nineteenth year." Probably
it was at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
\[LYRA\].

eight hundred and thirty and two--The most illustrious persons are
meant, who no doubt were carried away first, at the end of the
eighteenth year.

[Jeremiah 52:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 52:30</span></span>

Not recorded in Kings or Chronicles. Probably it took place during the
commotions that followed the death of Gedaliah ([Jer
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#018.md); [Kg2
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#026).md).

four thousand and six hundred--The exact sum-total of the numbers
specified here, namely, three thousand twenty-three, eight hundred
thirty-two, seven hundred forty-five, not including the general
multitude and the women and children ([Jer
52:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#015.md); [Jer
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md); [Kg2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 52:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 52:31</span></span>

([Kg2 25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027).md).

five and twentieth day--but in [Kg2
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027.md), it is "the twenty-seventh day."
Probably on the twenty-fifth the decree for his elevation was given, and
the preparations for it made by releasing him from prison; and on the
twenty-seventh day it was carried into effect.

Evil-merodach--son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar \[LYRA\]; and the
Hebrew writers say that during Nebuchadnezzar's exclusion from men among
beasts, Evil-merodach administered the government. When Nebuchadnezzar
at the end of seven years was restored, hearing of his son's misconduct
and that he had exulted in his father's calamity, he threw him into
prison, where the latter met Jeconiah and contracted a friendship with
him, whence arose the favor which subsequently he showed him. God, in
his elevation, rewarded his having surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar
(compare [Jer 38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017.md) with [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012).md).

lifted up . . . head--(Compare [Gen
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#013.md), [Gen
40:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#020.md); [Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003.md); [Psa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 52:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 52:32</span></span>

set his throne above--a mark of respect.

the kings--The Hebrew text reads (the other) kings." "The kings" is a
Masoretic correction.

[Jeremiah 52:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 52:33</span></span>

changed . . . garments--gave him garments suitable to a king.

did . . . eat bread before him-- ([Sa2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2009.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 52:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 52:34</span></span>

every day a portion--rather, "its portion," (compare [Kg1
8:59](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#059), Margin.md).
