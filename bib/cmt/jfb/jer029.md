### [Jeremiah Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 29:1</span></span>

LETTER OF JEREMIAH TO THE CAPTIVES IN BABYLON, TO COUNTERACT THE
ASSURANCES GIVEN BY THE FALSE PROPHETS OF A SPEEDY RESTORATION. (Jer.
29:1-32)

residue of the elders--those still surviving from the time when they
were carried to Babylon with Jeconiah; the other elders of the captives
had died by either a natural or a violent death.

[Jeremiah 29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 29:2</span></span>

queen--Nehushta, the queen mother, daughter of Elnathan ([Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008.md), [Kg2
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015).md). (Elnathan, her father, is
perhaps the same as the one mentioned in [Jer
26:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#022).md). She reigned jointly with her
son.

princes--All the men of authority were taken away lest they should
organize a rebellion. Jeremiah wrote his letter while the calamity was
still recent, to console the captives under it.

[Jeremiah 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 29:3</span></span>

Zedekiah . . . sent unto Babylon--In [Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md), Zedekiah himself goes to
Babylon; here he sends ambassadors. Whatever was the object of the
embassy, it shows that Zedekiah only reigned at the pleasure of the king
of Babylon, who might have restored Jeconiah, had he pleased. Hence,
Zedekiah permitted Jeremiah's letter to be sent, not only as being led
by Hananiah's death to attach greater credit to the prophet's words, but
also as the letter accorded with his own wish that the Jews should
remain in Chaldea till Jeconiah's death.

Hilkiah--the high priest who found the book of the law in the house of
the Lord, and showed it to "Shaphan" the scribe (the same Shaphan
probably as here), who showed it to King Josiah ([Kg2
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#008), &c..md). The sons of Hilkiah and
Shaphan inherited from their fathers some respect for sacred things. So
in [Jer 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025.md), "Gemariah" interceded
with King Jehoiakim that the prophet's roll should not be burned.

[Jeremiah 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 29:5</span></span>

Build . . . houses--In opposition to the false prophets' suggestions,
who told the captives that their captivity would soon cease, Jeremiah
tells them that it will be of long duration, and that therefore they
should build houses, as Babylon is to be for long their home.

[Jeremiah 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 29:6</span></span>

that ye . . . be . . . not diminished--It was God's will that the seed
of Abraham should not fail; thus consolation is given them, and the
hope, though not of an immediate, yet of an ultimate, return.

[Jeremiah 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 29:7</span></span>

([Ezr 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#010.md); [Rom
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md); [Ti1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#002).md). Not only bear the Babylonian
yoke patiently, but pray for your masters, that is, while the captivity
lasts. God's good time was to come when they were to pray for Babylon's
downfall ([Jer 51:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#035.md); [Psa
137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008).md). They were not to forestall
that time. True religion teaches patient submission, not sedition, even
though the prince be an unbeliever. In all states of life let us not
throw away the comfort we may have, because we have not all we would
have. There is here a foretaste of gospel love towards enemies ([Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044).md).

[Jeremiah 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 29:8</span></span>

your dreams which ye caused to be dreamed--The Latin adage says, "The
people wish to be deceived, so let them be deceived." Not mere credulity
misleads men, but their own perverse "love of darkness rather than
light." It was not priests who originated priestcraft, but the people's
own morbid appetite to be deceived; for example, Aaron and the golden
calf ([Exo 32:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#001).md). So the Jews caused
or made the prophets to tell them encouraging dreams ([Jer
23:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md); [Ecc
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#007.md); [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md); [Joh
3:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md).

[Jeremiah 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 29:10</span></span>

(See on [Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md). This proves that the seventy
years date from Jeconiah's captivity, not from the last captivity. The
specification of time was to curb the impatience of the Jews lest they
should hasten before God's time.

good word--promise of a return.

[Jeremiah 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 29:11</span></span>

I know--I alone; not the false prophets who know nothing of My purposes,
though they pretend to know.

thoughts . . . I think-- ([Isa 55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009).md).
Glancing at the Jews who had no "thoughts of peace," but only of "evil"
(misfortune), because they could not conceive how deliverance could come
to them. The moral malady of man is twofold--at one time vain
confidence; then, when that is disappointed, despair. So the Jews first
laughed at God's threats, confident that they should speedily return;
then, when cast down from that confidence, they sank in inconsolable
despondency.

expected end--literally, "end and expectation," that is, an end, and
that such an end as you wish for. Two nouns joined by "and," standing
for a noun and adjective. So in [Jer
36:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027.md), "the roll and the words," that
is, the roll of words; [Gen 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md),
"sorrow and conception," that is, sorrow in conception. Compare [Pro
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md), where, as here "end" means "a
happy issue."

[Jeremiah 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 29:12</span></span>

Fulfilled ([Dan 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003), &c..md). When God
designs mercy, He puts it into the hearts of His people to pray for the
mercy designed. When such a spirit of prayer is poured out, it is a sure
sign of coming mercy.

go--to the temple and other places of prayer: contrasted with their
previous sloth as to going to seek God.

[Jeremiah 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 29:13</span></span>

([Lev 26:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md), [Lev
26:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044).md).

[Jeremiah 29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 29:14</span></span>

to be found-- ([Psa 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md); [Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006).md).

turn . . . captivity--play upon sounds, shabti . . . shebith.

[Jeremiah 29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 29:15</span></span>

Because--referring not to the preceding words, but to [Jer
29:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md), "Jehovah saith this to you"
(that is, the prophecy of the continuance of the captivity seventy
years), "because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in
Babylon," namely, foretelling our speedy deliverance (this their
prophecy is supposed, not expressed; accordingly, [Jer
29:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md) contradict this false hope
again, [Jer 29:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md), [Jer
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021).md). He, in this fifteenth verse,
turns his address from the godly ([Jer
29:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012).md) to the ungodly listeners, to
false prophets.

[Jeremiah 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 29:16</span></span>

people . . . in this city . . . not gone forth--So far from your
returning to Jerusalem soon, even your brethren still left dwelling
there shall themselves also be cast into exile. He mentions "the throne
of David," lest they should think that, because David's kingdom was to
be perpetual, no severe, though temporary, chastisements could interpose
([Psa 89:29-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#029).md).

[Jeremiah 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 29:17</span></span>

vile figs--Hebrew, "horrible," or nauseous, from a root, "to regard with
loathing" (see [Jer 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md), [Jer
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010).md).

[Jeremiah 29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 29:18</span></span>

removed to all . . . kingdoms-- ([Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md); [Deu
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025).md).

curse, &c.-- ([Jer 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#006.md); [Jer
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 29:21</span></span>

Zedekiah--brother of Zephaniah ([Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025).md), both being sons of Maaseiah;
probably of the same family as the false prophet under Ahab in Israel
([Kg1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011.md), [Kg1
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#024).md).

[Jeremiah 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 29:22</span></span>

shall be taken . . . a curse--that is, a formula of imprecation.

Lord make thee like Zedekiah--(Compare [Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020.md); [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015).md).

roasted in the fire--a Chaldean punishment ([Dan
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 29:23</span></span>

villainy--literally, "sinful folly" ([Isa
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 29:24</span></span>

A second communication which Jeremiah sent to Babylon, after the
messenger who carried his first letter had brought a letter from the
false prophet Shemaiah to Zephaniah, &c., condemning Jeremiah and
reproving the authorities for not having apprehended him.

Nehelamite--a name derived either from his father or from a place:
alluding at the same time to the Hebrew meaning, "a dreamer" (compare
[Jer 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 29:25</span></span>

in thy name--without sanction of "the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,"
which words stand in antithesis to "thy name" ([Joh
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043).md).

Zephaniah--the second priest, or substitute (Sagan) of the high priest.
He was one of those sent to consult Jeremiah by Zedekiah ([Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001).md). Slain by Nebuchadnezzar at the
capture of Jerusalem ([Kg2 25:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018).md).
Zephaniah was in particular addressed, as being likely to take up
against Jeremiah the prophet's prediction against his brother Zedekiah
at Babylon ([Jer 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021).md). Zephaniah was
to read it to the priests, and in the presence of all the people, in the
temple.

[Jeremiah 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 29:26</span></span>

thee . . . in the stead of Jehoiada--Zephaniah's promotion as second
priest, owing to Jehoiada's being then in exile, was unexpected.
Shemaiah thus accuses him of ingratitude towards God, who had so highly
exalted him before his regular time.

ye should be officers . . . for every man--Ye should, as bearing rule in
the temple (see on [Jer 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001).md),
apprehend every false prophet like Jeremiah.

mad--Inspired prophets were often so called by the ungodly ([Kg2
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md); [Act
26:24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md); [Act
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#013.md), [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md), [Act
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#017).md). Jeremiah is in this a type
of Christ, against whom the same charge was brought ([Joh
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#020).md).

prison--rather, "the stocks" (see on [Jer
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#002).md).

stocks--from a root, "to confine"; hence rather, "a narrow dungeon."
According to [Deu 17:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md), the priest
was judge in such cases, but had no right to put into the stocks; this
right he had assumed to himself in the troubled state of the times.

[Jeremiah 29:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 29:27</span></span>

of Anathoth--said contemptuously, as "Jesus of Nazareth."

maketh himself--as if God had not made him one, but he himself had done
so.

[Jeremiah 29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 29:28</span></span>

Referring to Jeremiah's first letter to Babylon ([Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 29:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 29:29</span></span>

Zephaniah . . . read . . . in the ears of Jeremiah--He seems to have
been less prejudiced against Jeremiah than the others; hence he reads
the charge to the prophet, that he should not be condemned without a
hearing. This accords with Shemaiah's imputation against Zephaniah for
want of zeal against Jeremiah ([Jer
29:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#026).md). Hence the latter was chosen
by King Zedekiah as one of the deputation to Jeremiah ([Jer
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#001.md); [Jer
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 29:30</span></span>

This resumes the thread of the sentence which began at [Jer
29:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#025.md), but was left there not
completed. Here, in this thirtieth verse, it is completed, not however
in continuity, but by a new period. The same construction occurs in [Rom
5:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md).

[Jeremiah 29:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 29:32</span></span>

not . . . a man to dwell-- ([Deu
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018).md).

not . . . behold the good--As he despised the lawful time and wished to
return before the time God had expressly announced, in just retribution
he should not share in the restoration from Babylon at all.

rebellion--going against God's revealed will as to the time ([Jer
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#016).md).
