### [Zechariah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)

[Zechariah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 12:1</span></span>

JERUSALEM THE INSTRUMENT OF JUDGMENT ON HER FOES HEREAFTER; HER
REPENTANCE AND RESTORATION. ([Zac
12:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#001))

burden--"weighty prophecy"; fraught with destruction to Israel's foes;
the expression may also refer to the distresses of Israel implied as
about to precede the deliverance.

for Israel--concerning Israel \[MAURER\].

stretcheth forth--present; now, not merely "hath stretched forth," as if
God only created and then left the universe to itself ([Joh
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017)). To remove all doubts of
unbelief as to the possibility of Israel's deliverance, God prefaces the
prediction by reminding us of His creative and sustaining power. Compare
a similar preface in [Isa 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#005); [Isa
43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001); [Isa
65:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).

formeth . . . spirit of man-- ([Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022); [Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009)).

[Zechariah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 12:2</span></span>

cup of trembling--a cup causing those who drink it to reel (from a
Hebrew root "to reel"). Jerusalem, who drank the "cup of trembling"
herself, shall be so to her foes ([Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017), [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022); [Jer
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#013)). CALVIN with the Septuagint
translates, "threshold of destruction," on which they shall stumble and
be crushed when they attempt to cross it. English Version is better.

both against Judah--The Hebrew order of words is literally, "And also
against Judah shall he (the foe) be in the siege against Jerusalem";
implying virtually that Judah, as it shares the invasion along with
Jerusalem, so it shall, like the metropolis, prove a cup of trembling to
the invaders. MAURER with JEROME translates, "Also upon Judah shall be
(the cup of trembling); that is, some Jews forced by the foe shall join
in the assault on Jerusalem, and shall share the overthrow with the
besiegers. But [Zac 12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006) show that
Judah escapes and proves the scourge of the foe.

[Zechariah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 12:3</span></span>

(Compare [Zac 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004), [Zac
14:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#006), [Zac
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#013)). JEROME states it was a custom
in Palestine to test the strength of youths by their lifting up a
massive stone; the phrase, "burden themselves with it," refers to this
custom. Compare [Mat 21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044) : The Jews
"fell" on the rock of offense, Messiah, and were "broken"; but the rock
shall fall on Antichrist, who "burdens himself with it" by his assault
on the restored Jews, and "grind him to powder."

all . . . people of . . . earth--The Antichristian confederacy against
the Jews shall be almost universal.

[Zechariah 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 12:4</span></span>

I will smite . . . horse--The arm of attack especially formidable to
Judah, who was unprovided with cavalry. So in the overthrow of Pharaoh
([Exo 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#019), [Exo
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021)).

open mine eyes upon . . . Judah--to watch over Judah's safety.
Heretofore Jehovah seemed to have shut His eyes, as having no regard for
her.

blindness--so as to rush headlong on to their own ruin (compare [Zac
14:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#012)).

[Zechariah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 12:5</span></span>

shall say--when they see the foe divinely smitten with "madness."

Judah . . . Jerusalem--here distinguished as the country and the
metropolis. Judah recognizes her "strength" to be "Jerusalem and its
inhabitants" as the instrument, and "Jehovah of hosts their God"
(dwelling especially there) as the author of all power ([Joe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#016)). My strength is the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, who have the Lord their God as their help. The repulse of
the foe by the metropolis shall assure the Jews of the country that the
same divine aid shall save them.

[Zechariah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 12:6</span></span>

On "governors of Judah," see on [Zac
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#007).

hearth--or pan.

torch . . . in a sheaf--Though small, it shall consume the many foes
around. One prophet supplements the other. Thus Isa. 29:1-24; Joel
3:1-21; Zec. 12:1-14:21, describe more Antichrist's army than himself.
Daniel represents him as a horn growing out of the fourth beast or
fourth kingdom; St. John, as a separate beast having an individual
existence. Daniel dwells on his worldly conquests as a king; St. John,
more on his spiritual tyranny, whence he adds a second beast, the false
prophet coming in a semblance of spirituality. What is briefly described
by one is more fully prophesied by the other \[ROOS\].

[Zechariah 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 12:7</span></span>

Judah is to be "first saved," because of her meek acknowledgment of
dependence on Jerusalem, subordinate to Jehovah's aid.

tents--shifting and insecure, as contrasted with the solid
fortifications of Judah. But God chooses the weak to confound the
mighty, that all human glorying may be set aside.

[Zechariah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 12:8</span></span>

Jerusalem, however, also shall be specially strengthened against the
foe.

feeble . . . shall be as David--to the Jew, the highest type of strength
and glory on earth ([Sa2 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#008); [Sa2
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#003); [Joe
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#010)).

angel of the Lord before them--the divine angel that went "before them"
through the desert, the highest type of strength and glory in heaven
([Exo 23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020); [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034)). "The house of David" is the
"prince," and his family sprung from David ([Eze
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007), [Eze
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#009)). David's house was then in a
comparatively weak state.

[Zechariah 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 12:9</span></span>

I will seek to destroy--I will set Myself with determined earnestness to
destroy ([Hag 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#022)).

[Zechariah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 12:10</span></span>

Future conversion of the Jews is to flow from an extraordinary
outpouring of the Holy Spirit ([Jer
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#009), [Jer
31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031); [Eze
39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029)).

spirit of grace . . . supplications--"spirit" is here not the spirit
produced, but THE HOLY SPIRIT producing a "gracious" disposition, and
inclination for "supplications." CALVIN explains "spirit of grace" as
the grace of God itself (whereby He "pours" out His bowels of mercy),
"conjoined with the sense of it in man's heart." The "spirit of
supplications" is the mercury whose rise or fall is an unerring test of
the state of the Church \[MOORE\]. In Hebrew, "grace" and
"supplications" are kindred terms; translate, therefore, "gracious
supplications." The plural implies suppliant prayers "without ceasing."
Herein not merely external help against the foe, as before, but internal
grace is promised subsequently.

look upon me--with profoundly earnest regard, as the Messiah whom they
so long denied.

pierced--implying Messiah's humanity: as "I will pour . . . spirit"
implies His divinity.

look . . . mourn--True repentance arises from the sight by faith of the
crucified Saviour. It is the tear that drops from the eye of faith
looking on Him. Terror only produces remorse. The true penitent weeps
over his sins in love to Him who in love has suffered for them.

me . . . him--The change of person is due to Jehovah-Messiah speaking in
His own person first, then the prophet speaking of Him. The Jews, to
avoid the conclusion that He whom they have "pierced" is
Jehovah-Messiah, who says, "I will pour out . . . spirit," altered "me"
into "him," and represent the "pierced" one to be Messiah Ben (son of)
Joseph, who was to suffer in the battle with Cog, before Messiah Ben
David should come to reign. But Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic
oppose this; and the ancient Jews interpreted it of Messiah. [Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016) also refers to His being
"pierced." So [Joh 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037); [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007). The actual piercing of His side
was the culminating point of all their insulting treatment of Him. The
act of the Roman soldier who pierced Him was their act ([Mat
27:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#025)), and is so accounted here in
Zechariah. The Hebrew word is always used of a literal piercing (so [Zac
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003)); not of a metaphorical piercing,
"insulted," as MAURER and other Rationalists (from the Septuagint)
represent.

as one mourneth for . . . son-- ([Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026); [Amo
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010)). A proverbial phrase peculiarly
forcible among the Jews, who felt childlessness as a curse and dishonor.
Applied with peculiar propriety to mourning for Messiah, "the first-born
among many brethren" ([Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)).

[Zechariah 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 12:11</span></span>

As in [Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010) the bitterness of
their mourning is illustrated by a private case of mourning, so in this
verse by a public one, the greatest recorded in Jewish history, that for
the violent death in battle with Pharaoh-necho of the good King Josiah,
whose reign had been the only gleam of brightness for the period from
Hezekiah to the downfall of the state; lamentations were written by
Jeremiah for the occasion ([Kg2
23:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029); [Ch2
35:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022)).

Hadad-rimmon--a place or city in the great plain of Esdraelon, the
battlefield of many a conflict, near Megiddo; called so from the Syrian
idol Rimmon. Hadad also was the name of the sun, a chief god of the
Syrians \[MACROBIUS, Saturnalia, 1.23\]. A universal and an individual
mourning at once.

[Zechariah 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 12:12</span></span>

David . . . Nathan--representing the highest and lowest of the royal
order. Nathan, not the prophet, but a younger son of David ([Sa2
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#014); [Luk
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#031)).

apart--Retirement and seclusion are needful for deep personal religion.

wives apart--Jewish females worship separately from the males ([Exo
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001), [Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020)).

[Zechariah 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 12:13</span></span>

Levi . . . Shimei--the highest and lowest of the priestly order ([Num
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#018), [Num
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#021)). Their example and that of the
royal order would of course influence the rest.

[Zechariah 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 12:14</span></span>

All . . . that remain--after the fiery ordeal, in which two-thirds fall
([Zac 13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008)).
