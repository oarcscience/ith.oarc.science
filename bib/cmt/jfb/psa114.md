### [Psalms Chapter 114](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)

[Psalms 114:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 114:1</span></span>

The writer briefly and beautifully celebrates God's former care of His
people, to whose benefit nature was miraculously made to contribute.
([Psa 114:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#001))

of strange language--(compare [Psa
81:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#005)).

[Psalms 114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 114:4</span></span>

skipped . . . rams-- ([Psa 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#006)),
describes the waving of mountain forests, poetically representing the
motion of the mountains. The poetical description of the effect of God's
presence on the sea and Jordan alludes to the history ([Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021); [Jos
3:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014)). Judah is put as a parallel
to Israel, because of the destined, as well as real, prominence of that
tribe.

[Psalms 114:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 114:5</span></span>

The questions place the implied answers in a more striking form.

[Psalms 114:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 114:7</span></span>

at the presence of--literally, "from before," as if affrighted by the
wonderful display of God's power. Well may such a God be trusted, and
great should be His praise.
