### [Jeremiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 46:1</span></span>

THE PROPHECIES, FORTY-SIXTH THROUGH FIFTY-SECOND CHAPTERS, REFER TO
FOREIGN PEOPLES. (Jer. 46:1-28)

General heading of the next six chapters of prophecies concerning the
Gentiles; the prophecies are arranged according to nations, not by the
dates.

[Jeremiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 46:2</span></span>

Inscription of the first prophecy.

Pharaoh-necho--He, when going against Carchemish (Cercusium, near the
Euphrates), encountered Josiah, king of Judah (the ally of Assyria), at
Megiddo, and slew him there ([Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029.md); [Ch2
35:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020).md); but he was four years
subsequently overcome at Carchemish, by Nebuchadnezzar, as is foretold
here; and lost all the territory which had been subject to the Pharaohs
west of the Euphrates, and between it and the Nile. The prediction would
mitigate the Jews' grief for Josiah, and show his death was not to be
unavenged ([Kg2 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007).md). He is famed as
having fitted out a fleet of discovery from the Red Sea, which doubled
the Cape of Good Hope and returned to Egypt by the Mediterranean.

[Jeremiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 46:3</span></span>

Derisive summons to battle. With all your mighty preparation for the
invasion of Nebuchadnezzar, when ye come to the encounter, ye shall be
"dismayed" ([Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005).md). Your mighty
threats shall end in nothing.

buckler--smaller, and carried by the light-armed cavalry.

shield--of larger size, and carried by the heavily armed infantry.

[Jeremiah 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 46:4</span></span>

Harness the horses--namely, to the war chariots, for which Egypt was
famed ([Exo 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#007.md); [Exo
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#004).md).

get up, ye horsemen--get up into the chariots. MAURER, because of the
parallel "horses," translates, "Mount the steeds." But it is rather
describing the successive steps in equipping the war chariots; first
harness the horses to them, then let the horsemen mount them.

brigandines--cuirasses, or coats of mail.

[Jeremiah 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 46:5</span></span>

(See on [Jer 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003).md). The language of
astonishment, that an army so well equipped should be driven back in
"dismay." The prophet sees this in prophetic vision.

fled apace--literally, "fled a flight," that is, flee precipitately.

look not back--They do not even dare to look back at their pursuers.

[Jeremiah 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 46:6</span></span>

Let not--equivalent to the strongest negation. Let not any of the
Egyptian warriors think to escape by swiftness or by might.

toward the north--that is, in respect to Egypt or Judea. In the
northward region, by the Euphrates (see [Jer
46:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 46:7</span></span>

as a flood-- ([Jer 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md); [Isa
8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md); [Dan
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#022).md). The figure is appropriate in
addressing Egyptians, as the Nile, their great river, yearly overspreads
their lands with a turbid, muddy flood. So their army, swelling with
arrogance, shall overspread the region south of Euphrates; but it, like
the Nile, shall retreat as fast as it advanced.

[Jeremiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 46:8</span></span>

Answer to the question in [Jer 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#007.md).

waters . . . moved like the rivers--The rise of the Nile is gentle; but
at the mouth it, unlike most rivers, is much agitated, owing to the
sandbanks impeding its course, and so it rushes into the sea like a
cataract.

[Jeremiah 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 46:9</span></span>

Ironical exhortation, as in [Jer 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003.md).
The Egyptians, owing to the heat of their climate and abstinence from
animal food, were physically weak, and therefore employed mercenary
soldiers.

Ethiopians--Hebrew, Cush: Abyssinia and Nubia.

Libyans--Phut, Mauritania, west of Egypt (compare [Gen
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006).md).

shield--The Libyans borrowed from Egypt the use of the long shield
extending to the feet \[XENOPHON, CyropÃ&brvbr;dia, 6 and 7\].

Lydians--not the Lydians west of Asia Minor ([Gen
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005).md), but the Ludim, an African
nation descended from Egypt (Mizraim) ([Gen
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005.md); [Nah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009).md).

handle and bend the bow--The employment of two verbs expresses the
manner of bending the bow, namely, the foot being pressed on the center,
and the hands holding the ends of it.

[Jeremiah 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 46:10</span></span>

vengeance--for the slaughter of Josiah ([Kg2
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029).md).

sword shall devour . . . be . . . drunk--poetical personification ([Deu
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042).md).

a sacrifice-- ([Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md). The slaughter of the Egyptians
is represented as a sacrifice to satiate His righteous vengeance.

[Jeremiah 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 46:11</span></span>

Gilead . . . balm--(See on [Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022).md);
namely, for curing the wounds; but no medicine will avail, so desperate
shall be the slaughter.

virgin--Egypt is so called on account of her effeminate luxury, and as
having never yet been brought under foreign yoke.

thou shalt not be cured--literally, "there shall be no cure for thee"
([Jer 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013.md); [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021).md). Not that the kingdom of Egypt
should cease to exist, but it should not recover its former strength;
the blow should be irretrievable.

[Jeremiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 46:12</span></span>

mighty . . . stumbled against . . . mighty . . . fallen both
together--Their very multitude shall prove an impediment in their
confused flight, one treading on the other.

[Jeremiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 46:13</span></span>

Prophecy of the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, which took place
sixteen years after the taking of Jerusalem. Having spent thirteen years
in the siege of Tyre, and having obtained nothing for his pains, he is
promised by God Egypt for his reward in humbling Tyre ([Eze
29:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#017); Eze. 30:1-31:18.md). The
intestine commotions between Amasis and Pharaoh-hophra prepared his way
(compare Note, see on [Isa 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001), &c..md).

[Jeremiah 46:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 46:14</span></span>

Declare . . . publish--as if giving sentence from a tribunal.

Migdol . . . Noph . . . Tahpanhes--east, south, and north. He mentions
the three other quarters, but omits the west, because the Chaldeans did
not advance thither. These cities, too, were the best known to the Jews,
as being in their direction.

sword shall devour round about thee--namely, the Syrians, Jews,
Moabites, and Ammonites (see on [Jer
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#001).md). The exhortation is ironical, as
in [Jer 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#004.md), [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md), [Jer
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md).

[Jeremiah 46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 46:15</span></span>

thy valiant men--manuscripts, the Septuagint, and Vulgate read, "thy
valiant one," Apis, the bull-shaped Egyptian idol worshipped at Noph or
Memphis. The contrast thus is between the palpable impotence of the idol
and the might attributed to it by the worshippers. The Hebrew term,
"strong," or "valiant," is applied to bulls ([Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012).md). Cambyses in his invasion of
Egypt destroyed the sacred bull.

drive them--(Compare [Jer 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#005).md). The
Hebrew word is used of a sweeping rain ([Pro
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#003).md).

[Jeremiah 46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 46:16</span></span>

He--Jehovah.

made many to fall--literally, "multiplied the faller," that is, fallers.

one fell upon another-- ([Jer 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#006.md),
[Jer 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#012).md): even before the enemy
strikes them ([Lev 26:37](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#037).md).

let us go again to our own people--the language of the confederates and
mercenaries, exhorting one another to desert the Egyptian standard, and
return to their respective homes ([Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), [Jer
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021).md).

from the oppressing sword--from the cruel sword, namely, of the
Chaldeans (compare [Jer 25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038).md).

[Jeremiah 46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 46:17</span></span>

there--in their own country severally, the foreign soldiers ([Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md) cry, "Pharaoh is," &c.

but a noise--He threatens great things, but when the need arises, he
does nothing. His threats are mere "noise" (compare [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md). MAURER translates, "is ruined,"
literally (in appropriate abruptness of language), "Pharaoh, king . . .
ruin." The context favors English Version. His vauntings of what he
would do when the time of battle should come have proved to be empty
sounds; he hath passed the time appointed (namely, for battle with the
Chaldeans).

[Jeremiah 46:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 46:18</span></span>

As the mountains Tabor and Carmel tower high above the other hills of
Palestine, so Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026).md) when he comes shall prove
himself superior to all his foes. Carmel forms a bold promontory jutting
out into the Mediterranean. Tabor is the higher of the two; therefore it
is said to be "among the mountains"; and Carmel "by the sea."

the King . . . Lord of hosts-- ([Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015).md); in contrast to "Pharaoh king
of Egypt . . . but a noise" ([Jer
46:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#017).md). God the true "King . . . the
Lord of hosts," shall cause Nebuchadnezzar to come. Whereas Pharaoh
shall not come to battle at the time appointed, notwithstanding his
boasts, Nebuchadnezzar shall come according to the prediction of the
King, who has all hosts in His power, however ye Egyptians may despise
the prediction.

[Jeremiah 46:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 46:19</span></span>

furnish thyself--literally, "make for thyself vessels" (namely, to
contain food and other necessaries for the journey) for captivity.

daughter--so in [Jer 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md).

dwelling in Egypt--that is, the inhabitants of Egypt, the Egyptians,
represented as the daughter of Egypt ([Jer
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018.md); [Kg2
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#021).md). "Dwelling" implies that they
thought themselves to be securely fixed in their habitations beyond the
reach of invasion.

[Jeremiah 46:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 46:20</span></span>

heifer--wanton, like a fat, untamed heifer ([Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011).md). Appropriate to Egypt, where
Apis was worshipped under the form of a fair bull marked with spots.

destruction--that is, a destroyer: Nebuchadnezzar. Vulgate translates,
"a goader," answering to the metaphor, "one who will goad the heifer"
and tame her. The Arabic idiom favors this \[ROSENMULLER\].

cometh . . . cometh--The repetition implies, it cometh surely and
quickly ([Psa 96:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#013).md).

out of the north--(See on [Jer 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#014.md);
[Jer 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002).md).

[Jeremiah 46:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 46:21</span></span>

Translate, "Also her hired men (mercenary soldiers, [Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), [Jer
46:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#016).md), who are in the midst of her
like fatted bullocks, even they also are turned back," that is, shall
turn their backs to flee. The same image, "heifer . . . bullocks" ([Jer
46:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#020).md), is applied to Egypt's
foreign mercenaries, as to herself. Pampered with the luxuries of Egypt,
they become as enervated for battle as the natives themselves.

[Jeremiah 46:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 46:22</span></span>

The cry of Egypt when invaded shall be like the hissing of a serpent
roused by the woodcutters from its lair. No longer shall she loudly roar
like a heifer, but with a low murmur of fear, as a serpent hissing.

with axes--the Scythian mode of armor. The Chaldeans shall come with
such confidence as if not about to have to fight with soldiers, but
merely to cut down trees offering no resistance.

[Jeremiah 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 46:23</span></span>

her forest-- ([Isa 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#034).md).

though it cannot be searched--They cut down her forest, dense and
unsearchable ([Job 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#009.md); [Job
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#010.md); [Job
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#026).md) as it may seem: referring to
the thickly set cities of Egypt, which were at that time a thousand and
twenty. The Hebrew particle is properly, "for," "because."

because--the reason why the Chaldeans shall be able to cut down so dense
a forest of cities as Egypt: they themselves are countless in numbers.

grasshoppers--locusts ([Jdg 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 46:25</span></span>

multitude--Hebrew, "Amon" ([Nah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md),
Margin, "No-Ammon"), the same as Thebes or Diospolis in Upper Egypt,
where Jupiter Ammon had his famous temple. In English Version,
"multitude" answers to "populous No" ([Nah
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md); [Eze
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#015).md). The reference to "their gods"
which follows, makes the translation more likely, "Ammon of No," that
is, No and her idol Ammon; so the Chaldee Version. So called either from
Ham, the son of Noah; or, the "nourisher," as the word means.

their kings--the kings of the nations in league with Egypt.

[Jeremiah 46:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 46:26</span></span>

afterward . . . inhabited--Under Cyrus forty years after the conquest of
Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, it threw off the Babylonian yoke but has never
regained its former prowess ([Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011.md); [Eze
29:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 46:27</span></span>

Repeated from [Jer 30:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md). When the
Church (and literal Israel) might seem utterly consumed, there still
remains hidden hope, because God, as it were, raises His people from the
dead ([Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md). Whereas the godless
"nations" are consumed even though they survive, as are the Egyptians
after their overthrow; because they are radically accursed and doomed
\[CALVIN\].
