### [Psalms Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 48:1</span></span>

This is a spirited Psalm and song (compare [Psa
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#001).md), having probably been suggested
by the same occasion as the foregoing. It sets forth the privileges and
blessings of God's spiritual dominion as the terror of the wicked and
joy of the righteous. ([Psa 48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001).md)

to be praised--always: it is an epithet, as in [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md).

mountain of his holiness--His Church (compare [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md), [Isa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010).md); the sanctuary was erected
first on Mount Zion, then (as the temple) on Moriah; hence the figure.

[Psalms 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 48:2</span></span>

situation--literally, "elevation."

joy of, &c.--source of joy.

sides of the north--poetically for eminent, lofty, distinguished, as the
ancients believed the north to be the highest part of the earth (compare
[Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 48:3</span></span>

palaces--literally, "citadels."

refuge-- ([Psa 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#010.md); [Psa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003).md). He was so known in them because
they enjoyed His presence.

[Psalms 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 48:4</span></span>

For--The reason is given. Though the kings (perhaps of Moab and Ammon,
compare [Psa 83:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003).md) combined, a
conviction of God's presence with His people, evinced by the unusual
courage with which the prophets (compare [Ch2
20:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#012).md) had inspired them, seized on
their minds, and smitten with sudden and intense alarm, they fled
astonished.

[Psalms 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 48:7</span></span>

ships of Tarshish--as engaged in a distant and lucrative trade, the most
valuable. The phrase may illustrate God's control over all material
agencies, whether their literal destruction be meant or not.

[Psalms 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 48:8</span></span>

This present experience assures of that perpetual care which God extends
to His Church.

[Psalms 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 48:9</span></span>

thought of--literally, "compared," or considered, in respect of former
dealings.

in the . . . temple--in acts of solemn worship (compare [Ch2
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#028).md).

[Psalms 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 48:10</span></span>

According . . . praise--that is, As Thy perfections manifested (compare
[Psa 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001.md); [Psa
20:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001).md), demand praise, it shall be
given, everywhere.

thy right hand, &c.--Thy righteous government is displayed by Thy power.

[Psalms 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 48:11</span></span>

the daughters, &c.--the small towns, or the people, with the chief city,
or rulers of the Church.

judgments--decisions and acts of right government.

[Psalms 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 48:12</span></span>

The call to survey Zion, or the Church, as a fortified city, is designed
to suggest "how well our God secures His fold." This security is
perpetual, and its pledge is His guidance through this life.
