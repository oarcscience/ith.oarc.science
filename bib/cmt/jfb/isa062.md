### [Isaiah Chapter 62](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)

[Isaiah 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 62:1</span></span>

INTERCESSORY PRAYERS FOR ZION'S RESTORATION, ACCOMPANYING GOD'S PROMISES
OF IT, AS THE APPOINTED MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING IT. ([Isa
62:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001))

I--the prophet, as representative of all the praying people of God who
love and intercede for Zion (compare [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006); [Psa
102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)), or else Messiah (compare
[Isa 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006)). So Messiah is represented
as unfainting in His efforts for His people ([Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004); [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)).

righteousness thereof--not its own inherently, but imputed to it, for
its restoration to God's favor: hence "salvation" answers to it in the
parallelism. "Judah" is to be "saved" through "the Lord our (Judah's and
the Church's) righteousness" ([Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006)).

as brightness--properly the bright shining of the rising sun ([Isa
60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019); [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005); [Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004); [Pro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018)).

lamp--blazing torch.

[Isaiah 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 62:2</span></span>

([Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Isa
42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007), [Isa
49:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022); [Isa
60:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#003), [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016)).

new name--expression of thy new and improved condition ([Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004)), the more valuable and lasting
as being conferred by Jehovah Himself ([Isa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012); [Isa
65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015); [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017); [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 62:3</span></span>

([Zac 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016))

in . . . hand of . . . Lord--As a crown is worn on the head, not "in the
hand," hand must here be figurative for "under the Lord's protection"
(compare [Deu 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#003)). "All His saints
are in thy hand." His people are in His hand at the same time that they
are "a crown of glory" to Him ([Rev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002); [Rev
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012)); reciprocally, He is "a crown
of glory and a diadem of beauty" to them ([Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005); compare [Mal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 62:4</span></span>

be termed--be "forsaken," so as that that term could be applicable to
thee.

Hephzi-bah-- ([Kg2 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#001)), the name of
Hezekiah's wife, a type of Jerusalem, as Hezekiah was of Messiah ([Isa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001)): "my delight is in her."

Beulah--"Thou art married." See the same contrast of Zion's past and
future state under the same figure ([Isa
54:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002), [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004)).

land . . . married--to Jehovah as its Lord and Husband: implying not
only ownership, but protection on the part of the Owner \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 62:5</span></span>

thy sons--rather, changing the points, which are of no authority in
Hebrew, "thy builder" or "restorer," that is, God; for in the parallel
clause, and in [Isa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004), God is
implied as being "married" to her; whereas her "sons" could hardly be
said to marry their mother; and in [Isa
49:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018), they are said to be her bridal
ornaments, not her husband. The plural form, builders, is used of God in
reverence as "husbands" (see on [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005)).

over the bride--in the possession of the bride ([Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019); [Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041); [Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 62:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 62:6</span></span>

I--Isaiah speaking in the person of the Messiah.

watchmen upon . . . walls--image from the watches set upon a city's wall
to look out for the approach of a messenger with good tidings ([Isa
52:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)); the good tidings of the
return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, prefiguring the return from
the present dispersion (compare [Isa
21:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006); [Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010); [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017); [Eze
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#007)). The watches in the East are
announced by a loud cry to mark the vigilance of the watchmen.

ye that . . . mention . . . Lord--Hebrew, "ye that are the Lord's
remembrancers"; God's servants who by their prayers "put God in
remembrance" of His promises ([Isa
43:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026)); we are required to remind God,
as if God could, which He cannot, forget His promises ([Psa
119:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#049); [Jer
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 62:7</span></span>

no rest--Hebrew, "silence"; keep not silence yourselves, nor let Him
rest in silence. Compare as to Messiah Himself, "I will not hold . . .
peace . . . not rest" ([Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001));
Messiah's watchmen ([Isa 62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006))
imitate Him ([Isa 62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)) in
intercessory "prayer without ceasing" for Jerusalem ([Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006); [Psa
51:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#018)); also for the spiritual
Jerusalem, the Church ([Luk 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001), [Luk
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007); [Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)).

a praise--(See on [Isa 61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011); [Zep
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020)).

[Isaiah 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 62:8</span></span>

sworn by . . . right hand--His mighty instrument of accomplishing His
will (compare [Isa 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023); [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013)).

sons of . . . stranger--Foreigners shall no more rob thee of the fruit
of thy labors (compare [Isa 65:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 62:9</span></span>

eat . . . and praise--not consume it on their own lusts, and without
thanksgiving.

drink it in . . . courts--They who have gathered the vintage shall drink
it at the feasts held in the courts surrounding the temple ([Deu
12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017); [Deu
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023), &c.).

[Isaiah 62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 62:10</span></span>

What Isaiah in the person of Messiah had engaged in ([Isa
62:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#001)) unrestingly to seek, and what
the watchmen were unrestingly to pray for ([Isa
62:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#007)), and what Jehovah solemnly
promised ([Isa 62:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008)), is now to be
fulfilled; the Gentile nations are commanded to "go through the gates"
(either of their own cities \[ROSENMULLER\] or of Jerusalem \[MAURER\]),
in order to remove all obstacles out of "the way of the people (Israel)"
(see on [Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014); [Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003); [Isa
52:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010)).

standard--for the dispersed Jews to rally round, with a view to their
return ([Isa 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022); [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 62:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 62:11</span></span>

salvation--embodied in the Saviour (see [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)).

his work--rather, recompense ([Isa
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 62:12</span></span>

Sought out--Sought after and highly prized by Jehovah; answering to "not
forsaken" in the parallel clause; no longer abandoned, but loved; image
from a wife ([Isa 62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004); [Jer
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014)).

Messiah, approaching Jerusalem after having avenged His people on His
and their enemies, is represented under imagery taken from the
destruction of "Edom," the type of the last and most bitter foes of God
and His people (see [Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005), &c.).
