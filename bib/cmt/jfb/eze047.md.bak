### [Ezekiel Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 47:1</span></span>

VISION OF THE TEMPLE WATERS. BORDERS AND DIVISION OF THE LAND. (Eze.
47:1-23)

waters--So [Rev 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md), represents "the
water of life as proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."
His throne was set up in the temple at Jerusalem ([Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007).md). Thence it is to flow over the
earth ([Joe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#018.md); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008).md). Messiah is the temple and the
door; from His pierced side flow the living waters, ever increasing,
both in the individual believer and in the heart. The fountains in the
vicinity of Moriah suggested the image here. The waters flow eastward,
that is, towards the Kedron, and thence towards the Jordan, and so along
the Ghor into the Dead Sea. The main point in the picture is the rapid
augmentation from a petty stream into a mighty river, not by the influx
of side streams, but by its own self-supply from the sacred miraculous
source in the temple \[HENDERSON\]. (Compare [Psa
36:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008.md); [Psa
46:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004.md); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md); [Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014).md). Searching into the things of
God, we find some easy to understand, as the water up to the ankles;
others more difficult, which require a deeper search, as the waters up
to the knees or loins; others beyond our reach, of which we can only
adore the depth ([Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md). The
healing of the waters of the Dead Sea here answers to "there shall be no
more curse" ([Rev 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003.md); compare [Zac
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 47:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 47:7</span></span>

trees--not merely one tree of life as in Paradise ([Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022).md), but many: to supply immortal
food and medicine to the people of God, who themselves also become
"trees of righteousness" ([Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003).md)
planted by the waters and ([Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md)
bearing fruit unto holiness.

[Ezekiel 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 47:8</span></span>

the desert--or "plain," Hebrew, Arabah ([Deu
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049.md); [Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016).md), which is the name still given
to the valley of the Jordan and the plain south of the Dead Sea, and
extending to the Elanitic gulf of the Red Sea.

the sea--the Dead Sea. "The sea" noted as covering with its waters the
guilty cities of the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah. In its bituminous waters
no vegetable or animal life is said to be found. But now death is to
give place to life in Judea, and throughout the world, as symbolized by
the healing of these death-pervaded waters covering the doomed cities.
Compare as to "the sea" in general, regarded as a symbol of the troubled
powers of nature, disordered by the fall, henceforth to rage no more,
[Rev 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md).

[Ezekiel 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 47:9</span></span>

rivers--in Hebrew, "two rivers." Hence Hebrew expositors think that the
waters from the temple were divided into two branches, the one emptying
itself into the eastern or Dead Sea, the other into the western or
Mediterranean. So [Zac 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md). However,
though this probably is covertly implied in the Hebrew dual, the flowing
of the waters into the Dead Sea only is expressed. Compare [Eze
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#008.md), "waters . . . healed," which can
apply only to it, not to the Mediterranean: also [Eze
47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md), "fish as the fish of the great
sea"; the Dead Sea, when healed, containing fish, as the Mediterranean
does.

[Ezekiel 47:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 47:10</span></span>

En-gedi . . . En-eglaim--En-gedi (meaning "fountain of the kid"),
anciently, Hazazon-Tamar, now Ain-Jidy; west of the Dead Sea; David's
place of refuge from Saul. En-eglaim means "fountain of two calves," on
the confines of Moab, over against En-gedi, and near where Jordan enters
the Dead Sea ([Isa 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#008).md). These two
limits are fixed on, to comprise between them the whole Dead Sea.

fish . . . according to their kinds--JEROME quotes an ancient theory
that "there are a hundred fifty-three kinds of fishes," all of which
were taken by the apostles ([Joh
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#011).md), and not one remained
uncaptured; signifying that both the noble and baseborn, the rich and
the poor, and every class, are being drawn out of the sea of the world
to salvation. Compare [Mat 13:47](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047.md), the
gospel net; the apostles being fishermen, at first literally, afterwards
spiritually ([Mat 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 47:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 47:11</span></span>

marshes--marshy places. The region is known to have such pits and
marshes. The Arabs take the salt collected by evaporation in these pits
for their own use, and that of their flocks.

not be healed--Those not reached by the healing waters of the Gospel,
through their sloth and earthly-mindedness, are given over ([Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011).md) to their own bitterness and
barrenness (as "saltness" is often employed to express, [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); [Psa
107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034.md); [Zep
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009).md); and awful example to others in
the punishment they suffer ([Pe2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#006).md).

[Ezekiel 47:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 47:12</span></span>

Instead of the "vine of Sodom and grapes of Gomorrah" ([Deu
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032).md), nauseous and unwholesome,
trees of life-giving and life-restoring virtue shall bloom similar in
properties to, and exceeding in number, the tree of life in Eden ([Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md); [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002.md), [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014).md).

leaf . . . not fade--expressing not only the unfailing character of the
heavenly medicine of the tree of life, but also that the graces of the
believer (as a tree of righteousness), which are the leaves, and his
deeds, which are the fruits that flow from those graces, are immortal
([Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003.md); [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md); [Mat
10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md); [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058).md).

new fruit--literally, "firstlings," or first fruit. They are still, each
month afresh, as it were, yielding their first-fruit \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The
first-born of a thing, in Hebrew idiom, means the chiefest. As [Job
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#013.md), "the first-born of death," that
is, the most fatal death.

[Ezekiel 47:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 47:13</span></span>

The redivision of the land: the boundaries. The latter are substantially
the same as those given by Moses in Num. 34:1-29; they here begin with
the north, but in Numbers they begin with the south ([Num
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003).md). It is only Canaan proper,
exclusive of the possession of the two and a half tribes beyond Jordan,
that is here divided.

Joseph . . . two portions--according to the original promise of Jacob
([Gen 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#005.md), [Gen
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022).md). Joseph's sons were given the
birthright forfeited by Reuben, the first-born ([Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001).md). Therefore the former is here put
first. His two sons having distinct portions make up the whole number
twelve portions, as he had just before specified "twelve tribes of
Israel"; for Levi had no separate inheritance, so that he is not
reckoned in the twelve.

[Ezekiel 47:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 47:15</span></span>

Zedad--on the north boundary of Canaan.

[Ezekiel 47:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 47:16</span></span>

Hamath--As Israel was a separate people, so their land was a separate
land. On no scene could the sacred history have been so well transacted
as on it. On the east was the sandy desert. On the north and south,
mountains. On the west, an inhospitable sea-shore. But it was not always
to be a separate land. Between the parallel ranges of Lebanon is the
long valley of El-Bekaa, leading to "the entering in of Hamath" on the
Orontes, in the Syrian frontier. Roman roads, and the harbor made at
CÃ&brvbr;sarea, opened out doors through which the Gospel should go from
it to all lands. So in the last days, when all shall flock to Jerusalem
as the religious center of the world.

Berothah--a city in Syria conquered by David ([Sa2
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#008).md); meaning "wells."

Hazar-hatticon--meaning "the middle village."

Hauran--a tract in Syria, south of Damascus; Auranitis.

[Ezekiel 47:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 47:17</span></span>

Hazar-enan--a town in the north of Canaan, meaning "village of
fountains."

[Ezekiel 47:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 47:18</span></span>

east sea--the Dead Sea. The border is to go down straight to it by the
valley of the Jordan. So [Num
34:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011.md).

[Ezekiel 47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 47:19</span></span>

Tamar--not Tadmor in the desert, but Tamar, the last town of Judea, by
the Dead Sea. Meaning "palm tree"; so called from palm trees abounding
near it.

[Ezekiel 47:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 47:22</span></span>

to the strangers--It is altogether unprecedented under the old covenant,
that "strangers" should have "inheritance" among the tribes. There would
not be room locally within Canaan for more than the tribes. The literal
sense must therefore be modified, as expressing that Gentiles are not to
be excluded from settling among the covenant-people, and that
spiritually their privileges are not to be less than those of Israel
([Rom 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md); [Eph
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011.md); [Rev
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md). Still, "sojourneth," in [Eze
47:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#023.md), implies that in Canaan, the
covenant people are regarded as at home, the strangers as settlers.
