### [Romans Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

[Romans 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 3:1</span></span>

JEWISH OBJECTIONS ANSWERED. ([Rom
3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001).md)

What advantage then hath the Jew?--that is, "If the final judgment will
turn solely on the state of the heart, and this may be as good in the
Gentile without, as in the Jew within, the sacred enclosure of God's
covenant, what better are we Jews for all our advantages?"

Answer:

[Romans 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 3:2</span></span>

Much every way; chiefly, because--rather, "first, that."

unto them were committed the oracles of God--This remarkable expression,
denoting "divine communications" in general, is transferred to the
Scriptures to express their oracular, divine, authoritative character.

[Romans 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 3:3</span></span>

For what if some did not believe?--It is the unbelief of the great body
of the nation which the apostle points at; but as it sufficed for his
argument to put the supposition thus gently, he uses this word "some" to
soften prejudice.

shall their unbelief make the faith of God--or, "faithfulness of God."

of none effect?--"nullify," "invalidate" it.

[Romans 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 3:4</span></span>

God forbid--literally, "Let it not be," that is, "Away with such a
thought"--a favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only
repudiate a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his
abhorrence of it. "The Scriptures do not authorize such a use of God's
name as must have been common among the English translators of the
Bible" \[HODGE\].

yea, let God be--held

true, and every man a liar--that is, even though it should follow from
this that every man is a liar.

when thou art judged--so in [Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md),
according to the Septuagint; but in the Hebrew and in our version, "when
thou judgest." The general sentiment, however, is the same in both--that
we are to vindicate the righteousness of God, at whatever expense to
ourselves.

[Romans 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 3:5</span></span>

But if, &c.--Another objection: "It would appear, then, that the more
faithless we are, so much the more illustrious will the fidelity of God
appear; and in that case, for Him to take vengeance on us for our
unfaithfulness would be (to speak as men profanely do) unrighteousness
in God."

Answer:

[Romans 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 3:6</span></span>

God forbid; for then how shall God judge the world?--that is, "Far from
us be such a thought; for that would strike down all future judgment.

[Romans 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 3:7</span></span>

For if the truth of God, &c.--A further illustration of the same
sentiment: that is, "Such reasoning amounts to this--which indeed we who
preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of
teaching--that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God;
a damnable principle." (Thus the apostle, instead of refuting this
principle, thinks it enough to hold it up to execration, as one that
shocks the moral sense).

On this brief section, Note (1) Mark the place here assigned to the
Scriptures. In answer to the question, "What advantage hath the Jew?"
or, "What profit is there of circumcision?" ([Rom
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001).md) those holding Romish views would
undoubtedly have laid the stress upon the priesthood, as the glory of
the Jewish economy. But in the apostle's esteem, "the oracles of God"
were the jewel of the ancient Church ([Rom
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001)). (2.md) God's eternal purposes and
man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by grace and the
unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been subjected to the
charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no truth which their
own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all the clouds and darkness which
in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the
truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid
down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the
sheet-anchor of our faith. "Let God be true, and every man a liar" ([Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004).md); and as many advocates of
salvation by grace as say, "Let us do evil that good may come," "their
damnation is just" ([Rom 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008).md).

[Romans 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 3:9</span></span>

THAT THE JEW IS SHUT UP UNDER LIKE CONDEMNATION WITH THE GENTILE IS
PROVED BY HIS OWN SCRIPTURE. ([Rom
3:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#009).md)

are we better than they?--"do we excel them?"

No, in no wise--Better off the Jews certainly were, for having the
oracles of God to teach them better; but as they were no better, that
only aggravated their guilt.

[Romans 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 3:10</span></span>

As it is written, &c.-- ([Psa 14:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md);
[Psa 53:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001).md). These statements of the
Psalmist were indeed suggested by particular manifestations of human
depravity occurring under his own eye; but as this only showed what man,
when unrestrained, is in his present condition, they were quite
pertinent to the apostle's purpose.

[Romans 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 3:13</span></span>

Their, &c.--From generals, the apostle here comes to particulars,
culling from different parts of Scripture passages which speak of
depravity as it affects the different members of the body; as if to show
more affectingly how "from the sole of the foot even to the head there
is no soundness" in us.

throat is an open sepulchre-- ([Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009).md); that is, "What proceeds out of
their heart, and finds vent in speech and action through the throat, is
like the pestilential breath of an open grave."

with their tongues they have used deceit-- ([Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009).md); that is, "That tongue which is
man's glory ([Psa 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#009.md); [Psa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#008).md) is prostituted to the purposes
of deception."

the poison of asps is under their lips-- ([Psa
140:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003).md): that is, "Those lips which
should 'drop as an honeycomb,' and 'feed many,' and 'give thanks unto
His name' ([Sol 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011.md); [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015).md), are employed to secrete and to
dart deadly poison."

[Romans 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 3:14</span></span>

Whose mouth, &c.-- ([Psa 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007).md): that
is, "That mouth which should be 'most sweet' ([Sol
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016).md), being 'set on fire of hell'
([Jam 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006).md), is filled with burning
wrath against those whom it should only bless."

[Romans 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 3:15</span></span>

Their feet are swift to shed blood-- ([Pro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#016.md); [Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007).md): that is, "Those feet, which
should 'run the way of God's commandments' ([Psa
119:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#032).md), are employed to conduct men
to deeds of darkest crime."

[Romans 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 3:16</span></span>

Destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace have they
not known--This is a supplementary statement about men's ways, suggested
by what had been said about the "feet," and expresses the mischief and
misery which men scatter in their path, instead of that peace which, as
strangers to it themselves, they cannot diffuse.

[Romans 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 3:18</span></span>

There is no fear of God before their eyes-- ([Psa
36:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#001).md): that is, "Did the eyes but 'see
Him who is invisible' ([Heb 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md), a
reverential awe of Him with whom we have to do would chasten every joy
and lift the soul out of its deepest depressions; but to all this the
natural man is a stranger." How graphic is this picture of human
depravity, finding its way through each several organ of the body into
the life ([Rom 3:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#013).md): but how small
a part of the "desperate wickedness" that is within ([Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009).md) "proceedeth out of the heart of
man!" ([Mar 7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021.md); [Psa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012).md).

[Romans 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 3:19</span></span>

Now we know that what . . . the law--that is, the Scriptures, considered
as a law of duty.

saith, it saith to them that are under the law--of course, therefore, to
the Jews.

that every mouth--opened in self-justification.

may be stopped, and all the world may become--that is, be seen to be,
and own itself.

guilty--and so condemned

before God.

[Romans 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 3:20</span></span>

Therefore by the deeds of--obedience to

the law there shall no flesh be justified--that is, be held and treated
as righteous; as is plain from the whole scope and strain of the
argument.

in his sight--at His bar ([Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002).md).

for by the law is the knowledge of sin--(See on [Rom
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015.md); [Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md); and [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004).md).

Note, How broad and deep does the apostle in this section lay the
foundations of his great doctrine of Justification by free grace--in the
disorder of man's whole nature, the consequent universality of human
guilt, the condemnation, by reason of the breach of divine law, of the
whole world, and the impossibility of justification before God by
obedience to that violated law! Only when these humiliating conclusions
are accepted and felt, are we in a condition to appreciate and embrace
the grace of the Gospel, next to be opened up.

[Romans 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 3:21</span></span>

GOD'S JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST, ALIKE
ADAPTED TO OUR NECESSITIES AND WORTHY OF HIMSELF. ([Rom
3:21-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021).md)

But now the righteousness of God--(See on [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md).

without the law--that is, a righteousness to which our obedience to the
law contributes nothing whatever ([Rom
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md); [Gal
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#016).md).

is manifested, being witnessed--attested.

by the law and the prophets--the Old Testament Scriptures. Thus this
justifying righteousness, though new, as only now fully disclosed, is an
old righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament.

[Romans 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 3:22</span></span>

by faith of--that is, "in"

Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe--that is, perhaps,
brought nigh "unto all" men the Gospel, and actually "upon all"
believing men, as theirs in possession \[LUTHER and others\]; but most
interpreters understand both statements" of believers as only a more
emphatic way of saying that all believers, without distinction or
exception, are put in possession of this gratuitous justification,
purely by faith in Christ Jesus.

for there is no difference.

[Romans 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 3:23</span></span>

for all have sinned--Though men differ greatly in the nature and extent
of their sinfulness, there is absolutely no difference between the best
and the worst of men, in the fact that "all have sinned," and so
underlie the wrath of God.

and come short of the glory--or "praise"

of God--that is, "have failed to earn His approbation" (compare [Joh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043), Greek.md). So the best
interpreters.

[Romans 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 3:24</span></span>

justified freely--without anything done on our part to deserve.

by his grace--His free love.

through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus--a most important clause;
teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a
mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a "Redemption," that is, "the
payment of a Ransom," in Christ's death. That this is the sense of the
word "redemption," when applied to Christ's death, will appear clear to
any impartial student of the passages where it occurs.

[Romans 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 3:25</span></span>

Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation--or "propitiatory
sacrifice."

through faith in his blood--Some of the best interpreters, observing
that "faith upon" is the usual phrase in Greek, not "faith in" Christ,
would place a "comma" after "faith," and understand the words as if
written thus: "to be a propitiation, in His blood, through faith." But
"faith in Christ" is used in [Gal 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026.md)
and [Eph 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015.md); and "faith in His
blood" is the natural and appropriate meaning here.

to declare his righteousness for the remission--rather, "pretermission"
or "passing by."

of sins--"the sins."

that are past--not the sins committed by the believer before he embraces
Christ, but the sins committed under the old economy, before Christ came
to "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."

through the forbearance of God--God not remitting but only forbearing to
punish them, or passing them by, until an adequate atonement for them
should be made. In thus not imputing them, God was righteous, but He was
not seen to be so; there was no "manifestation of His righteousness" in
doing so under the ancient economy. But now that God can "set forth"
Christ as a "propitiation for sin through faith in His blood," the
righteousness of His procedure in passing by the sins of believers
before, and in now remitting them, is "manifested," declared, brought
fully out to the view of the whole world. (Our translators have
unfortunately missed this glorious truth, taking "the sins that are
past" to mean the past sins of believers--committed before faith--and
rendering, by the word "remission," what means only a "passing by"; thus
making it appear that "remission of sins" is "through the forbearance of
God," which it certainly is not).

[Romans 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 3:26</span></span>

To declare . . . at this time--now for the first time, under the Gospel.

his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him that
believeth in Jesus--Glorious paradox! "Just in punishing," and "merciful
in pardoning," men can understand; but "just in justifying the guilty,"
startles them. But the propitiation through faith in Christ's blood
resolves the paradox and harmonizes the discordant elements. For in that
"God hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin," justice has full
satisfaction; and in that "we are made the righteousness of God in Him,"
mercy has her heart's delight!

Note, (1) One way of a sinner's justification is taught in the Old
Testament and in the New alike: only more dimly during the twilight of
Revelation; in unclouded light under "its perfect day" ([Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021)). (2.md) As there is no difference
in the need, so is there none in the liberty to appropriate the provided
salvation. The best need to be saved by faith in Jesus Christ; and the
worst only need that. On this common ground all saved sinners meet here,
and will stand for ever ([Rom
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022)). (3.md) It is on the atoning
blood of Christ, as the one propitiatory sacrifice which God hath set
forth to the eye of the guilty, that the faith of the convinced and
trembling sinner fastens for deliverance from wrath. Though he knows
that he is "justified freely, by God's grace," it is only because it is
"through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus" that he is able to find
peace and rest even in this ([Rom
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)). (4.md) The strictly accurate view
of believers under the Old Testament is not that of a company of
pardoned men, but of men whose sins, put up with and passed by in the
meantime, awaited a future expiation in the fulness of time ([Rom
3:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025.md); see on [Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md); [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md); [Heb
11:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#039).md).

[Romans 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 3:27</span></span>

INFERENCES FROM THE FOREGOING DOCTRINES AND AN OBJECTION ANSWERED. ([Rom
3:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027).md)

Where is boasting then? . . . excluded. By what law?--on what principle
or scheme?.

of works? Nay; but by the law of faith.

[Romans 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 3:28</span></span>

Therefore we conclude, &c.--It is the unavoidable tendency of dependence
upon our own works, less or more, for acceptance with God, to beget a
spirit of "boasting." But that God should encourage such a spirit in
sinners, by any procedure of His, is incredible. This therefore stamps
falsehood upon every form of "justification by works," whereas the
doctrine that.

Our faith receives a righteousness

That makes the sinner just,

manifestly and entirely excludes "boasting"; and this is the best
evidence of its truth.

Inference second: This and no other way of salvation is adapted alike to
Jew and Gentile.

[Romans 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 3:29</span></span>

Is he the God of the Jews only? &c.--The way of salvation must be one
equally suited to the whole family of fallen man: but the doctrine of
justification by faith is the only one that lays the basis of a
Universal Religion; this therefore is another mark of its truth.

[Romans 3:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 3:30</span></span>

it is one God who shall justify--"has unchangeably fixed that He shall
justify."

the circumcision by--"of"

faith, and the uncircumcision through faith--probably this is but a
varied statement of the same truth for greater emphasis (see [Rom
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022).md); though BENGEL thinks that the
justification of the Jews, as the born heirs of the promise, may be here
purposely said to be "of faith," while that of the Gentiles, previously
"strangers to the covenants of promise," may be said to be "through
faith," as thus admitted into a new family.

Objection:

[Romans 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 3:31</span></span>

Do we then make void the law through faith?--"Does this doctrine of
justification by faith, then, dissolve the obligation of the law? If so,
it cannot be of God. But away with such a thought, for it does just the
reverse."

God forbid: yea, we establish the law--It will be observed here, that,
important as was this objection, and opening up as it did so noble a
field for the illustration of the peculiar glory of the Gospel, the
apostle does no more here than indignantly repel it, intending at a
subsequent stage of his argument (Rom. 6:1-23) to resume and discuss it
at length.

Note, (1) It is a fundamental requisite of all true religion that it
tend to humble the sinner and exalt God; and every system which breeds
self-righteousness, or cherishes boasting, bears falsehood on its face
([Rom 3:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027)). (2.md) The fitness of the
Gospel to be a universal religion, beneath which the guilty of every
name and degree are invited and warranted to take shelter and repose, is
a glorious evidence of its truth ([Rom
3:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029)). (3.md) The glory of God's law,
in its eternal and immutable obligations, is then only fully apprehended
by the sinner, and then only is it enthroned in the depths of his soul,
when, believing that "He was made sin for him who knew no sin," he sees
himself "made the righteousness of God in Him" ([Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md). Thus do we not make void the
law through faith: yea, we establish the law. (4) This chapter, and
particularly the latter part of it, "is the proper seat of the Pauline
doctrine of Justification, and the grand proof-passage of the Protestant
doctrine of the Imputation of Christ's righteousness and of
Justification not on account of, but through faith alone" \[PHILIPPI\].
To make good this doctrine, and reseat it in the faith and affection of
the Church, was worth all the bloody struggles that it cost our fathers,
and it will be the wisdom and safety, the life and vigor of the
churches, to "stand fast in this liberty wherewith Christ hath made them
free, and not be again entangled"--in the very least degree--"with the
yoke of bondage" ([Gal 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).md).
