### [Titus Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001)

[Titus 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">tit 2:1</span></span>

DIRECTIONS TO TITUS: HOW TO EXHORT VARIOUS CLASSES OF BELIEVERS: THE
GRACE OF GOD IN CHRIST OUR GRAND INCENTIVE TO LIVE GODLY. ([Tit
2:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001))

But . . . thou--in contrast to the reprobate seducers stigmatized in
[Tit 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011), [Tit
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015). "He deals more in
exhortations, because those intent on useless questions needed chiefly
to be recalled to the study of a holy, moral life; for nothing so
effectually allays men's wandering curiosity, as the being brought to
recognize those duties in which they ought to exercise themselves"
\[CALVIN\].

speak--without restraint: contrast [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011), "mouths . . . stopped."

doctrine--"instruction" or "teaching."

[Titus 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">tit 2:2</span></span>

sober--Translated "vigilant," as sober men alone can be ([Ti1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002)). But "sober" here answers to "not
given to wine," [Tit 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003); [Tit
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007).

grave--"dignified"; behaving with reverent propriety.

temperate--"self-restrained"; "discreet" \[ALFORD\], ([Tit
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008); [Ti1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009)).

faith . . . charity \[love\] . . . patience--combined in [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011). "Faith, hope, charity" ([Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)). "Patience," Greek, "enduring
perseverance," is the attendant on, and is supported by, "hope" ([Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007); [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)). It is the grace which especially
becomes old men, being the fruit of ripened experience derived from
trials overcome ([Rom 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003)).

[Titus 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">tit 2:3</span></span>

behaviour--"deportment."

as becometh holiness--"as becometh women consecrated to God" \[WAHL\]:
being by our Christian calling priestesses unto God ([Eph
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003); [Ti1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010)). "Observant of sacred decorum"
\[BENGEL\].

not false accusers--not slanderers: a besetting sin of some elderly
women.

given to much wine--the besetting sin of the Cretans ([Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012)). Literally, "enslaved to much
wine." Addiction to wine is slavery ([Rom
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016); [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019)).

teachers--in private: not in public ([Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034); [Ti1
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011)); influencing for good the
younger women by precept and example.

[Titus 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">tit 2:4</span></span>

to be sober--Greek, "self-restrained," "discreet"; the same Greek as in
[Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002), "temperate." (But see on
[Tit 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002); compare Note, [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)). ALFORD therefore translates,
"That they school (admonish in their duty) the young women to be lovers
of their husbands," &c. (the foundation of all domestic happiness). It
was judicious that Titus, a young man, should admonish the young women,
not directly, but through the older women.

[Titus 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">tit 2:5</span></span>

keepers at home--as "guardians of the house," as the Greek expresses.
The oldest manuscripts read, "Workers at home": active in household
duties ([Pro 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#011); [Ti1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#013)).

good--kind, beneficent ([Mat 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015);
[Rom 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007); [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)). Not churlish and niggardly, but
thrifty as housewives.

obedient--rather "submissive," as the Greek is translated; (see on [Eph
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021); [Eph
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#024)).

their own--marking the duty of subjection which they owe them, as being
their own husbands ([Eph 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022); [Col
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#018)).

blasphemed--"evil spoken of." That no reproach may be cast on the
Gospel, through the inconsistencies of its professors ([Tit
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008), [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010); [Rom
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024); [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014); [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001)). "Unless we are virtuous,
blasphemy will come through us to the faith" \[THEOPHYLACT\].

[Titus 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">tit 2:6</span></span>

Young--Greek, "The younger men."

sober-minded--self-restrained \[ALFORD\]. "Nothing is so hard at this
age as to overcome pleasures and follies" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Titus 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">tit 2:7</span></span>

In--with respect to all things.

thyself a pattern--though but a young man thyself. All teaching is
useless unless the teacher's example confirm his word.

in doctrine--in thy ministerial teaching (showing) uncorruptness, that
is, untainted purity of motive on thy part (compare [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)), so as to be "a pattern" to all.
As "gravity," &c., refers to Titus himself, so "uncorruptness"; though,
doubtless, uncorruptness of the doctrine will be sure to follow as a
consequence of the Christian minister being of simple, uncorrupt
integrity himself.

gravity--dignified seriousness in setting forth the truth.

sincerity--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

[Titus 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">tit 2:8</span></span>

speech--discourse in public and private ministrations.

he that is of the contrary part--the adversary ([Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009); [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025)), whether he be heathen or Jew.

may be ashamed--put to confusion by the power of truth and innocence
(compare [Tit 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#005), [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010); [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014); [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001)).

no evil thing--in our acts, or demeanor.

of you--So one of the oldest manuscripts. Other very old manuscripts
read, "of US," Christians.

[Titus 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">tit 2:9</span></span>

servants--"slaves."

to please them well--"to give satisfaction" \[ALFORD\]. To be
complaisant in everything; to have that zealous desire to gain the
master's goodwill which will anticipate the master's wish and do even
more than is required. The reason for the frequent recurrence of
injunctions to slaves to subjection ([Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005), &c.; [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022); [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001), &c.; [Pe1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)) was, that in no rank was there
more danger of the doctrine of the spiritual equality and freedom of
Christians being misunderstood than in that of slaves. It was natural
for the slave who had become a Christian, to forget his place and put
himself on a social level with his master. Hence the charge for each to
abide in the sphere in which he was when converted ([Co1
7:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020)).

not answering again--in contradiction to the master: so the Greek, "not
contradicting" \[WAHL\].

[Titus 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">tit 2:10</span></span>

Not purloining--Greek, "Not appropriating" what does not belong to one.
It means "keeping back" dishonestly or deceitfully ([Act
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002)).

showing--manifesting in acts.

all--all possible.

good--really good; not so in mere appearance ([Eph
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005); [Col
3:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022)). "The heathen do not judge of
the Christian's doctrines from the doctrine, but from his actions and
life" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Men will write, fight, and even die for their
religion; but how few live for it! Translate, "That they may adorn the
doctrine of our Saviour God," that is, God the Father, the originating
author of salvation (compare Note, see on [Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001)). God deigns to have His
Gospel-doctrine adorned even by slaves, who are regarded by the world as
no better than beasts of burden. "Though the service be rendered to an
earthly master, the honor redounds to God, as the servant's goodwill
flows from the fear of God" \[THEOPHYLACT\]. Even slaves, low as is
their status, should not think the influence of their example a matter
of no consequence to religion: how much more those in a high position.
His love in being "our Saviour" is the strongest ground for our adorning
His doctrine by our lives. This is the force of "For" in [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011).

[Titus 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">tit 2:11</span></span>

the grace of God--God's gratuitous favor in the scheme of redemption.

hath appeared--Greek, "hath been made to appear," or "shine forth" ([Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002); [Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079)). "hath been manifested" ([Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004)), after having been long hidden in
the loving counsels of God ([Col 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026);
[Ti2 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)). The image is illustrated
in [Act 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#020). The grace of God hath
now been embodied in Jesus, the brightness of the Father's glory,"
manifested as the "Sun of righteousness," "the Word made flesh." The
Gospel dispensation is hence termed "the day" ([Th1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005), [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008); there is a double "appearing,"
that of "grace" here, that of "glory," [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013); compare [Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)). Connect it not as English
Version, but, "The grace . . . that bringeth salvation to all men hath
appeared," or "been manifested" ([Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004); [Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010)). Hence God is called "our
Saviour" ([Tit 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010)). The very name
Jesus means the same.

to all--of whom he enumerated the different classes ([Tit
2:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002)): even to servants; to us
Gentiles, once aliens from God. Hence arises our obligation to all men
([Tit 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#002)).

[Titus 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">tit 2:12</span></span>

Teaching--Greek, "disciplining us." Grace exercises discipline, and is
imparted in connection with disciplining chastisements ([Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032); [Heb
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006)). The education which the
Christian receives from "the grace" of God is a discipline often trying
to flesh and blood: just as children need disciplining. The discipline
which it exercises teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and
to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world (Greek,
"age," or course of things) where such self-discipline is needed, seeing
that its spirit is opposed to God ([Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012), [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016); [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020); [Co1
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018)): in the coming world we may
gratify every desire without need of self-discipline, because all
desires there will be conformable to the will of God.

that--Greek, "in order that"; the end of the "disciplining" is "in order
that . . . we may live soberly," &c. This point is lost by the
translation, "teaching us."

denying . . . lusts-- ([Luk 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023)). The
Greek aorist expresses "denying once for all." We deny "worldly lusts"
when we withhold our consent from them, when we refuse the delight which
they suggest, and the act to which they solicit us, nay, tear them up by
the roots out of our soul and mind \[ST. BERNARD, Sermon 11\].

worldly lusts--The Greek article expresses, "the lusts of the world,"
"all worldly lusts" \[ALFORD\], ([Gal
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016); [Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003); [Jo1
2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019)). The world (cosmos) will not
come to an end when this present age (aeon) or course of things shall
end.

live soberly, righteously, and godly--the positive side of the Christian
character; as "denying . . . lusts" was the negative. "Soberly," that
is, with self-restraint, in relation to one's self: "righteously" or
justly, in relation to our neighbor; "godly" or piously, in relation to
God (not merely amiably and justly, but something higher, godly, with
love and reverence toward God). These three comprise our "disciplining"
in faith and love, from which he passes to hope ([Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)).

[Titus 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">tit 2:13</span></span>

([Phi 3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)).

Looking for--with constant expectation (so the Greek) and with joy ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)). This will prove the antidote to
worldly lusts, and the stimulus to "live in this present world"
conformably to this expectation. The Greek is translated, "waiting for,"
in [Luk 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025).

that--Greek, "the."

blessed--bringing blessedness ([Rom
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007)).

hope--that is, object of hope ([Rom
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024); [Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005); [Col
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005)).

the glorious appearing--There is but one Greek article to both "hope"
and "appearing," which marks their close connection (the hope being
about to be realized only at the appearing of Christ). Translate, "The
blessed hope and manifestation (compare Note, see on [Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)) of the glory." The Greek for
"manifestation" is translated "brightness" in [Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008). As His "coming" (Greek,
"parousia") expresses the fact; so "brightness, appearing," or
"manifestation" (epiphaneia) expresses His personal visibility when He
shall come.

the great God and our Saviour Jesus--There is but one Greek article to
"God" and "Saviour," which shows that both are predicated of one and the
same Being. "Of Him who is at once the great God and our Saviour." Also
(2) "appearing" (epiphaneia) is never by Paul predicated of God the
Father ([Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)), or even of "His glory" (as
ALFORD explains it): it is invariably applied to CHRIST'S coming, to
which (at His first advent, compare [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)) the kindred verb "appeared"
(epephanee), [Tit 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011), refers ([Ti1
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001), [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)). Also (3) in the context ([Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014)) there is no reference to the
Father, but to Christ alone; and here there is no occasion for reference
to the Father in the exigencies of the context. Also (4) the expression
"great God," as applied to Christ, is in accordance with the context,
which refers to the glory of His appearing; just as "the true God" is
predicated of Christ, [Jo1 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020). The
phrase occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but often in the Old
Testament. [Deu 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021); [Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017), predicated of Jehovah, who, as
their manifested Lord, led the Israelites through the wilderness,
doubtless the Second Person in the Trinity. Believers now look for the
manifestation of His glory, inasmuch as they shall share in it. Even the
Socinian explanation, making "the great God" to be the Father, "our
Saviour," the Son, places God and Christ on an equal relation to "the
glory" of the future appearing: a fact incompatible with the notion that
Christ is not divine; indeed it would be blasphemy so to couple any mere
created being with God.

[Titus 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">tit 2:14</span></span>

gave himself--"The forcible 'Himself, His whole self, the greatest gift
ever given,' must not be overlooked."

for us--Greek, "in our behalf."

redeem us--deliver us from bondage by paying the price of His precious
blood. An appropriate image in addressing bond-servants ([Tit
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009)):

from all iniquity--the essence of sin, namely, "transgression of the
law": in bondage to which we were till then. The aim of His redemption
was to redeem us, not merely from the penalty, but from the being of all
iniquity. Thus he reverts to the "teaching" in righteousness, or
disciplining effect of the grace of God that bringeth salvation ([Tit
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)).

peculiar--peculiarly His own, as Israel was of old.

zealous--in doing and promoting "good works."

[Titus 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">tit 2:15</span></span>

with all authority--Translate, "authoritativeness" (compare "sharply,"
[Tit 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013)).

Let no man despise thee--Speak with such vigor as to command respect
([Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)). Warn them with such
authority that no one may think himself above (so the Greek literally)
the need of admonition \[TITTMANN, Greek Synonyms of the New
Testament\].
