### [3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001)

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg1 2:1</span></span>

DAVID DIES. ([Kg1 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#001))

David . . . charged Solomon his son--The charge recorded here was given
to Solomon just before his death and is different from the farewell
address delivered in public some time before ([Ch1
28:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#002)). It is introduced with great
solemnity.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg1 2:2</span></span>

I go the way of all the earth--a beautiful and impressive periphrasis
for death.

be thou strong, . . . show thyself a man--This counsel is similar to the
apostolic direction ([Co1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013)) and
refers to the fortitude or strength of mind that was required to
discharge the onerous functions of king.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg1 2:3</span></span>

keep the charge of the Lord thy God--that is, the divine law in all its
ceremonial as well as moral requirements. But particular reference was
intended to its political institutions, as it was only by strictly
maintaining the conduct that became the Hebrew monarch ([Deu
17:10-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#010)), that he would secure the
blessing of peace and prosperity to his reign (see on [Deu
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005); [Deu
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#010)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">kg1 2:4</span></span>

there shall not fail thee . . . a man on the throne of Israel--a
reference to the promise made to David of the sovereignty being vested
perpetually in his lineage ([Sa2
7:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011)), which was confirmed to
Solomon afterwards (see [Kg1 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#005)), and
repeated with reference to its spiritual meaning long after ([Jer
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#017)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg1 2:5</span></span>

thou knowest also what Joab . . . did--The insolent and imperious
conduct of that general had not only been deeply offensive to the
feelings ([Sa2 18:5-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#005); [Sa2
19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#005)), but calculated to bring
reproach on the character, to injure the prospects, and endanger the
throne of David. Passing over the injuries committed directly against
himself, David dwelt with strong feelings on the base assassination of
Abner and Amasa.

shed the blood of war in peace, &c.--The obvious meaning is, that in
peace he acted towards them as if they had been in a state of warfare;
but perhaps these graphic expressions might be designed to impress
Solomon's mind more strongly with a sense of the malice, treachery, and
cruelty by which those murders were characterized.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg1 2:6</span></span>

Do . . . according to thy wisdom--Joab's immense popularity with the
army required that any proceedings instituted against him should be
taken with great prudence and deliberation.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg1 2:8</span></span>

thou hast with thee Shimei--Though David promised him a pardon, which
being enforced by the presence of a thousand followers, could not have
been well refused, he warned his son against Shimei as a turbulent and
dangerous character. It must not be supposed that in these dying
instructions David was evincing a fierce, vindictive spirit. He is
rather to be considered as acting in the character of a king and
magistrate, in noticing crimes which he had not been in a condition to
punish, and pointing out persons of whom Solomon would be under a
necessity to rid himself as dangerous to the state. The grateful mention
of Barzillai's kindness \[[Kg1 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#007)\]
was, however, a personal feeling that does honor to the warmth of his
heart; and his silence as to Mephibosheth, the son of his beloved
Jonathan, would imply the previous death of that prince.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg1 2:9</span></span>

for thou art a wise man--Solomon had given early indications of wisdom
before his miraculous endowment with the heavenly gift (see [Kg1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#011)), and his own sagacity would
dictate the course that should be followed in any new offense that
Shimei might commit.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg1 2:10</span></span>

So David slept with his fathers--about six months after the coronation
of Solomon (compare [Sa2 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#005) with [Ch1
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#027)). The interval was spent in
developing his ideas and plans for the future glory of the kingdom and
providing for the permanent worship of God (see on [Ch1
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#001), and following).

was buried in the city of David--Sepulchres were not allowed within the
precincts of cities. Jerusalem, however, formed an exception; and yet,
even there, the privilege was reserved chiefly for the royal family
([Act 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#029)). Tradition says that the
bones of David repose on Mount Zion, and the minaret of a small mosque
points out the spot which tradition has fixed. His was a noble, a
wondrous, and a humbling history. He was a good man, yet his life was
deformed by various crimes of a very gross character. But there were
many bright and noble traits in his character; he was an earnest lover
of the divine law; his reign was signalized by many important services
that contributed to the glory of God and the exaltation of His kingdom;
and his name, as the sweet Psalmist of Israel, will be held in honor to
the latest age of the Church.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg1 2:12</span></span>

SOLOMON SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Kg1 2:12-24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#012))

Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father--His ascension to
the royal dignity was made under the happiest auspices. Having been born
after his father became monarch of the whole kingdom, his claim,
according to the notions of Oriental people, was preferable to that of
all, even his elder brothers. The Hebrew kingdom enjoyed internal
prosperity; it was respected and renowned abroad, and Solomon well knew
how to improve these advantages.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg1 2:13</span></span>

Adonijah . . . came to Bath-sheba--Her question to him betrays an
apprehension which his recent conduct might well warrant; but his pious
acknowledgment of the divine will seemed apparently to indicate so
entire an acquiescence in the settlement of the succession \[[Kg1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#015)\], that, in her womanly
simplicity, she perceived not the deep cunning and evil design that was
concealed under his request and readily undertook to promote his wishes.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg1 2:19</span></span>

Bath-sheba . . . went unto King Solomon--The filial reverence and the
particular act of respect, which Solomon rendered, were quite in
accordance with the sentiments and customs of the East. The right hand
is the place of honor; and as it expressly said to have been assigned to
"the king's mother," it is necessary to remark that, when a husband
dies, his widow acquires a higher dignity and power, as a mother over
her son, than she ever possessed before. Besides, the dignity of "king's
mother" is a state office, to which certain revenues are attached. The
holder has a separate palace or court, as well as possesses great
influence in public affairs; and as the dignity is held for life, it
sometimes happens, in consequence of deaths, that the person enjoying it
may not be related to the reigning sovereign by natural maternity.
Bath-sheba had evidently been invested with this honorable office.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg1 2:22</span></span>

why dost thou ask Abishag . . . ask for him the kingdom also--(See on
[Sa2 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#005); also see on [Sa2
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#008)). Solomon's indignation was
roused; he in a moment penetrated the artful scheme, and from his
associating the names of Abiathar and Joab, he seems to have suspected
or known that those deep schemers had been the prompters of Adonijah.

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg1 2:23</span></span>

God do so to me, and more also--the common form of introducing a solemn
oath.

if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life--Whether
there was a treasonable design to conceal under this request or not, the
act, according to Eastern notions, was criminal, and of dangerous
consequence to the state. There is no ground of censure upon Solomon for
cruelty or precipitation in this instance. He had pardoned Adonijah's
former conspiracy; but this new attempt was rebellion against the
viceroy appointed by the divine King and called for condign punishment.
The office of executioner was among the Hebrews, as in other ancient
countries of the East, performed unceremoniously and privately--often
without any previous warning--by the captain of the guard, or one of his
officers ([Mat 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#010)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg1 2:26</span></span>

unto Abiathar the priest said the king--This functionary, as the
counsellor or accomplice of Adonijah, had deserved to share his fate.
But partly from regard to his priestly dignity, and partly from his long
associations with the late king, Solomon pronounced on him the mitigated
sentence of banishment to his country estate at Anathoth, and thereby,
as God's vicegerent, deprived him of his office and its emoluments. The
sacred writer notices the remarkable fulfilment, Abiathar's degradation
from the high priesthood (see on [Kg1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#004)), of the doom denounced against
the house of Eli ([Sa1 2:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#030)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">kg1 2:28</span></span>

JOAB SLAIN. (1Ki. 2:28-45)

Then tidings came to Joab--The execution of these sentences respectively
on Adonijah and Abiathar prepared Joab for his fate. Death, due to his
great crimes ([Num 35:33](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#033)), would long
ago have been inflicted, had not his power and popularity with the army
been too formidable for the old king. He now fled to the altar, which,
though a recognized asylum, afforded no sanctuary to the rebel and
murderer ([Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014)). And, as he
refused to leave it, he seems to have cherished some faint hope that a
religious scruple would have been felt at the thought of violating the
sanctity of the place by bloodshed. Benaiah, not liking to assume any
responsibility, referred the matter to Solomon, who determined that the
law should take its course ([Deu
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#013)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">kg1 2:33</span></span>

Their blood shall . . . return upon the head of Joab, &c.--A reference
is here made to the curse publicly and solemnly pronounced by King David
([Sa2 3:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#028)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg1 2:34</span></span>

SHIMEI PUT TO DEATH. ([Kg1 2:34-46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#034))

Benaiah . . . went up, and fell upon him--According to the terms of the
statute ([Exo 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#014)), and the practice
in similar cases ([Kg2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#015)), the
criminal was to be dragged from the altar and slain elsewhere. But the
truth is, that the sanctity of the altar was violated as much by the
violence used in forcing the criminal from the place as in shedding his
blood there; the express command of God authorized the former and
therefore by implication permitted the latter.

was buried in his own house--or family vault, at his property in the
wilderness of Judah. His interment was included in the king's order, as
enjoined in the divine law ([Deu
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)).

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">kg1 2:36</span></span>

the king sent and called for Shimei--He was probably residing at
Bahurim, his native place. But, as he was a suspicious character,
Solomon condemned him henceforth to live in Jerusalem, on the penalty of
death, for going without the gates. He submitted to this confinement for
three years, when, violating his oath, he was arrested and put to death
by Solomon for perjury, aggravated by his former crime of high treason
against David \[[Kg1 2:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#042)\].

[3 Kings (1 Kings) 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">kg1 2:46</span></span>

the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon--Now, by the death of
Shimei, all the leaders of the rival factions had been cut off.
