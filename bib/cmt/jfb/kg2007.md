[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 7:1</span></span>

ELISHA PROPHESIES INCREDIBLE PLENTY IN SAMARIA. (2Ki. 7:1-16)

Hear ye the word of the Lord--This prediction, though uttered first to
the assembled elders, was intimated to the king's messengers, who
reported it to Jehoram ([Kg2 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#018).md).

To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a
shekel, &c.--This may be estimated at a peck of fine flour for 2s. 6d.,
and two pecks of barley at the same price.

in the gate of Samaria--Vegetables, cattle, all sorts of country
produce, are still sold every morning at the gates of towns in the East.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 7:2</span></span>

a lord on whose hand the king leaned--When an Eastern king walks or
stands abroad in the open air, he always supports himself on the arm of
the highest courtier present.

if the Lord would make windows in heaven--The scoffing infidelity of
this remark, which was a sneer against not the prophet only, but the God
he served, was justly and signally punished (see [Kg2
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#020).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 7:3</span></span>

there were four leprous men--The account of the sudden raising of the
siege and the unexpected supply given to the famishing inhabitants of
Samaria, is introduced by a narrative of the visit and discovery, by
these poor creatures, of the extraordinary flight of the Syrians.

leprous men at the entering in of the gate--living, perhaps, in some
lazar house there ([Lev 13:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#004.md); [Num
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#003).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 7:5</span></span>

they rose up in the twilight--that is, the evening twilight ([Kg2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012).md).

the uttermost part of the camp of Syria--that is, the extremity nearest
the city.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 7:6</span></span>

the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots--This illusion of the sense of hearing, whereby the besiegers
imagined the tramp of two armies from opposite quarters, was a great
miracle which God wrought directly for the deliverance of His people.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 7:8</span></span>

these lepers . . . did eat and drink--After they had appeased their
hunger and secreted as many valuables as they could carry, their
consciences smote them for concealing the discovery and they hastened to
publish it in the city.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 7:10</span></span>

horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were--The uniform
arrangement of encampments in the East is to place the tents in the
center, while the cattle are picketed all around, as an outer wall of
defense; and hence the lepers describe the cattle as the first objects
they saw.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">kg2 7:12</span></span>

the king . . . said unto his servants, I will now show you what the
Syrians have done--Similar stratagems have been so often resorted to in
the ancient and modern wars of the East that there is no wonder
Jehoram's suspicions were awakened. But the scouts, whom he despatched,
soon found unmistakable signs of the panic that had struck the enemy and
led to a most precipitate flight.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">kg2 7:17</span></span>

THE UNBELIEVING LORD TRODDEN TO DEATH. ([Kg2
7:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#017).md)

the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned,--&c. The news
spread like lightning through the city, and was followed, as was
natural, by a popular rush to the Syrian camp. To keep order at the
gate, the king ordered his minister to keep guard; but the impetuosity
of the famishing people could not be resisted. The lord was trodden to
death, and Elisha's prophecy in all respects accomplished.
