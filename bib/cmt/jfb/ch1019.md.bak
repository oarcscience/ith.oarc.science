### [1 Chronicles Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 19:1</span></span>

DAVID'S MESSENGERS, SENT TO COMFORT HANUN, ARE DISGRACEFULLY TREATED.
([Ch1 19:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#001).md)

after this--This phrase seems to indicate that the incident now to be
related took place immediately, or soon after the wars described in the
preceding chapter. But the chronological order is loosely observed, and
the only just inference that can be drawn from the use of this phrase
is, that some farther account is to be given of the wars against the
Syrians.

Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died--There had subsisted a
very friendly relation between David and him, begun during the exile of
the former, and cemented, doubtless, by their common hostility to Saul.

[1 Chronicles 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 19:3</span></span>

are not his servants come unto thee for to search?--that is, thy
capital, Rabbah ([Sa2 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#003).md).

[1 Chronicles 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 19:4</span></span>

shaved them--not completely, but only the half of their face. This
disrespect to the beard, and indecent exposure of their persons by their
clothes being cut off from the girdle downwards, was the grossest
indignity to which Jews, in common with all Orientals, could be
subjected. No wonder that the men were ashamed to appear in public--that
the king recommended them to remain in seclusion on the border till the
mark of their disgrace had disappeared--and then they might, with
propriety, return to the court.

[1 Chronicles 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 19:6</span></span>

JOAB AND ABISHAI OVERCOME THE AMMONITES. ([Ch1
19:6-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#006).md)

when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to
David--One universal feeling of indignation was roused throughout
Israel, and all classes supported the king in his determination to
avenge this unprovoked insult on the Hebrew nation.

Hanun . . . sent a thousand talents of silver--a sum equal to Â£342,100,
to procure the services of foreign mercenaries.

chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia . . . Syria-maachah, and . . .
Zobah--The Mesopotamian troops did not arrive during this campaign ([Ch1
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016).md). Syria-maachah lay on the north
of the possessions of the trans-jordanic Israelites, near Gilead.

Zobah--(see on [Ch1 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#003).md).

[1 Chronicles 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 19:7</span></span>

So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots--Hebrew, "riders," or
"cavalry," accustomed to fight either on horseback or in chariots, and
occasionally on foot. Accepting this as the true rendering, the number
of hired auxiliaries mentioned in this passage agrees exactly with the
statement in [Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006.md) : twenty
thousand (from Syria), twelve thousand (from Tob), equal to thirty-two
thousand, and one thousand with the king of Maachah.

[1 Chronicles 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 19:8</span></span>

David . . . sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men--All the
forces of Israel, including the great military orders, were engaged in
this war.

[1 Chronicles 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch1 19:9</span></span>

children of Ammon . . . put the battle in array before the gate of the
city--that is, outside the walls of Medeba, a frontier town on the
Arnon.

the kings that were come were by themselves in the field--The
Israelitish army being thus beset by the Ammonites in front, and by the
Syrian auxiliaries behind, Joab resolved to attack the latter (the more
numerous and formidable host), while he directed his brother Abishai,
with a suitable detachment, to attack the Ammonites. Joab's address
before the engagement displays the faith and piety that became a
commander of the Hebrew people. The mercenaries being defeated, the
courage of the Ammonites failed; so that, taking flight, they entrenched
themselves within the fortified walls.

[1 Chronicles 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 19:16</span></span>

SHOPHACH SLAIN BY DAVID. ([Ch1
19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#016).md)

And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
Israel--(See on [Sa2 10:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#015).md).

[1 Chronicles 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch1 19:18</span></span>

David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men--(Compare [Sa2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md), which has seven hundred
chariots). Either the text in one of the books is corrupt \[KEIL,
DAVIDSON\], or the accounts must be combined, giving this result--seven
thousand horsemen, seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen
\[KENNICOTT, HOUBIGANT, CALMET\].
