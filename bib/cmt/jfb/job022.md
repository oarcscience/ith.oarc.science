### [Job Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)

[Job 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 22:1</span></span>

AS BEFORE, ELIPHAZ BEGINS. (Job 22:1-30)

Eliphaz shows that man's goodness does not add to, or man's badness take
from, the happiness of God; therefore it cannot be that God sends
prosperity to some and calamities on others for His own advantage; the
cause of the goods and ills sent must lie in the men themselves ([Psa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002); [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010); [Act
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#025); [Ch1
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#014)). So Job's calamities must arise
from guilt. Eliphaz, instead of meeting the facts, tries to show that it
could not be so.

[Job 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 22:2</span></span>

as he that is wise--rather, yea the pious man profiteth himself. So
"understanding" or "wise"--pious ([Dan
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003), [Dan
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#010); [Psa
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002)) \[MICHAELIS\].

[Job 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 22:3</span></span>

pleasure--accession of happiness; God has pleasure in man's
righteousness ([Psa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007)), but He is
not dependent on man's character for His happiness.

[Job 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 22:4</span></span>

Is the punishment inflicted on thee from fear of thee, in order to
disarm thee? as Job had implied (see on [Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012); [Job
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020); and [Job
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#017)).

will he enter . . . into judgment?-- Job had desired this ([Job
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#003), [Job
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#021)). He ought rather to have spoken
as in [Psa 143:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002).

[Job 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 22:5</span></span>

Heretofore Eliphaz had only insinuated, now he plainly asserts Job's
guilt, merely on the ground of his sufferings.

[Job 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 22:6</span></span>

The crimes alleged, on a harsh inference, by Eliphaz against Job are
such as he would think likely to be committed by a rich man. The Mosaic
law ([Exo 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026); [Deu
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010)) subsequently embodied the
feeling that existed among the godly in Job's time against oppression of
debtors as to their pledges. Here the case is not quite the same; Job is
charged with taking a pledge where he had no just claim to it; and in
the second clause, that pledge (the outer garment which served the poor
as a covering by day and a bed by night) is represented as taken from
one who had not "changes of raiment" (a common constituent of wealth in
the East), but was poorly clad--"naked" ([Mat
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#036); [Jam
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#015)); a sin the more heinous in a
rich man like Job.

[Job 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 22:7</span></span>

Hospitality to the weary traveller is regarded in the East as a primary
duty ([Isa 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#014)).

[Job 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 22:8</span></span>

mighty--Hebrew, "man of arm" ([Psa
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#015); namely, Job).

honourable--Hebrew, "eminent, or, accepted for countenance" ([Isa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#003); [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001)); that is, possessing authority.
Eliphaz repeats his charge ([Job
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#028); so Zophar, [Job
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#019)), that it was by violence Job
wrung houses and lands from the poor, to whom now he refused relief
([Job 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#007), [Job
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009)) \[MICHAELIS\].

[Job 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 22:9</span></span>

empty--without their wants being relieved ([Gen
31:42](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#042)). The Mosaic law especially
protected the widow and fatherless ([Exo
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022)); the violation of it in their
case by the great is a complaint of the prophets ([Isa
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017)).

arms--supports, helps, on which one leans ([Hos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015)). Thou hast robbed them of their
only stay. Job replies in [Job
29:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011).

[Job 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 22:10</span></span>

snares--alluding to Job's admission ([Job
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#006); compare [Job
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#010); [Pro
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005)).

[Job 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 22:11</span></span>

that--so that thou.

abundance--floods. Danger by floods is a less frequent image in this
book than in the rest of the Old Testament ([Job
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#016); [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020)).

[Job 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 22:12</span></span>

Eliphaz says this to prove that God can from His height behold all
things; gratuitously inferring that Job denied it, because he denied
that the wicked are punished here.

height--Hebrew, "head of the stars"; that is, "elevation" ([Job
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#008)).

[Job 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 22:13</span></span>

Rather, And yet thou sayest, God does not concern Himself with ("know")
human affairs ([Psa 73:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#011)).

[Job 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 22:14</span></span>

in the circuit of heaven--only, not taking any part in earthly affairs.
Job is alleged as holding this Epicurean sentiment ([Lam
3:44](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#044); [Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015); [Isa
40:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#027); [Jer
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024); [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012); [Psa
139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012)).

[Job 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 22:15</span></span>

marked--Rather, Dost thou keep to? that is, wish to follow (so Hebrew,
[Sa2 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#022)). If so, beware of sharing
their end.

the old way--the degenerate ways of the world before the flood ([Gen
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005)).

[Job 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 22:16</span></span>

cut down--rather, "fettered," as in [Job
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#008); that is, arrested by death.

out of time--prematurely, suddenly ([Job
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#032); [Ecc
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#017)); literally, "whose foundation
was poured out (so as to become) a stream or flood." The solid earth
passed from beneath their feet into a flood ([Gen
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011)).

[Job 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 22:17</span></span>

Eliphaz designedly uses Job's own words ([Job
21:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#014)).

do for them--They think they can do everything for themselves.

[Job 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 22:18</span></span>

"Yet" you say (see on [Job 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016)) that
it is "He who filled their houses with good"--"their good is not in
their hand," but comes from God.

but the counsel . . . is--rather, "may the counsel be," &c. Eliphaz
sarcastically quotes in continuation Job's words ([Job
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#016)). Yet, after uttering this
godless sentiment, thou dost hypocritically add, "May the counsel," &c.

[Job 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 22:19</span></span>

Triumph of the pious at the fall of the recent followers of the
antediluvian sinners. While in the act of denying that God can do them
any good or harm, they are cut off by Him. Eliphaz hereby justifies
himself and the friends for their conduct to Job: not derision of the
wretched, but joy at the vindication of God's ways ([Psa
107:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#042); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003); [Rev
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007); [Rev
19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001)).

[Job 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 22:20</span></span>

The triumphant speech of the pious. If "substance" be retained,
translate, rather as the Septuagint, "Has not their substance been taken
away, and . . . ?" But the Hebrew is rather, "Truly our adversary is cut
down" \[GESENIUS\]. The same opposition exists between the godly and
ungodly seed as between the unfallen and restored Adam and Satan
(adversary); this forms the groundwork of the book (Job 1:1-2:13; [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015)).

remnant--all that "is left" of the sinner; repeated from [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026), which makes UMBREIT'S rendering
"glory" (Margin), "excellency," less probable.

fire--alluding to Job ([Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016); [Job
15:34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#034); [Job
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015)). First is mentioned destruction
by water ([Job 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#016)); here, by fire
([Pe2 3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005)).

[Job 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 22:21</span></span>

Eliphaz takes it for granted, Job is not yet "acquainted" with God;
literally, "become a companion of God." Turn with familiar confidence to
God.

and be--So thou shalt be: the second imperatively expresses the
consequence of obeying the first ([Psa
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027)).

peace--prosperity and restoration to Job; true spiritually also to us
([Rom 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001); [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)).

good-- ([Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)).

[Job 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 22:22</span></span>

lay up-- ([Psa 119:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#011)).

[Job 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 22:23</span></span>

Built up--anew, as a restored house.

thou shalt put away--rather, "If thou put away" \[MICHAELIS\].

[Job 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 22:24</span></span>

Rather, containing the protasis from the last clause of [Job
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#023), "If thou regard the glittering
metal as dust"; literally, "lay it on on the dust"; to regard it of as
little value as the dust on which it lies. The apodosis is at [Job
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025), Then shall the Almighty be, &c.
God will take the place of the wealth, in which thou didst formerly
trust.

gold--rather, "precious" or "glittering metal," parallel to "(gold) of
Ophir," in the second clause \[UMBREIT and MAURER\].

Ophir--derived from a Hebrew word "dust," namely, gold dust. HEEREN
thinks it a general name for the rich countries of the South, on the
African, Indian, and especially the Arabian coast (where was the port
Aphar. El Ophir, too, a city of Oman, was formerly the center of Arabian
commerce). It is curious that the natives of Malacca still call their
mines Ophirs.

stones of the brooks--If thou dost let the gold of Ophir remain in its
native valley among the stones of the brooks; that is, regard it as of
little worth as the stones, &c. The gold was washed down by mountain
torrents and lodged among the stones and sand of the valley.

[Job 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 22:25</span></span>

Apodosis.

Yea--rather, Then shall the Almighty be, &c.

defence--rather, as the same Hebrew means in [Job
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024) (see on [Job
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024)) --Thy precious metals; God will
be to thee in the place of riches.

plenty of silver--rather, "And shall be to thee in the place of
laboriously-obtained treasures of silver" \[GESENIUS\]. Elegantly
implying, it is less labor to find God than the hidden metals; at least
to the humble seeker (Job 28:12-28). But \[MAURER\] "the shining
silver."

[Job 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 22:26</span></span>

lift up . . . face, &c.--repeated from Zophar ([Job
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#015)).

[Job 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 22:27</span></span>

([Isa 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009), [Isa
58:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#014)).

pay thy vows--which thou hast promised to God in the event of thy
prayers being heard: God will give thee occasion to pay the former, by
hearing the latter.

[Job 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 22:28</span></span>

light--success.

[Job 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 22:29</span></span>

Rather, When (thy ways; from [Job
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028)) are cast down (for a time),
thou shalt (soon again have joyful cause to) say, There is lifting up
(prosperity returns back to me) \[MAURER\].

he--God.

humble--Hebrew, "him that is of low eyes." Eliphaz implies that Job is
not so now in his affliction; therefore it continues: with this he
contrasts the blessed effect of being humble under it ([Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005) probably quote this passage).
Therefore it is better, I think, to take the first clause as referred to
by "God resisteth the proud." When (men) are cast down, thou shalt say
(behold the effects of) pride. Eliphaz hereby justifies himself for
attributing Job's calamities to his pride. "Giveth grace to the humble,"
answers to the second clause.

[Job 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 22:30</span></span>

island--that is, "dwelling." But the Hebrew expresses the negative ([Sa1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#021)); translate "Thus He (God) shall
deliver him who was not guiltless," namely, one, who like Job himself on
conversion shall be saved, but not because he was, as Job so constantly
affirms of himself, guiltless, but because he humbles himself ([Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029)); an oblique attack on Job, even
to the last.

and it--Rather, "he (the one not heretofore guiltless) shall be
delivered through the purity (acquired since conversion) of thy hands";
by thy intercession (as [Gen 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#026),
&c.). \[MAURER\]. The irony is strikingly exhibited in Eliphaz
unconsciously uttering words which exactly answer to what happened at
last: he and the other two were "delivered" by God accepting the
intercession of Job for them ([Job
42:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007)).
