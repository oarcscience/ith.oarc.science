### [Job Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md)

[Job 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 30:1</span></span>

(Job 30:1-31)

younger--not the three friends ([Job
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010.md); [Job
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004.md), [Job
32:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006).md). A general description: [Job
30:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md), the lowness of the persons who
derided him; [Job 30:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009.md), the
derision itself. Formerly old men rose to me ([Job
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008).md). Now not only my juniors, who
are bound to reverence me ([Lev
19:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032).md), but even the mean and
base-born actually deride me; opposed to, "smiled upon" ([Job
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024).md). This goes farther than even
the "mockery" of Job by relations and friends ([Job
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004.md); [Job
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010.md), [Job
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020.md); [Job
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002.md), [Job
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006.md); [Job
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022).md). Orientals feel keenly any
indignity shown by the young. Job speaks as a rich Arabian emir, proud
of his descent.

dogs--regarded with disgust in the East as unclean ([Sa1
17:43](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043.md); [Pro
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011).md). They are not allowed to enter
a house, but run about wild in the open air, living on offal and chance
morsels ([Psa 59:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014).md). Here again we
are reminded of Jesus Christ ([Psa
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016).md). "Their fathers, my coevals,
were so mean and famished that I would not have associated them with
(not to say, set them over) my dogs in guarding my flock."

[Job 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 30:2</span></span>

If their fathers could be of no profit to me, much less the sons, who
are feebler than their sires; and in whose case the hope of attaining
old age is utterly gone, so puny are they ([Job
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026).md) \[MAURER\]. Even if they had
"strength of hands," that could be now of no use to me, as all I want in
my present affliction is sympathy.

[Job 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 30:3</span></span>

solitary--literally, "hard as a rock"; so translate, rather, "dried up,"
emaciated with hunger. Job describes the rudest race of Bedouins of the
desert \[UMBREIT\].

fleeing--So the Septuagint. Better, as Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate,
"gnawers of the wilderness." What they gnaw follows in [Job
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004.md).

in former time--literally, the "yesternight of desolation and waste"
(the most utter desolation; [Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014).md); that is, those deserts
frightful as night to man, and even there from time immemorial. I think
both ideas are in the words darkness \[GESENIUS\] and antiquity
\[UMBREIT\]. ([Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033), Margin.md).

[Job 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 30:4</span></span>

mallows--rather, "salt-wort," which grows in deserts and is eaten as a
salad by the poor \[MAURER\].

by the bushes--among the bushes.

juniper--rather, a kind of broom, Spartium junceum \[LINNÃ†US\], still
called in Arabia, as in the Hebrew of Job, retem, of which the bitter
roots are eaten by the poor.

[Job 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 30:5</span></span>

they cried--that is, "a cry is raised." Expressing the contempt felt for
this race by civilized and well-born Arabs. When these wild vagabonds
make an incursion on villages, they are driven away, as thieves would
be.

[Job 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 30:6</span></span>

They are forced "to dwell."

cliffs of the valleys--rather, "in the gloomy valleys"; literally, "in
the gloom of the valleys," or wadies. To dwell in valleys is, in the
East, a mark of wretchedness. The troglodytes, in parts of Arabia, lived
in such dwellings as caves.

[Job 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 30:7</span></span>

brayed--like the wild ass ([Job 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005.md)
for food). The inarticulate tones of this uncivilized rabble are but
little above those of the beast of the field.

gathered together--rather, sprinkled here and there. Literally, "poured
out," graphically picturing their disorderly mode of encampment, lying
up and down behind the thorn bushes.

nettles--or brambles \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 30:8</span></span>

fools--that is, the impious and abandoned ([Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025).md).

base--nameless, low-born rabble.

viler than, &c.--rather, they were driven or beaten out of the land. The
Horites in Mount Seir ([Gen 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006.md) with
which compare [Gen 36:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020.md); [Deu
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012.md), [Deu
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022).md) were probably the aborigines,
driven out by the tribe to which Job's ancestors belonged; their name
means troglodytÃ&brvbr;, or "dwellers in caves." To these Job alludes
here ([Job 30:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md), and [Gen
24:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004), which compare together.md).

[Job 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 30:9</span></span>

([Job 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006).md). Strikingly similar to the
derision Jesus Christ underwent ([Lam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014.md); [Psa
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012).md). Here Job returns to the
sentiment in [Job 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001.md). It is to such
I am become a song of "derision."

[Job 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 30:10</span></span>

in my face--rather, refrain not to spit in deliberate contempt before my
face. To spit at all in presence of another is thought in the East
insulting, much more so when done to mark "abhorrence." Compare the
further insult to Jesus Christ ([Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Mat
26:67](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067).md).

[Job 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 30:11</span></span>

He--that is, "God"; antithetical to "they"; English Version here follows
the marginal reading (Keri).

my cord--image from a bow unstrung; opposed to [Job
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#020). The text (Chetib.md), "His cord"
or "reins" is better; "yea, each lets loose his reins" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 30:12</span></span>

youth--rather, a (low) brood. To rise on the right hand is to accuse, as
that was the position of the accuser in court ([Zac
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md); [Psa
109:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006).md).

push . . . feet--jostle me out of the way ([Job
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004).md).

ways of--that is, their ways of (that is, with a view to my)
destruction. Image, as in [Job 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#012.md),
from a besieging army throwing up a way of approach for itself to a
city.

[Job 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 30:13</span></span>

Image of an assailed fortress continued. They tear up the path by which
succor might reach me.

set forward-- ([Zac 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015).md).

they have no helper--Arabic proverb for contemptible persons. Yet even
such afflict Job.

[Job 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 30:14</span></span>

waters--(So [Sa2 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020).md). But it is
better to retain the image of [Job
30:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012.md). "They came \[upon me\] as
through a wide breach," namely, made by the besiegers in the wall of a
fortress ([Isa 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013).md) \[MAURER\].

in the desolation--"Amidst the crash" of falling masonry, or "with a
shout like the crash" of, &c.

[Job 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 30:15</span></span>

they--terrors.

soul--rather, "my dignity" \[UMBREIT\].

welfare--prosperity.

cloud-- ([Job 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#009.md); [Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022).md).

[Job 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 30:16</span></span>

Job's outward calamities affect his mind.

poured out--in irrepressible complaints ([Psa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md); [Jos
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#005).md).

[Job 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 30:17</span></span>

In the Hebrew, night is poetically personified, as in [Job
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md) : "night pierceth my bones (so
that they fall) from me" (not as English Version, "in me"; see [Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030).md).

sinews--so the Arabic, "veins," akin to the Hebrew; rather, "gnawers"
(see on [Job 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003).md), namely, my gnawing
pains never cease. Effects of elephantiasis.

[Job 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 30:18</span></span>

of my disease--rather, "of God" ([Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006).md).

garment changed--from a robe of honor to one of mourning, literally
([Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008.md); [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md) and metaphorically \[UMBREIT\].
Or rather, as SCHUTTENS, following up [Job
30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017.md), My outer garment is changed
into affliction; that is, affliction has become my outer garment; it
also bindeth me fast round (my throat) as the collar of the inner coat;
that is, it is both my inner and outer garment. Observe the distinction
between the inner and outer garments. The latter refers to his
afflictions from without ([Job
30:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001).md); the former his personal
afflictions ([Job 30:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014).md). UMBREIT
makes "God" subject to "bindeth," as in [Job
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019.md).

[Job 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 30:19</span></span>

God is poetically said to do that which the mourner had done to himself
([Job 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008).md). With lying in the ashes he
had become, like them, in dirty color.

[Job 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 30:20</span></span>

stand up--the reverential attitude of a suppliant before a king ([Kg1
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#014.md); [Luk
18:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011).md).

not--supplied from the first clause. But the intervening affirmative
"stand" makes this ellipsis unlikely. Rather, as in [Job
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009.md) (not only dost thou refuse aid to
me "standing" as a suppliant, but), thou dost regard me with a frown:
eye me sternly.

[Job 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 30:22</span></span>

liftest . . . to wind--as a "leaf" or "stubble" ([Job
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#025).md). The moving pillars of sand,
raised by the wind to the clouds, as described by travellers, would
happily depict Job's agitated spirit, if it be to them that he alludes.

dissolvest . . . substance--The marginal Hebrew reading (Keri), "my
wealth," or else "wisdom," that is, sense and spirit, or "my hope of
deliverance." But the text (Chetib) is better: Thou dissolvest me (with
fear, [Exo 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015).md) in the crash (of the
whirlwind; see on [Job 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014).md)
\[MAURER\]. UMBREIT translates as a verb, "Thou terrifiest me."

[Job 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 30:23</span></span>

This shows [Job 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md) cannot be
restricted to Job's hope of a temporal deliverance.

death--as in [Job 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#022.md), the realm of
the dead ([Heb 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md); [Gen
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md).

[Job 30:24](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 30:24</span></span>

Expressing Job's faith as to the state after death. Though one must go
to the grave, yet He will no more afflict in the ruin of the body (so
Hebrew for "grave") there, if one has cried to Him when being destroyed.
The "stretching of His hand" to punish after death answers
antithetically to the raising "the cry" of prayer in the second clause.
MAURER gives another translation which accords with the scope of [Job
30:24-31](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024.md); if it be natural for one in
affliction to ask aid, why should it be considered (by the friends)
wrong in my case? "Nevertheless does not a man in ruin stretch out his
hand" (imploring help, [Job 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020.md);
[Lam 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017).md)? If one be in his calamity
(destruction) is there not therefore a "cry" (for aid)? Thus in the
parallelism "cry" answers to "stretch--hand"; "in his calamity," to "in
ruin." The negative of the first clause is to be supplied in the second,
as in [Job 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#025.md) ([Job
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017).md).

[Job 30:25](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 30:25</span></span>

May I not be allowed to complain of my calamity, and beg relief, seeing
that I myself sympathized with those "in trouble" (literally, "hard of
day"; those who had a hard time of it).

[Job 30:26](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 30:26</span></span>

I may be allowed to crave help, seeing that, "when I looked for good (on
account of my piety and charity), yet evil," &c.

light-- ([Job 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#028).md).

[Job 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 30:27</span></span>

bowels--regarded as the seat of deep feeling ([Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011).md).

boiled--violently heated and agitated.

prevented--Old English for "unexpectedly came upon" me, "surprised" me.

[Job 30:28](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 30:28</span></span>

mourning--rather, I move about blackened, though not by the sun; that
is, whereas many are blackened by the sun, I am, by the heat of God's
wrath (so "boiled," [Job 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027).md); the
elephantiasis covering me with blackness of skin ([Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030).md), as with the garb of mourning
([Jer 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002).md). This striking enigmatic
form of Hebrew expression occurs, [Isa
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#009.md).

stood up--as an innocent man crying for justice in an assembled court
([Job 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020).md).

[Job 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 30:29</span></span>

dragons . . . owls--rather, "jackals," "ostriches," both of which utter
dismal screams ([Mic 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008).md); in which
respect, as also in their living amidst solitudes (the emblem of
desolation), Job is their brother and companion; that is, resembles
them. "Dragon," Hebrew, tannim, usually means the crocodile; so perhaps
here, its open jaws lifted towards heaven, and its noise making it seem
as if it mourned over its fate \[BOCHART\].

[Job 30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 30:30</span></span>

upon me--rather, as in [Job 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017.md) (see
on [Job 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017).md), "my skin is black (and
falls away) from me."

my bones-- ([Job 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020.md); [Psa
102:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#005).md).

[Job 30:31](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 30:31</span></span>

organ--rather, "pipe" ([Job 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#012).md).
"My joy is turned into the voice of weeping" ([Lam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#015).md). These instruments are properly
appropriated to joy ([Isa 30:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029.md), [Isa
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#032).md), which makes their use now in
sorrow the sadder by contrast.
