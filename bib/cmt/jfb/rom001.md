### [Romans Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)

[Romans 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 1:1</span></span>

INTRODUCTION. (Rom. 1:1-17)

Paul--(See on [Act 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009)).

a servant of Jesus Christ--The word here rendered "servant" means
"bond-servant," or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of
another. In this sense it is applied to the disciples of Christ at large
([Co1 7:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#021)), as in the Old
Testament to all the people of God ([Isa
66:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014)). But as, in addition to this,
the prophets and kings of Israel were officially "the servants of the
Lord" ([Jos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001); [Psa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001), title), the apostles call
themselves, in the same official sense, "the servants of Christ" (as
here, and [Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001); [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001); [Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001); [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)), expressing such absolute
subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have
yielded to a mere creature. (See on [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007); [Joh
5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022)).

called to be an apostle--when first he "saw the Lord"; the indispensable
qualification for apostleship. (See on [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005); [Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014); [Co1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001)).

separated unto the--preaching of the

gospel--neither so late as when "the Holy Ghost said, Separate me
Barnabas and Saul" ([Act 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)), nor so
early as when "separated from his mother's womb" (see on [Gal
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)). He was called at one and the
same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ ([Act
26:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016)).

of God--that is, the Gospel of which God is the glorious Author. (So
[Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016); [Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002), [Th1
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)).

[Romans 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 1:2</span></span>

Which he had promised afore . . . in the holy scriptures--Though the
Roman Church was Gentile by nation (see on [Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013)), yet as it consisted mostly of
proselytes to the Jewish faith (see on Introduction to this Epistle),
they are here reminded that in embracing Christ they had not cast off,
but only the more profoundly yielded themselves to, Moses and the
prophets ([Act 13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032)).

[Romans 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 1:3</span></span>

Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord--the grand burden of this
"Gospel of God."

made of the seed of David--as, according to "the holy scriptures," He
behooved to be. (See on [Mat 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001)).

according to the flesh--that is, in His human nature (compare [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005); [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)); implying, of course, that He
had another nature, of which the apostle immediately proceeds to speak.

[Romans 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 1:4</span></span>

And declared--literally, "marked off," "defined," "determined," that is,
"shown," or "proved."

to be the Son of God--Observe how studiously the language changes here.
He "was MADE \[says the apostle\] of the seed of David, according to the
flesh" ([Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003)); but He was not
made, He was only "declared \[or proved\] to BE the Son of God." So [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014), "In the beginning WAS the Word .
. . and the Word was MADE flesh"; and [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006), "Unto us a Child is BORN, unto us
a Son is GIVEN." Thus the Sonship of Christ is in no proper sense a born
relationship to the Father, as some, otherwise sound divines, conceive
of it. By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and
uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation. (See on [Luk
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#035); [Act
13:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#032)).

with power--This may either be connected with "declared," and then the
meaning will be "powerfully declared" \[LUTHER, BEZA, BENGEL, FRITZSCHE,
ALFORD, &c.\]; or (as in our version, and as we think rightly) with "the
Son of God," and then the sense is, "declared to be the Son of God" in
possession of that "power" which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of
the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but "by His
resurrection from the dead" gloriously displayed and henceforth to be
for ever exerted in this nature of ours \[Vulgate, CALVIN, HODGE,
PHILIPPI, MEHRING, &c.\].

according to the spirit of holiness--If "according to the flesh" means
here, "in His human nature," this uncommon expression must mean "in His
other nature," which we have seen to be that "of the Son of God"--an
eternal, uncreated nature. This is here styled the "spirit," as an
impalpable and immaterial nature ([Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024)), and "the spirit of holiness,"
probably in absolute contrast with that "likeness, of sinful flesh"
which He assumed. One is apt to wonder that if this be the meaning, it
was not expressed more simply. But if the apostle had said "He was
declared to be the Son of God according to the Holy Spirit," the reader
would have thought he meant "the Holy Ghost"; and it seems to have been
just to avoid this misapprehension that he used the rare expression,
"the spirit of holiness."

[Romans 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 1:5</span></span>

By whom--as the ordained channel.

we have received grace--the whole "grace that bringeth salvation" ([Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011)).

and apostleship--for the publication of that "grace," and the
organization of as many as receive it into churches of visible
discipleship. (We prefer thus taking them as two distinct things, and
not, with some good interpreters, as one--"the grace of apostleship").

for obedience to the faith--rather, "for the obedience of faith"--that
is, in order to men's yielding themselves to the belief of God's saving
message, which is the highest of all obedience.

for his name--that He might be glorified.

[Romans 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 1:6</span></span>

Among whom are ye also--that is, along with others; for the apostle
ascribes nothing special to the Church of Rome (compare [Co1
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#036)) \[BENGEL\].

the called--(See on [Rom 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030)).

of Christ Jesus--that is, either called "by Him" ([Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025)), or the called "belonging to
Him"; "Christ's called ones." Perhaps this latter sense is best
supported, but one hardly knows which to prefer.

[Romans 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 1:7</span></span>

beloved of God--(Compare [Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012);
[Col 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)).

Grace, &c.--(See on [Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)).

and peace--the peace which Christ made through the blood of His cross
([Col 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020)), and which reflects into
the believing bosom "the peace of God which passeth all understanding"
([Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)).

from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ--"Nothing speaks more
decisively for the divinity of Christ than these juxtapositions of
Christ with the eternal God, which run through the whole language of
Scripture, and the derivation of purely divine influences from Him also.
The name of no man can be placed by the side of the Almighty. He only,
in whom the Word of the Father who is Himself God became flesh, may be
named beside Him; for men are commanded to honor Him even as they honor
the Father ([Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023))" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Romans 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 1:8</span></span>

your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world--This was quite
practicable through the frequent visits paid to the capital from all the
provinces; and the apostle, having an eye to the influence they would
exercise upon others, as well as their own blessedness, given thanks for
such faith to "his God through Jesus Christ," as being the source,
according to his theology of faith, as of all grace in men.

[Romans 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 1:9</span></span>

For God . . . whom I serve--the word denotes religious service.

with my spirit--from my inmost soul.

in the gospel of his Son--to which Paul's whole religious life and
official activity were consecrated.

is my witness, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers--so for the Ephesians ([Eph
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#015)); so for the Philippians ([Phi
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003)); so for the Colossians ([Col
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003)); so for the Thessalonians ([Th1
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002)). What catholic love, what
all-absorbing spirituality, what impassioned devotion to the glory of
Christ among men!

[Romans 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 1:10</span></span>

Making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous
journey by the will of God, to come to you--Though long anxious to visit
the capital, he met with a number of providential hindrances ([Rom
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013); [Rom
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022); and see on [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021); [Act
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011); [Act
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#015)); insomuch that nearly a quarter
of a century elapsed, after his conversion, ere his desire was
accomplished, and that only as "a prisoner of Jesus Christ." Thus taught
that his whole future was in the hands of God, he makes it his continual
prayer that at length the obstacles to a happy and prosperous meeting
might be removed.

[Romans 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 1:11</span></span>

For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift--not
any supernatural gift, as the next clause shows, and compare [Co1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007).

to the end that ye may be established.

[Romans 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 1:12</span></span>

That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith
both of you and me--"Not wishing to "lord it over their faith," but
rather to be a "helper of their joy," the apostle corrects his former
expressions: my desire is to instruct you and do you good, that is, for
us to instruct and do one another good: in giving I shall also receive"
\[JOWETT\]. "Nor is he insincere in so speaking, for there is none so
poor in the Church of Christ who may not impart to us something of
value: it is only our malignity and pride that hinder us from gathering
such fruit from every quarter" \[CALVIN\]. How "widely different is the
apostolic style from that of the court of Papal Rome!" \[BENGEL\].

[Romans 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 1:13</span></span>

oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, but was let--hindered.

hitherto--chiefly by his desire to go first to places where Christ was
not known ([Rom 15:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020)).

that I might have some fruit--of my ministry

among you also, even as among other Gentiles--The GENTILE origin of the
Church at Rome is here so explicitly stated, that those who conclude,
merely from the Jewish strain of the argument, that they must have been
mostly Israelites, decide in opposition to the apostle himself. (But see
on Introduction to this Epistle.)

[Romans 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 1:14</span></span>

I am debtor both to the Greeks--cultivated

and to the Barbarians--rude.

[Romans 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 1:15</span></span>

So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are
at Rome also--He feels himself under an all-subduing obligation to carry
the gospel to all classes of mankind, as adapted to and ordained equally
for all ([Co1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016)).

[Romans 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 1:16</span></span>

For I am not ashamed of the gospel--(The words, "of Christ," which
follow here, are not found in the oldest and best manuscripts). This
language implies that it required some courage to bring to "the mistress
of the world" what "to the Jews was a stumbling-block and to the Greeks
foolishness" ([Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)). But its
inherent glory, as God's life-giving message to a dying world, so filled
his soul, that, like his blessed Master, he "despised the shame."

for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
believeth--Here and in [Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017) the
apostle announces the great theme of his ensuing argument; SALVATION,
the one overwhelming necessity of perishing men; this revealed IN THE
GOSPEL MESSAGE; and that message so owned and honored of God as to
carry, in the proclamation of it, GOD'S OWN POWER TO SAVE EVERY SOUL
THAT EMBRACES IT, Greek and Barbarian, wise and unwise alike.

[Romans 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 1:17</span></span>

For therein is the righteousness of God revealed--that is (as the whole
argument of the Epistle shows), GOD'S JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS.

from faith to faith--a difficult clause. Most interpreters (judging from
the sense of such phrases elsewhere) take it to mean, "from one degree
of faith to another." But this agrees ill with the apostle's design,
which has nothing to do with the progressive stages of faith, but solely
with faith itself as the appointed way of receiving God's
"righteousness." We prefer, therefore, to understand it thus: "The
righteousness of God is in the gospel message, revealed (to be) from (or
'by') faith to (or 'for') faith," that is, "in order to be by faith
received." (So substantially, MELVILLE, MEYER, STUART, BLOOMFIELD, &c.).

as it is written-- ([Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004)).

The just shall live by faith--This golden maxim of the Old Testament is
thrice quoted in the New Testament--here; [Gal
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011); [Heb
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038) --showing that the gospel way of
"LIFE BY FAITH," so far from disturbing, only continued and developed
the ancient method.

On the foregoing verses, Note (1) What manner of persons ought the
ministers of Christ to be, according to the pattern here set up:
absolutely subject and officially dedicated to the Lord Jesus; separated
unto the gospel of God, which contemplates the subjugation of all
nations to the faith of Christ: debtors to all classes, the refined and
the rude, to bring the gospel to them all alike, all shame in the
presence of the one, as well as pride before the other, sinking before
the glory which they feel to be in their message; yearning over all
faithful churches, not lording it over them, but rejoicing in their
prosperity, and finding refreshment and strength in their fellowship!
(2) The peculiar features of the gospel here brought prominently forward
should be the devout study of all who preach it, and guide the views and
the taste of all who are privileged statedly to hear it: that it is "the
gospel of God," as a message from heaven, yet not absolutely new, but on
the contrary, only the fulfilment of Old Testament promise, that not
only is Christ the great theme of it, but Christ in the very nature of
God as His own Son, and in the nature of men as partaker of their
flesh--the Son of God now in resurrection--power and invested with
authority to dispense all grace to men, and all gifts for the
establishment and edification of the Church, Christ the righteousness
provided of God for the justification of all that believe in His name;
and that in this glorious Gospel, when preached as such, there resides
the very power of God to save Jew and Gentile alike who embrace it. (3)
While Christ is to be regarded as the ordained Channel of all grace from
God to men ([Rom 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)), let none
imagine that His proper divinity is in any respect compromised by this
arrangement, since He is here expressly associated with "God the
Father," in prayer for "grace and peace" (including all spiritual
blessings) to rest upon this Church ([Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007)). (4) While this Epistle teaches,
in conformity with the teaching of our Lord Himself, that all salvation
is suspended upon faith, this is but half a truth, and will certainly
minister to self-righteousness, if dissociated from another feature of
the same truth, here explicitly taught, that this faith in God's own
gift--for which accordingly in the case of the Roman believers, he
"thanks his God through Jesus Christ" ([Rom
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)). (5) Christian fellowship, as
indeed all real fellowship, is a mutual benefit; and as it is not
possible for the most eminent saints and servants of Christ to impart
any refreshment and profit to the meanest of their brethren without
experiencing a rich return into their bosoms, so just in proportion to
their humility and love will they feel their need of it and rejoice in
it.

[Romans 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 1:18</span></span>

WHY THIS DIVINELY PROVIDED RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NEEDED BY ALL MEN. ([Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018))

For the wrath of God--His holy displeasure and righteous vengeance
against sin.

is revealed from heaven--in the consciences of men, and attested by
innumerable outward evidences of a moral government.

against all ungodliness--that is, their whole irreligiousness, or their
living without any conscious reference to God, and proper feelings
towards Him.

and unrighteousness of men--that is, all their deviations from moral
rectitude in heart, speech, and behavior. (So these terms must be
distinguished when used together, though, when standing alone, either of
them includes the other).

THIS WRATH OF GOD, REVEALED AGAINST ALL INIQUITY, OVERHANGS THE WHOLE
HEATHEN WORLD. ([Rom 1:18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018))

who hold--rather, "hold down," "hinder," or "keep back."

the truth in unrighteousness--The apostle, though he began this verse
with a comprehensive proposition regarding men in general, takes up in
the end of it only one of the two great divisions of mankind, to whom he
meant to apply it; thus gently sliding into his argument. But before
enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them
all, their stifling the light which still remained to them. As darkness
overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the heart, when
the "still small voice" of conscience is first disregarded, next
thwarted, and then systematically deadened. Thus "the truth" which God
left with and in men, instead of having free scope and developing
itself, as it otherwise would, was obstructed (compare [Mat
6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022); [Eph
4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017)).

[Romans 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 1:19</span></span>

Because that which may be--rather, "which is."

known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them--The
sense of this pregnant statement the apostle proceeds to unfold in [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020).

[Romans 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 1:20</span></span>

For the invisible things of him from--or "since"

the creation of the world are clearly seen--the mind brightly beholding
what the eye cannot discern.

being understood by the things that are made--Thus, the outward creation
is not the parent but the interpreter of our faith in God. That faith
has its primary sources within our own breast ([Rom
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)); but it becomes an intelligible
and articulate conviction only through what we observe around us ("by
the things which are made," [Rom
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)). And thus are the inner and the
outer revelation of God the complement of each other, making up between
them one universal and immovable conviction that God is. (With this
striking apostolic statement agree the latest conclusions of the most
profound speculative students of Theism).

even his eternal power and Godhead--both that there is an Eternal Power,
and that this is not a mere blind force, or pantheistic "spirit of
nature," but the power of a living Godhead.

so that they are without excuse--all their degeneracy being a voluntary
departure from truth thus brightly revealed to the unsophisticated
spirit.

[Romans 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 1:21</span></span>

Because that, when they knew God--that is, while still retaining some
real knowledge of Him, and ere they sank down into the state next to be
described.

they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful--neither yielded
the adoration due to Himself, nor rendered the gratitude which His
beneficence demanded.

but became vain--(compare [Jer 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#005)).

in their imaginations--thoughts, notions, speculations, regarding God;
compare [Mat 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019); [Luk
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035); [Co1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020), Greek.

and their foolish--"senseless," "stupid."

heart--that is, their whole inner man.

was darkened--How instructively is the downward progress of the human
soul here traced!

[Romans 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 1:22</span></span>

Professing themselves--"boasting," or "pretending to be"

wise, they became fools--"It is the invariable property of error in
morals and religion, that men take credit to themselves for it and extol
it as wisdom. So the heathen" ([Co1
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021)) \[THOLUCK\].

[Romans 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 1:23</span></span>

And changed--or "exchanged."

the glory of the uncorruptible God into--or "for"

an image . . . like to corruptible man--The allusion here is doubtless
to the Greek worship, and the apostle may have had in his mind those
exquisite chisellings of the human form which lay so profusely beneath
and around him as he stood on Mars' Hill; and "beheld their devotions."
(See on [Act 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029)). But as if that
had not been a deep enough degradation of the living God, there was
found "a lower deep" still.

and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and to creeping things--referring
now to the Egyptian and Oriental worship. In the face of these plain
declarations of the descent of man's religious belief from loftier to
ever lower and more debasing conceptions of the Supreme Being, there are
expositors of this very Epistle (as REICHE and JOWETT), who, believing
neither in any fall from primeval innocence, nor in the noble traces of
that innocence which lingered even after the fall and were only by
degrees obliterated by wilful violence to the dictates of conscience,
maintain that man's religious history has been all along a struggle to
rise, from the lowest forms of nature worship, suited to the childhood

Wherefore God also--in righteous retribution.

gave them up--This divine abandonment of men is here strikingly traced
in three successive stages, at each of which the same word is used ([Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), [Rom
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026); and [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028), where the word is rendered "gave
over"). "As they deserted God, God in turn deserted them; not giving
them divine (that is, supernatural) laws, and suffering them to corrupt
those which were human; not sending them prophets, and allowing the
philosophers to run into absurdities. He let them do what they pleased,
even what was in the last degree vile, that those who had not honored
God, might dishonor themselves" \[GROTIUS\].

[Romans 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025)

Who changed the truth of God into a lie--that is, the truth concerning
God into idol falsehood.

and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator--Professing
merely to worship the Creator by means of the creature, they soon came
to lose sight of the Creator in the creature. How aggravated is the
guilt of the Church of Rome, which, under the same flimsy pretext, does
shamelessly what the heathen are here condemned for doing, and with
light which the heathen never had!

who is blessed for ever! Amen--By this doxology the apostle
instinctively relieves the horror which the penning of such things
excited within his breast; an example to such as are called to expose
like dishonor done to the blessed God.

[Romans 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 1:26</span></span>

For this cause God gave them up--(See on [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024)).

for even their women--that sex whose priceless jewel and fairest
ornament is modesty, and which, when that is once lost, not only becomes
more shameless than the other sex, but lives henceforth only to drag the
other sex down to its level.

did change, &c.--The practices here referred to, though too abundantly
attested by classic authors, cannot be further illustrated, without
trenching on things which "ought not to be named among us as become the
saints." But observe how vice is here seen consuming and exhausting
itself. When the passions, scourged by violent and continued indulgence
in natural vices, became impotent to yield the craved enjoyment, resort
was had to artificial stimulants by the practice of unnatural and
monstrous vices. How early these were in full career, in the history of
the world, the case of Sodom affectingly shows; and because of such
abominations, centuries after that, the land of Canaan "spued out" its
old inhabitants. Long before this chapter was penned, the Lesbians and
others throughout refined Greece had been luxuriating in such
debasements; and as for the Romans, TACITUS, speaking of the emperor
Tiberius, tells us that new words had then to be coined to express the
newly invented stimulants to jaded passion. No wonder that, thus sick
and dying as was this poor humanity of ours under the highest earthly
culture, its many-voiced cry for the balm in Gilead, and the Physician
there, "Come over and help us," pierced the hearts of the missionaries
of the Cross, and made them "not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ!"

[Romans 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#027)

and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was
meet--alluding to the many physical and moral ways in which, under the
righteous government of God, vice was made self-avenging.

[Romans 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 1:28</span></span>

gave them over--or "up" (see on [Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024)).

to do those things which are not convenient--in the old sense of that
word, that is, "not becoming," "indecorous," "shameful."

[Romans 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 1:30</span></span>

haters of God--The word usually signifies "God-hated," which some here
prefer, in the sense of "abhorred of the Lord"; expressing the
detestableness of their character in His sight (compare [Pro
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#014); [Psa
73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020)). But the active sense of the
word, adopted in our version and by the majority of expositors, though
rarer, agrees perhaps better with the context.

[Romans 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 1:32</span></span>

Who knowing--from the voice of conscience, [Rom
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014)

that they which commit such things are worthy of death--here used in its
widest known sense, as the uttermost of divine vengeance against sin:
see [Act 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004).

not only do the same--which they might do under the pressure of
temptation and in the heat of passion.

but have pleasure in them that do them--deliberately set their seal to
such actions by encouraging and applauding the doing of them in others.
This is the climax of our apostle's charges against the heathen; and
certainly, if the things are in themselves as black as possible, this
settled and unblushing satisfaction at the practice of them, apart from
all the blinding effects of present passion, must be regarded as the
darkest feature of human depravity.

On this section, Note (1) "The wrath of God" against sin has all the
dread reality of a "revelation from heaven" sounding in the consciences
of men, in the self-inflicted miseries of the wicked, and in the
vengeance which God's moral government, sooner or later, takes upon all
who outrage it; so this "wrath of God" is not confined to high-handed
crimes, or the grosser manifestations of human depravity, but is
"revealed" against all violations of divine law of whatever
nature--"against all ungodliness" as well as "unrighteousness of men,"
against all disregard of God in the conduct of life as well as against
all deviations from moral rectitude; and therefore, since no child of
Adam can plead guiltless either of "ungodliness" or of
"unrighteousness," to a greater or less extent, it follows that every
human being is involved in the awful sweep of "the wrath of God" ([Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018)). The apostle places this
terrible truth in the forefront of his argument on justification by
faith, that upon the basis of universal condemnation he might rear the
edifice of a free, world-wide salvation; nor can the Gospel be
scripturally preached or embraced, save as the good news of salvation to
those that are all equally "lost." (2) We must not magnify the
supernatural revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself,
through Abraham's family to the human race, at the expense of that
older, and, in itself, lustrous revelation which He has made to the
whole family of man through the medium of their own nature and the
creation around them. Without the latter, the former would have been
impossible, and those who have not been favored with the former will be
without excuse, if they are deaf to the voice and blind to the glory of
the latter ([Rom 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)). (3) Wilful
resistance of light has a retributive tendency to blunt the moral
perceptions and weaken the capacity to apprehend and approve of truth
and goodness; and thus is the soul prepared to surrender itself, to an
indefinite extent, to error and sin ([Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021), &c.). (4) Pride of wisdom, as it
is a convincing evidence of the want of it, so it makes the attainment
of it impossible ([Rom 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022); and
compare [Mat 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#025); [Co1
3:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018)). (5) As idolatry, even in its
most plausible forms, is the fruit of unworthy views of the Godhead, so
its natural effect is to vitiate and debase still further the religious
conceptions; nor is there any depth of degradation too low and too
revolting for men's ideas of the Godhead to sink to, if only their
natural temperament and the circumstances they are placed in be
favorable to their unrestrained development ([Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023), [Rom
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025)). The apostle had Greece and
Egypt in his eye when he penned this description. But all the paganisms
of the East at this day attest its accuracy, from the more elaborate
idolatry of India and the simpler and more stupid idolatry of China down
to the childish rudiments of nature worship prevalent among the savage
tribes. Alas! Christendom itself furnishes a melancholy illustration of
this truth; the constant use of material images in the Church of Rome
and the materialistic and sensuous character of its entire service (to
say nothing of the less offensive but more stupid service of the Greek
Church,) debasing the religious ideas of millions of nominal Christians,
and lowering the whole character and tone of Christianity as represented
within their immense pale. (6) Moral corruption invariably follows
religious debasement. The grossness of pagan idolatry is only equalled
by the revolting character and frightful extent of the immoralities
which it fostered and consecrated ([Rom
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), [Rom
1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026)). And so strikingly is this to
be seen in all its essential features in the East at this day, that (as
HODGE says) the missionaries have frequently been accused by the natives
of having forged the whole of the latter part of this chapter, as they
could not believe that so accurate a description of themselves could
have been written eighteen centuries ago. The kingdoms of Israel and
Judah furnish a striking illustration of the inseparable connection
between religion and morals. Israel corrupted and debased the worship of
Jehovah, and the sins with which they were charged were mostly of the
grosser kind--intemperance and sensuality: the people of Judah,
remaining faithful to the pure worship, were for a long time charged
mostly with formality and hypocrisy; and only as they fell into the
idolatries of the heathen around them, did they sink into their vices.
And may not a like distinction be observed between the two great
divisions of Christendom, the Popish and the Protestant? To test this,
we must not look to Popery, surrounded with, and more or less influenced
by, the presence and power of Protestantism; nor to Protestantism under
every sort of disadvantage, internal and external. But look at Romanism
where it has unrestrained liberty to develop its true character, and see
whether impurity does not there taint society to its core, pervading
alike the highest and the lowest classes; and then look at Protestantism
where it enjoys the same advantages, and see whether it be not marked by
a comparatively high standard of social virtue. (7) To take pleasure in
what is sinful and vicious for its own sake, and knowing it to be such,
is the last and lowest stage of human recklessness ([Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032)). But (8) this knowledge can
never be wholly extinguished in the breast of men. So long as reason
remains to them, there is still a small voice in the worst of men,
protesting, in the name of the Power that implanted it, "that they which
do such things are worthy of death" ([Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032)).
