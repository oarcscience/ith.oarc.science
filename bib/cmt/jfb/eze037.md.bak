### [Ezekiel Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 37:1</span></span>

THE VISION OF DRY BONES REVIVIFIED, SYMBOLIZING ISRAEL'S DEATH AND
RESURRECTION. (Eze. 37:1-28)

carried . . . in the spirit--The matters transacted, therefore, were not
literal, but in vision.

the valley--probably that by the Chebar ([Eze
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#022).md). The valley represents
Mesopotamia, the scene of Israel's sojourn in her state of national
deadness.

[Ezekiel 37:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 37:2</span></span>

dry--bleached by long exposure to the atmosphere.

[Ezekiel 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 37:3</span></span>

can these bones live? . . . thou knowest--implying that, humanly
speaking, they could not; but faith leaves the question of possibility
to rest with God, with whom nothing is impossible ([Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039).md). An image of Christian faith
which believes in the coming general resurrection of the dead, in spite
of all appearances against it, because God has said it ([Joh
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md); [Rom
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md); [Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 37:4</span></span>

Prophesy--Proclaim God's quickening word to them. On account of this
innate power of the divine word to effect its end, prophets are said to
do that which they prophesy as about to be done ([Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 37:5</span></span>

I . . . cause breath to enter into you--So [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md), containing the same vision,
refers primarily to Israel's restoration. Compare as to God's renovation
of the earth and all its creatures hereafter by His breath, [Psa
104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md).

ye shall live--come to life again.

[Ezekiel 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 37:6</span></span>

ye shall know that I am the Lord--by the actual proof of My divinity
which I will give in reviving Israel.

[Ezekiel 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 37:7</span></span>

noise--of the bones when coming in mutual collision. Perhaps referring
to the decree of Cyrus, or the noise of the Jews' exultation at their
deliverance and return.

bones came together--literally, "ye bones came together"; as in [Jer
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011) (Hebrew.md), "ye widows of thine
shall trust in Me." The second person puts the scene vividly before
one's eyes, for the whole resurrection scene is a prophecy in action to
render more palpably to the people the prophecy in word ([Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021).md).

[Ezekiel 37:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 37:8</span></span>

So far, they were only cohering in order as unsightly skeletons. The
next step, that of covering them successively with sinews, skin, and
flesh, gives them beauty; but still "no breath" of life in them. This
may imply that Israel hereafter, as at the restoration from Babylon was
the case in part, shall return to Judea unconverted at first ([Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008).md). Spiritually: a man may assume
all the semblances of spiritual life, yet have none, and so be dead
before God.

[Ezekiel 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 37:9</span></span>

wind--rather, the spirit of life or life-breath (Margin). For it is
distinct from "the four winds" from which it is summoned.

from the four winds--implying that Israel is to be gathered from the
four quarters of the earth ([Isa
43:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005.md); [Jer
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#008).md), even as they were "scattered
into all the winds" ([Eze 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md); [Eze
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#014.md); [Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021.md); compare [Rev
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001.md), [Rev
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 37:10</span></span>

Such honor God gives to the divine word, even in the mouth of a man. How
much more when in the mouth of the Son of God! ([Joh
5:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025).md). Though this chapter does not
directly prove the resurrection of the dead, it does so indirectly; for
it takes for granted the future fact as one recognized by believing
Jews, and so made the image of their national restoration (so [Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md); [Isa
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#019.md); [Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md); [Hos
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#002.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md); compare Note, see on [Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 37:11</span></span>

Our bones are dried-- ([Psa 141:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa141.htm#007).md),
explained by "our hope is lost" ([Isa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#014).md); our national state is as
hopeless of resuscitation, as marrowless bones are of reanimation.

cut off for our parts--that is, so far as we are concerned. There is
nothing in us to give hope, like a withered branch "cut off" from a
tree, or a limb from the body.

[Ezekiel 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 37:12</span></span>

my people--in antithesis to "for our parts" ([Eze
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#011).md). The hope that is utterly gone,
if looking at themselves, is sure for them in God, because He regards
them as His people. Their covenant relation to God ensures His not
letting death permanently reign over them. Christ makes the same
principle the ground on which the literal resurrection rests. God had
said, "I am the God of Abraham," &c.; God, by taking the patriarchs as
His, undertook to do for them all that Omnipotence can perform: He,
being the ever living God, is necessarily the God of, not dead, but
living persons, that is, of those whose bodies His covenant love binds
Him to raise again. He can--and because He can--He will--He must
\[FAIRBAIRN\]. He calls them "My people" when receiving them into favor;
but "thy people," in addressing His servant, as if He would put them
away from Him ([Eze 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md); [Eze
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#002.md); [Exo
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007).md).

out of your graves--out of your politically dead state, primarily in
Babylon, finally hereafter in all lands (compare [Eze
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md); [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014).md). The Jews regarded the lands of
their captivity and dispersion as their "graves"; their restoration was
to be as "life from the dead" ([Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md). Before, the bones were in the
open plain ([Eze 37:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001).md); now, in the
graves, that is, some of the Jews were in the graves of actual
captivity, others at large but dispersed. Both alike were nationally
dead.

[Ezekiel 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 37:16</span></span>

stick--alluding to [Num 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#002.md), the
tribal rod. The union of the two rods was a prophecy in action of the
brotherly union which is to reunite the ten tribes and Judah. As their
severance under Jeroboam was fraught with the greatest evil to the
covenant-people, so the first result of both being joined by the spirit
of life to God is that they become joined to one another under the one
covenant King, Messiah-David.

Judah, and . . . children of Israel his companions--that is, Judah and,
besides Benjamin and Levi, those who had joined themselves to him of
Ephraim, Manasseh, Simeon, Asher, Zebulun, Issachar, as having the
temple and lawful priesthood in his borders ([Ch2
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#012.md), [Ch2
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#016.md); [Ch2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#009.md); [Ch2
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#011.md), [Ch2
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#018).md). The latter became identified
with Judah after the carrying away of the ten tribes, and returned with
Judah from Babylon, and so shall be associated with that tribe at the
future restoration.

For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim--Ephraim's posterity took the lead, not
only of the other descendants of Joseph (compare [Eze
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019).md), but of the ten tribes of
Israel. For four hundred years, during the period of the judges, with
Manasseh and Benjamin, its dependent tribes, it had formerly taken the
lead: Shiloh was its religious capital; Shechem, its civil capital. God
had transferred the birthright from Reuben (for dishonoring his father's
bed) to Joseph, whose representative, Ephraim, though the younger, was
made ([Gen 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#019.md); [Ch1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001).md). From its pre-eminence "Israel"
is attached to it as "companions." The "all" in this case, not in that
of Judah, which has only attached as "companions" the children of
Israel" (that is, some of them, namely, those who followed the fortunes
of Judah), implies that the bulk of the ten tribes did not return at the
restoration from Babylon, but are distinct from Judah, until the coming
union with it at the restoration.

[Ezekiel 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 37:18</span></span>

God does not explain the symbolical prophecy until the Jews have been
stimulated by the type to consult the prophet.

[Ezekiel 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 37:19</span></span>

The union effected at the restoration from Babylon embraced but
comparatively few of Israel; a future complete fulfilment must therefore
be looked for.

stick of Joseph . . . in the hand of Ephraim--Ephraim, of the
descendants of Joseph, had exercised the rule among the ten tribes: that
rule, symbolized by the "stick," was now to be withdrawn from him, and
to be made one with the other, Judah's rule, in God's hand.

them--the "stick of Joseph," would strictly require "it"; but Ezekiel
expresses the sense, namely, the ten tribes who were subject to it.

with him--that is, Judah; or "it," that is, the stick of Judah.

[Ezekiel 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 37:22</span></span>

one nation-- ([Isa 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013.md); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md); [Hos
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).md).

one king--not Zerubbabel, who was not a king either in fact or name, and
who ruled over but a few Jews, and that only for a few years; whereas
the King here reigns for ever. MESSIAH is meant ([Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md). The union of Judah and
Israel under King Messiah symbolizes the union of Jews and Gentiles
under Him, partly now, perfectly hereafter ([Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md); [Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 37:23</span></span>

([Eze 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025).md).

out of . . . their dwelling-places-- ([Eze
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028.md), [Eze
36:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#033).md). I will remove them from the
scene of their idolatries to dwell in their own land, and to serve idols
no more.

[Ezekiel 37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 37:24</span></span>

David--Messiah (See on [Eze 34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md).

[Ezekiel 37:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 37:25</span></span>

for ever-- ([Isa 60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md); [Joe
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#020.md); [Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015).md).

[Ezekiel 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 37:26</span></span>

covenant of peace--better than the old legal covenant, because an
unchangeable covenant of grace ([Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md); [Isa
55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md); [Jer
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#040).md).

I will place them--set them in an established position; no longer
unsettled as heretofore.

my sanctuary--the temple of God; spiritual in the heart of all true
followers of Messiah ([Co2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md); and,
in some "literal" sense, in the restored Israel (Eze. 40:1-44:31).

[Ezekiel 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 37:27</span></span>

My tabernacle . . . with them--as foretold ([Gen
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#027).md); [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md), "The Word . . . dwelt among us"
(literally, "tabernacled"); first, in humiliation; hereafter, in
manifested glory ([Rev 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

[Ezekiel 37:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 37:28</span></span>

([Eze 36:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#023).md).

sanctify Israel--set it apart as holy unto Myself and inviolable ([Exo
19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005).md).

The objections to a literal interpretation of the prophecy are--(1) The
ideal nature of the name Gog, which is the root of Magog, the only
kindred name found in Scripture or history. (2) The nations congregated
are selected from places most distant from Israel, and from one another,
and therefore most unlikely to act in concert (Persians and Libyans,
&c.). (3) The whole spoil of Israel could not have given a handful to a
tithe of their number, or maintained the myriads of invaders a single
day ([Eze 38:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#012)). (4.md) The wood of
their invaders' weapons was to serve for fuel to Israel for seven years!
And all Israel were to take seven months in burying the dead! Supposing
a million of Israelites to bury each two corpses a day, the aggregate
buried in the hundred eighty working days of the seven months would be
three hundred sixty millions of corpses! Then the pestilential vapors
from such masses of victims before they were all buried! What Israelite
could live in such an atmosphere? (5) The scene of the Lord's
controversy here is different from that in [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md), Edom, which creates a
discrepancy. (But probably a different judgment is alluded to). (6) The
gross carnality of the representation of God's dealings with His
adversaries is inconsistent with Messianic times. It therefore requires
a non-literal interpretation. The prophetical delineations of the divine
principles of government are thrown into the familiar forms of Old
Testament relations. The final triumph of Messiah's truth over the most
distant and barbarous nations is represented as a literal conflict on a
gigantic scale, Israel being the battlefield, ending in the complete
triumph of Israel's anointed King, the Saviour of the world. It is a
prophetical parable \[FAIRBAIRN\]. However, though the details are not
literal, the distinctiveness in this picture, characterizing also
parallel descriptions in writers less ideally picturesque than Ezekiel,
gives probability to a more definite and generally literal
interpretation. The awful desolations caused in Judea by Antiochus
Epiphanes, of Syria (1 Maccabees; and PORPHYRY, quoted by JEROME on
Ezekiel), his defilement of Jehovah's temple by sacrificing swine and
sprinkling the altar with the broth, and setting up the altar of Jupiter
Olympius, seem to be an earnest of the final desolations to be caused by
Antichrist in Israel, previous to His overthrow by the Lord Himself,
coming to reign (compare Dan. 8:10-26; [Dan
11:21-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021.md); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md); [Zac
14:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md). GROTIUS explains Gog as a
name taken from Gyges, king of Lydia; and Magog as Syria, in which was a
city called Magag \[PLINY, 5.28\]. What Ezekiel stated more generally,
[Rev 20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007.md) states more definitely as
to the anti-Christian confederacy which is to assail the beloved city.
