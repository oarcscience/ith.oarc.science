### [Esther Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001.md)

[Esther 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">est 4:1</span></span>

MORDECAI AND THE JEWS MOURN. ([Est
4:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#001).md)

When Mordecai perceived all that was done--Relying on the irrevocable
nature of a Persian monarch's decree ([Dan
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#015).md), Hamman made it known as soon as
the royal sanction had been obtained; and Mordecai was, doubtless, among
the first to hear of it. On his own account, as well as on that of his
countrymen, this astounding decree must have been indescribably
distressing. The acts described in this passage are, according to the
Oriental fashion, expressive of the most poignant sorrow; and his
approach to the gate of the palace, under the impulse of irrepressible
emotions, was to make an earnest though vain appeal to the royal mercy.
Access, however, to the king's presence was, to a person in his
disfigured state, impossible: "for none might enter into the king's gate
clothed with sackcloth." But he found means of conveying intelligence of
the horrid plot to Queen Esther.

[Esther 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">est 4:4</span></span>

Then was the queen . . . grieved; and . . . sent raiment to . . .
Mordecai--Her object in doing so was either to qualify him for resuming
his former office, or else, perhaps, of fitting him to come near enough
to the palace to inform her of the cause of such sudden and extreme
distress.

[Esther 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">est 4:5</span></span>

Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he
had appointed to attend upon her--Communication with the women in the
harem is very difficult to be obtained, and only through the medium of
the keepers. The chief eunuch receives the message from the lips of the
queen, conveys it to some inferior office of the seraglio. When the
commission is executed, the subaltern communicates it to the
superintendent, by whom it is delivered to the queen. This chief eunuch,
usually an old man who has recommended himself by a long course of
faithful service, is always appointed by the king; but it is his
interest, as well as his duty, to ingratiate himself with the queen
also. Accordingly, we find Hatach rendering himself very serviceable in
carrying on those private communications with Mordecai who was thereby
enabled to enlist Esther's powerful influence.

[Esther 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">est 4:8</span></span>

charge her that she should go in unto the king--This language is
exceedingly strong. As it can scarcely be supposed that Mordecai was
still using authority over Esther as his adopted daughter, he must be
considered as imploring rather than commanding her, in the name of her
brethren and in the name of her God, to make a direct appeal to the
feelings of her royal husband.

[Esther 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">est 4:11</span></span>

whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner
court, who is not called--The Persian kings surrounded themselves with
an almost impassable circle of forms. The law alluded to was first
enacted by Deioces, king of Media, and afterwards, when the empires were
united, adopted by the Persians, that all business should be transacted
and petitions transmitted to the king through his ministers. Although
the restriction was not intended, of course, to apply to the queen, yet
from the strict and inflexible character of the Persian laws and the
extreme desire to exalt the majesty of the sovereign, even his favorite
wife had not the privilege of entree, except by special favor and
indulgence. Esther was suffering from the severity of this law; and as,
from not being admitted for a whole month to the king's presence, she
had reason to fear that the royal affections had become alienated from
her, she had little hope of serving her country's cause in this awful
emergency.

[Esther 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">est 4:13</span></span>

Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther--His answer was to this effect,
that Esther need not indulge the vain hope she would, from her royal
connection, escape the general doom of her race--that he (Mordecai)
confidently believed God would interpose, and, if not through her, by
some other deliverer, save His people; but that the duty evidently
devolved on her, as there was great reason to believe that this was the
design of Providence in her elevation to the dignity of queen, and
therefore that she should go with a courageous heart, not doubting of
success.

[Esther 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">est 4:16</span></span>

so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law--The
appeal of Mordecai was irresistible. Having appointed a solemn fast of
three days, she expressed her firm resolution to make an appeal to the
king, though she should perish in the attempt.

I . . . and my maidens--It is probable that she had surrounded herself
with Jewish maidens, or women who were proselytes to that religion.
