### [1 Chronicles Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 6:5</span></span>

LINE OF THE PRIESTS. (1Ch. 6:1-48)

Uzzi--It is supposed that, in his days, the high priesthood was, for
unrecorded reasons, transferred from Eleazar's family to Ithamar's, in
which it continued for several generations.

[1 Chronicles 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 6:10</span></span>

he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon
built in Jerusalem--It is doubtful whether the person in favor of whom
this testimony is borne be Johanan or Azariah. If the former, he is the
same as Jehoiada, who rendered important public services (2Ki. 11:1-20);
if the latter, it refers to the worthy and independent part he acted in
resisting the unwarrantable encroachments of Uzziah ([Ch2
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#017).md).

in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem--described in this
particular manner to distinguish it from the second temple, which was in
existence at the time when this history was written.

[1 Chronicles 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 6:14</span></span>

Azariah begat Seraiah--He filled the supreme pontifical office at the
destruction of Jerusalem, and, along with his deputy and others, he was
executed by Nebuchadnezzar's orders at Riblah ([Kg2
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#018.md), [Kg2
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021).md). The line of high priests,
under the first temple, which from Zadok amounted to twelve, terminated
with him.

[1 Chronicles 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 6:16</span></span>

The sons of Levi; Gershom, &c.--This repetition (see [Ch1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001).md) is made, as the historian here
begins to trace the genealogy of the Levitical families who were not
priests. The list is a long one, comprising the chiefs or heads of their
several families until David's reign, who made a new and different
classification of them by courses.

[1 Chronicles 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 6:20</span></span>

Zimmah his son--his grandson ([Ch1
6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042).md).

[1 Chronicles 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 6:24</span></span>

Uriel--or Zephaniah ([Ch1 6:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#036).md).

[1 Chronicles 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 6:27</span></span>

Elkanah--the father of the prophet Samuel ([Sa1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#001).md).

[1 Chronicles 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 6:28</span></span>

the sons of Samuel--The sons of Samuel are here named Vashni and Abiah.
The first-born is called Joel ([Sa1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#002).md); and this name is given to him in
[Ch1 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md). It is now generally thought
by the best critics that, through an error of the copyists, an omission
has been made of the oldest son's name, and that Vashni, which is not
the name of a person, merely signifies "and the second." This critical
emendation of the text makes all clear, as well as consistent with other
passages relating to the family of Samuel.

[1 Chronicles 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch1 6:32</span></span>

before the dwelling-place, &c.--that is, in the tent which David had
erected for receiving the ark after it was removed from the house of
Obed-edom \[[Sa2 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017.md)\]. This was a
considerable time before the temple was built.

they waited on their office according to their order--which David,
doubtless by the direction of the Holy Spirit, had instituted for the
better regulation of divine worship.

[1 Chronicles 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 6:33</span></span>

Shemuel--that is, Samuel. This is the exact representation of the Hebrew
name.

[1 Chronicles 6:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">ch1 6:39</span></span>

his brother Asaph--They were brothers naturally, both being descended
from Levi, as well as officially, both being of the Levitical order.

[1 Chronicles 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">ch1 6:42</span></span>

Ethan--or Jeduthun ([Ch1 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#016.md); [Ch2
35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015).md).

[1 Chronicles 6:48](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">ch1 6:48</span></span>

Their brethren also the Levites were appointed unto all manner of
service--Those of them who were endowed with musical tastes and talents
were employed in various other departments of the temple service.

[1 Chronicles 6:49](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">ch1 6:49</span></span>

OFFICE OF AARON AND HIS SONS. (1Ch. 6:49-81)

But Aaron and his sons offered, &c.--The office and duties of the high
priests having been already described, the names of those who
successively filled that important office are recorded.

[1 Chronicles 6:60](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">ch1 6:60</span></span>

thirteen cities--No more than eleven are named here; but two additional
ones are mentioned ([Jos 21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#016).md),
which makes up the thirteen.

[1 Chronicles 6:61](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">ch1 6:61</span></span>

unto the sons of Kohath, which were left--that is, in addition to the
priests belonging to the same family and tribe of Levi.

by lot, ten cities-- ([Jos 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#026).md). The
sacred historian gives an explanation ([Ch1
6:66](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#066).md). Eight of these are mentioned,
but only two of them are taken out of the half tribe of Manasseh ([Ch1
6:70](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#070).md). The names of the other two are
given ([Jos 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#021).md), where full and
detailed notices of these arrangements may be found.

[1 Chronicles 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">ch1 6:62</span></span>

to the sons of Gershom--Supply "the children of Israel gave."

[1 Chronicles 6:67](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">ch1 6:67</span></span>

they gave unto them of the cities of refuge--The names of the cities
given here are considerably different from those applied to them ([Jos
21:13-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#013).md). In the lapse of centuries,
and from the revolutions of society, changes might have been expected to
take place in the form or dialectic pronunciation of the names of those
cities; and this will sufficiently account for the variations that are
found in the lists as enumerated here and in an earlier book. As to
these cities themselves that were assigned to the Levites, they were
widely remote and separated--partly in fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy
([Gen 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007).md), and partly that the
various districts of the country might obtain a competent supply of
teachers who might instruct the people in the knowledge, and animate
them to the observance, of a law which had so important a bearing on the
promotion both of their private happiness and their national prosperity.
