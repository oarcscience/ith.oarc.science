### [Psalms Chapter 58](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 58:1</span></span>

David's critical condition in some period of the Sauline persecution
probably occasioned this Psalm, in which the Psalmist teaches that the
innate and actual sinfulness of men deserves, and shall receive, God's
righteous vengeance, while the pious may be consoled by the evidence of
His wise and holy government of men. ([Psa
58:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#001).md)

O congregation--literally, "Oh, dumb"; the word used is never translated
"congregation." "Are ye dumb? ye should speak righteousness," may be the
translation. In any case, the writer remonstrates with them, perhaps a
council, who were assembled to try his cause, and bound to give a right
decision.

[Psalms 58:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 58:2</span></span>

This they did not design; but

weigh . . . violence--or give decisions of violence. Weigh is a figure
to express the acts of judges.

in the earth--publicly.

[Psalms 58:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 58:3</span></span>

describe the wicked generally, who sin naturally, easily, malignantly,
and stubbornly.

[Psalms 58:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 58:4</span></span>

stoppeth her--literally, "his."

ear--that is, the wicked man (the singular used collectively), who thus
becomes like the deaf adder which has no ear.

[Psalms 58:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 58:6</span></span>

He prays for their destruction, under the figure of ravenous beasts
([Psa 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007.md); [Psa
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 58:7</span></span>

which run continually--literally, "they shall go to themselves," utterly
depart, as rapid mountain torrents.

he bendeth . . . his arrows--prepares it. The term for preparing a bow
applied to arrows ([Psa 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003).md).

let them . . . pieces--literally, "as if they cut themselves off"--that
is, become blunted and of no avail.

[Psalms 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 58:8</span></span>

Other figures of this utter ruin; the last denoting rapidity. In a
shorter time than pots feel the heat of thorns on fire--

[Psalms 58:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 58:9</span></span>

he shall take them away as with a whirlwind--literally, "blow him (them)
away."

both living . . . wrath--literally, "as the living" or fresh as the
heated or burning--that is, thorns--all easily blown away, so easily and
quickly the wicked. The figure of the "snail" perhaps alludes to its
loss of saliva when moving. Though obscure in its clauses, the general
sense of the passage is clear.

[Psalms 58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 58:10</span></span>

wash . . . wicked--denoting great slaughter. The joy of triumph over the
destruction of the wicked is because they are God's enemies, and their
overthrow shows that He reigneth (compare [Psa
52:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md); [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007).md). In this assurance let heaven
and earth rejoice ([Psa 96:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#010.md); [Psa
97:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#001), &c..md).
