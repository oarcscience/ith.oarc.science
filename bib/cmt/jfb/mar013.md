### [Mark Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

[Mark 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 13:1</span></span>

CHRIST'S PROPHECY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM, AND WARNINGS
SUGGESTED BY IT TO PREPARE FOR HIS SECOND COMING. ( = Mat. 24:1-51; Luke
21:5-36). (Mark 13:1-37)

And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
him--The other Evangelists are less definite. "As some spake," says Luke
([Luk 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#005).md); "His disciples came to
Him," says Matthew ([Mat 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002).md).
Doubtless it was the speech of one, the mouthpiece, likely, of others.

Master--Teacher.

see what manner of stones and what buildings are here--wondering
probably, how so massive a pile could be overthrown, as seemed implied
in our Lord's last words regarding it. JOSEPHUS, who gives a minute
account of the wonderful structure, speaks of stones forty cubits long
\[Wars of the Jews, 5.5.1.\] and says the pillars supporting the porches
were twenty-five cubits high, all of one stone, and that of the whitest
marble \[Wars of the Jews, 5.5.2\]. Six days' battering at the walls,
during the siege, made no impression upon them \[Wars of the Jews,
6.4.1\]. Some of the under-building, yet remaining, and other works, are
probably as old as the first temple.

[Mark 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 13:2</span></span>

And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
buildings?--"Ye call My attention to these things? I have seen them. Ye
point to their massive and durable appearance: now listen to their
fate."

there shall not be left--"left here" ([Mat
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002).md).

one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down--Titus ordered the
whole city and temple to be demolished \[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews,
7.1.1\]; Eleazar wished they had all died before seeing that holy city
destroyed by enemies' hands, and before the temple was so profanely dug
up \[Wars of the Jews, 7.8.7\].

[Mark 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 13:3</span></span>

And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, over against the temple--On
their way from Jerusalem to Bethany they would cross Mount Olivet; on
its summit He seats Himself, over against the temple, having the city
all spread out under His eye. How graphically is this set before us by
our Evangelist!

Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately--The other
Evangelists tell us merely that "the disciples" did so. But Mark not
only says that it was four of them, but names them; and they were the
first quarternion of the Twelve.

[Mark 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 13:4</span></span>

Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all
these things shall be fulfilled?--"and what shall be the sign of Thy
coming, and of the end of the world?" They no doubt looked upon the date
of all these things as one and the same, and their notions of the things
themselves were as confused as of the times of them. Our Lord takes His
own way of meeting their questions.

Prophecies of the Destruction of Jerusalem (Mark 13:5-31).

[Mark 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 13:5</span></span>

And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive
you:

[Mark 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 13:6</span></span>

For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ--(see [Mat
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005).md) --"and the time draweth nigh"
([Luk 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008).md); that is, the time of the
kingdom in its full splendor.

and shall deceive many--"Go ye not therefore after them" ([Luk
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#008).md). The reference here seems not to
be to pretended Messiahs, deceiving those who rejected the claims of
Jesus, of whom indeed there were plenty--for our Lord is addressing His
own genuine disciples--but to persons pretending to be Jesus Himself,
returned in glory to take possession of His kingdom. This gives peculiar
force to the words, "Go ye not therefore after them."

[Mark 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 13:7</span></span>

And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
troubled--(See on [Mar 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#013.md), and
compare [Isa 8:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#011).md).

for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet--In Luke
([Luk 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009).md), "the end is not by and
by," or "immediately." Worse must come before all is over.

[Mark 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 13:8</span></span>

These are the beginnings of sorrows--"of travail-pangs," to which heavy
calamities are compared. (See [Jer
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031), &c..md). The annals of TACITUS tell
us how the Roman world was convulsed, before the destruction of
Jerusalem, by rival claimants of the imperial purple.

[Mark 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 13:9</span></span>

But take heed to yourselves: for--"before all these things" ([Luk
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#012).md); that is, before these public
calamities come.

they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be
beaten--These refer to ecclesiastical proceedings against them.

and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings--before civil tribunals
next.

for my sake, for a testimony against them--rather "unto them"--to give
you an opportunity of bearing testimony to Me before them. In the Acts
of the Apostles we have the best commentary on this announcement.
(Compare [Mat 10:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017).md).

[Mark 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 13:10</span></span>

And the gospel must first be published among all nations--"for a
witness, and then shall the end come" ([Mat
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#014).md). God never sends judgment
without previous warning; and there can be no doubt that the Jews,
already dispersed over most known countries, had nearly all heard the
Gospel "as a witness," before the end of the Jewish state. The same
principle was repeated and will repeat itself to "the end."

[Mark 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 13:11</span></span>

But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought
beforehand--"Be not anxious beforehand."

what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate--"Be not filled with
apprehension, in the prospect of such public appearances for Me, lest ye
should bring discredit upon My name, nor think it necessary to prepare
beforehand what ye are to say."

but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is
not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost--(See on [Mat
10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019)..md)

[Mark 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 13:13</span></span>

And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake--Matthew ([Mat
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012).md) adds this important intimation:
"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many"--"of the many," or
"of the most," that is, of the generality of professed disciples--"shall
wax cold." Sad illustrations of the effect of abounding iniquity in
cooling the love even of faithful disciples we have in the Epistle of
James, written about the period here referred to, and too frequently
ever since.

but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved--See on
[Mat 10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#021.md); and compare [Heb
10:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md), which is a manifest allusion
to these words of Christ; also [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md). Luke ([Luk
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018).md) adds these reassuring words:
"But there shall not an hair of your heads perish." Our Lord had just
said ([Luk 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#016).md) that they should be
put to death; showing that this precious promise is far above immunity
from mere bodily harm, and furnishing a key to the right interpretation
of the ninety-first Psalm and such like.

[Mark 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 13:14</span></span>

But when ye shall see--"Jerusalem compassed by armies"--by encamped
armies; in other words, when ye shall see it besieged, and

the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing
where it ought not--that is, as explained in Matthew ([Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015).md), "standing in the holy place."

(let him that readeth understand)--readeth that prophecy. That "the
abomination of desolation" here alluded to was intended to point to the
Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous, and so unclean pagan
power, may be gathered by comparing what Luke says in the corresponding
verse ([Luk 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020).md); and commentators
are agreed on it. It is worthy of notice, as confirming this
interpretation, that in 1 Maccabees 1:54--which, though aprocryphal
Scripture, is authentic history--the expression of Daniel ([Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031.md); [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011).md) is applied to the idolatrous
profanation of the Jewish altar by Antiochus Epiphanes.

then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains--The ecclesiastical
historian, EUSEBIUS, early in the fourth century, tells us that the
Christians fled to Pella, at the northern extremity of Perea, being
"prophetically directed"--perhaps by some prophetic intimation more
explicit than this, which would be their chart--and that thus they
escaped the predicted calamities by which the nation was overwhelmed.

[Mark 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 13:15</span></span>

And let him that is on the housetop not get down into the house, neither
enter therein, to take any thing out of his house--that is, let him take
the outside flight of steps from the roof to the ground; a graphic way
of denoting the extreme urgency of the case, and the danger of being
tempted, by the desire to save his property, to delay till escape should
become impossible.

[Mark 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 13:16</span></span>

And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his
garment.

[Mark 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 13:17</span></span>

But woe to them--or, "alas for them."

that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days--in
consequence of the aggravated suffering which those conditions would
involve.

[Mark 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 13:18</span></span>

And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter--making escape
perilous, or tempting you to delay your flight. Matthew ([Mat
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#020).md) adds, "neither on the sabbath
day," when, from fear of a breach of its sacred rest, they might be
induced to remain.

[Mark 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 13:19</span></span>

For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither
shall be--Such language is not unusual in the Old Testament with
reference to tremendous calamities. But it is matter of literal fact
that there was crowded into the period of the Jewish war an amount and
complication of suffering perhaps unparalleled; as the narrative of
JOSEPHUS, examined closely and arranged under different heads, would
show.

[Mark 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 13:20</span></span>

And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh--that is, no
human life.

should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath
shortened the days--But for this merciful "shortening," brought about by
a remarkable concurrence of causes, the whole nation would have
perished, in which there yet remained a remnant to be afterwards
gathered out. This portion of the prophecy closes, in Luke, with the
following vivid and important glance at the subsequent fortunes of the
chosen people: "And they shall fall by the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" ([Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md). The language as well as the
idea of this remarkable statement is taken from [Dan
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#010.md), [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md). What, then, is its import here?
It implies, first, that a time is coming when Jerusalem shall cease to
be "trodden down of the Gentiles"; which it was then by pagan, and since
and till now is by Mohammedan unbelievers: and next, it implies that the
period when this treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles is to cease
will be when "the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" or "completed."
But what does this mean? We may gather the meaning of it from Rom.
11:1-36 in which the divine purposes and procedure towards the chosen
people from first to last are treated in detail. In [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md) these words of our Lord are thus
reproduced: "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of
this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
Gentiles be come in." See the exposition of that verse, from which it
will appear that "till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in"--or, in
our Lord's phraseology, "till the times of the Gentiles be
fulfilled"--does not mean "till the general conversion of the world to
Christ," but "till the Gentiles have had their full time of that place
in the Church which the Jews had before them." After that period of
Gentilism, as before of Judaism, "Jerusalem" and Israel, no longer
"trodden down by the Gentiles," but "grafted into their own olive tree,"
shall constitute, with the believing Gentiles, one Church of God, and
fill the whole earth. What a bright vista does this open up!

[Mark 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 13:21</span></span>

And then, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo he is
there; believe him not--So [Luk 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023.md).
No one can read JOSEPHUS' account of what took place before the
destruction of Jerusalem without seeing how strikingly this was
fulfilled.

to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect--implying that this,
though all but done, will prove impossible. What a precious assurance!
(Compare [Th2 2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009).md).

[Mark 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 13:23</span></span>

But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things--He had just
told them that the seduction of the elect would prove impossible; but
since this would be all but accomplished, He bids them be on their
guard, as the proper means of averting that catastrophe. In Matthew
([Mat 24:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#026).md) we have some
additional particulars: "Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold,
He is in the desert; go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers;
believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be." See
on [Luk 17:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023.md). "For wheresoever the
carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together." See on [Luk
17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037.md).

[Mark 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 13:24</span></span>

But in those days, after that tribulation--"Immediately after the
tribulation of those days" ([Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md).

the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.

[Mark 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 13:25</span></span>

And the stars of heaven shall fall--"and upon the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts
failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth" ([Luk 21:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025).md).

and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken--Though the grandeur
of this language carries the mind over the head of all periods but that
of Christ's Second Coming, nearly every expression will be found used of
the Lord's coming in terrible national judgments: as of Babylon ([Isa
13:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#009).md); of Idumea ([Isa
34:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md), [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md), [Isa
34:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008).md); of Egypt ([Eze
32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007).md); compare also [Psa
18:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md); [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001.md), [Isa
24:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md); [Joe
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#010.md), &c. We cannot therefore
consider the mere strength of this language a proof that it refers
exclusively or primarily to the precursors of the final day, though of
course in "that day" it will have its most awful fulfilment.

[Mark 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 13:26</span></span>

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great
power and glory--In [Mat 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#030.md), this
is given most fully: "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man
in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
shall see the Son of man," &c. That this language finds its highest
interpretation in the Second Personal Coming of Christ, is most certain.
But the question is, whether that be the primary sense of it as it
stands here? Now if the reader will turn to [Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), and connect with it the
preceding verses, he will find, we think, the true key to our Lord's
meaning here. There the powers that oppressed the Church--symbolized by
rapacious wild beasts--are summoned to the bar of the Great God, who as
the Ancient of days seats Himself, with His assessors, on a burning
Throne: thousand thousands ministering to Him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand standing before Him. "The judgment is set, and the books
are opened." Who that is guided by the mere words would doubt that this
is a description of the Final Judgment? And yet nothing is clearer than
that it is not, but a description of a vast temporal judgment, upon
organized bodies of men, for their incurable hostility to the kingdom of
God upon earth. Well, after the doom of these has been pronounced and
executed, and room thus prepared for the unobstructed development of the
kingdom of God over the earth, what follows? "I saw in the night
visions, and behold, one like THE SON OF MAN came with the clouds of
heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they \[the angelic
attendants\] brought Him near before Him." For what purpose? To receive
investiture in the kingdom, which, as Messiah, of right belonged to Him.
Accordingly, it is added, "And there was given Him dominion, and glory,
and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve
Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,
and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed." Comparing this with
our Lord's words, He seems to us, by "the Son of man \[on which phrase,
see on [Joh 1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051.md)\] coming in the
clouds with great power and glory," to mean, that when judicial
vengeance shall once have been executed upon Jerusalem, and the ground
thus cleared for the unobstructed establishment of His own kingdom, His
true regal claims and rights would be visibly and gloriously asserted
and manifested. See on [Luk 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028.md) (with
its parallels in [Mat 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md); [Mar
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002).md), in which nearly the same
language is employed, and where it can hardly be understood of anything
else than the full and free establishment of the kingdom of Christ on
the destruction of Jerusalem. But what is that "sign of the Son of man
in heaven?" Interpreters are not agreed. But as before Christ came to
destroy Jerusalem some appalling portents were seen in the air, so
before His Personal appearing it is likely that something analogous will
be witnessed, though of what nature it would be vain to conjecture.

[Mark 13:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 13:27</span></span>

And then shall he send his angels--"with a great sound of a trumpet"
([Mat 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).md).

and shall gather together his elect, &c.--As the tribes of Israel were
anciently gathered together by sound of trumpet ([Exo
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013.md), [Exo
19:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md); [Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md); [Psa
81:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#003).md), so any mighty gathering of
God's people, by divine command, is represented as collected by sound of
trumpet ([Isa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013.md); compare [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md); and the ministry of angels,
employed in all the great operations of Providence, is here held forth
as the agency by which the present assembling of the elect is to be
accomplished. LIGHTFOOT thus explains it: "When Jerusalem shall be
reduced to ashes, and that wicked nation cut off and rejected, then
shall the Son of man send His ministers with the trumpet of the Gospel,
and they shall gather His elect of the several nations, from the four
corners of heaven: so that God shall not want a Church, although that
ancient people of His be rejected and cast off: but that ancient Jewish
Church being destroyed, a new Church shall be called out of the
Gentiles." But though something like this appears to be the primary
sense of the verse, in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem, no one
can fail to see that the language swells beyond any gathering of a human
family into a Church upon earth, and forces the thoughts onward to that
gathering of the Church "at the last trump," to meet the Lord in the
air, which is to wind up the present scene. Still, this is not, in our
judgment, the direct subject of the prediction; for [Mar
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md) limits the whole prediction to
the generation then existing.

[Mark 13:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 13:28</span></span>

Now learn a parable of the fig tree--"Now from the fig tree learn the
parable," or the high lesson which this teaches.

When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves--"its leaves."

[Mark 13:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 13:29</span></span>

So ye, in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
pass--rather, "coming to pass."

know that it--"the kingdom of God" ([Luk
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#031).md).

is nigh, even at the doors--that is, the full manifestation of it; for
till then it admitted of no full development. In Luke ([Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028).md) the following words precede
these: "And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh"--their redemption,
in the first instance certainly, from Jewish oppression ([Th1
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md); [Luk
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052).md): but in the highest sense of
these words, redemption from all the oppressions and miseries of the
present state at the second appearing of the Lord Jesus.

[Mark 13:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 13:30</span></span>

Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass fill all
these things be done--or "fulfilled" ([Mat
24:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#034.md); [Luk
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#032).md). Whether we take this to mean
that the whole would be fulfilled within the limits of the generation
then current, or, according to a usual way of speaking, that the
generation then existing would not pass away without seeing a begun
fulfilment of this prediction, the facts entirely correspond. For either
the whole was fulfilled in the destruction accomplished by Titus, as
many think; or, if we stretch it out, according to others, till the
thorough dispersion of the Jews a little later, under Adrian, every
requirement of our Lord's words seems to be met.

[Mark 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 13:31</span></span>

Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away--the
strongest possible expression of the divine authority by which He spake;
not as Moses or Paul might have said of their own inspiration, for such
language would be unsuitable in any merely human mouth.

Warnings to Prepare for the Coming of Christ Suggested by the Foregoing
Prophecy ([Mar 13:32-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032).md).

It will be observed that, in the foregoing prophecy, as our Lord
approaches the crisis of the day of vengeance on Jerusalem and
redemption for the Church--at which stage the analogy between that and
the day of final vengeance and redemption waxes more striking--His
language rises and swells beyond all temporal and partial vengeance,
beyond all earthly deliverances and enlargements, and ushers us
resistlessly into the scenes of the final day. Accordingly, in these six
concluding verses it is manifest that preparation for "THAT DAY" is what
our Lord designs to inculcate.

[Mark 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 13:32</span></span>

But of that day and that hour--that is, the precise time.

knoweth no man--literally, no one.

no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the
Father--This very remarkable statement regarding "the Son" is peculiar
to Mark. Whether it means that the Son was not at that time in
possession of the knowledge referred to, or simply that it was not among
the things which He had received to communicate--has been matter of much
controversy even among the firmest believers in the proper Divinity of
Christ. In the latter sense it was taken by some of the most eminent of
the ancient Fathers, and by LUTHER, MELANCTHON, and most of the older
Lutherans; and it is so taken by BENGEL, LANGE, WEBSTER and WILKINSON,
CHRYSOSTOM and others understood it to mean that as man our Lord was
ignorant of this. It is taken literally by CALVIN, GROTIUS, DE WETTE,
MEYER, FRITZSCHE, STIER, ALFORD, and ALEXANDER.

[Mark 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 13:33</span></span>

Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.

[Mark 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 13:34</span></span>

For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, &c.--The idea thus
far is similar to that in the opening part of the parable of the talents
([Mat 25:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#014).md).

and commanded the porter--the gatekeeper.

to watch--pointing to the official duty of the ministers of religion to
give warning of approaching danger to the people.

[Mark 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 13:35</span></span>

Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh,
at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning--an
allusion to the four Roman watches of the night.

[Mark 13:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 13:36</span></span>

Lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping--See on [Luk
12:35-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md); [Luk
12:42-46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md).

[Mark 13:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 13:37</span></span>

And what I say unto you--this discourse, it will be remembered, was
delivered in private.

I say unto all, Watch--anticipating and requiring the diffusion of His
teaching by them among all His disciples, and its perpetuation through
all time.
