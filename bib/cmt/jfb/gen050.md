### [Genesis Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 50:1</span></span>

MOURNING FOR JACOB. (Gen. 50:1-26)

Joseph fell upon his father's face, &c.--On him, as the principal member
of the family, devolved the duty of closing the eyes of his venerable
parent (compare [Gen 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#004).md) and
imprinting the farewell kiss.

[Genesis 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 50:2</span></span>

Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father,
&c.--In ancient Egypt the embalmers were a class by themselves. The
process of embalmment consisted in infusing a great quantity of resinous
substances into the cavities of the body, after the intestines had been
removed, and then a regulated degree of heat was applied to dry up the
humors, as well as decompose the tarry materials which had been
previously introduced. Thirty days were alloted for the completion of
this process; forty more were spent in anointing it with spices; the
body, tanned from this operation, being then washed, was wrapped in
numerous folds of linen cloth--the joinings of which were fastened with
gum, and then it was deposited in a wooden chest made in the form of a
human figure.

[Genesis 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 50:3</span></span>

the Egyptians mourned, &c. It was made a period of public mourning, as
on the death of a royal personage.

[Genesis 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 50:4</span></span>

Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, &c.--Care was taken to let it be
known that the family sepulchre was provided before leaving Canaan and
that an oath bound his family to convey the remains thither. Besides,
Joseph deemed it right to apply for a special leave of absence; and
being unfit, as a mourner, to appear in the royal presence, he made the
request through the medium of others.

[Genesis 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 50:7</span></span>

Joseph went up to bury his father--a journey of three hundred miles. The
funeral cavalcade, composed of the nobility and military, with their
equipages, would exhibit an imposing appearance.

[Genesis 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 50:10</span></span>

they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, &c.--"Atad" may be taken as a
common noun, signifying "the plain of the thorn bushes." It was on the
border between Egypt and Canaan; and as the last opportunity of
indulging grief was always the most violent, the Egyptians made a
prolonged halt at this spot, while the family of Jacob probably
proceeded by themselves to the place of sepulture.

[Genesis 50:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 50:15</span></span>

When Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph
will peradventure hate us, &c.--Joseph was deeply affected by this
communication. He gave them the strongest assurances of his forgiveness
and thereby gave both a beautiful trait of his own pious character, as
well as appeared an eminent type of the Saviour.

[Genesis 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 50:22</span></span>

Joseph dwelt in Egypt--He lived eighty years after his elevation to the
chief power \[see on [Gen 41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md)\]
witnessing a great increase in the prosperity of the kingdom, and also
of his own family and kindred--the infant Church of God.

[Genesis 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 50:24</span></span>

Joseph said unto his brethren, I die--The national feelings of the
Egyptians would have been opposed to his burial in Canaan; but he gave
the strongest proof of the strength of his faith and full assurance of
the promises, by "the commandment concerning his bones" \[[Heb
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md)\].

[Genesis 50:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 50:26</span></span>

and they embalmed him--\[See on [Gen
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#002.md)\]. His funeral would be conducted
in the highest style of Egyptian magnificence and his mummied corpse
carefully preserved till the Exodus.
