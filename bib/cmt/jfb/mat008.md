### [Matthew Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mat 8:1</span></span>

HEALING OF A LEPER. ( = [Mar 1:40-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md);
[Luk 5:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).md). ([Mat
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001).md)

When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

[Matthew 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mat 8:2</span></span>

And, behold, there came a leper--"a man full of leprosy," says [Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md). Much has been written on this
disease of leprosy, but certain points remain still doubtful. All that
needs be said here is that it was a cutaneous disease, of a loathsome,
diffusive, and, there is reason to believe, when thoroughly pronounced,
incurable character; that though in its distinctive features it is still
found in several countries--as Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa--it
prevailed, in the form of what is called white leprosy, to an unusual
extent, and from a very early period, among the Hebrews; and that it
thus furnished to the whole nation a familiar and affecting symbol of
SIN, considered as (1) loathsome, (2) spreading, (3) incurable. And
while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and cleansing prescribed
in this case by the law of Moses (Lev. 13:1-14:57) held forth a coming
remedy "for sin and for uncleanness" ([Psa
51:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md); [Kg2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#001.md), [Kg2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#007.md), [Kg2
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#010.md), [Kg2
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#013).md), the numerous cases of
leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures of
them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work which He
came to accomplish. In this view, it deserves to be noticed that the
first of our Lord's miracles of healing recorded by Matthew is this cure
of a leper.

and worshipped him--in what sense we shall presently see. Mark says
([Mar 1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040).md), he came, "beseeching and
kneeling to Him," and Luke says ([Luk
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012).md), "he fell on his face."

saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean--As this is the
only cure of leprosy recorded by all the three first Evangelists, it was
probably the first case of the kind; and if so, this leper's faith in
the power of Christ must have been formed in him by what he had heard of
His other cures. And how striking a faith is it! He does not say he
believed Him able, but with a brevity expressive of a confidence that
knew no doubt, he says simply, "Thou canst." But of Christ's willingness
to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge of Jesus than
he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But one thing he was
sure of, that He had but to "will" it. This shows with what "worship" of
Christ this leper fell on his face before Him. Clear theological
knowledge of the Person of Christ was not then possessed even by those
who were most with Him and nearest to Him. Much less could full insight
into all that we know of the Only-begotten of the Father be expected of
this leper. But he who at that moment felt and owned that to heal an
incurable disease needed but the fiat of the Person who stood before
him, had assuredly that very faith in the germ which now casts its crown
before Him that loved us, and would at any time die for His blessed
name.

[Matthew 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mat 8:3</span></span>

And Jesus--or "He," according to another reading,--"moved with
compassion," says Mark ([Mar 1:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#041).md); a
precious addition.

put forth his hand, and touched him--Such a touch occasioned ceremonial
defilement ([Lev 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#003).md); even as the
leper's coming near enough for contact was against the Levitical
regulations ([Lev 13:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#046).md). But as the
man's faith told him there would be no case for such regulations if the
cure he hoped to experience should be accomplished, so He who had
healing in His wings transcended all such statutes.

saying, I will; be thou clean--How majestic those two words! By not
assuring the man of His power to heal him, He delightfully sets His seal
to the man's previous confession of that power; and by assuring him of
the one thing of which he had any doubt, and for which he waited--His
will to do it--He makes a claim as divine as the cure which immediately
followed it.

And immediately his leprosy was cleansed--Mark, more emphatic, says
([Mar 1:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#042).md), "And as soon as He had
spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was
cleansed"--as perfectly as instantaneously. What a contrast this to
modern pretended cures!

[Matthew 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mat 8:4</span></span>

And Jesus--"straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away" ([Mar
1:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#043).md), and

saith unto him, See thou tell no man--A hard condition this would seem
to a grateful heart, whose natural language, in such a case, is "Come,
hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my
soul" ([Psa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#016).md). We shall presently
see the reason for it.

but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that
Moses commanded-- (Lev. 14:1-57).

for a testimony unto them--a palpable witness that the Great Healer had
indeed come, and that "God had visited His people." What the sequel was,
our Evangelist Matthew does not say; but Mark thus gives it ([Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045).md): "But he went out, and began to
publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus
could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert
places: and they came to Him from every quarter." Thus--by an
over-zealous, though most natural and not very culpable, infringement of
the injunction to keep the matter quiet--was our Lord, to some extent,
thwarted in His movements. As His whole course was sublimely noiseless
([Mat 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019).md), so we find Him
repeatedly taking steps to prevent matters prematurely coming to a
crisis with Him. (But see on [Mar
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019).md). "And He withdrew Himself,"
adds Luke ([Luk 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#016).md), "into the
wilderness, and prayed"; retreating from the popular excitement into the
secret place of the Most High, and thus coming forth as dew upon the
mown grass, and as showers that water the earth ([Psa
72:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#006).md). And this is the secret both of
strength and of sweetness in the servants and followers of Christ in
every age.

[Matthew 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mat 8:19</span></span>

INCIDENTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF DISCIPLESHIP. ( = [Luk
9:57-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057).md). ([Mat
8:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#018).md)

And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest.

[Matthew 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mat 8:20</span></span>

And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head--Few as
there were of the scribes who attached themselves to Jesus, it would
appear, from his calling Him Teacher, that this one was a "disciple" in
that looser sense of the word in which it is applied to the crowds who
flocked after Him, with more or less conviction that His claims were
well founded. But from the answer which he received we are led to infer
that there was more of transient emotion--of temporary impulse--than of
intelligent principle in the speech. The preaching of Christ had riveted
and charmed him; his heart had swelled; his enthusiasm had been kindled;
and in this state of mind he will go anywhere with Him, and feels
impelled to tell Him so. "Wilt thou?" replies the Lord Jesus. "Knowest
thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may
lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them
not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds
of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the
hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head."
How affecting is this reply! And yet He rejects not this man's offer,
nor refuses him the liberty to follow Him. Only He will have him know
what he is doing, and "count the cost." He will have him weigh well the
real nature and the strength of his attachment, whether it be such as
will abide in the day of trial. If so, he will be right welcome, for
Christ puts none away. But it seems too plain that in this case that had
not been done. And so we have called this the Rash or Precipitate
Disciple.

II\. The Procrastinating or Entangled Disciple ([Mat
8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021).md).

As this is more fully given in Luke ([Luk
9:59](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#059).md), we must take both together.
"And He said unto another of His disciples, Follow Me. But he said,"

Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto him,
Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead--or, as more definitely in
Luke, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom
of God" ([Luk 9:60](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#060).md). This disciple did
not, like the former, volunteer his services, but is called by the Lord
Jesus, not only to follow, but to preach Him. And he is quite willing;
only he is not ready just yet. "Lord, I will; but"--"There is a
difficulty in the way just now; but that once removed, I am Thine." What
now is this difficulty? Was his father actually dead--lying a
corpse--having only to be buried? Impossible. As it was the practice, as
noticed on [Luk 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#012.md), to bury on the
day of death, it is not very likely that this disciple would have been
here at all if his father had just breathed his last; nor would the
Lord, if He was there, have hindered him discharging the last duties of
a son to a father. No doubt it was the common case of a son having a
frail or aged father, not likely to live long, whose head he thinks it
his duty to see under the ground ere he goes abroad. "This aged father
of mine will soon be removed; and if I might but delay till I see him
decently interred, I should then be free to preach the kingdom of God
wherever duty might call me." This view of the case will explain the
curt reply, "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the
kingdom of God." Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord, the
key to it is the different senses--a higher and a lower--in which the
same word "dead" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence
upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one
kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully
alive; to the other, only the children of light: The reigning irreligion
consists not in indifference to the common humanities of social life,
but to things spiritual and eternal: Fear not, therefore, that your
father will in your absence be neglected, and that when he breathes his
last there will not be relatives and friends ready enough to do to him
the last offices of kindness. Your wish to discharge these yourself is
natural, and to be allowed to do it a privilege not lightly to be
foregone. But the kingdom of God lies now all neglected and needy: Its
more exalted character few discern; to its paramount claims few are
alive: and to "preach" it fewer still are qualified and called: But thou
art: The Lord therefore hath need of thee: Leave, then, those claims of
nature, high though they be, to those who are dead to the still higher
claims of the kingdom of grace, which God is now erecting upon
earth--Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom
of God. And so have we here the genuine, but Procrastinating or
Entangled Disciple.

The next case is recorded only by Luke:

III\. The Irresolute or Wavering Disciple ([Luk
9:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061).md)

[Luk 9:61](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#061.md) :

And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid
them farewell which are at home at my house.

[Luk 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062.md) :

And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. But for the very different
replies given, we should hardly have discerned the difference between
this and the second case: the one man called, indeed, and the other
volunteering, as did the first; but both seemingly alike willing, and
only having a difficulty in their way just at that moment. But, by help
of what is said respectively to each, we perceive the great difference
between the two cases. From the warning given against "looking back," it
is evident that this man's discipleship was not yet thorough, his
separation from the world not entire. It is not a case of going back,
but of looking back; and as there is here a manifest reference to the
case of "Lot's wife" ([Gen 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026.md); and
see on [Luk 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032).md), we see that it is
not actual return to the world that we have here to deal with, but a
reluctance to break with it. The figure of putting one's hand to the
plough and looking back is an exceedingly vivid one, and to an
agricultural people most impressive. As ploughing requires an eye intent
on the furrow to be made, and is marred the instant one turns about, so
will they come short of salvation who prosecute the work of God with a
distracted attention, a divided heart. The reference may be chiefly to
ministers; but the application at least is general. As the image seems
plainly to have been suggested by the case of Elijah and Elisha, a
difficulty may be raised, requiring a moment's attention. When Elijah
cast his mantle about Elisha, which the youth quite understood to mean
appointing him his successor, he was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen,
the last pair held by himself. Leaving his oxen, he ran after the
prophet, and said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother,
and \[then\] I will follow thee." Was this said in the same spirit with
the same speech uttered by our disciple? Let us see. "And Elijah said
unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee." Commentators
take this to mean that Elijah had really done nothing to hinder him from
going on with all his ordinary duties. But to us it seems clear that
Elijah's intention was to try what manner of spirit the youth was
of:--"Kiss thy father and mother? And why not? By all means, go home and
stay with them; for what have I done to thee? I did but throw a mantle
about thee; but what of that?" If this was his meaning, Elisha
thoroughly apprehended and nobly met it. "He returned back from him, and
took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the
instruments of the oxen (the wood of his ploughing implements), and gave
unto the people, and they did eat: then he arose, and went after Elijah,
and ministered unto him" ([Kg1
19:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019).md). We know not if even his
father and mother had time to be called to this hasty feast. But this
much is plain, that, though in affluent circumstances, he gave up his
lower calling, with all its prospects, for the higher and at that time
perilous, office to which he was called. What now is the bearing of
these two cases? Did Elisha do wrong in bidding them farewell with whom
he was associated in his early calling? Or, if not, would this disciple
have done wrong if he had done the same thing, and in the same spirit,
with Elisha? Clearly not. Elisha's doing it proved that he could with
safety do it; and our Lord's warning is not against bidding them
farewell which were at home at his house, but against the probable fatal
consequences of that step; lest the embraces of earthly relationship
should prove too strong for him, and he should never return to follow
Christ. Accordingly, we have called this the Irresolute or Wavering
Disciple.
