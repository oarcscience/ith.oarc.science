### [Mark Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#001.md)

[Mark 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 7:24</span></span>

THE SYROPHÅ“NICIAN WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER--A DEAF AND DUMB MAN HEALED. (
= [Mat 15:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#021).md). ([Mar
7:24-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#024).md)

And from thence he arose, and went into the borders--or "unto the
borders."

of Tyre and Sidon--the two great PhÅ“nician seaports, but here denoting
the territory generally, to the frontiers of which Jesus now came. But
did Jesus actually enter this heathen territory? The whole narrative, we
think, proceeds upon the supposition that He did. His immediate object
seems to have been to avoid the wrath of the Pharisees at the withering
exposure He had just made of their traditional religion.

and entered into an house, and would have no man know it--because He had
not come there to minister to heathens. But though not "sent but to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel" ([Mat
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024).md), He hindered not the lost sheep
of the vast Gentile world from coming to Him, nor put them away when
they did come--as this incident was designed to show.

but he could not be hid--Christ's fame had early spread from Galilee to
this very region ([Mar 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008.md); [Luk
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017).md).

[Mark 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 7:25</span></span>

For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit--or, as
in Matthew ([Mat 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022).md), "was badly
demonized."

heard of him--One wonders how; but distress is quick of hearing.

[Mark 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 7:26</span></span>

The woman was a Greek--that is, "a Gentile," as in the Margin.

a SyrophÅ“nician by nation--so called as inhabiting the PhÅ“nician tract
of Syria. JUVENAL uses the same term, as was remarked by JUSTIN MARTYR
and TERTULLIAN. Matthew ([Mat 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022).md)
calls her "a woman of Canaan"--a more intelligible description to his
Jewish readers (compare [Jdg 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md),
[Jdg 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#032).md).

and she besought him that he would east forth the devil out of her
daughter--"She cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of
David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil" ([Mat
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#022).md). Thus, though no Israelite
herself, she salutes Him as Israel's promised Messiah. Here we must go
to [Mat 15:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md) for some important
links in the dialogue omitted by our Evangelist.

[Mat 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#023.md) :

But he answered her not a word--The design of this was first, perhaps,
to show that He was not sent to such as she. He had said expressly to
the Twelve, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles" ([Mat
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005).md); and being now among them
Himself, He would, for consistency's sake, let it be seen that He had
not gone thither for missionary purposes. Therefore He not only kept
silence, but had actually left the house, and--as will presently
appear--was proceeding on His way back, when this woman accosted Him.
But another reason for keeping silence plainly was to try and whet her
faith, patience, and perseverance. And it had the desired effect: "She
cried after them," which shows that He was already on His way from the
place.

And His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send her away; for she
crieth after us--They thought her troublesome with her importunate
cries, just as they did the people who brought young children to be
blessed of Him, and they ask their Lord to "send her away," that is, to
grant her request and be rid of her; for we gather from His reply that
they meant to solicit favor for her, though not for her sake so much as
their own.

[Mat 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md) :

But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
house of Israel--a speech evidently intended for the disciples
themselves, to satisfy them that, though the grace He was about to show
to this Gentile believer was beyond His strict commission, He had not
gone spontaneously to dispense it. Yet did even this speech open a gleam
of hope, could she have discerned it. For thus might she have spoken: "I
am not SENT, did He say? Truth, Lord, Thou comest not hither in quest of
us, but I come in quest of Thee; and must I go empty away? So did not
the woman of Samaria, whom when Thou foundest her on Thy way to Galilee,
Thou sentest away to make many rich! But this our poor SyrophÅ“nician
could not attain to. What, then, can she answer to such a speech?
Nothing. She has reached her lowest depth, her darkest moment: she will
just utter her last cry:

[Mat 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#025.md) :

Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!--This appeal,
so artless, wrung from the depths of a believing heart, and reminding us
of the publican's "God be merciful to me a sinner," moved the Redeemer
at last to break silence--but in what style? Here we return to our own
Evangelist.

[Mark 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 7:27</span></span>

But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled--"Is there
hope for me here? . . . Filled FIRST?" "Then my turn, it seems, is
coming! "--but then, "The CHILDREN first? . . . Ah! when, on that rule,
shall my turn ever come!" But ere she has time for these ponderings of
His word, another word comes to supplement it.

for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the
dogs--Is this the death of her hopes? Nay, rather it is life from the
dead. Out of the eater shall come forth meat ([Jdg
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#014).md). "At evening-time, it shall be
light" ([Zac 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#007).md). "Ah! I have it
now. Had He kept silence, what could I have done but go unblest? but He
hath spoken, and the victory is mine."

[Mark 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 7:28</span></span>

And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord--or, as the same word is
rendered in [Mat 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027.md). "Truth, Lord."

yet the dogs eat of the children's crumbs--which fall from their
master's table" ([Mat 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027).md). "I thank
Thee, O blessed One, for that word! That's my whole case. Not of the
children? True. A dog? True also: Yet the dogs under the table are
allowed to eat of the children's crumbs--the droppings from their
master's full table: Give me that, and I am content: One crumb of power
and grace from Thy table shall cast the devil out of my daughter." Oh,
what lightning quickness, what reach of instinctive ingenuity, do we
behold in this heathen woman!

[Mark 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 7:29</span></span>

And he said unto her--"O woman, great is thy faith" ([Mat
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028).md). As BENGEL beautifully remarks,
Jesus "marvelled" only at two things--faith and unbelief (see [Luk
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#009).md).

For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter--That
moment the deed was done.

[Mark 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 7:30</span></span>

And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and
her daughter laid upon the bed--But Matthew ([Mat
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#028).md) is more specific; "And her
daughter was made whole from that very hour." The wonderfulness of this
case in all its features has been felt in every age of the Church, and
the balm it has administered, and will yet administer, to millions will
be known only in that day that shall reveal the secrets of all hearts.

Deaf and Dumb Man Healed ([Mar
7:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031).md).

[Mark 7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 7:31</span></span>

And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the
Sea of Galilee--or, according to what has very strong claims to be
regarded as the true text here, "And again, departing from the coasts of
Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee." The manuscripts in
favor of this reading, though not the most numerous, are weighty, while
the versions agreeing with it are among the most ancient; and all the
best critical editors and commentators adopt it. In this case we must
understand that our Lord, having once gone out of the Holy Land the
length of Tyre, proceeded as far north as Sidon, though without
ministering, so far as appears, in those parts, and then bent His steps
in a southeasterly direction. There is certainly a difficulty in the
supposition of so long a detour without any missionary object: and some
may think this sufficient to cast the balance in favor of the received
reading. Be this as it may, on returning from these coasts of Tyre, He
passed

through the midst of the coasts--frontiers.

of Decapolis--crossing the Jordan, therefore, and approaching the lake
on its east side. Here Matthew, who omits the details of the cure of
this deaf and dumb man, introduces some particulars, from which we learn
that it was only one of a great number. "And Jesus," says that
Evangelist ([Mat 15:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#029).md), "departed
from thence, and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee, and went up into a
mountain"--the mountain range bounding the lake on the northeast, in
Decapolis: "And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them lame,
blind, dumb, maimed"--not "mutilated," which is but a secondary sense of
the word, but "deformed"--"and many others, and cast them down at Jesus'
feet; and He healed them: insomuch that the multitude \[multitudes\]
wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the
lame to walk, and the blind to see; and they glorified the God of
Israel"--who after so long and dreary an absence of visible
manifestation, had returned to bless His people as of old (compare [Luk
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#016).md). Beyond this it is not clear
from the Evangelist's language that the people saw into the claims of
Jesus. Well, of these cases Mark here singles out one, whose cure had
something peculiar in it.

[Mark 7:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 7:32</span></span>

And they bring unto him one that was deaf . . . and they beseech him to
put his hand upon him--In their eagerness they appear to have been
somewhat too officious. Though usually doing as here suggested, He will
deal with this case in His own way.

[Mark 7:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 7:33</span></span>

And he took him aside from the multitude--As in another case He "took
the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town" ([Mar
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023).md), probably to fix his
undistracted attention on Himself, and, by means of certain actions He
was about to do, to awaken and direct his attention to the proper source
of relief.

and put his fingers into his ears--As his indistinct articulation arose
from his deafness, our Lord addresses Himself to this first. To the
impotent man He said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" to the blind men, "What
will ye that I shall do unto you?" and "Believe ye that I am able to do
this?" ([Joh 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#006.md); [Mat
20:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#032.md); [Mat
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#028).md). But as this patient could hear
nothing, our Lord substitutes symbolical actions upon each of the organs
affected.

and he spit and touched his tongue--moistening the man's parched tongue
with saliva from His own mouth, as if to lubricate the organ or
facilitate its free motion; thus indicating the source of the healing
virtue to be His own person. (For similar actions, see [Mar
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#023.md); [Joh
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#006).md).

[Mark 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 7:34</span></span>

And looking up to heaven--ever acknowledging His Father, even while the
healing was seen to flow from Himself (see on [Joh
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019).md).

he sighed--"over the wreck," says TRENCH, "which sin had brought about,
and the malice of the devil in deforming the fair features of God's
original creation." But, we take it, there was a yet more painful
impression of that "evil thing and bitter" whence all our ills have
sprung, and which, when "Himself took our infirmities and bare our
sicknesses" ([Mat 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017).md), became
mysteriously His own.

"In thought of these his brows benign,

Not even in healing, cloudless shine."

KEBLE

and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened--Our Evangelist, as
remarked on [Mar 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041.md), loves to give
such wonderful words just as they were spoken.

[Mark 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 7:35</span></span>

And straightway his ears were opened--This is mentioned first as the
source of the other derangement.

and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain--The cure
was thus alike instantaneous and perfect.

[Mark 7:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 7:36</span></span>

And he charged them that they should tell no man--Into this very region
He had sent the man out of whom had been cast the legion of devils, to
proclaim "what the Lord had done for him" ([Mar
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019).md). Now He will have them "tell no
man." But in the former case there was no danger of obstructing His
ministry by "blazing the matter" ([Mar
1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045).md), as He Himself had left the
region; whereas now He was sojourning in it.

but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they
published it--They could not be restrained; nay, the prohibition seemed
only to whet their determination to publish His fame.

[Mark 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 7:37</span></span>

And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things
well--reminding us, says TRENCH, Of the words of the first creation
([Gen 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031), Septuagint.md), upon which we
are thus not unsuitably thrown back, for Christ's work is in the truest
sense "a new creation,"

he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak--"and they
glorified the God of Israel" ([Mat
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#031).md). See on [Mar
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#031.md).
