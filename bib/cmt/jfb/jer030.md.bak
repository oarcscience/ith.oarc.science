### [Jeremiah Chapter 30](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 30:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 30:2</span></span>

RESTORATION OF THE JEWS FROM BABYLON AFTER ITS CAPTURE, AND RAISING UP
OF MESSIAH. (Jer. 30:1-24)

Write . . . in a book--After the destruction of Jerusalem Jeremiah is
not ordered as heretofore to speak, but to write the succeeding prophecy
([Jer 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#004), &c..md), so as thereby it
might be read by his countrymen wheresoever they might be in their
dispersion.

[Jeremiah 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 30:3</span></span>

bring again . . . captivity of . . . Israel and Judah--the restoration
not merely of the Jews (treated of in this thirtieth chapter), but also
of the ten tribes ("Israel"; treated in the thirty-first chapter),
together forming the whole nation ([Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md); [Jer
32:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#044.md); [Eze
39:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025.md); [Amo
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014).md). "Israel" is mentioned first
because its exile was longer than that of Judah. Some captives of the
Israelite ten tribes returned with those of Judah ([Luk
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#036); "Aser" is mentioned.md). But these
are only a pledge of the full restoration hereafter ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026), "All Israel".md). Compare [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md). This third verse is a brief
statement of the subject before the prophecy itself is given.

[Jeremiah 30:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 30:5</span></span>

We have heard . . . trembling--God introduces the Jews speaking that
which they will be reduced to at last in spite of their stubbornness.
Threat and promise are combined: the former briefly; namely, the misery
of the Jews in the Babylonian captivity down to their "trembling" and
"fear" arising from the approach of the Medo-Persian army of Cyrus
against Babylon; the promise is more fully dwelt on; namely, their
"trembling" will issue in a deliverance as speedy as is the transition
from a woman's labor pangs to her joy at giving birth to a child ([Jer
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006).md).

[Jeremiah 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 30:6</span></span>

Ask--Consult all the authorities, men or books, you can, you will not
find an instance. Yet in that coming day men will be seen with their
hands pressed on their loins, as women do to repress their pangs. God
will drive men through pain to gestures more fitting a woman than a man
([Jer 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md); [Jer
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024).md). The metaphor is often used to
express the previous pain followed by the sudden deliverance of Israel,
as in the case of a woman in childbirth ([Isa
66:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007).md).

paleness--properly the color of herbs blasted and fading: the green
paleness of one in jaundice: the sickly paleness of terror.

[Jeremiah 30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 30:7</span></span>

great--marked by great calamities ([Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011.md), [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md); [Zep
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014).md).

none like it . . . but he shall be saved-- ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001).md). The partial deliverance at
Babylon's downfall prefigures the final, complete deliverance of Israel,
literal and spiritual, at the downfall of the mystical Babylon (Rev.
18:1-19:21).

[Jeremiah 30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 30:8</span></span>

his yoke . . . thy neck--his, that is, Jacob's ([Jer
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#007).md), the yoke imposed on him. The
transition to the second person is frequent, God speaking of Jacob or
Israel, at the same time addressing him directly. So "him" rightly
follows; "foreigners shall no more make him their servant" ([Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014).md). After the deliverance by
Cyrus, Persia, Alexander, Antiochus, and Rome made Judah their servant.
The full of deliverance meant must, therefore, be still future.

[Jeremiah 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 30:9</span></span>

Instead of serving strangers ([Jer
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#008).md), they shall serve the Lord,
their rightful King in the theocracy ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md).

David, their king--No king of David's seed has held the scepter since
the captivity; for Zerubbabel, though of David's line, never claimed the
title of "king." The Son of David, Messiah, must therefore be meant; so
the Targum (compare [Isa 55:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md); [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md); [Rom
11:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025).md). He was appointed to the
throne of David ([Isa 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md); [Luk
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032).md). He is here joined with Jehovah
as claiming equal allegiance. God is our "King," only when we are
subject to Christ; God rules us not immediately, but through His Son
([Joh 5:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027).md).

raise up--applied to the judges whom God raised up as deliverers of
Israel out of the hand of its oppressors ([Jdg
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#016.md); [Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009).md). So Christ was raised up as the
antitypical Deliverer ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069.md); [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md); [Act
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#023).md).

[Jeremiah 30:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 30:10</span></span>

from afar--Be not afraid as if the distance of the places whither ye are
to be dispersed precludes the possibility of return.

seed--Though through the many years of captivity intervening, you
yourselves may not see the restoration, the promise shall be fulfilled
to your seed, primarily at the return from Babylon, fully at the final
restoration.

quiet . . . none . . . make . . . afraid-- ([Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md); [Zac
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 30:11</span></span>

though . . . full end of all nations . . . yet . . . not . . . of thee--
([Amo 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008).md). The punishment of
reprobates is final and fatal; that of God's people temporary and
corrective. Babylon was utterly destroyed: Israel after chastisement was
delivered.

in measure--literally, "with judgment," that is, moderation, not in the
full rigor of justice ([Jer 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024.md);
[Jer 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028.md); [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001.md); [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md).

not . . . altogether unpunished-- ([Exo
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 30:12</span></span>

The desperate circumstances of the Jews are here represented as an
incurable wound. Their sin is so grievous that their hope of the
punishment (their exile) soon coming to an end is vain ([Jer
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018.md); [Ch2
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 30:13</span></span>

none to plead--a new image from a court of justice.

bound up--namely, with the bandages applied to tie up a wound.

no healing medicines--literally, "medicines of healing," or else
applications, (literally, "ascensions") of medicaments.

[Jeremiah 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 30:14</span></span>

lovers--the peoples formerly allied to thee, Assyria and Egypt (compare
[Lam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002).md).

seek thee not--have cast away all concern for thee in thy distress.

wound of an enemy--a wound such as an enemy would inflict. God
condescends to employ language adapted to human conceptions. He is
incapable of "enmity" or "cruelty"; it was their grievous sin which
righteously demanded a grievous punishment, as though He were an "enemy"
([Jer 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006.md); [Job
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#024.md); [Job
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 30:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 30:15</span></span>

Why criest thou--as if God's severity was excessive. Thou hast no reason
to complain, for thine affliction is just. Thy cry is too late, for the
time of repentance and mercy is past \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 30:16</span></span>

Therefore--connected with [Jer 30:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#013.md),
because "There is none to plead thy cause . . . therefore" I will plead
thy cause, and heal thy wound, by overwhelming thy foes. This fifteenth
verse is inserted to amplify what was said at the close of [Jer
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014.md). When the false ways of peace,
suggested by the so-called prophets, had only ended in the people's
irremediable ruin, the true prophet comes forward to announce the grace
of God as bestowing repentance and healing.

devour thee . . . be devoured . . . spoil . . . be a spoil . . . prey
upon . . . give for a prey--retribution in kind (see on [Jer
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#003.md); [Exo
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#022.md); [Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 30:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 30:17</span></span>

([Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); [Jer
33:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#006).md).

Outcast--as a wife put away by her husband ([Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004.md), contrasted with [Jer
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012).md).

Zion--alluding to its Hebrew meaning, "dryness"; "sought after" by none,
as would be the case with an arid region ([Isa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012).md). The extremity of the people,
so far from being an obstacle to, will be the chosen opportunity of,
God's grace.

[Jeremiah 30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 30:18</span></span>

bring again . . . captivity-- ([Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007.md), [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011).md).

tents--used to intimate that their present dwellings in Chaldea were but
temporary as tents.

have mercy on dwelling-places-- ([Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013).md).

own heap--on the same hill, that is, site, a hill being the usual site
chosen for a city (compare [Jos 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#013.md),
Margin). This better answers the parallel clause, "after the manner
thereof" (that is, in the same becoming ways as formerly), than the
rendering, "its own heap of ruins," as in [Jer
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#002.md).

palace--the king's, on Mount Zion.

remain--rather, "shall be inhabited" (see on [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md), [Jer
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025).md). This confirms English Version,
"palace," not as others translate, "the temple" (see [Kg1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#018.md); [Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025).md).

[Jeremiah 30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 30:19</span></span>

thanksgiving--The Hebrew word includes confession as well as praise;
for, in the case of God, the highest praises we can bestow are only
confessing what God really is \[BENGEL\], ([Jer
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026.md); [Jer
31:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012.md); [Jer
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#011.md); [Isa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md); [Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011).md).

multiply them-- ([Zac 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 30:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 30:20</span></span>

as aforetime--as flourishing as in the time of David.

[Jeremiah 30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 30:21</span></span>

their nobles--rather, "their Glorious One," or "Leader" (compare [Act
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md), answering to "their Governor"
in the parallel clause.

of themselves--of their own nation, a Jew, not a foreigner; applicable
to Zerubbabel, or J. Hyrcanus (hereditary high priest and governor),
only as types of Christ ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md);
[Mic 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md); [Rom
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005).md), the antitypical "David" ([Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009).md).

cause him to draw near--as the great Priest ([Exo
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#022.md); [Lev
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#017).md), through whom believers also
have access to God ([Heb 10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019).md).
His priestly and kingly characters are similarly combined ([Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013).md).

who . . . engaged . . . heart to approach--literally, "pledged his
heart," that is, his life; a thing unique; Messiah alone has made His
life responsible as the surety ([Heb
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#022.md); [Heb
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md), in order to gain access not
only for Himself, but for us to God. Heart is here used for life, to
express the courage which it needed to undertake such a tremendous
suretyship. The question implies admiration at one being found competent
by His twofold nature, as God and man, for the task. Compare the
interrogation ([Isa 63:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 30:22</span></span>

ye shall be my people, &c.--The covenant shall be renewed between God
and His people through Messiah's mediation ([Jer
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#021.md); [Jer
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001.md), [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md); [Jer
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#038.md); [Eze
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020.md); [Eze
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 30:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 30:23</span></span>

([Jer 23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019).md). Vengeance upon God's
foes always accompanies manifestations of His grace to His people.

continuing--literally, "sojourning," abiding constantly; appropriately
here in the case of Babylon, which was to be permanently destroyed,
substituted for "whirling itself about" ("grievous" in English Version)
(see on [Jer 23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019).md), where the
temporary downfall of Judea is spoken of.

As in that chapter the restoration of Judah, so in this the restoration
of Israel's ten tribes is foretold.
