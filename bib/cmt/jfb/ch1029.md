### [1 Chronicles Chapter 29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 29:1</span></span>

DAVID CAUSES THE PRINCES AND PEOPLE TO OFFER FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD. ([Ch1
29:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md)

Solomon . . . is yet young and tender--Though Solomon was very young
when he was raised to the sovereign power, his kingdom escaped the woe
pronounced ([Ecc 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016).md). Mere
childhood in a prince is not always a misfortune to a nation, as there
are instances of the government being wisely administered during a
minority. Solomon himself is a most illustrious proof that a young
prince may prove a great blessing; for when he was but a mere child,
with respect to his age, no nation was happier. His father, however,
made this address before Solomon was endowed with the divine gift of
wisdom, and David's reference to his son's extreme youth, in connection
with the great national undertaking he had been divinely appointed to
execute, was to apologize to this assembly of the estates--or, rather,
to assign the reason of his elaborate preparations for the work.

[1 Chronicles 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 29:3</span></span>

Moreover . . . I have of mine own proper good, &c.--In addition to the
immense amount of gold and silver treasure which David had already
bequeathed for various uses in the service of the temple, he now made an
additional contribution destined to a specific purpose--that of
overlaying the walls of the house. This voluntary gift was from the
private fortune of the royal donor, and had been selected with the
greatest care. The gold was "the gold of Ophir," then esteemed the
purest and finest in the world ([Job
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#024.md); [Job
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#016.md); [Isa
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#012).md). The amount was three thousand
talents of gold and seven thousand talents of refined silver.

[1 Chronicles 29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 29:5</span></span>

who then is willing to consecrate his service--Hebrew, "fill his hand";
that is, make an offering ([Exo 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#029.md);
[Lev 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#033.md); [Kg1
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#033).md). The meaning is, that whoever
would contribute voluntarily, as he had done, would be offering a
freewill offering to the Lord. It was a sacrifice which every one of
them could make, and in presenting which the offerer himself would be
the priest. David, in asking freewill offerings for the temple, imitated
the conduct of Moses in reference to the tabernacle ([Exo
25:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#001).md).

[1 Chronicles 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 29:6</span></span>

Then the chief of the fathers--or heads of the fathers ([Ch1
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#031.md); [Ch1
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#001).md).

princes of the tribes-- ([Ch1
27:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#016).md).

rulers of the king's work--those who had charge of the royal demesnes
and other possessions ([Ch1 27:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/ch1027.htm#025).md).

offered willingly--Influenced by the persuasive address and example of
the king, they acted according to their several abilities, and their
united contributions amounted to the gross sum--of gold 5,000 talents
and 10,000 drams; and of silver, 10,000 talents, besides brass and iron.

[1 Chronicles 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 29:7</span></span>

drams--rather, darics, a Persian coin, with which the Jews from the time
of the captivity became familiar, and which was afterwards extensively
circulated in the countries of Western Asia. It is estimated as equal in
value to 25s. of British currency.

of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of
iron--In Scripture, iron is always referred to as an article of
comparatively low value, and of greater abundance and cheaper than
bronze \[NAPIER\].

[1 Chronicles 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 29:8</span></span>

and they with whom precious stones were found--rather, "whatever was
found along with it of precious stones they gave" \[BERTHEAU\]. These
gifts were deposited in the hands of Jehiel, whose family was charged
with the treasures of the house of the Lord ([Ch1
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#021).md).

[1 Chronicles 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch1 29:10</span></span>

HIS THANKSGIVING. (1Ch. 29:10-25)

Wherefore David blessed the Lord--This beautiful thanksgiving prayer was
the effusion overflowing with gratitude and delight at seeing the warm
and widespread interest that was now taken in forwarding the favorite
project of his life. Its piety is displayed in the fervor of devotional
feeling--in the ascription of all worldly wealth and greatness to God as
the giver, in tracing the general readiness in contributing to the
influence of His grace, in praying for the continuance of this happy
disposition among the people, and in solemnly and earnestly commending
the young king and his kingdom to the care and blessing of God.

[1 Chronicles 29:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 29:16</span></span>

all this store that we have prepared--It may be useful to exhibit a
tabular view of the treasure laid up and contributions stated by the
historian as already made towards the erection of the proposed temple.
Omitting the brass and iron, and precious stones, which, though
specified partly ([Ch1 29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007).md), are
represented in other portions as "without weight" ([Ch1
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#003.md), [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014).md), we shall give in this table
only the amount of gold and silver; and taking the talent of gold as
worth Â£5475 (the talent being 125 pounds in weight), the value of the
gold will be about 73s. per ounce. The talent of silver is given at
Â£342 3s. 9d., or 4s. 41/2d. per ounce. The total amount of the
contributions will be:

Sum accumulated, and in public treasury ([Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014).md):

Gold Â£547,500,000

Silver 342,187,500

Contributed by David from his private resources \[[Ch1
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#004.md)\]:

Gold 16,425,000

Silver 2,395,312

Contributed by the assembled rulers \[[Ch1
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#007.md)\]:

Gold 28,000,000

Silver 3,421,875

A grand total of approximately Â£939,929,687

Though it has been the common practice of Eastern monarchs to hoard vast
sums for the accomplishment of any contemplated project, this amount so
far exceeds not only every Oriental collection on record, but even the
bounds of probability, that it is very generally allowed that either
there is a corruption of the text in [Ch1
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014.md), or that the reckoning of the
historian was by the Babylonian, which was only a half, or the Syrian,
which was only a fifth part, of the Hebrew talent. This would bring the
Scripture account more into accordance with the statements of JOSEPHUS,
as well as within the range of credibility.

[1 Chronicles 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch1 29:20</span></span>

all the congregation . . . worshipped the Lord, and the king--Though the
external attitude might be the same, the sentiments of which it was
expressive were very different in the two cases--of divine worship in
the one, of civil homage in the other.

[1 Chronicles 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 29:21</span></span>

they sacrificed . . . And did eat and drink--After the business of the
assembly was over, the people, under the exciting influence of the
occasion, still remained, and next day engaged in the performance of
solemn rites, and afterwards feasted on the remainder of the sacrifices.

[1 Chronicles 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 29:22</span></span>

before the Lord--either in the immediate vicinity of the ark, or,
perhaps, rather in a religious and devout spirit, as partaking of a
sacrificial meal.

made Solomon . . . king the second time--in reference to the first time,
which was done precipitately on Adonijah's conspiracy ([Kg1
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#035).md).

they . . . anointed . . . Zadok--The statement implies that his
appointment met the popular approval. His elevation as sole high priest
was on the disgrace of Abiathar, one of Adonijah's accomplices.

[1 Chronicles 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 29:23</span></span>

Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord--As king of Israel, he was the
Lord's vicegerent.

[1 Chronicles 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch1 29:24</span></span>

submitted themselves--Hebrew, "put their hands under Solomon," according
to the custom still practised in the East of putting a hand under the
king's extended hand and kissing the back of it ([Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015).md).

[1 Chronicles 29:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 29:26</span></span>

HIS REIGN AND DEATH. ([Ch1 29:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#026).md)

Thus David . . . reigned--(See [Kg1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#011).md).
