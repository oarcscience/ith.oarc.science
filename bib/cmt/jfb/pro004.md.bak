### [Proverbs Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 4:1</span></span>

To an earnest call for attention to his teachings, the writer adds a
commendation of wisdom, preceded and enforced by the counsels of his
father and teacher. To this he adds a caution (against the devices of
the wicked), and a series of exhortations to docility, integrity, and
uprightness. (Pro. 4:1-27)

(Compare [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008).md).

to know--in order to know.

doctrine--the matter of learning ([Pro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#005).md), such as he had received ([Lam
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#001).md).

[Proverbs 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 4:3</span></span>

father's son--emphatic, a son specially regarded, and so called tender,
as an object of special care (compare [Ch1
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#007.md); [Ch1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#001).md); an idea further expressed by

only beloved--or, "as an only son" ([Gen
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002).md), though he had brothers (see on
[Ch1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1003.htm#005).md).

[Proverbs 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 4:4</span></span>

He taught--or directed me.

retain--as well as receive.

keep . . . and live--observe, that you may live ([Pro
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002).md).

[Proverbs 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 4:5</span></span>

Get--as a possession not to be given up.

neither decline--that is, from obeying my word.

[Proverbs 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 4:6</span></span>

Not only accept but love wisdom, who will keep thee from evil, and evil
from thee.

[Proverbs 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pro 4:7</span></span>

(Compare [Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028).md).

getting--or possession; a desire for wisdom is wise.

[Proverbs 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 4:8</span></span>

As you highly esteem her, she will raise you to honor.

embrace her--with fond affection.

[Proverbs 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 4:9</span></span>

ornament--such as the chaplet or wreath of conquerors.

deliver--(Compare [Gen 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#020).md). The
allusion to a shield, contained in the Hebrew, suggests protection as
well as honor (compare [Pro 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#006).md).

[Proverbs 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 4:10</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#001.md); [Pro
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#002).md).

[Proverbs 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 4:11</span></span>

way of wisdom--which it prescribes.

led thee--literally, "caused thee to tread," as a path ([Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007).md).

not be straitened--have ample room ([Psa
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036).md).

[Proverbs 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 4:13</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018).md). The figure of
laying hold with the hand suggests earnest effort.

[Proverbs 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 4:14</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001).md). Avoid all
temptations to the beginning of evil.

[Proverbs 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 4:16</span></span>

The reason is found in the character of sinners, whose zeal to do evil
is forcibly depicted ([Pro 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004.md); [Psa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005).md). They live by flagrant vices
([Pro 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#013).md). Some prefer to render,
"Their bread is wickedness, their drink violence" (compare [Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md); [Job
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007).md).

[Proverbs 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 4:18</span></span>

As shining light increases from twilight to noonday splendor, so the
course of the just increases in purity, but that of the wicked is as
thickest darkness, in which one knows not on what he stumbles.

[Proverbs 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 4:20</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#010.md), [Pro
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#013.md); [Pro
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008), &c..md).

[Proverbs 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 4:22</span></span>

health . . . flesh--by preserving from vices destructive of health.

[Proverbs 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 4:23</span></span>

with all diligence--or, "above," or "more than all," custody (compare
Margin), all that is kept (compare [Eze
38:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#007).md), because the heart is the
depository of all wisdom and the source of whatever affects life and
character ([Mat 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035.md); [Mat
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019).md).

[Proverbs 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 4:24</span></span>

a froward mouth--that is, a mouth, or words of ill nature. The Hebrew
word differs from that used ([Pro
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#015.md); [Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032).md).

perverse--or, "quarreling."

lips--or, "words."

[Proverbs 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 4:25</span></span>

Let . . . before thee--that is, pursue a sincere and direct purpose,
avoiding temptations.

[Proverbs 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 4:26</span></span>

Ponder--Consider well; a wise course results from wise forethought.

[Proverbs 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 4:27</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#025).md). Avoid all
by-paths of evil ([Deu 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#027.md); [Deu
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#011).md). A life of integrity requires
attention to heart, speech, eyes, and conduct.
