### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 2:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 2:1-26)

I said . . . heart-- ([Luk 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019).md).

thee--my heart, I will test whether thou canst find that solid good in
pleasure which was not in "worldly wisdom." But this also proves to be
"vanity" ([Isa 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 2:2</span></span>

laughter--including prosperity, and joy in general ([Job
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021).md).

mad--that is, when made the chief good; it is harmless in its proper
place.

What doeth it?--Of what avail is it in giving solid good? ([Ecc
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#006.md); [Pro
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#013).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 2:3</span></span>

Illustration more at large of [Ecc
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001.md).

I sought--I resolved, after search into many plans.

give myself unto wine--literally, "to draw my flesh," or "body to wine"
(including all banquetings). Image from a captive drawn after a chariot
in triumph ([Rom 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016.md), [Rom
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md); [Co1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#002).md); or, one "allured" ([Pe2
2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018).md).

yet acquainting . . . wisdom--literally, "and my heart (still) was
behaving, or guiding itself," with wisdom \[GESENIUS\]. MAURER
translates: "was weary of (worldly) wisdom." But the end of [Ecc
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md) confirms English Version.

folly--namely, pleasures of the flesh, termed "mad," [Ecc
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002.md).

all the days, &c.--(See Margin and [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md); [Job
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 2:4</span></span>

([Kg1 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001.md); [Kg1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#001.md), [Kg1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#019.md); [Kg1
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018), &c..md).

vineyards-- ([Sol 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 2:5</span></span>

gardens--Hebrew, "paradises," a foreign word; Sanskrit, "a place
enclosed with a wall"; Armenian and Arabic, "a pleasure ground with
flowers and shrubs near the king's house, or castle." An earthly
paradise can never make up for the want of the heavenly ([Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 2:6</span></span>

pools--artificial, for irrigating the soil ([Gen
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#010.md); [Neh
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014.md); [Isa
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#030).md). Three such reservoirs are still
found, called Solomon's cisterns, a mile and a half from Jerusalem.

wood that bringeth forth--rather, "the grove that flourisheth with
trees" \[LOWTH\].

[Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 2:7</span></span>

born in my house--These were esteemed more trustworthy servants than
those bought ([Gen 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#014.md); [Gen
15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md); [Gen
17:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#012.md), [Gen
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#027.md); [Jer
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#014).md), called "songs of one's
handmaid" ([Exo 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#012.md); compare [Gen
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 2:8</span></span>

([Kg1 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027.md); [Ch2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#015.md); [Ch2
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#020).md).

peculiar treasure of kings and . . . provinces--contributed by them, as
tributary to him ([Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md), [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024).md); a poor substitute for the
wisdom whose "gain is better than fine gold" ([Pro
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#014).md).

singers--so David ([Sa2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#035).md).

musical instruments . . . of all sorts--introduced at banquets ([Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Amo
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005).md); rather, "a princess and
princesses," from an Arabic root. One regular wife, or queen ([Est
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/est001.htm#009).md); Pharaoh's daughter ([Kg1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001).md); other secondary wives,
"princesses," distinct from the "concubines" ([Kg1
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#003.md); [Psa
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#010.md); [Sol
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#008).md) \[WEISS, GESENIUS\]. Had these
been omitted, the enumeration would be incomplete.

[Ecclesiastes 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 2:9</span></span>

great--opulent ([Gen 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#035.md); [Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003.md); see [Kg1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#023).md).

remained-- ([Ecc 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#003).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 2:10</span></span>

my labour--in procuring pleasures.

this--evanescent "joy" was my only "portion out of all my labor" ([Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md); [Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009.md); [Kg1
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#005).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 2:11</span></span>

But all these I felt were only "vanity," and of "no profit" as to the
chief good. "Wisdom" (worldly common sense, sagacity), which still
"remained with me" ([Ecc 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#009).md), showed
me that these could not give solid happiness.

[Ecclesiastes 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 2:12</span></span>

He had tried (worldly) wisdom ([Ecc
1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#012)) and folly (foolish pleasure.md)
([Ecc 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001).md); he now compares them
([Ecc 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#012).md) and finds that while
(worldly)

wisdom excelleth folly ([Ecc 2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013).md),
yet the one event, death, befalls both ([Ecc
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014).md), and that thus the wealth
acquired by the wise man's "labor" may descend to a "fool" that hath not
labored ([Ecc 2:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md), [Ecc
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021).md); therefore all his labor is
vanity ([Ecc 2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022).md).

what can the man do . . . already done-- ([Ecc
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009).md). Parenthetical. A future
investigator can strike nothing out "new," so as to draw a different
conclusion from what I draw by comparing "wisdom and madness." HOLDEN,
with less ellipsis, translates, "What, O man, shall come after the
king?" &c. Better, GROTIUS, "What man can come after (compete with) the
king in the things which are done?" None ever can have the same means of
testing what all earthly things can do towards satisfying the soul;
namely, worldly wisdom, science, riches, power, longevity, all combined.

[Ecclesiastes 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 2:13</span></span>

([Pro 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#024).md). The worldly "wise" man
has good sense in managing his affairs, skill and taste in building and
planting, and keeps within safe and respectable bounds in pleasure,
while the "fool" is wanting in these respects ("darkness," equivalent to
fatal error, blind infatuation), yet one event, death, happens to both
([Job 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#026).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 2:15</span></span>

why was I--so anxious to become, &c. ([Ch2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#010).md).

Then--Since such is the case.

this--namely, pursuit of (worldly) wisdom; it can never fill the place
of the true wisdom ([Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028.md); [Jer
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 2:16</span></span>

remembrance--a great aim of the worldly ([Gen
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004).md). The righteous alone attain it
([Psa 112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006.md); [Pro
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007).md).

for ever--no perpetual memorial.

that which now is--MAURER, "In the days to come all things shall be now
long ago forgotten."

[Ecclesiastes 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 2:17</span></span>

Disappointed in one experiment after another, he is weary of life. The
backslider ought to have rather reasoned as the prodigal ([Hos
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md); [Luk
15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017).md).

grievous unto me-- ([Job 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#001).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 2:18</span></span>

One hope alone was left to the disappointed worldling, the perpetuation
of his name and riches, laboriously gathered, through his successor. For
selfishness is mostly at the root of worldly parents' alleged providence
for their children. But now the remembrance of how he himself, the
piously reared child of David, had disregarded his father's dying charge
([Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009).md), suggested the sad
misgivings as to what Rehoboam, his son by an idolatrous Ammonitess,
Naamah, should prove to be; a foreboding too fully realized (1Ki.
12:1-18; [Kg1 14:21-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021).md).

[Ecclesiastes 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 2:20</span></span>

I gave up as desperate all hope of solid fruit from my labor.

[Ecclesiastes 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 2:21</span></span>

Suppose "there is a man," &c.

equity--rather "with success," as the Hebrew is rendered ([Ecc
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006).md), "prosper," though Margin gives
"right" \[HOLDEN and MAURER\].

evil--not in itself, for this is the ordinary course of things, but
"evil," as regards the chief good, that one should have toiled so
fruitlessly.

[Ecclesiastes 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 2:22</span></span>

Same sentiment as in [Ecc 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#021.md),
interrogatively.

[Ecclesiastes 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ecc 2:23</span></span>

The only fruit he has is, not only sorrows in his days, but all his days
are sorrows, and his travail (not only has griefs connected with it, but
is itself), grief.

[Ecclesiastes 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ecc 2:24</span></span>

English Version gives a seemingly Epicurean sense, contrary to the
general scope. The Hebrew, literally is, "It is not good for man that he
should eat," &c., "and should make his soul see good" (or "show his
soul, that is, himself, happy"), &c. \[WEISS\]. According to HOLDEN and
WEISS, [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md) differ from this verse in the
text and meaning; here he means, "It is not good that a man should feast
himself, and falsely make as though his soul were happy"; he thus refers
to a false pretending of happiness acquired by and for one's self; in
[Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012.md), [Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018.md), to real seeing, or finding
pleasure when God gives it. There it is said to be good for a man to
enjoy with satisfaction and thankfulness the blessings which God gives;
here it is said not to be good to take an unreal pleasure to one's self
by feasting, &c.

This also I saw--I perceived by experience that good (real pleasure) is
not to be taken at will, but comes only from the hand of God \[WEISS\]
([Psa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006.md); [Isa
57:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019).md). Or as HOLDEN, "It is the
appointment from the hand of God, that the sensualist has no solid
satisfaction" (good).

[Ecclesiastes 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ecc 2:25</span></span>

hasten--after indulgences ([Pro 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#023.md);
[Pro 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#002).md), eagerly pursue such
enjoyments. None can compete with me in this. If I, then, with all my
opportunities of enjoyment, failed utterly to obtain solid pleasure of
my own making, apart from God, who else can? God mercifully spares His
children the sad experiment which Solomon made, by denying them the
goods which they often desire. He gives them the fruits of Solomon's
experience, without their paying the dear price at which Solomon bought
it.

[Ecclesiastes 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ecc 2:26</span></span>

True, literally, in the Jewish theocracy; and in some measure in all
ages ([Job 27:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#016.md); [Pro
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#022.md); [Pro
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#008).md). Though the retribution be not
so visible and immediate now as then, it is no less real. Happiness even
here is more truly the portion of the godly ([Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011.md); [Mat
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005.md); [Mar
10:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#029.md); [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md); [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008).md).

that he--the sinner

may give--that is, unconsciously and in spite of himself. The godly
Solomon had satisfaction in his riches and wisdom, when God gave them
([Ch2 1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#011).md). The backsliding
Solomon had no happiness when he sought it in them apart from God; and
the riches which he heaped up became the prey of Shishak ([Ch2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009).md).

Earthly pursuits are no doubt lawful in their proper time and order
([Ecc 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001).md), but unprofitable when
out of time and place; as for instance, when pursued as the solid and
chief good ([Ecc 3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009).md); whereas God
makes everything beautiful in its season, which man obscurely
comprehends ([Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011).md). God allows
man to enjoy moderately and virtuously His earthly gifts ([Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012).md). What consoles us amidst the
instability of earthly blessings is, God's counsels are immutable ([Ecc
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014).md).
