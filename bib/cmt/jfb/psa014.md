### [Psalms Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 14:1</span></span>

The practical atheism and total and universal depravity of the wicked,
with their hatred to the good, are set forth. Yet, as they dread God's
judgments when He vindicates His people, the Psalmist prays for His
delivering power. ([Psa 14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md)

Sinners are termed "fools," because they think and act contrary to right
reason ([Gen 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007.md); [Jos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015.md); [Psa
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#008.md); [Psa
74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018.md), [Psa
74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022).md).

in his heart--to himself ([Gen 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 14:2</span></span>

looked--in earnest enquiry.

understand--as opposed to "fool" \[[Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md)\].

[Psalms 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 14:3</span></span>

filthy--literally, "spoiled," or, "soured," "corrupted" ([Job
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016.md); [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 14:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 14:4</span></span>

Their conduct evinces indifference rather than ignorance of God; for
when He appears in judgment, they are stricken with great fear.

who eat up my people--to express their beastly fury ([Pro
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#014.md); [Hab
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#014).md). To "call on the Lord" is to
worship Him.

[Psalms 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 14:7</span></span>

captivity--denotes any great evil.

Zion--God's abode, from which He revealed His purposes of mercy, as He
now does by the Church (compare [Psa
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#004.md); [Psa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002).md), and which He rules and in which
He does all other things for the good of His people ([Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022).md).
