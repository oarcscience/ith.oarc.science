### [Deuteronomy Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 19:2</span></span>

OF THE CITIES OF REFUGE. ([Deu
19:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#001).md)

Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
land--Goelism, or the duty of the nearest kinsmen to avenge the death of
a slaughtered relative, being the customary law of that age (as it still
is among the Arabs and other people of the East), Moses incorporated it
in an improved form with his legislative code. For the protection of the
unintentional homicide, he provided certain cities of refuge--three had
been destined for this purpose on the east of Jordan ([Deu
4:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#041.md); [Num
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#011).md); three were to be invested with
the same privilege on the west of that river when Canaan should be
conquered.

in the midst of thy land--in such a position that they would be
conspicuous and accessible, and equidistant from the extremities of the
land and from each other.

[Deuteronomy 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 19:3</span></span>

Thou shalt prepare thee a way--The roads leading to them were to be kept
in good condition and the brooks or rivers to be spanned by good
bridges; the width of the roads was to be thirty-two cubits; and at all
the crossroads signposts were to be erected with the words, Mekeleth,
Mekeleth, "refuge, refuge," painted on them.

divide the coasts of thy land . . . into three parts--the whole extent
of the country from the south to the north. The three cities on each
side of Jordan were opposite to each other, "as two rows of vines in a
vineyard" (see on [Jos 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#007).md).

[Deuteronomy 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 19:6</span></span>

Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is
hot--This verse is a continuation of [Deu
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#003.md) (for [Deu
19:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#004.md), which are explanatory, are in
a parenthetical form), and the meaning is that if the kinsman of a
person inadvertently killed should, under the impulse of sudden
excitement and without inquiring into the circumstances, inflict summary
vengeance on the homicide, however guiltless, the law tolerated such an
act; it was to pass with impunity. But to prevent such precipitate
measures, the cities of refuge were established for the reception of the
homicide, that "innocent blood might not be shed in thy land" ([Deu
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#010).md). In the case of premeditated
murder ([Deu 19:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#011).md), they afforded
no immunity; but, if it were only manslaughter, the moment the fugitive
was within the gates, he found himself in a safe asylum ([Num
35:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#026.md); [Jos
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#006).md).

[Deuteronomy 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 19:8</span></span>

And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast--Three additional sanctuaries
were to be established in the event of their territory extending over
the country from Hermon and Gilead to the Euphrates (see [Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md); [Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031).md). But it was obscurely hinted
that this last provision would never be carried into effect, as the
Israelites would not fulfil the conditions, namely, "that of keeping the
commandments, to love the Lord, and walk ever in his ways." In point of
fact, although that region was brought into subjection by David and
Solomon, we do not find that cities of refuge were established; because
those sovereigns only made the ancient inhabitants tributary, instead of
sending a colony of Israelites to possess it. The privilege of sanctuary
cities, however, was given only for Israelites; and besides, that
conquered territory did not remain long under the power of the Hebrew
kings.

[Deuteronomy 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">deu 19:14</span></span>

THE LANDMARK IS NOT TO BE REMOVED. ([Deu
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014).md)

Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old have
set in thine inheritance--The state of Palestine in regard to enclosures
is very much the same now as it has always been. Though gardens and
vineyards are surrounded by dry-stone walls or hedges of prickly pear,
the boundaries of arable fields are marked by nothing but by a little
trench, a small cairn, or a single erect stone, placed at certain
intervals. It is manifest that a dishonest person could easily fill the
gutter with earth, or remove these stones a few feet without much risk
of detection and so enlarge his own field by a stealthy encroachment on
his neighbor's. This law, then, was made to prevent such trespasses.

[Deuteronomy 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 19:15</span></span>

TWO WITNESSES REQUIRED. ([Deu 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015).md)

One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity--The
following rules to regulate the admission of testimony in public courts
are founded on the principles of natural justice. A single witness shall
not be admitted to the condemnation of an accused person.

[Deuteronomy 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 19:16</span></span>

PUNISHMENT OF A FALSE WITNESS. ([Deu
19:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#016).md)

But if convicted of perjury, it will be sufficient for his own
condemnation, and his punishment shall be exactly the same as would have
overtaken the object of his malignant prosecution. (See on [Exo
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#023.md); see also [Lev
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#020).md).
