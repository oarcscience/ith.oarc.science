[1 Corinthians 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 8:1</span></span>

ON PARTAKING OF MEATS OFFERED TO IDOLS. ([Co1
8:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md)

Though to those knowing that an idol has no existence, the question of
eating meats offered to idols (referred to in the letter of the
Corinthians, compare [Co1 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#001).md) might
seem unimportant, it is not so with some, and the infirmities of such
should be respected. The portions of the victims not offered on the
altars belonged partly to the priests, partly to the offerers; and were
eaten at feasts in the temples and in private houses and were often sold
in the markets; so that Christians were constantly exposed to the
temptation of receiving them, which was forbidden ([Num
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#002.md); [Psa
106:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028).md). The apostles forbade it in
their decree issued from Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-29; [Act
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025).md); but Paul does not allude here
to that decree, as he rests his precepts rather on his own independent
apostolic authority.

we know that we all have knowledge--The Corinthians doubtless had
referred to their "knowledge" (namely, of the indifference of meats, as
in themselves having no sanctity or pollution). Paul replies, "We are
aware that we all have \[speaking generally, and so far as Christian
theory goes; for in [Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md) he speaks
of some who practically have not\] this knowledge."

Knowledge puffeth up--when without "love." Here a parenthesis begins;
and the main subject is resumed in the same words, [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md). "As concerning \[touching\]
therefore the eating," &c. "Puffing up" is to please self. "Edifying" is
to please one's neighbor; Knowledge only says, All things are lawful for
me; Love adds, But all things do not edify \[BENGEL\], ([Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md); [Rom
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015).md).

edifieth--tends to build up the spiritual temple ([Co1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 8:2</span></span>

And--omitted in the oldest manuscripts The absence of the connecting
particle gives an emphatical sententiousness to the style, suitable to
the subject. The first step to knowledge is to know our own ignorance.
Without love there is only the appearance of knowledge.

knoweth--The oldest manuscripts read a Greek word implying personal
experimental acquaintance, not merely knowledge of a fact, which the
Greek of "we know" or are aware ([Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md) means.

as he ought to know--experimentally and in the way of "love."

[1 Corinthians 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 8:3</span></span>

love God--the source of love to our neighbor ([Jo1
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#011.md), [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020.md); [Jo1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002).md).

the same--literally, "this man"; he who loves, not he who "thinks that
he knows," not having "charity" or love ([Co1
8:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md).

is known of him--is known with the knowledge of approval and is
acknowledged by God as His ([Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md);
[Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019).md). Contrast, "I never knew you"
([Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023).md). To love God is to know
God; and he who thus knows God has been first known by God (compare [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 8:4</span></span>

As concerning, &c.--resuming the subject begun in [Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md), "As touching," &c.

idol is nothing--has no true being at all, the god it represents is not
a living reality. This does not contradict [Co1
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md), which states that they who
worship idols, worship devils; for here it is the GODS believed by the
worshippers to be represented by the idols which are denied to have any
existence, not the devils which really under the idols delude the
worshippers.

none other God--The oldest manuscripts omit the word "other"; which
gives a clearer sense.

[1 Corinthians 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 8:5</span></span>

"For even supposing there are (exist) gods so called ([Th2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004).md), whether in heaven (as the sun,
moon, and stars) or in earth (as deified kings, beasts, &c.), as there
be (a recognized fact, [Deu 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017.md);
[Psa 135:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#005.md); [Psa
136:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#002).md) gods many and lords many."
Angels and men in authority are termed gods in Scripture, as exercising
a divinely delegated power under God (compare [Exo
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#009.md), with [Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028.md); [Psa
82:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#001.md), [Psa
82:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md); [Joh
10:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#034).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 8:6</span></span>

to us--believers.

of whom--from whom as Creator all things derive their existence.

we in him--rather, "we for Him," or "unto Him." God the FATHER is the
end for whom and for whose glory believers live. In [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md) all things are said to be created
(not only "by" Christ, but also) "for Him" (CHRIST). So entirely are the
Father and Son one (compare [Rom
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md); [Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010).md).

one Lord--contrasted with the "many lords" of heathendom ([Co1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005).md).

by whom-- ([Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md); [Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md).

we by him--as all things are "of" the Father by creation, so they (we
believers especially) are restored to Him by the new creation ([Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005).md). Also, as all things are by
Christ by creation, so they (we especially) are restored by Him by the
new creation.

[1 Corinthians 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 8:7</span></span>

Howbeit--Though to us who "have knowledge" ([Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001.md), [Co1
8:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md) all meats are indifferent, yet
"this knowledge is not in all" in the same degree as we have it. Paul
had admitted to the Corinthians that "we all have knowledge" ([Co1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md), that is, so far as Christian
theory goes; but practically some have it not in the same degree.

with conscience--an ancient reading; but other very old manuscripts read
"association" or "habit." In either reading the meaning is: Some Gentile
Christians, whether from old association of ideas or misdirected
conscience, when they ate such meats, ate them with some feeling as if
the idol were something real ([Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md), and had changed the meats by the
fact of the consecration into something either holy or else polluted.

unto this hour--after they have embraced Christianity; an implied
censure, that they are not further advanced by this time in Christian
"knowledge."

their conscience . . . is defiled--by their eating it "as a thing
offered to idols." If they ate it unconscious at the time that it had
been offered to idols, there would be no defilement of conscience. But
conscious of what it was, and not having such knowledge as other
Corinthians boasted of, namely, that an idol is nothing and can
therefore neither pollute nor sanctify meats, they by eating them sin
against conscience (compare [Rom
14:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015).md). It was on the ground of
Christian expediency, not to cause a stumbling-block to "weak" brethren,
that the Jerusalem decree against partaking of such meats (though
indifferent in themselves) was passed (Acts 15:1-29). Hence he here
vindicates it against the Corinthian asserters of an inexpedient
liberty.

[1 Corinthians 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 8:8</span></span>

Other old manuscripts read, "Neither if we do not eat, are we the
better: neither if we eat are we the worse": the language of the eaters
who justified their eating thus \[LACHMANN\]. In English Version Paul
admits that "meat neither presents \[so the Greek for 'commendeth'\] us
as commended nor as disapproved before God": it does not affect our
standing before God ([Rom 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 8:9</span></span>

this liberty of yours--the watchword for lax Corinthians. The very
indifference of meats, which I concede, is the reason why ye should
"take heed" not to tempt weak brethren to act against their conscience
(which constitutes sin, [Rom
14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 8:10</span></span>

if any man--being weak.

which hast knowledge--The very knowledge which thou pridest thyself on
([Co1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001).md), will lead the weak after
thy example to do that against his conscience, which thou doest without
any scruple of conscience; namely, to eat meats offered to idols.

conscience of him which is weak--rather, "His conscience, seeing he is
weak" \[ALFORD and others\].

emboldened--literally, "built up." You ought to have built up your
brother in good: but by your example your building him up is the
emboldening him to violate his conscience.

[1 Corinthians 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 8:11</span></span>

shall . . . perish--The oldest manuscripts read "perisheth." A single
act seemingly unimportant may produce everlasting consequences. The weak
brother loses his faith, and if he do not recover it, his salvation
\[BENGEL\] ([Rom 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023).md).

for whom Christ died--and for whose sake we too ought to be willing to
die ([Jo1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016).md). And yet professing
Christians at Corinth virtually tempted their brethren to their
damnation, so far were they from sacrificing aught for their salvation.
Note here, that it is no argument against the dogma that Christ died for
all, even for those who perish, to say that thus He would have died in
vain for many. Scripture is our rule, not our suppositions as to
consequences. More is involved in redemption than the salvation of man:
the character of God as at once just and loving is vindicated even in
the case of the lost for they might have been saved, and so even in
their case Christ has not died in vain. So the mercies of God's
providence are not in vain, though many abuse them. Even the condemned
shall manifest God's love in the great day, in that they too had the
offer of God's mercy. It shall be the most awful ingredient in their cup
that they might have been saved but would not: Christ died to redeem
even them.

[1 Corinthians 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 8:12</span></span>

wound their weak conscience--literally, "smite their conscience, being
(as yet) in a weak state." It aggravates the cruelty of the act that it
is committed on the weak, just as if one were to strike an invalid.

against Christ--on account of the sympathy between Christ and His
members ([Mat 25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md); [Act
9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004).md).

[1 Corinthians 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 8:13</span></span>

meat--Old English for "food" in general.

make . . . to offend--Greek, "is a stumbling-block to."

no flesh--In order to ensure my avoiding flesh offered to idols, I would
abstain from all kinds of flesh, in order not to be a stumbling-block to
my brother.
