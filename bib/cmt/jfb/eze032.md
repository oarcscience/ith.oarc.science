Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Ezekiel Chapter 32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 32:1</span></span>

TWO ELEGIES OVER PHARAOH, ONE DELIVERED ON THE FIRST DAY ([Eze
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001).md), THE OTHER ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY
OF THE SAME MONTH, THE TWELFTH OF THE TWELFTH YEAR. (Eze. 32:1-32)

The twelfth year from the carrying away of Jehoiachin; Jerusalem was by
this time overthrown, and Amasis was beginning his revolt against
Pharaoh-hophra.

[Ezekiel 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 32:2</span></span>

Pharaoh--"Phra" in Burmah, signifies the king, high priest, and idol.

whale--rather, any monster of the waters; here, the crocodile of the
Nile. Pharaoh is as a lion on dry land, a crocodile in the waters; that
is, an object of terror everywhere.

camest forth with thy rivers--"breakest forth" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The
antithesis of "seas" and "rivers" favors GROTIUS rendering, "Thou camest
forth from the sea into the rivers"; that is, from thy own empire into
other states. However, English Version is favored by the "thy": thou
camest forth with thy rivers (that is, with thy forces) and with thy
feet didst fall irrecoverably; so Israel, once desolate, troubles the
waters (that is, neighboring states).

[Ezekiel 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 32:3</span></span>

with a company of many people--namely, the Chaldeans ([Eze
29:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md); [Hos
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012).md).

my net--for they are My instrument.

[Ezekiel 32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 32:4</span></span>

leave thee upon the land--as a fish drawn out of the water loses all its
strength, so Pharaoh (in [Eze 32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003.md),
compared to a water monster) shall be ([Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005).md).

[Ezekiel 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 32:5</span></span>

thy height--thy hugeness \[FAIRBAIRN\]. The great heap of corpses of thy
forces, on which thou pridest thyself. "Height" may refer to mental
elevation, as well as bodily \[VATABLUS\].

[Ezekiel 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 32:6</span></span>

land wherein thou swimmest--Egypt: the land watered by the Nile, the the
source of its fertility, wherein thou swimmest (carrying on the image of
the crocodile, that is, wherein thou dost exercise thy wanton power at
will). Irony. The land shall still afford seas to swim in, but they
shall be seas of blood. Alluding to the plague ([Exo
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#019.md); [Rev
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#008).md). HAVERNICK translates, "I will
water the land with what flows from thee, even thy blood, reaching to
the mountains": "with thy blood overflowing even to the mountains."
Perhaps this is better.

[Ezekiel 32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 32:7</span></span>

put thee out--extinguish thy light ([Job
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005).md). Pharaoh is represented as a
bright star, at the extinguishing of whose light in the political sky
the whole heavenly host is shrouded in sympathetic darkness. Here, too,
as in [Eze 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#006.md), there is an allusion
to the supernatural darkness sent formerly ([Exo
10:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021).md). The heavenly bodies are
often made images of earthly dynasties ([Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md).

[Ezekiel 32:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 32:9</span></span>

thy destruction--that is tidings of thy destruction (literally, "thy
breakage") carried by captive and dispersed Egyptians "among the
nations" \[GROTIUS\]; or, thy broken people, resembling one great
fracture, the ruins of what they had been \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 32:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 32:10</span></span>

brandish my sword before them--literally, "in their faces," or sight.

[Ezekiel 32:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 32:13</span></span>

(See on [Eze 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#011).md). The picture is
ideally true, not to be interpreted by the letter. The political
ascendency of Egypt was to cease with the Chaldean conquest
\[FAIRBAIRN\]. Henceforth Pharaoh must figuratively no longer trouble
the waters by man or beast, that is, no longer was he to flood other
peoples with his overwhelming forces.

[Ezekiel 32:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 32:14</span></span>

make their waters deep--rather, "make . . . to subside"; literally,
"sink" \[FAIRBAIRN\].

like oil--emblem of quietness. No longer shall they descend violently on
other countries as the overflowing Nile, but shall be still and sluggish
in political action.

[Ezekiel 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 32:16</span></span>

As in [Eze 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014.md). This is a
prophetical lamentation; yet so it shall come to pass \[GROTIUS\].

[Ezekiel 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 32:17</span></span>

The second lamentation for Pharaoh. This funeral dirge in imagination
accompanies him to the unseen world. Egypt personified in its political
head is ideally represented as undergoing the change by death to which
man is liable. Expressing that Egypt's supremacy is no more, a thing of
the past, never to be again.

the month--the twelfth month ([Eze
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#001).md); fourteen days after the former
vision.

[Ezekiel 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 32:18</span></span>

cast them down--that is predict that they shall be cast down (so [Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010).md). The prophet's word was God's,
and carried with it its own fulfilment.

daughters of . . . nations--that is the nations with their peoples.
Egypt is to share the fate of other ancient nations once famous, now
consigned to oblivion: Elam ([Eze
32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024).md), Meshech, &c. ([Eze
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026).md), Edom ([Eze
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029).md), Zidon ([Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030).md).

[Ezekiel 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 32:19</span></span>

Whom dost thou pass in beauty?--Beautiful as thou art, thou art not more
so than other nations, which nevertheless have perished.

go down, &c.--to the nether world, where all "beauty" is speedily
marred.

[Ezekiel 32:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 32:20</span></span>

she is delivered to the sword--namely, by God.

draw her--as if addressing her executioners: drag her forth to death.

[Ezekiel 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 32:21</span></span>

([Eze 31:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#016).md). Ezekiel has before his
eyes [Isa 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), &c.

shall speak to him--with "him" join "with them that help him"; shall
speak to him and his helpers with a taunting welcome, as now one of
themselves.

[Ezekiel 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 32:22</span></span>

her . . . his--The abrupt change of gender is, because Ezekiel has in
view at one time the kingdom (feminine), at another the monarch.
"Asshur," or Assyria, is placed first in punishment, as being first in
guilt.

[Ezekiel 32:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 32:23</span></span>

in the sides of the pit--Sepulchres in the East were caves hollowed out
of the rock, and the bodies were laid in niches formed at the sides.
MAURER needlessly departs from the ordinary meaning, and translates,
"extremities" (compare [Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md),
[Isa 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#015).md).

which caused terror--They, who alive were a terror to others, are now,
in the nether world, themselves a terrible object to behold.

[Ezekiel 32:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 32:24</span></span>

Elam--placed next, as having been an auxiliary to Assyria. Its territory
lay in Persia. In Abraham's time an independent kingdom ([Gen
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#001).md). Famous for its bowmen ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md).

borne their shame--the just retribution of their lawless pride.
Destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
49:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#034).md).

[Ezekiel 32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 32:25</span></span>

a bed--a sepulchral niche.

all . . . slain by . . . sword, &c.-- ([Eze
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021.md), [Eze
32:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#023).md). The very monotony of the
phraseology gives to the dirge an awe-inspiring effect.

[Ezekiel 32:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 32:26</span></span>

Meshech, Tubal--northern nations: the Moschi and Tibareni, between the
Black and Caspian Seas. HERODOTUS \[3.94\], mentions them as a
subjugated people, tributaries to Darius Hystaspes (see [Eze
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013).md).

[Ezekiel 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 32:27</span></span>

they shall not lie with the mighty--that is, they shall not have
separate tombs such as mighty conquerors have: but shall all be heaped
together in one pit, as is the case with the vanquished \[GROTIUS\].
HAVERNICK reads it interrogatively, "Shall they not lie with the mighty
that are fallen?" But English Version is supported by the parallel ([Isa
14:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#018).md), to which Ezekiel refers,
and which represents them as not lying as mighty kings lie in a grave,
but cast out of one, as a carcass trodden under foot.

with . . . weapons of war--alluding to the custom of burying warriors
with their arms (1 Maccabees 13:29). Though honored by the laying of
"their swords under their heads," yet the punishment of "their
iniquities shall be upon their bones." Their swords shall thus attest
their shame, not their glory ([Mat
26:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052).md), being the instruments of their
violence, the penalty of which they are paying.

[Ezekiel 32:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 32:28</span></span>

Yea, thou--Thou, too, Egypt, like them, shalt lie as one vanquished.

[Ezekiel 32:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 32:29</span></span>

princes--Edom was not only governed by kings, but by subordinate
"princes" ox "dukes" ([Gen 36:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040).md).

with their might--notwithstanding their might, they shall be brought
down ([Isa 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md), [Isa
34:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010.md); [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md), [Jer
49:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013).md).

lie with the uncircumcised--Though Edom was circumcised, being descended
from Isaac, he shall lie with the uncircumcised; much more shall Egypt,
who had no hereditary right to circumcision.

[Ezekiel 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 32:30</span></span>

princes of the north--Syria, which is still called by the Arabs the
north; or the Tyrians, north of Palestine, conquered by Nebuchadnezzar
(Eze. 26:1-28:26), \[GROTIUS\].

Zidonians--who shared the fate of Tyre ([Eze
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#021).md).

with their terror they are ashamed of their might--that is,
notwithstanding the terror which they inspired in their contemporaries.
"Might" is connected by MAURER thus, "Notwithstanding the terror which
resulted from their might."

[Ezekiel 32:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 32:31</span></span>

comforted--with the melancholy satisfaction of not being alone, but of
having other kingdoms companions in his downfall. This shall be his only
comfort--a very poor one!

[Ezekiel 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 32:32</span></span>

my terror--the Margin or Keri. The Hebrew text or Chetib is "his
terror," which gives good sense ([Eze
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#025.md), [Eze
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#030).md). "My terror" implies that God
puts His terror on Pharaoh's multitude, as they put "their terror" on
others, for example, under Pharaoh-necho on Judea. As "the land of the
living" was the scene of "their terror," so it shall be God's;
especially in Judea, He will display His glory to the terror of Israel's
foes ([Eze 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#020).md). In Israel's case
the judgment is temporary, ending in their future restoration under
Messiah. In the case of the world kingdoms which flourished for a time,
they fall to rise no more.

Heretofore his functions had been chiefly threatening; from this point,
after the evil had got to its worst in the overthrow of Jerusalem, the
consolatory element preponderates.
