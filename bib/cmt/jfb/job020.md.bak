### [Job Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#001.md)

[Job 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 20:2</span></span>

REPLY OF ZOPHAR. (Job 20:1-29)

Therefore--Rather, the more excited I feel by Job's speech, the more for
that very reason shall my reply be supplied by my calm consideration.
Literally, "Notwithstanding; my calm thoughts (as in [Job
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#013).md) shall furnish my answer, because
of the excitement (haste) within me" \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 20:3</span></span>

check of my reproach--that is, the castigation intended as a reproach
(literally, "shame") to me.

spirit of . . . understanding--my rational spirit; answering to "calm
thoughts" ([Job 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002).md). In spite of thy
reproach urging me to "hastiness." I will answer in calm reason.

[Job 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 20:5</span></span>

the hypocrite--literally, "the ungodly" ([Psa
37:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035).md).

[Job 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 20:6</span></span>

([Isa 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md); [Oba
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#003).md).

[Job 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 20:7</span></span>

dung--in contrast to the haughtiness of the sinner ([Job
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006).md); this strong term expresses
disgust and the lowest degradation ([Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010.md); [Kg1
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#010).md).

[Job 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 20:8</span></span>

([Psa 73:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#020).md).

[Job 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 20:9</span></span>

Rather "the eye followeth him, but can discern him no more." A
sharp-looking is meant ([Job 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#007.md);
[Job 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010).md).

[Job 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 20:10</span></span>

seek to please--"Atone to the poor" (by restoring the property of which
they had been robbed by the father) \[DE WETTE\]. Better than English
Version, "The children" are reduced to the humiliating condition of
"seeking the favor of those very poor," whom the father had oppressed.
But UMBREIT translates as Margin.

his hands--rather, "their (the children's) hands."

their goods--the goods of the poor. Righteous retribution! ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005).md).

[Job 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 20:11</span></span>

([Psa 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#007).md), so Vulgate. GESENIUS has
"full of youth"; namely, in the fulness of his youthful strength he
shall be laid in the dust. But "bones" plainly alludes to Job's disease,
probably to Job's own words ([Job
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#020).md). UMBREIT translates, "full of
his secret sins," as in [Psa 90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008.md); his
secret guilt in his time of seeming righteousness, like secret poison,
at last lays him in the dust. The English Version is best. Zophar
alludes to Job's own words ([Job
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#016).md).

with him--His sin had so pervaded his nature that it accompanies him to
the grave: for eternity the sinner cannot get rid of it ([Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011).md).

[Job 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 20:12</span></span>

be--"taste sweet." Sin's fascination is like poison sweet to the taste,
but at last deadly to the vital organs ([Pro
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#017.md); [Job
9:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#017).md).

hide . . . tongue--seek to prolong the enjoyment by keeping the sweet
morsel long in the mouth (so [Job
20:13](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#013).md).

[Job 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 20:14</span></span>

turned--Hebrew denotes a total change into a disagreeable contrary ([Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021.md); compare [Rev
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009).md).

gall--in which the poison of the asp was thought to lie. It rather is
contained in a sack in the mouth. Scripture uses popular language, where
no moral truth is thereby endangered.

[Job 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 20:15</span></span>

He is forced to disgorge his ill-gotten wealth.

[Job 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 20:16</span></span>

shall suck--It shall turn out that he has sucked the poison, &c.

[Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 20:17</span></span>

floods--literally, "stream of floods," plentiful streams flowing with
milk, &c. ([Job 29:6](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#006.md); [Exo
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#017).md). Honey and butter are more fluid
in the East than with us and are poured out from jars. These "rivers" or
water brooks are in the sultry East emblems of prosperity.

[Job 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 20:18</span></span>

Image from food which is taken away from one before he can swallow it.

restitution--(So [Pro 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031).md). The
parallelism favors the English Version rather than the translation of
GESENIUS, "As a possession to be restored in which he rejoices not."

he shall not rejoice--His enjoyment of his ill-gotten gains shall then
be at an end ([Job 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#005).md).

[Job 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 20:19</span></span>

oppressed--whereas he ought to have espoused their cause ([Ch2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#010).md).

forsaken--left helpless.

house--thus leaving the poor without shelter ([Isa
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md); [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md).

[Job 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 20:20</span></span>

UMBREIT translates, "His inward parts know no rest" from desires.

his belly--that is, peace inwardly.

not save--literally, "not escape with that which," &c., alluding to
Job's having been stripped of his all.

[Job 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 20:21</span></span>

look for--rather, "because his goods," that is, prosperity shall have no
endurance.

[Job 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 20:22</span></span>

shall be--rather, "he is (feeleth) straitened." The next clause explains
in what respect.

wicked--Rather, "the whole hand of the miserable (whom he had oppressed)
cometh upon him"; namely, the sense of his having oppressed the poor,
now in turn comes with all its power (hand) on him. This caused his
"straitened" feeling even in prosperity.

[Job 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 20:23</span></span>

Rather, "God shall cast (may God send) \[UMBREIT\] upon him the fury of
His wrath to fill his belly!"

while . . . eating--rather, "shall rain it upon him for his food!" Fiery
rain, that is, lightning ([Psa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md);
alluding to Job's misfortune, [Job
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016).md). The force of the image is felt
by picturing to one's self the opposite nature of a refreshing rain in
the desert ([Exo 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#004.md); [Psa
68:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#009).md).

[Job 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 20:24</span></span>

steel--rather, "brass." While the wicked flees from one danger, he falls
into a greater one from an opposite quarter \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 20:25</span></span>

It is drawn--Rather, "He (God) draweth (the sword, [Jos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013).md) and (no sooner has He done so,
than) it cometh out of (that is, passes right through) the (sinner's)
body" ([Deu 32:41-42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041.md); [Eze
21:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009).md). The glittering sword is a
happy image for lightning.

gall--that is, his life ([Job 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013).md).
"Inflicts a deadly wound."

terrors--Zophar repeats Bildad's words ([Job
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011.md); [Psa
88:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#016.md); [Psa
55:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004).md).

[Job 20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 20:26</span></span>

All darkness--that is, every calamity that befalls the wicked shall be
hid (in store for him) in His (God's) secret places, or treasures ([Jde
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#013.md); [Deu
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#034).md).

not blown--not kindled by man's hands, but by God's ([Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md); the Septuagint in the
Alexandrian Manuscript reads "unquenchable fire," [Mat
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md). Tact is shown by the friends in
not expressly mentioning, but alluding under color of general cases, to
Job's calamities; here ([Job 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#016).md)
UMBREIT explains it, wickedness, is a "self-igniting fire"; in it lie
the principles of destruction.

ill . . . tabernacle--Every trace of the sinner must be obliterated
([Job 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#015).md).

[Job 20:27](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 20:27</span></span>

All creation is at enmity with him, and proclaims his guilt, which he
would fain conceal.

[Job 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">job 20:28</span></span>

increase--prosperity. Ill got--ill gone.

flow away--like waters that run dry in summer; using Job's own metaphor
against himself ([Job 6:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#015.md); [Sa2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014.md); [Mic
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#004).md).

his wrath--God's.

[Job 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 20:29</span></span>

appointed--not as a matter of chance, but by the divine "decree"
(Margin) and settled principle.
