### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Thessalonians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS AND SALUTATION: INTRODUCTION: THANKSGIVING FOR THEIR GROWTH IN
FAITH AND LOVE, AND FOR THEIR PATIENCE IN PERSECUTIONS, WHICH ARE A
TOKEN FOR GOOD EVERLASTING TO THEM, AND FOR PERDITION TO THEIR
ADVERSARIES AT CHRIST'S COMING: PRAYER FOR THEIR PERFECTION. ([Th2
1:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#001).md)

in God our Father--still more endearing than the address, [Th1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001.md) "in God THE Father."

[2 Thessalonians 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 1:2</span></span>

from God our Father--So some oldest manuscripts read. Others omit "our."

[2 Thessalonians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 1:3</span></span>

We are bound--Greek, "We owe it as a debt" ([Th2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). They had prayed for the
Thessalonians ([Th1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012).md) that they
might "increase and abound in love"; their prayer having been heard, it
is a small but a bounden return for them to make, to thank God for it.
Thus, Paul and his fellow missionaries practice what they preach ([Th1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018).md). In [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md), their thanksgiving was for the
Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience"; here, for their exceeding
growth in faith, and for their charity abounding. "We are bound"
expresses the duty of thanksgiving from its subjective side as an inward
conviction. "As it is meet," from the objective: side as something
answering to the state of circumstances \[ALFORD\]. Observe the exact
correspondence of the prayer ([Th1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012.md), "The Lord make you to abound in
love") and the answer, "The love of every one of you all toward each
other aboundeth" (compare [Th1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#010).md).

meet--right.

[2 Thessalonians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 1:4</span></span>

glory in you--make our boast of you, literally, "in your case."
"Ourselves" implies that not merely did they hear others speaking of the
Thessalonians' faith, but they, the missionaries themselves, boasted of
it. Compare [Th1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md), wherein the
apostle said, their faith was so well known in various places, that he
and his fellow missionaries had no need to speak of it; but here he
says, so abounding is their love, combined with faith and patience, that
he and his fellow missionaries themselves, make it a matter of glorying
in the various churches elsewhere (he was now at Corinth in Achaia, and
boasted there of the faith of the Macedonian churches, [Co2
10:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015.md); [Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md), at the same time giving the glory
to the Lord), not only looking forward to glorying thereat at Christ's
coming ([Th1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019).md), but doing so even
now.

patience--in [Th1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003.md), "patience of
hope." Here hope is tacitly implied as the ground of their patience;
[Th2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md), [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md) state the object of their hope,
namely, the kingdom for which they suffer.

tribulations--literally, "pressures." The Jews were the instigators of
the populace and of the magistrates against Christians ([Act
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006.md), [Act
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#008).md).

which ye endure--Greek, "are (now) enduring."

[2 Thessalonians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 1:5</span></span>

Which--Your enduring these tribulations is a "token of the righteous
judgment of God," manifested in your being enabled to endure them, and
in your adversaries thereby filling up the measure of their guilt. The
judgment is even now begun, but its consummation will be at the Lord's
coming. David ([Psa 73:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001).md) and
Jeremiah ([Jer 12:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001).md) were perplexed
at the wicked prospering and the godly suffering. But Paul, by the light
of the New Testament, makes this fact a matter of consolation. It is a
proof (so the Greek) of the future judgment, which will set to rights
the anomalies of the present state, by rewarding the now suffering
saint, and by punishing the persecutor. And even now "the Judge of all
the earth does right" ([Gen 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md);
for the godly are in themselves sinful and need chastisement to amend
them. What they suffer unjustly at the hands of cruel men they suffer
justly at the hands of God; and they have their evil things here that
they may escape condemnation with the world and have their good things
hereafter ([Luk 16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md); [Co1
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032).md) \[EDMUNDS\].

that ye may be counted worthy--expressing the purpose of God's
"righteous judgment" as regards you.

for which--Greek, "in behalf of which ye are also suffering" (compare
[Act 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md); [Act
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016.md); [Phi
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029).md). "Worthy" implies that, though
men are justified by faith, they shall be judged "according to their
works" ([Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md); compare [Th1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md); [Pe1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md). The "also" implies the
connection between the suffering for the kingdom and being counted
worthy of it. Compare [Rom 8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 1:6</span></span>

seeing it is a righteous thing--This justifies the assertion above of
there being a "righteous judgment" ([Th2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005).md), namely, "seeing that it is
(literally, 'if at least,' 'if at all events it is') a righteous thing
with (that is, in the estimation of) God" (which, as we all feel, it
certainly is). Our own innate feeling of what is just, in this confirms
what is revealed.

recompense--requite in kind, namely, tribulation to them that trouble
you (affliction to those that afflict you); and to you who are troubled,
rest from trouble.

[2 Thessalonians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 1:7</span></span>

rest--governed by "to recompense" ([Th2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006).md). The Greek is literally,
"relaxation"; loosening of the tension which had preceded; relaxing of
the strings of endurance now so tightly drawn. The Greek word for
"rest," [Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md), is distinct,
namely, cessation from labor. Also, [Heb
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#009.md), "A keeping of sabbath."

with us--namely, Paul, Silas, and Timothy, the writers, who are troubled
like yourselves.

when--at the time when . . . ; not sooner, not later.

with his mighty angels--rather as the Greek, "with the angels of His
might," or "power," that is, the angels who are the ministers by whom He
makes His might to be recognized ([Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041.md), [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052).md). It is not their might, but His
might, which is the prominent thought.

[2 Thessalonians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 1:8</span></span>

In flaming fire--Greek, "In flame of fire"; or, as other oldest
manuscripts read, "in fire of flame." This flame of fire accompanied His
manifestation in the bush ([Exo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002).md);
also His giving of the law at Sinai ([Exo
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md). Also it shall accompany His
revelation at His advent ([Dan
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009).md), symbolizing His own bright
glory and His consuming vengeance against His foes ([Heb
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md); [Heb
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md); [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007.md), [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md).

taking--literally, "giving" them, as their portion, "vengeance."

know not God--the Gentiles primarily ([Psa
79:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#006.md); [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008.md); [Th1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005).md); not of course those
involuntarily not knowing God, but those wilfully not knowing Him, as
Pharaoh, who might have known God if he would, but who boasted "I know
not the Lord" ([Exo 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo005.htm#002).md); and as the
heathen persecutors who might have known God by the preaching of those
whom they persecuted. Secondarily, all who "profess to know God but in
works deny Him" ([Tit 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016).md).

obey not the gospel--primarily the unbelieving Jews ([Rom
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md), [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md); secondarily, all who obey not
the truth ([Rom 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008).md).

Christ--omitted by some of the oldest manuscripts, and retained by
others.

[2 Thessalonians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 1:9</span></span>

Who--Greek, "persons who," &c.

destruction from the presence of the Lord--driven far from His presence
\[ALFORD\]. The sentence emanating from Him in person, sitting as Judge
\[BENGEL\], and driving them far from Him ([Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md); [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md); [Rev
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#014.md); compare [Pe1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#012.md); [Isa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010.md), [Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019).md). "The presence of the Lord" is
the source whence the sentence goes forth; "the glory of His power" is
the instrument whereby the sentence is carried into execution
\[EDMUNDS\]. But ALFORD better interprets the latter clause (see [Th2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010).md), driven "from the manifestation
of His power in the glorification of His saints." Cast out from the
presence of the Lord is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law
of evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting
influence of the presence of God, who is the source of all light and
holiness ([Isa 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md); [Mar
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044).md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 1:10</span></span>

"When He shall have come."

glorified in his saints--as the element and mirror IN which His glory
shall shine brightly ([Joh 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010).md).

admired in all them that believe--Greek, "them that believed." Once they
believed, now they see: they had taken His word on trust. Now His word
is made good and they need faith no longer. With wonder all celestial
intelligences ([Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010).md) shall see
and admire the Redeemer on account of the excellencies which He has
wrought in them.

because, &c.--Supply for the sense, among whom (namely, those who shall
be found to have believed) you, too, shall be; "because our testimony
unto (so the Greek for 'among') you was believed" (and was not rejected
as by those "who obey not the Gospel," [Th2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008).md). The early preaching of the
Gospel was not abstract discussions, but a testimony to facts and truths
experimentally known ([Luk 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#048.md); [Act
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008).md). Faith is defined by BISHOP
PEARSON as "an assent unto truths, credible upon the testimony of God,
delivered unto us by the apostles and prophets" (originally delivering
their testimony orally, but now in their writings). "Glorified in His
saints" reminds us that holiness is glory in the bud; glory is holiness
manifested.

[2 Thessalonians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 1:11</span></span>

Wherefore--Greek, "With a view to which," namely, His glorification in
you as His saints.

also--We not only anticipate the coming glorification of our Lord in His
saints, but we also pray concerning (so the Greek) YOU.

our God--whom we serve.

count you worthy--The prominent position of the "You" in the Greek makes
it the emphatic word of the sentence. May you be found among the saints
whom God shall count worthy of their calling ([Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001).md)! There is no dignity in us
independent of God's calling of us ([Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009).md). The calling here is not merely
the first actual call, but the whole of God's electing act, originating
in His "purpose of grace given us in Christ before the world began," and
having its consummation in glory.

the good pleasure of, &c.--on the part of God \[BENGEL\].

faith--on your part. ALFORD refers the former clause, "good pleasure of
his goodness," also to man, arguing that the Greek for "goodness" is
never applied to God, and translates, "All \[that is, every possible\]
right purpose of goodness." WAHL, "All sweetness of goodness," that is,
impart in full to you all the refreshing delights of goodness. I think
that, as in the previous and parallel clause, "calling" refers to GOD'S
purpose; and as the Greek for "good pleasure" mostly is used of God, we
ought to translate, "fulfil (His) every gracious purpose of goodness (on
your part)," that is, fully perfect in you all goodness according to His
gracious purpose. Thus, "the grace of our God," [Th2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012.md), corresponds to God's "good
pleasure" here, which confirms the English Version, just as "the grace
of the Lord Jesus Christ" is parallel to "work of faith," as Christ
especially is the object of faith. "The work of faith"; Greek, (no
article; supply from the previous clause all) work of faith"; faith
manifested by work, which is its perfected development ([Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md); compare Note, see on [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003).md). Working reality of faith.

with power--Greek, "in power," that is, "powerfully fulfil in you" ([Col
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#011).md).

[2 Thessalonians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 1:12</span></span>

the name of our Lord Jesus--Our Lord Jesus in His manifested personality
as the God-man.

in you, and ye in him--reciprocal glorification; compare [Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005.md), "The Lord of hosts shall be . .
. a crown of glory and . . . a diadem of beauty unto . . . His people,"
with [Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003), "Thou (Zion.md) shalt be
a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem," &c. ([Joh
21:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#010.md); [Gal
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#024.md); [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014).md). The believer's graces redound
to Christ's glory, and His glory, as their Head, reflects glory on them
as the members.

the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ--There is but one Greek
article to both, implying the inseparable unity of God and the Lord
Jesus.
