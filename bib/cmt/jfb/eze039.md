### [Ezekiel Chapter 39](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 39:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 39:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY AGAINST GOG. (Eze. 39:1-29)

Repeated from [Eze 38:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#003.md), to impress
the prophecy more on the mind.

[Ezekiel 39:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 39:2</span></span>

leave but the sixth part of thee--Margin, "strike thee with six plagues"
(namely, pestilence, blood, overflowing rain, hailstones, fire,
brimstone, [Eze 38:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#022).md); or, "draw thee
back with an hook of six teeth" ([Eze
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004).md), the six teeth being those six
plagues. Rather, "lead thee about" \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU and Septuagint\].
As Antiochus was led (to his ruin) to leave Egypt for an expedition
against Palestine, so shall the last great enemy of God be.

north parts--from the extreme north \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 39:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 39:3</span></span>

bow--in which the Scythians were most expert.

[Ezekiel 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 39:4</span></span>

(Compare [Eze 39:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md).

upon the mountains of Israel--The scene of Israel's preservation shall
be that of the ungodly foe's destruction.

[Ezekiel 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 39:6</span></span>

carelessly--in self-confident security.

the isles--Those dwelling in maritime regions, who had helped Gog with
fleets and troops, shall be visited with the fire of God's wrath in
their own lands.

[Ezekiel 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 39:7</span></span>

not let them pollute my holy name--by their sins bringing down judgments
which made the heathen think that I was unable or unwilling to save My
people.

[Ezekiel 39:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 39:8</span></span>

it is come . . . it is done--The prediction of the salvation of My
people, and the ruin of their enemy, is come to pass--is done:
expressing that the event foretold is as certain as if it were already
accomplished.

[Ezekiel 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 39:9</span></span>

The burning of the foe's weapons implies that nothing belonging to them
should be left to pollute the land. The seven years (seven being the
sacred number) spent on this work, implies the completeness of the
cleansing, and the people's zeal for purity. How different from the
ancient Israelites, who left not merely the arms, but the heathen
themselves, to remain among them \[FAIRBAIRN\], ([Jdg
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md); [Jdg
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#002.md); [Psa
106:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#034).md). The desolation by
Antiochus began in the one hundred and forty-first year of the
SeleucidÃ&brvbr;. From this date to 148, a period of six years and four
months ("2300 days," [Dan 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014).md), when
the temple-worship was restored (1 Maccabees 4:52), God vouchsafed many
triumphs to His people; from this time to the death of Antiochus, early
in 149, a period of seven months, the Jews had rest from Antiochus, and
purified their land, and on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month
celebrated the EncÃ&brvbr;nia, or feast of dedication ([Joh
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022).md) and purification of the temple.
The whole period, in round numbers, was seven years. Mattathias was the
patriotic Jewish leader, and his third son, Judas, the military
commander under whom the Syrian generals were defeated. He retook
Jerusalem and purified the temple. Simon and Jonathan, his brothers,
succeeded him: the independence of the Jews was secured, and the crown
vested in the Asmonean family, in which it continued till Herod the
Great.

[Ezekiel 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 39:11</span></span>

place . . . of graves--Gog found only a grave where he had expected the
spoils of conquest.

valley--So vast were to be the masses that nothing but a deep valley
would suffice for their corpses.

the passengers on the east of the sea--those travelling on the high
road, east of the Dead Sea, from Syria to Petra and Egypt. The publicity
of the road would cause many to observe God's judgments, as the stench
(as English Version translates) or the multitude of graves (as HENDERSON
translates, "it shall stop the passengers") would arrest the attention
of passers-by. Their grave would be close to that of their ancient
prototypes, Sodom and Gomorrah in the Dead Sea, both alike being signal
instances of God's judgments.

[Ezekiel 39:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 39:13</span></span>

I . . . glorified--in destroying the foe ([Eze
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#022).md).

[Ezekiel 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 39:14</span></span>

with the passengers--The men employed continually in the burying were to
be helped by those happening to pass by; all were to combine.

after the end of seven months shall they search--to see if the work was
complete \[MUNSTER\].

[Ezekiel 39:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 39:15</span></span>

First "all the people of the land" engaged in the burying for seven
months; then special men were employed, at the end of the seven months,
to search for any still left unburied. The passers-by helped them by
setting up a mark near any such bones, in order to keep others from
being defiled by casually touching them, and that the buriers might come
and remove them. Denoting the minute care to put away every relic of
heathen pollution from the Holy Land.

[Ezekiel 39:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 39:16</span></span>

A city in the neighborhood was to receive the name Hamonah, "multitude,"
to commemorate the overthrow of the multitudes of the foe \[HENDERSON\].
The multitude of the slain shall give a name to the city of Jerusalem
after the land shall have been cleansed \[GROTIUS\]. Jerusalem shall be
famed as the conqueror of multitudes.

[Ezekiel 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 39:17</span></span>

([Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017).md).

sacrifice--Anciently worshippers feasted on the sacrifices. The birds
and beasts of prey are invited to the sacrificial feast provided by God
(compare [Isa 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#006.md); [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md); [Mar
9:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#049).md). Here this sacrifice holds only
a subordinate place in the picture, and so is put last. Not only shall
their bones lie long unburied, but they shall be stripped of the flesh
by beasts and birds of prey.

[Ezekiel 39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 39:18</span></span>

rams . . . lambs . . . goats--By these various animal victims used in
sacrifices are meant various ranks of men, princes, generals, and
soldiers (compare [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md).

fatlings of Bashan--ungodly men of might ([Psa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012).md). Bashan, beyond Jordan, was
famed for its fat cattle. Fat implies prosperity which often makes men
refractory towards God ([Deu
32:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#014).md).

[Ezekiel 39:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 39:20</span></span>

my table--the field of battle on the mountains of Israel ([Eze
38:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#008.md), [Eze
38:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#020).md).

chariots--that is, charioteers.

[Ezekiel 39:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 39:22</span></span>

So the house of Israel shall know . . . Lord--by My interposition for
them. So, too, the heathen shall be led to fear the name of the Lord
([Psa 102:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015).md).

[Ezekiel 39:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 39:23</span></span>

hid I my face-- ([Deu 31:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#017.md); [Isa
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 39:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 39:25</span></span>

bring again the captivity--restore from calamity to prosperity.

the whole house of Israel--so "all Israel" ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md). The restorations of Israel
heretofore have been partial; there must be one yet future that is to be
universal ([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).md).

[Ezekiel 39:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 39:26</span></span>

After that they have borne their shame--the punishment of their sin:
after they have become sensible of their guilt, and ashamed of it ([Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031).md).

[Ezekiel 39:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 39:27</span></span>

sanctified in them--vindicated as holy in My dealings with them.

[Ezekiel 39:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 39:28</span></span>

The Jews, having no dominion, settled country, or fixed property to
detain them, may return at any time without difficulty (compare [Hos
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 39:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 39:29</span></span>

poured out my Spirit upon . . . Israel--the sure forerunner of their
conversion ([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). The pouring out of His Spirit
is a pledge that He will hide His face no more ([Co2
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md); [Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

The arrangements as to the land and the temple are, in many particulars,
different from those subsisting before the captivity. There are things
in it so improbable physically as to preclude a purely literal
interpretation. The general truth seems to hold good that, as Israel
served the nations for his rejection of Messiah, so shall they serve him
in the person of Messiah, when he shall acknowledge Messiah ([Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012.md); [Zac
14:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#017.md); compare [Psa
72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011).md). The ideal temple exhibits,
under Old Testament forms (used as being those then familiar to the men
whom Ezekiel, a priest himself, and one who delighted in sacrificial
images, addresses), not the precise literal outline, but the essential
character of the worship of Messiah as it shall be when He shall
exercise sway in Jerusalem among His own people, the Jews, and thence to
the ends of the earth. The very fact that the whole is a vision ([Eze
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002).md), not an oral face-to-face
communication such as that granted to Moses ([Num
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md), implies that the directions
are not to be understood so precisely literally as those given to the
Jewish lawgiver. The description involves things which, taken literally,
almost involve natural impossibilities. The square of the temple, in
[Eze 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#020.md), is six times as large as
the circuit of the wall enclosing the old temple, and larger than all
the earthly Jerusalem. Ezekiel gives three and a half miles and one
hundred forty yards to his temple square. The boundaries of the ancient
city were about two and a half miles. Again, the city in Ezekiel has an
area between three or four thousand square miles, including the holy
ground set apart for the prince, priests, and Levites. This is nearly as
large as the whole of Judea west of the Jordan. As Zion lay in the
center of the ideal city, the one-half of the sacred portion extended to
nearly thirty miles south of Jerusalem, that is, covered nearly the
whole southern territory, which reached only to the Dead Sea ([Eze
47:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#019).md), and yet five tribes were to
have their inheritance on that side of Jerusalem, beyond the sacred
portion ([Eze 48:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#023).md). Where was
land to be found for them there? A breadth of but four or five miles
apiece would be left. As the boundaries of the land are given the same
as under Moses, these incongruities cannot be explained away by
supposing physical changes about to be effected in the land such as will
meet the difficulties of the purely literal interpretation. The
distribution of the land is in equal portions among the twelve tribes,
without respect to their relative numbers, and the parallel sections
running from east to west. There is a difficulty also in the supposed
separate existence of the twelve tribes, such separate tribeships no
longer existing, and it being hard to imagine how they could be restored
as distinct tribes, mingled as they now are. So the stream that issued
from the east threshold of the temple and flowed into the Dead Sea, in
the rapidity of its increase and the quality of its waters, is unlike
anything ever known in Judea or elsewhere in the world. Lastly, the
catholicity of the Christian dispensation, and the spirituality of its
worship, seem incompatible with a return to the local narrowness and
"beggarly elements" of the Jewish ritual and carnal ordinances,
disannulled "because of the unprofitableness thereof" \[FAIRBAIRN\],
([Gal 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md), [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md); [Heb
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md); [Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md). "A temple with sacrifices now
would be a denial of the all-sufficiency of the sacrifice of Christ. He
who sacrificed before confessed the Messiah. He who should sacrifice now
would solemnly deny Him" \[DOUGLAS\]. These difficulties, however, may
be all seeming, not real. Faith accepts God's Word as it is, waits for
the event, sure that it will clear up all such difficulties. Perhaps, as
some think, the beau ideal of a sacred commonwealth is given according
to the then existing pattern of temple services, which would be the
imagery most familiar to the prophet and his hearers at the time. The
minute particularizing of details is in accordance with Ezekiel's style,
even in describing purely ideal scenes. The old temple embodied in
visible forms and rites spiritual truths affecting the people even when
absent from it. So this ideal temple is made in the absence of the
outward temple to serve by description the same purpose of symbolical
instruction as the old literal temple did by forms and acts. As in the
beginning God promised to be a "sanctuary" ([Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016).md) to the captives at the Chebar,
so now at the close is promised a complete restoration and realization
of the theocratic worship and polity under Messiah in its noblest ideal
(compare [Jer 31:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038).md). In [Rev
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md) "no temple" is seen, as in the
perfection of the new dispensation the accidents of place and form are
no longer needed to realize to Christians what Ezekiel imparts to Jewish
minds by the imagery familiar to them. In Ezekiel's temple holiness
stretches over the entire temple, so that in this there is no longer a
distinction between the different parts, as in the old temple: parts
left undeterminate in the latter obtain now a divine sanction, so that
all arbitrariness is excluded. So that it is be a perfect manifestation
of the love of God to His covenant-people (Eze. 40:1-43:12); and from
it, as from a new center of religious life, there gushes forth the
fulness of blessings to them, and so to all people (Eze. 47:1-23)
\[FAIRBAIRN and HAVERNICK\]. The temple built at the return from Babylon
can only very partially have realized the model here given. The law is
seemingly opposed to the gospel ([Mat
5:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md), [Mat
5:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md), [Mat
5:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033).md). It is not really so (compare
[Mat 5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md); [Rom
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#031.md); [Gal
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021).md). It is true Christ's
sacrifice superseded the law sacrifices ([Heb
10:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md). Israel's province may
hereafter be to show the essential identity, even in the minute details
of the temple sacrifices, between the law and gospel ([Rom
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008).md). The ideal of the theocratic
temple will then first be realized.
