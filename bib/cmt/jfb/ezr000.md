EZRA was, along with Nehemiah, reckoned one book by the ancient Jews,
who called them the First and Second Books of Ezra, and they are still
designated by Roman Catholic writers the First and Second Books of
Esdras. This book naturally divides itself into two parts or sections,
the one contained in the first six chapters, and which relates the
circumstances connected with the return of the first detachment of
Babylonish exiles under Zerubbabel with the consequent rebuilding of the
temple and the re-establishment of the divine service. The other part,
embraced in the four concluding chapters, narrates the journey of a
second caravan of returning captives under the conduct of Ezra himself,
who was invested with powers to restore, in all its splendor, the entire
system of the Jewish ritual. The general opinion of the Church in every
succeeding age has been that Ezra was the author of this book. The chief
objection is founded on [Ezr 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#004),
where the words, "Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the
names of the men that make this building?" have occasioned a surmise
that the first portion of the book was not written by Ezra, who did not
go to Jerusalem for many years after. But a little attention will show
the futility of this objection, as the words in question did not refer
to the writer, but were used by Tatnai and his associates \[[Ezr
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#003)\]. The style and unity of object
in the book clearly prove it to have been the production of but one
author. The canonical authority of this book is well established; but
another under the name of Ezra is rejected as apocryphal.
