[2 Corinthians](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)

THE following reasons seem to have induced Paul to write this Second
Epistle to the Corinthians: (1) That he might explain the reasons for
his having deferred to pay them his promised visit, by taking Corinth as
his way to Macedonia ([Co1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019); [Co2
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015); compare [Co1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005)); and so that he might set forth
to them his apostolic walk in general ([Co2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012), [Co2
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024); [Co2
6:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#003); [Co2
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#002)). (2) That he might commend their
obedience in reference to the directions in his First Epistle, and at
the same time direct them now to forgive the offender, as having been
punished sufficiently ([Co2 2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001);
[Co2 7:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006)). (3) That he might urge
them to collect for the poor saints at Jerusalem ([Co2
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001), [Co2
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#015)). (4) That he might maintain his
apostolic authority and reprove gainsayers.

The external testimonies for its genuineness are IRENÃ†US \[Against
Heresies, 3,7,1\]; ATHENAGORAS \[Of the Resurrection of the Dead\];
CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA \[Miscellanies, 3, p. 94; 4, p. 101\]; TERTULLIAN
\[On Modesty, 13\].

The TIME OF WRITING was after Pentecost, A.D. 57, when Paul left Ephesus
for Troas. Having stayed in the latter place for some time preaching the
Gospel with effect ([Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)), he
went on to Macedonia, being eager to meet Titus there, having been
disappointed in his not coming to Troas, as had been agreed on between
them. Having heard from him the tidings he so much desired of the good
effect produced on the Corinthians by his First Epistle, and after
having tested the liberality of the Macedonian churches ([Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001)), he wrote this Second Epistle,
and then went on to Greece, where he abode for three months; and then,
after travelling by land, reached Philippi on his return at Passover or
Easter, A.D. 58 ([Act 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)). So that
this Epistle must have been written about autumn, A.D. 57.

Macedonia was THE PLACE from which it was written ([Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002), where the present tense, "I
boast," or "am boasting," implies his presence then in Macedonia). In
Asia (Lydian Asia) he had undergone some great peril of his life ([Co2
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008)), whether the reference be
\[PALEY\] to the tumult at Ephesus (Acts 19:23-41), or, as ALFORD
thinks, to a dangerous illness in which he despaired of life. Thence he
passed by Troas to Philippi, the first city which would meet him in
entering Macedonia. The importance of the Philippian Church would induce
him to stay there some time; as also his desire to collect contributions
from the Macedonian churches for the poor saints at Jerusalem. His
anxiety of mind is recorded ([Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005))
as occurring when he came into Macedonia, and therefore must have been
at Philippi, which was the first city of Macedonia in coming from Troas;
and here, too, from [Co2 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006), compared
with [Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005), must have been the
scene of his receiving the comforting tidings from Titus. "Macedonia" is
used for Philippi in [Co2 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009), as is
proved by comparison with [Phi
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015). So it is probably used here
([Co2 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)). ALFORD argues from [Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001), where he speaks of the "grace
bestowed on the churches (plural) of Macedonia," that Paul must have
visited other churches in Macedonia, besides Philippi, when he wrote,
for example, Thessalonica, Berea, &c., and that Philippi, the first on
his route, is less likely to have been the scene of his writing than the
last on his route, whichever it was, perhaps Thessalonica. But Philippi,
as being the chief town of the province, was probably the place to which
all the collections of the churches were sent. Ancient tradition, too
(as appears from the subscription to this Epistle), favors the view that
Philippi was the place from which this Epistle was sent by the hands of
Titus who received, besides, a charge to prosecute at Corinth the
collection which he had begun at his first visit ([Co2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006)).

The STYLE is most varied, and passes rapidly from one phase of feeling
to another; now joyous and consolatory, again severe and full of
reproof; at one time gentle and affectionate, at another, sternly
rebuking opponents and upholding his dignity as an apostle. This variety
of style accords with the warm and earnest character of the apostle,
which nowhere is manifested more beautifully than in this Epistle. His
bodily frailty, and the chronic malady under which he suffered, and
which is often alluded to ([Co2 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007);
[Co2 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001); [Co2
12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007); compare Note, see on [Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008)), must have been especially trying
to one of his ardent temperament. But besides this, was the more
pressing anxiety of the "care of all the churches." At Corinth, as
elsewhere, Judaizing emissaries wished to bind legal fetters of letter
and form (compare 2Co. 3:3-18) on the freedom and catholicity of the
Church. On the other hand, there were free thinkers who defended their
immorality of practice by infidel theories ([Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012), [Co1
15:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)). These were the "fightings
without," and "fears within" ([Co2
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)) which agitated the apostle's
mind until Titus brought him comforting tidings from Corinth. Even then,
while the majority at Corinth had testified their repentance, and, as
Paul had desired, excommunicated the incestuous person, and contributed
for the poor Christians of Judea, there was still a minority who, more
contemptuously than ever, resisted the apostle. These accused him of
crafty and mercenary motives, as if he had personal gain in view in the
collection being made; and this, notwithstanding his scrupulous care to
be above the possibility of reasonable suspicion, by having others
besides himself to take charge of the money. This insinuation was
palpably inconsistent with their other charge, that he could be no true
apostle, as he did not claim maintenance from the churches which he
founded. Another accusation they brought of cowardly weakness; that he
was always threatening severe measures without daring to execute them
([Co2 10:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008); [Co2
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002)); and that he was vacillating in
his teaching and practice, circumcising Timothy, and yet withholding
circumcision from Titus; a Jew among the Jews, and a Greek among the
Greeks. That most of these opponents were of the Judaizing party in the
Church, appears from [Co2 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022). They
seem to have been headed by an emissary from Judea ("he that cometh,"
[Co2 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#004)), who had brought "letters
of commendation" ([Co2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)) from
members of the Church at Jerusalem, and who boasted of his purity of
Hebrew descent, and his close connection with Christ Himself ([Co2
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013), [Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)). His partisans contrasted his
high pretensions with the timid humility of Paul ([Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003)); and his rhetoric with the
apostle's plain and unadorned style ([Co2
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#006); [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010), [Co2
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013)). It was this state of things at
Corinth, reported by Titus, that caused Paul to send him back forthwith
thither with this Second Epistle, which is addressed, not to Corinth
only ([Co1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002)), but to all the
churches also in Achaia ([Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)),
which had in some degree been affected by the same causes as affected
the Corinthian Church. The widely different tone in different parts of
the Epistle is due to the diversity which existed at Corinth between the
penitent majority and the refractory minority. The former he addresses
with the warmest affection; the latter with menace and warning. Two
deputies, chosen by the churches to take charge of the contribution to
be collected at Corinth, accompanied Titus ([Co2
8:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022)).
