*A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New
Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Psalms Chapter 64](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 64:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 64:1</span></span>

A prayer for deliverance from cunning and malicious enemies, with a
confident view of their overthrow, which will honor God and give joy to
the righteous. ([Psa 64:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#001).md)

preserve . . . fear--as well as the danger producing it.

[Psalms 64:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 64:2</span></span>

insurrection--literally, "uproar," noisy assaults, as well as their
secret counsels.

[Psalms 64:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 64:3</span></span>

Similar figures for slander ([Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md); [Psa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007).md).

bend--literally, "tread," or, "prepared." The allusion is to the mode of
bending a bow by treading on it; here, and in [Psa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007.md), transferred to arrows.

[Psalms 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 64:4</span></span>

the perfect--one innocent of the charges made ([Psa
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023).md).

fear not-- ([Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019).md), not regarding
God.

[Psalms 64:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 64:5</span></span>

A sentiment here more fully presented, by depicting their deliberate
malice.

[Psalms 64:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 64:6</span></span>

This is further evinced by their diligent efforts and deeply laid
schemes.

[Psalms 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 64:7</span></span>

The contrast is heightened by representing God as using weapons like
theirs.

[Psalms 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 64:8</span></span>

their . . . tongue to fall, &c.--that is, the consequences of their
slanders, &c. (compare [Psa 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002.md); [Psa
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#016).md).

all that see . . . away--Their partners in evil shall be terrified.

[Psalms 64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 64:9</span></span>

Men, generally, will acknowledge God's work, and the righteous,
rejoicing in it, shall be encouraged to trust Him ([Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010).md).
