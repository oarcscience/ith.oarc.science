### [2 Chronicles Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 26:1</span></span>

UZZIAH SUCCEEDS AMAZIAH AND REIGNS WELL IN THE DAYS OF ZECHARIAH. ([Ch2
26:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md)

Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah--(See on [Kg2
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md); [Kg2
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001).md).

[2 Chronicles 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 26:2</span></span>

He built Eloth--or, "He it was who built Eloth." The account of the
fortifications of this port on the Red Sea, which Uzziah restored to the
kingdom of Judah ([Ch2 33:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#013).md), is
placed before the chronological notices ([Ch2
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#003).md), either on account of the
importance attached to the conquest of Eloth, or from the desire of the
historian to introduce Uzziah as the king, who was known as the
conqueror of Eloth. Besides, it indicates that the conquest occurred in
the early part of his reign, that it was important as a port, and that
Hebrew merchants maintained the old trade between it and the countries
of the East \[BERTHEAU\].

[2 Chronicles 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 26:5</span></span>

he sought God in the days of Zechariah--a wise and pious counsellor, who
was skilled in understanding the meaning and lessons of the ancient
prophecies, and who wielded a salutary influence over Uzziah.

[2 Chronicles 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 26:6</span></span>

he went forth and warred against the Philistines--He overcame them in
many engagements--dismantled their towns, and erected fortified cities
in various parts of the country, to keep them in subjection.

Jabneh--the same as Jabneel ([Jos
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#011).md).

[2 Chronicles 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 26:7</span></span>

Gur-baal--thought by some to be Gerar, and by others Gebal.

[2 Chronicles 26:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 26:8</span></span>

the Ammonites gave gifts--The countries east of the Jordan became
tributary to him, and by the rapid succession and extent of his
victories, his kingdom was extended to the Egyptian frontier.

[2 Chronicles 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 26:9</span></span>

HIS BUILDINGS. ([Ch2 26:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009).md)

Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, &c.--whence resistance could be made,
or missiles discharged against assailants. The sites of the principal of
these towers were: at the corner gate ([Ch2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023).md), the northwest corner of the
city; at the valley gate on the west, where the Joppa gate now is; at
the "turning"--a curve in the city wall on the eastern side of Zion. The
town, at this point, commanded the horse gate which defended Zion and
the temple hill on the southeast \[BERTHEAU\].

[2 Chronicles 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 26:10</span></span>

Also he built towers in the desert--for the threefold purpose of
defense, of observation, and of shelter to his cattle. He dug also a
great many wells, for he loved and encouraged all branches of
agriculture. Some of these "were in the desert," that is, in the
district to the southeast of Jerusalem, on the west of the Dead Sea, an
extensive grazing district "in the low country" lying between the
mountains of Judah and the Mediterranean; "and in the plains," east of
the Jordan, within the territory of Reuben ([Deu
4:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#043.md); [Jos
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos020.htm#008).md).

in Carmel--This mountain, being within the boundary of Israel, did not
belong to Uzziah; and as it is here placed in opposition to the
vine-bearing mountains, it is probably used, not as a proper name, but
to signify, as the word denotes, "fruitful fields" (Margin).

[2 Chronicles 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 26:11</span></span>

HIS HOST, AND ENGINES OF WAR. ([Ch2
26:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#011).md)

an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands--He raised a
strong body of militia, divided into companies or regiments of uniform
size, which served in rotation. The enumeration was performed by two
functionaries expert in the drawing up of military muster-rolls, under
the superintendence of Hananiah, one of the high officers of the crown.
The army consisted of 307,500 picked men, under the command of two
thousand gallant officers, chiefs or heads of fathers' houses, so that
each father's house formed a distinct band. They were fully equipped
with every kind of military accoutrements, from brazen helmets, a
habergeon or coat of mail, to a sling for stones.

[2 Chronicles 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ch2 26:15</span></span>

he made . . . engines, invented by cunning men . . . to shoot arrows and
great stones--This is the first notice that occurs in history of the use
of machines for throwing projectiles. The invention is apparently
ascribed to the reign of Uzziah, and PLINY expressly says they
originated in Syria.

he was marvellously helped till he was strong--He conducted himself as
became the viceroy of the Divine King, and prospered.

[2 Chronicles 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 26:16</span></span>

HE INVADES THE PRIEST'S OFFICE, AND IS SMITTEN WITH LEPROSY. ([Ch2
26:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#016).md)

he transgressed against the Lord, &c.--(See on [Kg2
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#005).md). This daring and wicked act is
in both records traced to the intoxicating influence of overweening
pride and vanity. But here the additional circumstances are stated, that
his entrance was opposed, and strong remonstrances made ([Ch1
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#010).md) by the high priest, who was
accompanied by eighty inferior priests. Rage and threats were the only
answers he deigned to return, but God took care to vindicate the
sacredness of the priestly office. At the moment the king lifted the
censer, He struck him with leprosy. The earthquake mentioned ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001).md) is said to have been felt at the
moment \[JOSEPHUS\].

[2 Chronicles 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 26:21</span></span>

dwelt in a several house--in an infirmary \[BERTHEAU\].

[2 Chronicles 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch2 26:23</span></span>

they buried him . . . in the field of the burial which belonged to the
kings--He was interred not in, but near, the sepulcher of the kings, as
the corpse of a leper would have polluted it.
