### [Proverbs Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

[Proverbs 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 5:1</span></span>

A warning against the seductive arts of wicked women, enforced by
considering the advantages of chastity, and the miserable end of the
wicked. (Pro. 5:1-23)

This connection of wisdom and understanding is frequent ([Pro
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#002.md); [Pro
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007).md); the first denotes the use of
wise means for wise ends; the other, the exercise of a proper
discrimination in their discovery.

[Proverbs 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pro 5:2</span></span>

regard--or, "observe."

keep--preserve constantly.

[Proverbs 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 5:3</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#016).md). Her enticing
promises are deceitful.

[Proverbs 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 5:4</span></span>

her end--literally, "her future," in sense of reward, what follows
(compare [Psa 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037.md); [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017).md). Its nature is evinced by the
use of figures, opposite those of [Pro
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#003.md). The physical and moral suffering
of the deluded profligate are notoriously terrible.

[Proverbs 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pro 5:5</span></span>

feet . . . , steps--that is, course of life ends in death.

[Proverbs 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 5:6</span></span>

her ways . . . know--Some prefer, "that she may not ponder the path of
life," &c.; but perhaps a better sense is, "her ways are varied, so as
to prevent your knowledge of her true character, and so of true
happiness."

[Proverbs 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pro 5:8</span></span>

Avoid the slightest temptation.

[Proverbs 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 5:9</span></span>

thine honour--in whatever consisting, strength ([Pro
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#013).md) or wealth.

thy years--by cutting them off in dissipation.

unto the cruel--for such the sensual are apt to become.

[Proverbs 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pro 5:10</span></span>

wealth--literally, "strength," or the result of it.

labours--the fruit of thy painful exertions ([Psa
127:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002).md). There may be a reference to
slavery, a commuted punishment for death due the adulterer ([Deu
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022).md).

[Proverbs 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 5:11</span></span>

at the last--the end, or reward (compare [Pro
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#004).md).

mourn--roar in pain.

flesh and . . . body--the whole person under incurable disease.

[Proverbs 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 5:12</span></span>

The ruined sinner vainly laments his neglect of warning and his sad fate
in being brought to public disgrace.

[Proverbs 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 5:14</span></span>

evil--for affliction, as in [Gen
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#020.md); [Gen
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#015.md).

[Proverbs 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 5:15</span></span>

By figures, in which well, cistern, and fountain \[[Pro
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015.md), [Pro
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md)\] represent the wife, and rivers
of waters \[[Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md)\] the children,
men are exhorted to constancy and satisfaction in lawful conjugal
enjoyments. In [Pro 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016.md), fountains
(in the plural) rather denote the produce or waters of a spring,
literally, "what is from a spring," and corresponds with "rivers of
waters."

[Proverbs 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 5:17</span></span>

only thine own--harlots' children have no known father.

[Proverbs 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pro 5:18</span></span>

wife . . . youth--married in youth.

[Proverbs 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 5:19</span></span>

loving . . . roe--other figures for a wife from the well-known beauty of
these animals.

breasts--(Compare [Sol 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#013.md); [Eze
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#003.md), [Eze
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#008).md).

ravished--literally, "intoxicated," that is, fully satisfied.

[Proverbs 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pro 5:21</span></span>

The reason, God's eye is on you,

[Proverbs 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 5:22</span></span>

and He will cause sin to bring its punishment.

[Proverbs 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 5:23</span></span>

without instruction--literally, "in want of instruction," having refused
it (compare [Job 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md); [Heb
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024).md).

go astray--literally, "be drunken." The word "ravished" ([Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019).md) here denotes fulness of
punishment.
