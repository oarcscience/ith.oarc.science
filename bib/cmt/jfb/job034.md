### [Job Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

[Job 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 34:1</span></span>

(Job 34:1-37)

answered--proceeded.

[Job 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 34:2</span></span>

This chapter is addressed also to the "friends" as the thirty-third
chapter to Job alone.

[Job 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 34:3</span></span>

palate--(See on [Job 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#011.md); [Job
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#002).md).

[Job 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 34:4</span></span>

judgment--Let us select among the conflicting sentiments advanced, what
will stand the test of examination.

[Job 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 34:5</span></span>

judgment--my right. Job's own words ([Job
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#018.md); [Job
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#002).md).

[Job 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 34:6</span></span>

Were I to renounce my right (that is, confess myself guilty), I should
die. Job virtually had said so ([Job
27:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#004.md); [Job
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028).md). MAURER, not so well,
"Notwithstanding my right (innocence) I am treated as a liar," by God,
by His afflicting me.

my wound--literally, "mine arrow," namely, by which I am pierced. So "my
stroke" ("hand," [Job 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002), Margin.md).
My sickness ([Job 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#004.md); [Job
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#013).md).

without transgression--without fault of mine to deserve it ([Job
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#017).md).

[Job 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 34:7</span></span>

([Job 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#016).md). Image from the camel.

scorning--against God ([Job 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#004).md).

[Job 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 34:8</span></span>

Job virtually goes in company (makes common cause) with the wicked, by
taking up their sentiments ([Job
9:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#022.md), [Job
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#030.md); [Job
21:7-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007).md), or at least by saying, that
those who act on such sentiments are unpunished ([Mal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#014).md). To deny God's righteous
government because we do not see the reasons of His acts, is virtually
to take part with the ungodly.

[Job 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 34:9</span></span>

with God--in intimacy ([Psa 50:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#018.md),
Margin).

[Job 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 34:10</span></span>

The true answer to Job, which God follows up (Job 38:1-41). Man is to
believe God's ways are right, because they are His, not because we fully
see they are so ([Rom 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014.md); [Deu
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md); [Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md).

[Job 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 34:11</span></span>

Partly here; fully, hereafter ([Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019.md); [Rom
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md); [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); [Rev
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#012).md).

[Job 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 34:12</span></span>

([Job 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#003).md). In opposition to Job, [Job
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#005.md), will not--cannot.

[Job 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 34:13</span></span>

If the world were not God's property, as having been made by Him, but
committed to His charge by some superior, it might be possible for Him
to act unjustly, as He would not thereby be injuring Himself; but as it
is, for God to act unjustly would undermine the whole order of the
world, and so would injure God's own property ([Job
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#023).md).

disposed--hath founded ([Isa 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md),
established the circle of the globe.

[Job 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 34:14</span></span>

"If He were to set His heart on man," either to injure him, or to take
strict account of his sins. The connection supports rather \[UMBREIT\],
"If He had regard to himself (only), and were to gather unto Himself
([Psa 104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029).md) man's spirit, &c. (which
he sends forth, [Psa 104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md); [Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007).md), all flesh must perish
together," &c. ([Gen 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019).md). God's
loving preservation of His creatures proves He cannot be selfish, and
therefore cannot be unjust.

[Job 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 34:16</span></span>

In [Job 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md), Elihu had spoken to all
in general, now he calls Job's special attention.

[Job 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 34:17</span></span>

"Can even He who (in thy view) hateth right (justice) govern?" The
government of the world would be impossible if injustice were
sanctioned. God must be just, because He governs ([Sa2
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#003).md).

govern--literally, "bind," namely, by authority (so "reign," [Sa1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#017), Margin.md). UMBREIT translates for
"govern, repress wrath, namely, against Job for his accusations.

most just--rather, "Him who is at once mighty and just" (in His
government of the world).

[Job 34:18](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 34:18</span></span>

Literally, (Is it fit) to be said to a king? It would be a gross outrage
to reproach thus an earthly monarch, much more the King of kings ([Exo
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028).md). But MAURER with the Septuagint
and Vulgate reads, (It is not fit to accuse of injustice Him) who says
to a king, Thou art wicked; to princes, Ye are ungodly; that is, who
punishes impartially the great, as the small. This accords with [Job
34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md).

[Job 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 34:19</span></span>

([Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md); [Ch2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md); [Pro
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002.md); [Job
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#015).md).

[Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 34:20</span></span>

they--"the rich" and "princes" who offend God.

the people--namely, of the guilty princes: guilty also themselves.

at midnight--image from a night attack of an enemy on a camp, which
becomes an easy prey ([Exo 12:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029).md).

without hand--without visible agency, by the mere word of God (so [Job
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#026.md); [Zac
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md); [Dan
2:34](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034).md).

[Job 34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 34:21</span></span>

God's omniscience and omnipotence enable Him to execute immediate
justice. He needs not to be long on the "watch," as Job thought ([Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012.md); [Ch2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#009.md); [Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019).md).

[Job 34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">job 34:22</span></span>

shadow of death--thick darkness ([Amo
9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md); [Psa
139:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#012).md).

[Job 34:23](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 34:23</span></span>

([Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md); [Lam
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#032.md); [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008).md). Better, as UMBREIT, "He does
not (needs not to) regard (as in [Job
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#014.md); [Isa
41:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#020).md) man long (so Hebrew, [Gen
46:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#029).md) in order that he may go (be
brought by God) into judgment." Literally, "lest his (attention) upon
men" ([Job 11:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#010).md). So [Job
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024.md), "without number" ought to be
translated, "without \[needing any\] searching out," such as has to be
made in human judgments.

[Job 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 34:24</span></span>

break in pieces-- ([Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md); [Job
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#018.md); [Dan
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021).md).

[Job 34:25](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 34:25</span></span>

Therefore--because He knows all things ([Job
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#021).md). He knows their works, without
a formal investigation ([Job 34:24](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#024).md).

in the night--suddenly, unexpectedly ([Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020).md). Fitly in the night, as it was
in it that the godless hid themselves ([Job
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022).md). UMBREIT, less simply, for
"overturneth," translates, "walketh"; that is, God is ever on the alert,
discovering all wickedness.

[Job 34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 34:26</span></span>

He striketh them--chasteneth.

as--that is, because they are wicked.

sight of others--Sinners hid themselves in darkness; therefore they are
punished before all, in open day. Image from the place of public
execution ([Job 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#012.md); [Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md); [Sa2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012).md).

[Job 34:27](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">job 34:27</span></span>

The grounds of their punishment in [Job
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md). [Job
34:28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#028.md) states in what respect they
"considered not God's ways," namely, by oppression, whereby "they caused
the cry," &c.

[Job 34:29](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">job 34:29</span></span>

([Pro 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007.md); [Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003).md).

make trouble--rather, "condemn" ([Rom
8:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md). MAURER, from the reference
being only to the godless, in the next clause, and [Job
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md) translates, "When God keeps
quiet" (leaves men to perish) [Psa
83:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md); \[UMBREIT\] from the Arabic
(strikes to the earth), "who shall condemn Him as unjust?" [Job
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#017.md).

hideth . . . face-- ([Job 23:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008.md); [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001).md).

it be done--Whether it be against a guilty nation ([Kg2
18:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#009).md) or an individual, that God
acts so.

[Job 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">job 34:30</span></span>

Ensnared--into sin ([Kg1 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md), [Kg1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030).md). Or rather, "enthralled by
further oppression," [Job 34:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#026.md).

[Job 34:31](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">job 34:31</span></span>

Job accordingly says so ([Job 40:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#003.md);
[Mic 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md); [Lev
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041).md). It was to lead him to this
that Elihu was sent. Though no hypocrite, Job, like all, had sin;
therefore through affliction he was to be brought to humble himself
under God. All sorrow is a proof of the common heritage of sin, in which
the godly shares; and therefore he ought to regard it as a merciful
correction. UMBREIT and MAURER lose this by translating, as the Hebrew
will bear, "Has any a right to say to God, I have borne chastisement and
yet have not sinned?" (so [Job 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#006).md).

borne--namely, the penalty of sin, as in [Lev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001.md), [Lev
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#017.md).

offend--literally, "to deal destructively or corruptly" ([Neh
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#007).md).

[Job 34:32](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">job 34:32</span></span>

([Job 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#002.md); [Psa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md); [Psa
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md); [Psa
139:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023).md).

no more-- ([Pro 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022).md).

[Job 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">job 34:33</span></span>

Rather, "should God recompense (sinners) according to thy mind? Then it
is for thee to reject and to choose, and not me" \[UMBREIT\]; or as
MAURER, "For thou hast rejected God's way of recompensing; state
therefore thy way, for thou must choose, not I," that is, it is thy
part, not mine, to show a better way than God's.

[Job 34:34](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">job 34:34</span></span>

Rather, "men . . . will say to me, and the wise man ([Job
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#002.md), [Job
34:10](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#010)) who hearkens to me (will say.md),
'Job hath spoken,'" &c.

[Job 34:36](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">job 34:36</span></span>

Margin, not so well, "My father," Elihu addressing God. This title does
not elsewhere occur in Job.

tried--by calamities.

answers for wicked men--(See on [Job
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#008).md). Trials of the godly are not
removed until they produce the effect designed.

[Job 34:37](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">job 34:37</span></span>

clappeth . . . hands--in scorn ([Job
27:23](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#023.md); [Eze
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017).md).

multiplieth . . . words-- ([Job 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#002.md);
[Job 35:16](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#016).md). To his original "sin" to
correct which trials have been sent, "he adds rebellion," that is, words
arraigning God's justice.
