### [Judges Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

[Judges 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 3:1</span></span>

NATIONS LEFT TO PROVE ISRAEL. ([Jdg
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#001).md)

these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel--This was the
special design of these nations being left, and it evinces the direct
influence of the theocracy under which the Israelites were placed. These
nations were left for a double purpose: in the first instance, to be
instrumental, by their inroads, in promoting the moral and spiritual
discipline of the Israelites; and also to subserve the design of making
them acquainted with war, in order that the young, more especially, who
were total strangers to it, might learn the use of weapons and the art
of wielding them.

[Judges 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 3:5</span></span>

BY COMMUNION WITH THESE THE ISRAELITES COMMIT IDOLATRY. ([Jdg
3:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#005).md)

the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites--The two peoples by
degrees came to be on habits of intercourse. Reciprocal alliances were
formed by marriage till the Israelites, relaxing the austerity of their
principles, showed a growing conformity to the manners and worship of
their idolatrous neighbors.

[Judges 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 3:8</span></span>

OTHNIEL DELIVERS ISRAEL. ([Jdg 3:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#008).md)

sold them--that is, "delivered them"

into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim--or, Chushan, "the wicked." This
name had been probably given him from his cruel and impious character.

served Chushan-rishathaim eight years--by the payment of a stipulated
tribute yearly, the raising of which must have caused a great amount of
labor and privation.

[Judges 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 3:9</span></span>

when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord--In their distress they
had recourse to earnest prayer, accompanied by humble and penitent
confession of their errors.

Othniel--(See on [Jos 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016.md); [Jdg
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#013).md). His military experience
qualified him for the work, while the gallant exploits he was known to
have performed, gained him the full confidence of his countrymen in his
ability as a leader.

[Judges 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jdg 3:10</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Israel, and went out
to war--Impelled by a supernatural influence, he undertook the difficult
task of government at this national crisis--addressing himself to
promote a general reformation of manners, the abolition of idolatry, and
the revival of pure religion. After these preliminary measures, he
collected a body of choice warriors to expel the foreign oppressors.

the Lord delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand;
and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim--No details are given
of this war, which, considering the resources of so potent a monarch,
must have been a determined struggle. But the Israelitish arms were
crowned through the blessing of God with victory, and Canaan regained
its freedom and independence.

[Judges 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 3:11</span></span>

Othniel . . . died--How powerful the influence of one good man is, in
church or state, is best found in his loss \[BISHOP HALL\].

[Judges 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 3:12</span></span>

EHUD SLAYS EGLON. (Jdg. 3:12-30)

the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord--The
Israelites, deprived of the moral and political influences of Othniel,
were not long in following their native bias to idolatry.

the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab--The reigning monarch's
ambition was to recover that extensive portion of his ancient territory
possessed by the Israelites. In conjunction with his neighbors, the
Ammonites and the Amalekites, sworn enemies of Israel, he first
subjected the eastern tribes; then crossing the Jordan, he made a sudden
incursion on western Canaan, and in virtue of his conquests, erected
fortifications in the territory adjoining Jericho \[JOSEPHUS\], to
secure the frontier, and fixed his residence there. This oppressor was
permitted, in the providence of God, to triumph for eighteen years.

[Judges 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 3:15</span></span>

Ehud the son of Gera--descended from Gera, one of Benjamin's sons ([Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021).md).

left-handed--This peculiarity distinguished many in the Benjamite tribe
([Jdg 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016).md). But the original word is
rendered in some versions "both-handed," a view countenanced by [Ch1
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#002.md).

by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of
Moab--the yearly tribute, which, according to Eastern fashion, would be
borne with ostentatious ceremony and offered ([Jdg
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#018).md) by several messengers.

[Judges 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 3:16</span></span>

Ehud made him a dagger . . . and he did gird it . . . upon his right
thigh--The sword was usually worn on the left side; so that Ehud's was
the more likely to escape detection.

[Judges 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 3:19</span></span>

quarries--rather, "graven images" ([Deu
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#025.md); [Jer
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#019.md); [Jer
51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052).md); statues of Moabite idols, the
sight of which kindled the patriotic zeal of Ehud to avenge this public
insult to Israel on its author.

I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep
silence--"Privacy"--a signal for all to withdraw.

[Judges 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jdg 3:20</span></span>

a summer parlour--Hebrew, "chamber of cooling"--one of those retired
edifices which Oriental grandees usually have in their gardens, and in
which they repose during the heat of the day.

[Judges 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 3:21</span></span>

Ehud put forth his left hand--The whole circumstance of this daring
act--the death of Eglon without a shriek, or noise--the locking of the
doors--the carrying off the key--the calm, unhurried deportment of
Ehud--show the strength of his confidence that he was doing God service.

[Judges 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 3:27</span></span>

he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim--summoned to arms the
people of that mountainous region, which, adjoining the territory of
Benjamin, had probably suffered most from the grievous oppression of the
Moabites.

[Judges 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jdg 3:28</span></span>

they went down after him, and took the fords--(See on [Jos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#007).md). With the view of preventing all
escape to the Moabite coast, and by the slaughter of ten thousand men
\[[Jdg 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#029.md)\], Ehud rescued his
country from a state of ignominious vassalage.

[Judges 3:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jdg 3:31</span></span>

after him was Shamgar--No notice is given of the tribe or family of this
judge; and from the Philistines being the enemy that roused him into
public service, the suffering seems to have been local--confined to some
of the western tribes.

slew . . . six hundred men with an oxgoad--This instrument is eight feet
long and about six inches in circumference. It is armed at the lesser
end with a sharp prong for driving the cattle, and on the other with a
small iron paddle for removing the clay which encumbers the plough in
working. Such an instrument, wielded by a strong arm, would do no mean
execution. We may suppose, however, for the notice is very fragmentary,
that Shamgar was only the leader of a band of peasants, who by means of
such implements of labor as they could lay hold of at the moment,
achieved the heroic exploit recorded.
