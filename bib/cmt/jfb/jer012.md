### [Jeremiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 12:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE SUBJECT AT THE CLOSE OF THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER. (Jer.
12:1-17)

([Psa 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004)).

let me talk, &c.--only let me reason the case with Thee: inquire of Thee
the causes why such wicked men as these plotters against my life prosper
(compare [Job 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#006); [Job
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#007); [Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001), [Psa
37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035); [Psa
73:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#003); [Mal
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#015)). It is right, when hard thoughts
of God's providence suggest themselves, to fortify our minds by
justifying God beforehand (as did Jeremiah), even before we hear the
reasons of His dealings.

[Jeremiah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 12:2</span></span>

grow--literally "go on," "progress." Thou givest them sure dwellings and
increasing prosperity.

near in . . . mouth . . . far from . . . reins-- ([Isa
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#013); [Mat
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008)). Hypocrites.

[Jeremiah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 12:3</span></span>

knowest me-- ([Psa 139:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001)).

tried . . . heart-- ([Jer 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#020)).

toward thee--rather, "with Thee," that is, entirely devoted to Thee;
contrasted with the hypocrites ([Jer
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002)), "near in . . . mouth, and far
from . . . reins." This being so, how is it that I fare so ill, they so
well?

pull . . . out--containing the metaphor, from a "rooted tree" ([Jer
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#002)).

prepare--literally, "separate," or "set apart as devoted."

day of slaughter-- ([Jam 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 12:4</span></span>

land mourn--personification ([Jer
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#002); [Jer
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010)).

for the wickedness-- ([Psa 107:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#034)).

beasts-- ([Hos 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003)).

He shall not see our last end--Jehovah knows not what is about to happen
to us ([Jer 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)) \[ROSENMULLER\]. So
the Septuagint. ([Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011); [Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012); [Eze
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009)). Rather, "The prophet (Jeremiah,
to whom the whole context refers) shall not see our last end." We need
not trouble ourselves about his boding predictions. We shall not be
destroyed as he says ([Jer 5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 12:5</span></span>

Jehovah's reply to Jeremiah's complaint.

horses--that is, horsemen: the argument a fortiori. A proverbial phrase.
The injuries done thee by the men of Anathoth ("the footmen") are small
compared with those which the men of Jerusalem ("the horsemen") are
about to inflict on thee. If the former weary thee out, how wilt thou
contend with the king, the court, and the priests at Jerusalem?

wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee--English Version thus fills up
the sentence with the italicized words, to answer to the parallel clause
in the first sentence of the verse. The parallelism is, however,
sufficiently retained with a less ellipsis: "If (it is only) in a land
of peace thou art confident" \[MAURER\].

swelling of Jordan--In harvest-time and earlier (April and May) it
overflows its banks ([Jos 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#015)), and
fills the valley called the Ghor. Or, "the pride of Jordan," namely, its
wooded banks abounding in lions and other wild beasts ([Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019); [Jer
50:44](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#044); [Zac
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#003); compare [Kg2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#002)). MAUNDRELL says that between the
Sea of Tiberias and Lake Merom the banks are so wooded that the
traveller cannot see the river at all without first passing through the
woods. If in the campaign country (alone) thou art secure, how wilt thou
do when thou fallest into the wooded haunts of wild beasts?

[Jeremiah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 12:6</span></span>

even thy brethren--as in Christ's case ([Psa
69:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#008); [Joh
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011); [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005); compare [Jer
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004); [Jer
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019), [Jer
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#021); [Mat
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036)). Godly faithfulness is sure to
provoke the ungodly, even of one's own family.

called a multitude after thee-- ([Isa
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#004)). JEROME translates, "cry after
thee with a loud (literally, 'full') voice."

believe . . . not . . . though . . . speak fair-- ([Pro
26:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#025)).

[Jeremiah 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 12:7</span></span>

I have forsaken--Jehovah will forsake His temple and the people
peculiarly His. The mention of God's close tie to them, as heretofore
His, aggravates their ingratitude, and shows that their past spiritual
privileges will not prevent God from punishing them.

beloved of my soul--image from a wife ([Jer
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#015); [Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 12:8</span></span>

is unto me--is become unto Me: behaves towards Me as a lion which roars
against a man, so that he withdraws from the place where he hears it: so
I withdrew from My people, once beloved, but now an object of abhorrence
because of their rebellious cries against Me.

[Jeremiah 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 12:9</span></span>

speckled bird--Many translate, "a ravenous beast, the hyena"; the
corresponding Arabic word means hyena; so the Septuagint. But the Hebrew
always elsewhere means "a bird of prey." The Hebrew for "speckled" is
from a root "to color"; answering to the Jewish blending together with
paganism the altogether diverse Mosaic ritual. The neighboring nations,
birds of prey like herself (for she had sinfully assimilated herself to
them), were ready to pounce upon her.

assemble . . . beasts of . . . field--The Chaldeans are told to gather
the surrounding heathen peoples as allies against Judah ([Isa
56:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#009); [Eze
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 12:10</span></span>

pastors--the Babylonian leaders (compare [Jer
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012); [Jer
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003)).

my vineyard-- ([Isa 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001), [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005)).

trodden my portion-- ([Isa 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 12:11</span></span>

mourneth unto me--that is, before Me. EICHORN translates, "by reason of
Me," because I have given it to desolation ([Jer
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#007)).

because no man layeth it to heart--because none by repentance and prayer
seek to deprecate God's wrath. Or, "yet none lays it to heart"; as in
[Jer 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003) \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 12:12</span></span>

high places--Before, He had threatened the plains; now, the hills.

wilderness--not an uninhabited desert, but high lands of pasturage,
lying between Judea and Chaldea ([Jer
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011)).

[Jeremiah 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 12:13</span></span>

Description in detail of the devastation of the land ([Mic
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#015)).

they shall be ashamed of your--The change of persons, in passing from
indirect to direct address, is frequent in the prophets. Equivalent to,
"Ye shall be put to the shame of disappointment at the smallness of your
produce."

[Jeremiah 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 12:14</span></span>

Prophecy as to the surrounding nations, the Syrians, Ammonites, &c., who
helped forward Judah's calamity: they shall share her fall; and, on
their conversion, they shall share with her in the future restoration.
This is a brief anticipation of the predictions in the forty-seventh,
forty-eighth, and forty-ninth chapters.

touch-- ([Zac 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)).

pluck them out . . . pluck out . . . Judah--(Compare end of [Jer
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016)). During the thirteen years that
the Babylonians besieged Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar, after subduing
CÅ“lo-Syria, brought Ammon, Moab, &c., and finally Egypt, into
subjection \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 10:9.7\]. On the restoration of
these nations, they were to exchange places with the Jews. The latter
were now in the midst of them, but on their restoration they were to be
"in the midst of the Jews," that is, as proselytes to the true God
(compare [Mic 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)). "Pluck them," namely, the
Gentile nations: in a bad sense. "Pluck Judah": in a good sense; used to
express the force which was needed to snatch Judah from the tyranny of
those nations by whom they had been made captives, or to whom they had
fled; otherwise they never would have let Judah go. Previously he had
been forbidden to pray for the mass of the Jewish people. But here he
speaks consolation to the elect remnant among them. Whatever the Jews
might be, God keeps His covenant.

[Jeremiah 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 12:15</span></span>

A promise, applying to Judah, as well as to the nations specified ([Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014)). As to Moab, compare [Jer
48:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#047); as to Ammon, [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006).

[Jeremiah 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 12:16</span></span>

swear by my name-- ([Jer 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002); [Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018); [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016)); that is, confess solemnly the
true God.

built--be made spiritually and temporally prosperous: fixed in sure
habitations (compare [Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006); [Jer
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#010); [Jer
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer045.htm#004); [Psa
87:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004); [Eph
2:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020); [Pe1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)).

[Jeremiah 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 12:17</span></span>

([Isa 60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012)).

Many of these figurative acts being either not possible, or not
probable, or decorous, seem to have existed only in the mind of the
prophet as part of his inward vision. \[So CALVIN\]. The world he moved
in was not the sensible, but the spiritual, world. Inward acts were,
however, when it was possible and proper, materialized by outward
performance but not always, and necessarily so. The internal act made a
naked statement more impressive and presented the subject when extending
over long portions of space and time more concentrated. The interruption
of Jeremiah's official duty by a journey of more than two hundred miles
twice is not likely to have literally taken place.
