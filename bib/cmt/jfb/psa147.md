### [Psalms Chapter 147](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 147:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 147:1</span></span>

This and the remaining Psalms have been represented as specially
designed to celebrate the rebuilding of Jerusalem (compare [Neh
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh006.htm#016.md); [Neh
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#027).md). They all open and close with
the stirring call for praise. This one specially declares God's
providential care towards all creatures, and particularly His people.
(Psa. 147:1-20)

(Compare [Psa 92:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#001.md); [Psa
135:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 147:2</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 107:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#003.md); [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 147:3</span></span>

Though applicable to the captive Israelites, this is a general and
precious truth.

wounds--(Compare Margin).

[Psalms 147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 147:4</span></span>

God's power in nature ([Isa 40:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md),
and often) is presented as a pledge of His power to help His people.

telleth . . . stars--what no man can do ([Gen
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 147:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 147:6</span></span>

That power is put forth for the good of the meek and suffering pious,
and confusion of the wicked ([Psa
146:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 147:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 147:7</span></span>

His providence supplies bountifully the wild animals in their mountain
homes.

Sing . . . Lord--literally, "Answer the Lord," that is, in grateful
praise to His goodness, thus declared in His acts.

[Psalms 147:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 147:10</span></span>

The advantages afforded, as in war by the strength of the horse or the
agility of man, do not incline God to favor any; but those who fear and,
of course, trust Him, will obtain His approbation and aid.

[Psalms 147:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 147:13</span></span>

strengthened . . . gates--or, means of defense against invaders,

[Psalms 147:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 147:14</span></span>

maketh . . . borders--or, territories ([Gen
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#017.md); [Isa
54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012).md).

filleth thee, &c.--(Compare Margin).

[Psalms 147:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 147:15</span></span>

God's Word, as a swift messenger, executes His purpose, for with Him to
command is to perform ([Gen 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md); [Psa
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009).md), and He brings about the wonders
of providence as easily as men cast crumbs.

[Psalms 147:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 147:17</span></span>

morsels--used as to food ([Gen 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005).md),
perhaps here denotes hail.

[Psalms 147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 147:19</span></span>

This mighty ruler and benefactor of heaven and earth is such especially
to His chosen people, to whom alone ([Deu
4:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#032).md) He has made known His will,
while others have been left in darkness. Therefore unite in the great
hallelujah.
