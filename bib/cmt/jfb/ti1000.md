GENUINENESS.--The ancient Church never doubted of their being canonical
and written by Paul. They are in the Peschito Syriac version of the
second century. MURATORI'S Fragment on the Canon of Scripture, at the
close of the second century, acknowledges them as such. IRENÃ†US
\[Against Heresies, 1; 3.3.3; 4.16.3; 2.14.8; 3.11.1; 1.16.3\], quotes
[Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004), [Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009); [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); [Ti2
4:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009); [Tit
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010). CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 2, p. 457; 3, pp. 534, 536; 1, p. 350\], quotes [Ti1
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001), [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); Second Timothy, as to
deaconesses; [Tit 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012). TERTULLIAN
\[The Prescription against Heretics, 25; 6\], quotes [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); [Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014); [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013), &c.; [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002); [Tit
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010). EUSEBIUS includes the three
in the "universally acknowledged" Scriptures. Also THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH
\[To Autolychus, 3.14\], quotes [Ti1
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001), and CAIUS (in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 6.20\]) recognizes their authenticity. CLEMENT
OF ROME, in the end of the first century, in his first Epistle to the
Corinthians \[29\], quotes [Ti1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008).
IGNATIUS, in the beginning of the second century, in Epistle to
Polycarp, \[6\], alludes to [Ti2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004).
POLYCARP, in the beginning of the second century \[Epistle to the
Philippians, 4\], alludes to [Ti2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004);
and in the ninth chapter to [Ti2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010).
Hegisippus, in the end of the second century, in EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 3.32\], alludes to [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003), [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020). ATHENAGORAS, in the end of the
second century, alludes to [Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).
JUSTIN MARTYR, in the middle of the second century \[Dialogue with
Trypho, 47\], alludes to [Tit 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004). The
Gnostic MARCION alone rejected these Epistles.

The HERESIES OPPOSED in them form the transition stage from Judaism, in
its ascetic form, to Gnosticism, as subsequently developed. The
references to Judaism and legalism are clear ([Ti1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007); [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003); [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010), [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009)). Traces of beginning Gnosticism
are also unequivocal ([Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004)). The
Gnostic theory of a twofold principle from the beginning, evil as well
as good, appears in germ in [Ti1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003),
&c. In [Ti1 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020) the term Gnosis
("science") itself occurs. Another Gnostic error, namely, that "the
resurrection is past," is alluded to in [Ti2
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017). The Judaism herein opposed is
not that of the earlier Epistles, which upheld the law and tried to join
it with faith in Christ for justification. It first passed into that
phase of it which appears in the Epistle to the Colossians, whereby
will-worship and angel-worship were superadded to Judaizing opinions.
Then a further stage of the same evil appears in the Epistle to the
Philippians ([Phi 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002), [Phi
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018)), whereby immoral practice
accompanied false doctrine as to the resurrection (compare [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018), with [Co1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012), [Co1
15:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)). This descent from legality
to superstition, and from superstition to godlessness, appears more
matured in the references to it in these Pastoral Epistles. The false
teachers now know not the true use of the law ([Ti1
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007)), and further, have put away
good conscience as well as the faith ([Ti1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019); [Ti1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002)); speak lies in hypocrisy, are
corrupt in mind, and regard godliness as a means of earthly gain ([Ti1
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#005) [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011)); overthrow the faith by heresies
eating as a canker, saying the resurrection is past ([Ti2
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017)), leading captive silly women,
ever learning yet never knowing the truth, reprobate as Jannes and
Jambres ([Ti2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006), [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008)), defiled, unbelieving, professing
to know God, but in works denying Him, abominable, disobedient,
reprobate ([Tit 1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)). This
description accords with that in the Catholic Epistles of St. John and
St. Peter, and, in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This fact proves the
later date of these Pastoral Epistles as compared with Paul's earlier
Epistles. The Judaism reprobated herein is not that of an earlier date,
so scrupulous as to the law; it was now tending to immortality of
practice. On the other hand, the Gnosticism opposed in these Epistles is
not the anti-Judaic Gnosticism of a later date, which arose as a
consequence of the overthrow of Judaism by the destruction of Jerusalem
and the temple, but it was the intermediate phase between Judaism and
Gnosticism, in which the Oriental and Greek elements of the latter were
in a kind of amalgam with Judaism, just prior to the overthrow of
Jerusalem.

The DIRECTIONS AS TO CHURCH GOVERNORS and ministers, "bishop-elders, and
deacons," are such as were natural for the apostle, in prospect of his
own approaching removal, to give to Timothy, the president of the Church
at Ephesus, and to Titus, holding the same office in Crete, for securing
the due administration of the Church when he should be no more, and at a
time when heresies were rapidly springing up. Compare his similar
anxiety in his address to the Ephesian elders ([Act
20:21-30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021)). The Presbyterate (elders;
priest is a contraction from presbyter) and Diaconate had existed from
the earliest times in the Church ([Act
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003); [Act
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030); [Act
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023)). Timothy and Titus, as
superintendents or overseers (so bishop subsequently meant), were to
exercise the same power in ordaining elders at Ephesus which the apostle
had exercised in his general supervision of all the Gentile churches.

The PECULIARITIES OF MODES OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION, are such as the
difference of subject and circumstances of those addressed and those
spoken of in these Epistles, as compared with the other Epistles, would
lead us to expect. Some of these peculiar phrases occur also in
Galatians, in which, as in the Pastoral Epistles, he, with his
characteristic fervor, attacks the false teachers. Compare [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014), "gave Himself for us," with [Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004); [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017); [Ti2
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#018), "for ever and ever," with [Gal
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#005) : "before God," [Ti1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021); [Ti1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013); [Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001), with [Gal
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#020) : "a pillar," [Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015), with [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009) : "mediator," [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005), with [Gal
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020) : "in due season," [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006); [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003) with [Gal
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009).

TIME AND PLACE OF WRITING.--The First Epistle to Timothy was written not
long after Paul had left Ephesus for Macedon ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)). Now, as Timothy was in Macedon
with Paul ([Co2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)) on the occasion
of Paul's having passed from Ephesus into that country, as recorded,
[Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022); [Act
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001), whereas the First Epistle to
Timothy contemplates a longer stay of Timothy in Ephesus, MOSHEIM
supposes that Paul was nine months of the "three years" stay mostly at
Ephesus ([Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)) in Macedonia, and
elsewhere (perhaps Crete), (the mention of only "three months" and "two
years," [Act 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008), [Act
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010), favors this, the remaining nine
months being spent elsewhere); and that during these nine months
Timothy, in Paul's absence, superintended the Church of Ephesus. It is
not likely that Ephesus and the neighboring churches should have been
left long without church officers and church organization, rules
respecting which are giver in this Epistle. Moreover, Timothy was still
"a youth" ([Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)), which he could
hardly be called after Paul's first imprisonment, when he must have been
at least thirty-four years of age. Lastly, in [Act
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025), Paul asserts his knowledge that
the Ephesians should not all see his face again, so that [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003) will thus refer to his sojourn at
Ephesus, recorded in [Act 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010),
whence he passed into Macedonia. But the difficulty is to account for
the false teachers having sprung up almost immediately (according to
this theory) after the foundation of the Church. However, his visit
recorded in Acts 19:1-41 was not his first visit. The beginning of the
Church at Ephesus was probably made at his visit a year before ([Act
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019)). Apollos, Aquila and
Priscilla, carried on the work ([Act
18:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)). Thus, as to the sudden
growth of false teachers, there was time enough for their springing up,
especially considering that the first converts at Ephesus were under
Apollos' imperfect Christian teachings at first, imbued as he was likely
to be with the tenets of PHILO of Alexandria, Apollos' native town,
combined with John the Baptist's Old Testament teachings ([Act
18:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)). Besides Ephesus, from its
position in Asia, its notorious voluptuousness and sorcery ([Act
19:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018)), and its lewd worship of
Diana (answering to the PhÅ“nician Ashtoreth), was likely from the first
to tinge Christianity in some of its converts with Oriental speculations
and Asiatic licentiousness of practices. Thus the phenomenon of the
phase of error presented in this Epistle, being intermediate between
Judaism and later Gnosticism (see above), would be such as might occur
at an early period in the Ephesian Church, as well as later, when we
know it had open "apostles" of error ([Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002), [Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006)), and Nicolaitans infamous in
practice. As to the close connection between this First Epistle and the
Second Epistle (which must have been written at the close of Paul's
life), on which ALFORD relies for his theory of making the First Epistle
also written at the close of Paul's life, the similarity of
circumstances, the person addressed being one and the same, and either
in Ephesus at the time, or at least connected with Ephesus as its church
overseer, and having heretics to contend with of the same stamp as in
the First Epistle, would account for the connection. There is not so
great identity of tone as to compel us to adopt the theory that some
years could not have elapsed between the two Epistles.

However, all these arguments against the later date may be answered.
This First Epistle may refer not to the first organization of the Church
under its bishops, or elders and deacons, but to the moral
qualifications laid down at a later period for those officers when
scandals rendered such directions needful. Indeed, the object for which
he left Timothy at Ephesus he states ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)) to be, not to organize the Church
for the first time, but to restrain the false teachers. The directions
as to the choice of fit elders and deacons refer to the filling up of
vacancies, not to their first appointment. The fact of there existing an
institution for Church widows implies an established organization. As to
Timothy's "youth," it may be spoken of comparatively young compared with
Paul, now "the aged" ([Plm 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009)), and
with some of the Ephesian elders, senior to Timothy their overseer. As
to [Act 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025), we know not but that
"all" of the elders of Ephesus called to Miletus "never saw Paul's face"
afterwards, as he "knew" (doubtless by inspiration) would be the case,
which obviates the need of ALFORD'S lax view, that Paul was wrong in
this his positive inspired anticipation (for such it was, not a mere
boding surmise as to the future). Thus he probably visited Ephesus again
([Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003); [Ti2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018); [Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020), he would hardly have been at
Miletum, so near Ephesus, without visiting Ephesus) after his first
imprisonment in Rome, though all the Ephesian elders whom he had
addressed formerly at Miletus did not again see him. The general
similarity of subject and style, and of the state of the Church between
the two Epistles, favors the view that they were near one another in
date. Also, against the theory of the early date is the difficulty of
defining, when, during Paul's two or three years' stay at Ephesus, we
can insert an absence of Paul from Ephesus long enough for the
requirements of the case, which imply a lengthened stay and
superintendence of Timothy at Ephesus (see, however, [Ti1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014), on the other side) after having
been "left" by Paul there. Timothy did not stay there when Paul left
Ephesus ([Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022); [Act
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)). In [Ti1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014), Paul says, "I write, hoping to
come unto thee shortly," but on the earlier occasion of his passing from
Ephesus to Macedon he had no such expectation, but had planned to spend
the summer in Macedon, and the winter in Corinth, ([Co1
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)). The expression "Till I come"
([Ti1 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013)), implies that Timothy was
not to leave his post till Paul should arrive; this and the former
objection, however, do not hold good against MOSHEIM'S theory. Moreover,
Paul in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders prophetically
anticipates the rise of false teachers hereafter of their own selves;
therefore this First Epistle, which speaks of their actual presence at
Ephesus, would naturally seem to be not prior, but subsequent, to the
address, that is, will belong to the later date assigned. In the Epistle
to the Ephesians no notice is taken of the Judaeo-Gnostic errors, which
would have been noticed had they been really in existence; however, they
are alluded to in the contemporaneous sister Epistle to Colossians (Col.
2:1-23).

Whatever doubt must always remain as to the date of the First Epistle,
there can be hardly any as to that of the Second Epistle. In [Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013), Paul directs Timothy to bring
the books and cloak which the apostle had left at Troas. Assuming that
the visit to Troas referred to is the one mentioned in [Act
20:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005), it will follow that the cloak
and parchments lay for about seven years at Troas, that being the time
that elapsed between the visit and Paul's first imprisonment at Rome: a
very unlikely supposition, that he should have left either unused for so
long. Again, when, during his first Roman imprisonment, he wrote to the
Colossians ([Col 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)) and Philemon
([Plm 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024)), Demas was with him; but
when he was writing [Ti2 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010), Demas
had forsaken him from love of this world, and gone to Thessalonica.
Again, when he wrote to the Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and
Philemon, he had good hopes of a speedy liberation; but here in [Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006), he anticipates immediate death,
having been at least once already tried ([Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)). Again, he is in this Epistle
represented as in closer confinement than he was when writing those
former Epistles in his first imprisonment (even in the Philippians,
which represent him in greater uncertainty as to his life, he cherished
the hope of soon being delivered, [Phi
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#024); [Ti2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016); [Ti2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009); [Ti2
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006), [Ti2
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)). Again ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)), he speaks of having left
Trophimus sick at Miletum. This could not have been on the occasion,
[Act 20:15](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#015). For Trophimus was with
Paul at Jerusalem shortly afterwards ([Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029)). Besides, he would thus be made
to speak of an event six or seven years after its occurrence, as a
recent event: moreover, Timothy was, on that occasion of the apostle
being at Miletum, with Paul, and therefore needed not to be informed of
Trophimus' sickness there ([Act
20:4-17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)). Also, the statement ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)), "Erastus abode at Corinth,"
implies that Paul had shortly before been at Corinth, and left Erastus
there; but Paul had not been at Corinth for several years before his
first imprisonment, and in the interval Timothy had been with him, so
that he did not need to write subsequently about that visit. He must
therefore have been liberated after his first imprisonment (indeed, [Heb
13:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023), expressly proves that the
writer was in Italy and at liberty), and resumed his apostolic
journeyings, and been imprisoned at Rome again, whence shortly before
his death he wrote Second Timothy.

EUSEBIUS \[Chronicles, Anno 2083\] (beginning October, A.D. 67), says,
"Nero, to his other crimes, added the persecution of Christians: under
him the apostles Peter and Paul consummated their martyrdom at Rome." So
JEROME \[On Illustrious Men\], "In the fourteenth year of Nero, Paul was
beheaded at Rome for Christ's sake, on the same day as Peter, and was
buried on the Ostian Road, in the thirty-seventh year after the death of
our Lord." ALFORD reasonably conjectures the Pastoral Epistles were
written near this date. The interval was possibly filled up (so CLEMENT
OF ROME states that Paul preached as far as "to the extremity of the
west") by a journey to Spain ([Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024), [Rom
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028)), according to his own original
intention. MURATORI'S Fragment on the Canon of Scripture (about A.D.
170) also alleges Paul's journey into Spain. So EUSEBIUS, CHRYSOSTOM,
and JEROME. Be that as it may, he seems shortly before his second
imprisonment to have visited Ephesus, where a new body of elders
governed the Church ([Act 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025)), say
in the latter end of A.D. 66, or beginning of 67. Supposing him thirty
at his conversion, he would now be upwards of sixty, and older in
constitution than in years, through continual hardship. Even four years
before he called himself "Paul the aged" ([Plm
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009)).

From Ephesus he went into Macedonia ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)). He may have written the First
Epistle to Timothy from that country. But his use of "went," not "came,"
in [Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003), "When I went into
Macedonia," implies he was not there when writing. Wherever he was, he
writes uncertain how long he may be detained from coming to Timothy
([Ti1 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014)). BIRKS shows the
probability that he wrote from Corinth, between which city and Ephesus
the communication was rapid and easy. His course, as on both former
occasions, was from Macedon to Corinth. He finds a coincidence between
[Ti1 2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011), and [Co1
14:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034), as to women being silent in
Church; and [Ti1 5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017), and [Co1
9:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008), as to the maintenance of
ministers, on the same principle as the Mosaic law, that the ox should
not be muzzled that treadeth out the corn; and [Ti1
5:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019), and [Co2
13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001), as to charges against elders.
It would be natural for the apostle in the very place where these
directions had been enforced, to reproduce them in his letter.

The date of the Epistle to Titus must depend on that assigned to First
Timothy, with which it is connected in subject, phraseology, and tone.
There is no difficulty in the Epistle to Titus, viewed by itself, in
assigning it to the earlier date, namely, before Paul's first
imprisonment. In [Act 18:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018), Paul,
in journeying from Corinth to Palestine, for some cause or other landed
at Ephesus. Now we find ([Tit 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013))
that Apollos in going from Ephesus to Corinth was to touch at Crete
(which seems to coincide with Apollos' journey from Ephesus to Corinth,
recorded in [Act 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024), [Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027); [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)); therefore it is not unlikely
that Paul may have taken Crete similarly on his way between Corinth and
Ephesus; or, perhaps been driven out of his course to it in one of his
three shipwrecks spoken of in [Co2
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025); this will account for his
taking Ephesus on his way from Corinth to Palestine, though out of his
regular course. At Ephesus Paul may have written the Epistle to Titus
\[HUG\]; there he probably met Apollos and gave the Epistle to Titus to
his charge, before his departure for Corinth by way of Crete, and before
the apostle's departure for Jerusalem ([Act
18:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019), [Act
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)). Moreover, on Paul's way back
from Jerusalem and Antioch, he travelled some time in Upper Asia ([Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)); and it was then, probably, that
his intention to "winter at Nicopolis" was realized, there being a town
of that name between Antioch and Tarsus, lying on Paul's route to
Galatia ([Tit 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012)). Thus, First
Timothy will, in this theory, be placed two and a half years later ([Act
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001); compare [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)).

ALFORD'S argument for classing the Epistle to Titus with First Timothy,
as written after Paul's first Roman imprisonment, stands or falls with
his argument for assigning First Timothy to that date. Indeed, HUG'S
unobjectionable argument for the earlier date of the Epistle to Titus,
favors the early date assigned to First Timothy, which is so much akin
to it, if other arguments be not thought to counterbalance this. The
Church of Crete had been just founded ([Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)), and yet the same heresies are
censured in it as in Ephesus, which shows that no argument, such as
ALFORD alleges against the earlier date of First Timothy, can be drawn
from them ([Tit 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010), [Tit
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009), [Tit
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#011)). But vice versa, if, as seems
likely from the arguments adduced, the First Epistle to Timothy be
assigned to the later date, the Epistle to Titus must, from similarity
of style, belong to the same period. ALFORD traces Paul's last journey
before his second imprisonment thus: To Crete ([Tit
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)), Miletus ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)), Colosse (fulfilling his
intention, [Plm 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022)), Ephesus ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003); [Ti2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018)), from which neighborhood he
wrote the Epistle to Titus; Troas, Macedonia, Corinth ([Ti2
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#020)), Nicopolis ([Tit
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012)) in Epirus, where he had intended
to winter; a place in which, as being a Roman colony, he would be free
from tumultuary violence, and yet would be more open to a direct attack
from foes in the metropolis, Rome. Being known in Rome as the leader of
the Christians, he was probably \[ALFORD\] arrested as implicated in
causing the fire in A.D. 64, attributed by Nero to the Christians, and
was sent to Rome by the Duumvirs of Nicopolis. There he was imprisoned
as a common malefactor ([Ti2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009)); his
Asiatic friends deserted him, except Onesiphorus ([Ti2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016)). Demas, Crescens, and Titus,
left him. Tychicus he had sent to Ephesus. Luke alone remained with him
([Ti2 4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)). Under the
circumstances he writes the Second Epistle to Timothy, most likely while
Timothy was at Ephesus ([Ti2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017);
compare [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020); [Ti2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013)), begging him to come to him
before winter ([Ti2 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021)), and
anticipating his own execution soon ([Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006)). Tychicus was perhaps the bearer
of the Second Epistle ([Ti2 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012)). His
defense was not made before the emperor, for the latter was then in
Greece ([Ti2 4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)). Tradition
represents that he died by the sword, which accords with the fact that
his Roman citizenship would exempt him from torture; probably late in
A.D. 67 or A.D. 68, the last year of Nero.

Timothy is first mentioned, [Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001),
as dwelling in Lystra (not Derbe, compare [Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)). His mother was a Jewess named
Eunice ([Ti2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005)); his father, "a
Greek" (that is, a Gentile). As Timothy is mentioned as "a disciple" in
[Act 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001), he must have been converted
before, and this by Paul ([Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002)),
probably at his former visit to Lystra ([Act
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)); at the same time, probably,
that his Scripture-loving mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois, were
converted to Christ from Judaism ([Ti2
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)). Not only the good report
given as to him by the brethren of Lystra, but also his origin, partly
Jewish, partly Gentile, adapted him specially for being Paul's assistant
in missionary work, laboring as the apostle did in each place, firstly
among the Jews, and then among the Gentiles. In order to obviate Jewish
prejudices, he first circumcised him. He seems to have accompanied Paul
in his tour through Macedonia; but when the apostle went forward to
Athens, Timothy and Silas remained in Berea. Having been sent back by
Paul to visit the Thessalonian Church ([Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)), he brought his report of it to
the apostle at Corinth ([Th1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)).
Hence we find his name joined with Paul's in the addresses of both the
Epistles to Thessalonians, which were written at Corinth. We again find
him "ministering to" Paul during the lengthened stay at Ephesus ([Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022)). Thence he was sent before Paul
into Macedonia and to Corinth ([Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017); [Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)). He was with Paul when he wrote
the Second Epistle to Corinthians ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001)); and the following winter in
Corinth, when Paul sent from thence his Epistle to the Romans ([Rom
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021)). On Paul's return to Asia
through Macedonia, he went forward and waited for the apostle at Troas
([Act 20:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003)). Next we find him with
Paul during his imprisonment at Rome, when the apostle wrote the
Epistles to Colossians ([Col 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001)),
Philemon ([Plm 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001)), and Philippians
([Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001)). He was imprisoned and set
at liberty about the same time as the writer of the Hebrews ([Heb
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023)). In the Pastoral Epistles, we
find him mentioned as left by the apostle at Ephesus to superintend the
Church there ([Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)). The last
notice of him is in the request which Paul makes to him ([Ti2
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#021)) to "come before winter," that is
about A.D. 67 \[ALFORD\]. EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History, 3.42\],
reports that he was first bishop of Ephesus; and \[NICOPHORUS,
Ecclesiastical History, 3.11\], represents that he died by martyrdom. If
then, St. John, as tradition represents, resided and died in that city,
it must have been at a later period. Paul himself ordained or
consecrated him with laying on of his own hands, and those of the
presbytery, in accordance with prophetic intimations given respecting
him by those possessing the prophetic gift ([Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014) [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006)). His self-denying character is
shown by his leaving home at once to accompany the apostle, and
submitting to circumcision for the Gospel's sake; and also by his
abstemiousness (noted in [Ti1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023))
notwithstanding his bodily infirmities, which would have warranted a
more generous diet. Timidity and a want of self-confidence and boldness
in dealing with the difficulties of his position, seem to have been a
defect in his otherwise beautiful character as a Christian minister
([Co1 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012); [Ti2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007)).

The DESIGN of the First Epistle was: (1) to direct Timothy to charge the
false teachers against continuing to teach other doctrine than that of
the Gospel (1Ti. 1:3-20; compare [Rev
2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001)); (2) to give him instructions
as to the orderly conducting of worship, the qualifications of bishops
and deacons, and the selection of widows who should, in return for
Church charity, do appointed service (1Ti. 2:1-6:2); (3) to warn against
covetousness, a sin prevalent at Ephesus, and to urge to good works
(1Ti. 6:3-19).
