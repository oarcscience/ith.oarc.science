### [2 Kings (2 Samuel) Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa2 6:1</span></span>

DAVID FETCHES THE ARK FROM KIRJATH-JEARIM ON A NEW CART. ([Sa2
6:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001))

Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel--(See [Sa2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#001)). The object of this second
assembly was to commence a national movement for establishing the ark in
Jerusalem, after it had continued nearly fifty years in the house of
Abinadab (see on [Ch1 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa2 6:2</span></span>

from Baale of Judah--A very large force of picked men were selected for
this important work lest the undertaking might be opposed or obstructed
by the Philistines. Besides, a great concourse of people accompanied
them out of veneration for the sacred article. The journey to Baale,
which is related ([Ch1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#006)), is here
presupposed, and the historian describes the course of the procession
from that place to the capital.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa2 6:3</span></span>

they set the ark of God upon a new cart--or a covered wagon (see on [Sa1
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#007)). This was a hasty and
inconsiderate procedure, in violation of an express statute (see on [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015) and see [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009); [Num
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa2 6:6</span></span>

UZZAH SMITTEN. ([Sa2 6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#006))

they came to Nachon's threshing-floor--or Chidon's ([Ch1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009)). The Chaldee version renders the
words, "came to the place prepared for the reception of the ark," that
is, near the city of David ([Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013)).

the oxen shook it--or, "stumbled" ([Ch1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#009)). Fearing that the ark was in
danger of being overturned, Uzzah, under the impulse of momentary
feeling, laid hold of it to keep it steady. Whether it fell and crushed
him, or some sudden disease attacked him, he fell dead upon the spot.
This melancholy occurrence not only threw a cloud over the joyous scene,
but entirely stopped the procession; for the ark was left where it then
was, in the near neighborhood of the capital. It is of importance to
observe the proportionate severity of the punishments attending the
profanation of the ark. The Philistines suffered by diseases, from which
they were relieved by their oblations, because the law had not been
given to them \[[Sa1 5:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#008)\]; the
Bethshemites also suffered, but not fatally \[[Sa1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#019)\]; their error proceeded from
ignorance or inadvertency. But Uzzah, who was a Levite, and well
instructed, suffered death for his breach of the law. The severity of
Uzzah's fate may seem to us too great for the nature and degree of the
offense. But it does not become us to sit in judgment on the
dispensations of God; and, besides, it is apparent that the divine
purpose was to inspire awe of His majesty, a submission to His law, and
a profound veneration for the symbols and ordinances of His worship.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa2 6:9</span></span>

David was afraid of the Lord that day, &c.--His feelings on this
alarming judgment were greatly excited on various accounts, dreading
that the displeasure of God had been provoked by the removal of the ark,
that the punishment would be extended to himself and people, and that
they might fall into some error or neglect during the further conveyance
of the ark. He resolved, therefore, to wait for more light and direction
as to the path of duty. An earlier consultation by Urim would have led
him right at the first, whereas in this perplexity and distress, he was
reaping the fruits of inconsideration and neglect.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa2 6:11</span></span>

Obed-edom the Gittite--a Levite ([Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018), [Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021), [Ch1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#024); [Ch1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#005); [Ch1
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#004)). He is called a Gittite, either
from his residence at Gath, or more probably from Gath-rimmon, one of
the Levitical cities ([Jos 21:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#024)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa2 6:12</span></span>

DAVID AFTERWARDS BRINGS THE ARK TO ZION. ([Sa2
6:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012))

it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of
Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of
God--The lapse of three months not only restored the agitated mind of
the monarch to a tranquil and settled tone, but led him to a discovery
of his former error. Having learned that the ark was kept in its
temporary resting-place not only without inconvenience or danger, but
with great advantage, he resolved forthwith to remove it to the capital,
with the observance of all due form and solemnity ([Ch1
15:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001)). It was transported now on
the shoulders of the priests, who had been carefully prepared for the
work, and the procession was distinguished by extraordinary solemnities
and demonstrations of joy.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa2 6:13</span></span>

when they that bare the ark . . . had gone six paces--Some think that
four altars were hastily raised for the offering of sacrifices at the
distance of every six paces (but see on [Ch1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026)).

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa2 6:14</span></span>

David danced before the Lord--The Hebrews, like other ancient people,
had their sacred dances, which were performed on their solemn
anniversaries and other great occasions of commemorating some special
token of the divine goodness and favor.

with all his might--intimating violent efforts of leaping, and divested
of his royal mantle (in a state of undress), conduct apparently
unsuitable to the gravity of age or the dignity of a king. But it was
unquestionably done as an act of religious homage, his attitudes and
dress being symbolic, as they have always been in Oriental countries, of
penitence, joy, thankfulness, and devotion. \[See on [Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027).\]

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa2 6:17</span></span>

they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in his place, in the
midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it--The old
tabernacle remained at Gibeon ([Ch1
16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039); [Ch1
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#029); [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003)). Probably it was not removed
because it was too large for the temporary place the king had
appropriated, and because he contemplated the building of a temple.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa2 6:18</span></span>

he blessed the people--in the double character of prophet and king (see
[Kg1 8:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#055)). \[See on [Ch1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#002).\]

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa2 6:19</span></span>

cake of bread--unleavened and slender.

a good piece of flesh--roast beef.

[2 Kings (2 Samuel) 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa2 6:20</span></span>

MICHAL'S BARRENNESS. ([Sa2 6:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#020))

Michal . . . came out to meet David, &c.--Proud of her royal extraction,
she upbraided her husband for lowering the dignity of the crown and
acting more like a buffoon than a king. But her taunting sarcasm was
repelled in a manner that could not be agreeable to her feelings while
it indicated the warm piety and gratitude of David.
