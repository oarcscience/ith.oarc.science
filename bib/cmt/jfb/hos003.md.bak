### [Hosea Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 3:1</span></span>

ISRAEL'S CONDITION IN THEIR PRESENT DISPERSION, SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR
RETURN FROM BABYLON, SYMBOLIZED. ([Hos
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001).md)

The prophet is to take back his wife, though unfaithful, as foretold in
[Hos 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md). He purchases her from her
paramour, stipulating she should wait for a long period before she
should be restored to her conjugal rights. So Israel is to live for a
long period without her ancient rites of religion, and yet be free from
idolatry; then at last she shall acknowledge Messiah, and know Jehovah's
goodness restored to her.

Go yet--"Go again," referring to [Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md) \[HENDERSON\].

a woman--purposely indefinite, for thy wife, to express the separation
in which Hosea had lived from Gomer for her unfaithfulness.

beloved of her friend--used for "her husband," on account of the
estrangement between them. She was still beloved of her husband, though
an adulteress; just as God still loved Israel, though idolatrous ([Jer
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020).md). Hosea is told, not as in [Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md), "take a wife," but "love" her,
that is, renew thy conjugal kindness to her.

who look to other gods--that is, have done so heretofore, but henceforth
(from the return from Babylon) shall do so no more ([Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md).

flagons of wine--rather, pressed cakes of dried grapes, such as were
offered to idols ([Jer 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018).md)
\[MAURER\].

[Hosea 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 3:2</span></span>

I bought her--The price paid is too small to be a probable dowry
wherewith to buy a wife from her parents; but it is just half the price
of a female slave, in money, the rest of the price being made up in
grain ([Exo 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032).md). Hosea pays this
for the redemption of his wife, who has become the slave of her
paramour. The price being half grain was because the latter was the
allowance of food for the slave, and of the coarsest kind, not wheat,
but barley. Israel, as committing sin, was the slave of sin ([Joh
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034.md); [Rom
6:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#016.md); [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019).md). The low price expresses
Israel's worthlessness.

[Hosea 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 3:3</span></span>

abide for me--separate from intercourse with any other man, and
remaining for me who have redeemed thee (compare [Deu
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#013).md).

so will I also be for thee--remain for thee, not taking any other
consort. As Israel should long remain without serving other gods, yet
separate from Jehovah; so Jehovah on His part, in this long period of
estrangement, would form no marriage covenant with any other people
(compare [Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md). He would not
immediately receive her to marriage privileges, but would test her
repentance and discipline her by the long probation; still the marriage
covenant would hold good, she was to be kept separated for but a time,
not divorced ([Isa 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001).md); in God's
good time she shall be restored.

[Hosea 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 3:4</span></span>

The long period here foretold was to be one in which Israel should have
no civil polity, king, or prince, no sacrifice to Jehovah, and yet no
idol, or false god, no ephod, or teraphim. Exactly describing their
state for the last nineteen centuries, separate from idols, yet without
any legal sacrifice to Jehovah, whom they profess to worship, and
without being acknowledged by Him as His Church. So KIMCHI, a Jew,
explains it. The ephod was worn by the high priest above the tunic and
robe. It consisted of two finely wrought pieces which hung down, the one
in front over the breast, the other on the back, to the middle of the
thigh; joined on the shoulders by golden clasps set in onyx stones with
the names of the twelve tribes, and fastened round the waist by a girdle
([Exo 28:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#006).md). The common ephod worn
by the lower priests, Levites, and any person performing sacred rites,
was of linen ([Sa2 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#014.md); [Ch1
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027).md). In the breast were the Urim
and Thummim by which God gave responses to the Hebrews. The latter was
one of the five things which the second temple lacked, and which the
first had. It, as representing the divinely constituted priesthood, is
opposed to the idolatrous "teraphim," as "sacrifice" (to Jehovah) is to
"an (idolatrous) image." "Abide" answers to "thou shalt abide for me"
([Hos 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003).md). Abide in solitary
isolation, as a separated wife. The teraphim were tutelary household
gods, in the shape of human busts, cut off at the waist (as the root of
the Hebrew word implies) \[MAURER\], ([Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md), [Gen
31:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030).md). They were supposed to give
responses to consulters ([Kg2 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#024.md);
[Eze 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021.md), Margin; [Zac
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002).md). Saul's daughter, Michal,
putting one in a bed, as if it were David, proves the shape to have been
that of a man.

[Hosea 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 3:5</span></span>

Afterward--after the long period ("many days," [Hos
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md) has elapsed.

return--from their idols to "their God," from whom they had wandered.

David their king--Israel had forsaken the worship of Jehovah at the same
time that they forsook their allegiance to David's line. Their
repentance towards God is therefore to be accompanied by their return to
the latter. So Judah and Israel shall be one, and under "one head," as
is also foretold ([Hos 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011).md). That
representative and antitype of David is Messiah. "David" means "the
beloved." Compare as to Messiah, [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md); [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md). Messiah is called David ([Isa
55:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024).md).

fear the Lord and his goodness--that is, tremblingly flee to the Lord,
to escape from the wrath to come; and to His goodness," as manifested in
Messiah, which attracts them to Him ([Jer
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#012).md). The "fear" is not that which
"hath torment" ([Jo1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018).md), but
reverence inspired by His goodness realized in the soul ([Psa
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004).md).

the latter days--those of Messiah \[KIMCHI\].
