Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Luke Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

[Luke 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 17:1</span></span>

OFFENSES--FAITH--HUMILITY. ([Luk
17:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#001).md)

(See [Mat 18:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006).md).

[Luke 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 17:3</span></span>

(See on [Mat 18:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md); [Mat
18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021).md).

[Luke 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 17:4</span></span>

seven times--not a lower measure of the forgiving spirit than the
"seventy times seven" enjoined on Peter, which was occasioned by his
asking if he was to stop at seven times. "No," is the virtual answer,
"though it come to seventy times that number, if only he ask forgiveness
in sincerity."

[Luke 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 17:5</span></span>

Lord--(See on [Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001).md).

increase our faith--moved by the difficulty of avoiding and forgiving
"offenses." This is the only instance in which a spiritual operation
upon their souls was solicited of Christ by the Twelve; but a kindred
and higher prayer had been offered before, by one with far fewer
opportunities. (See on [Mar 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#024)..md)

[Luke 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 17:6</span></span>

sycamine--mulberry. (See on [Mar
11:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#022)..md)

[Luke 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 17:7</span></span>

say unto him by and by--The "by and by" (or rather "directly") should be
joined not to the saying but the going: "Go directly." The connection
here is: "But when your faith has been so increased as both to avoid and
forgive offenses, and do things impossible to all but faith, be not
puffed up as though you had laid the Lord under any obligations to you."

[Luke 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 17:9</span></span>

I trow not--or, as we say, when much more is meant, "I should think
not."

[Luke 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 17:10</span></span>

unprofitable--a word which, though usually denoting the opposite of
profit, is here used simply in its negative sense. "We have not, as his
servants, profited or benefited God at all." (Compare [Job
22:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#002.md); [Rom
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035)..md)

[Luke 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 17:11</span></span>

TEN LEPERS CLEANSED. ([Luk 17:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#011).md)

through the midst of Samaria and Galilee--probably on the confines of
both.

[Luke 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 17:12</span></span>

stood afar off--(Compare [Lev
13:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045).md).

[Luke 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 17:13</span></span>

they lifted up--their common misery drawing these poor outcasts together
([Kg2 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2007.htm#003).md), nay, making them forget
the fierce national antipathy of Jew and Samaritan \[TRENCH\].

Jesus, &c.--(Compare [Mat 20:30-33](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#030).md).
How quick a teacher is felt misery, even though as here the teaching may
be soon forgotten!

[Luke 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 17:14</span></span>

show yourselves--as cleansed persons. (See on [Mat
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004)..md) Thus too would the Samaritan be
taught that "salvation is of the Jews" ([Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022).md).

as they went, were cleansed--In how many different ways were our Lord's
cures wrought, and this different from all the rest.

[Luke 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 17:17</span></span>

Were there not ten cleansed--rather, were not the ten cleansed? that is,
the whole of them--an example (by the way) of Christ's omniscience
\[BENGEL\].

[Luke 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 17:18</span></span>

this stranger--"this alien" (literally, "of another race"). The language
is that of wonder and admiration, as is expressly said of another
exhibition of Gentile faith ([Mat
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#010).md).

[Luke 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 17:19</span></span>

Arise--for he had "fallen down on his face at His feet" ([Luk
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#016).md) and there lain prostrate.

faith made thee whole--not as the others, merely in body, but in that
higher spiritual sense with which His constant language has so
familiarized us.

[Luke 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">luk 17:20</span></span>

COMING OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND OF THE SON OF MAN. (Luke 17:20-37)

when, &c.--To meet the erroneous views not only of the Pharisees, but of
the disciples themselves, our Lord addresses both, announcing the coming
of the kingdom under different aspects.

It cometh not with observation--with watching or lying in wait, as for
something outwardly imposing and at once revealing itself.

[Luke 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 17:21</span></span>

Lo here! . . . lo there!--shut up within this or that sharply defined
and visible geographical or ecclesiastical limit.

within you--is of an internal and spiritual character (as contrasted
with their outside views of it). But it has its external side too.

[Luke 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 17:22</span></span>

The days--rather "Days."

will come--as in [Luk 19:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md), when,
amidst calamities, &c., you will anxiously look for a deliverer, and
deceivers will put themselves forward in this character.

one of the days of the Son of man--Himself again among them but for one
day; as we say when all seems to be going wrong and the one person who
could keep them right is removed \[NEANDER in STIER, &c.\]. "This is
said to guard against the mistake of supposing that His visible presence
would accompany the manifestation and establishment of His kingdom"
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Luke 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 17:23</span></span>

they shall say, See here . . . go not, &c.--a warning to all so-called
expositors of prophecy and their followers, who cry, Lo there and see
here, every time that war breaks out or revolutions occur.

[Luke 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 17:24</span></span>

as lightning . . . so . . . the Son of man--that is it will be as
manifest. The Lord speaks here of His coming and manifestation in a
prophetically indefinite manner, and in these preparatory words blends
into one the distinctive epochs \[STIER\]. When the whole polity of the
Jews, civil and ecclesiastical alike, was broken up at once, and its
continuance rendered impossible by the destruction of Jerusalem, it
became as manifest to all as the lightning of heaven that the kingdom of
God had ceased to exist in its old, and had entered on a new and
perfectly different form. So it may be again, ere its final and greatest
change at the personal coming of Christ, and of which the words in their
highest sense are alone true.

[Luke 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 17:25</span></span>

But first . . . suffer, &c.--This shows that the more immediate
reference of [Luk 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#023.md) is to an event
soon to follow the death of Christ. It was designed to withdraw the
attention of "His disciples" from the glare in which His foregoing words
had invested the approaching establishment of His kingdom.

[Luke 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 17:26</span></span>

eat . . . married . . . planted--all the ordinary occupations and
enjoyments of life. Though the antediluvian world and the cities of the
plain were awfully wicked, it is not their wickedness, but their
worldliness, their unbelief and indifference to the future, their
unpreparedness, that is here held up as a warning. Note.--These recorded
events of Old Testament history--denied or explained away nowadays by
not a few--are referred to here as facts.

[Luke 17:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 17:31</span></span>

to take it away . . . Remember, &c.--a warning against that lingering
reluctance to part with present treasures which induces some to remain
in a burning house, in hopes of saving this and that precious article
till consumed and buried in its ruins. The cases here supposed, though
different, are similar.

[Luke 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 17:32</span></span>

Lot's wife--her "look back," for that is all that is said of her, and
her recorded doom. Her heart was in Sodom still, and the "look" just
said, "And must I bid it adieu?"

[Luke 17:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 17:33</span></span>

Whosoever, &c.--(See on [Luk 9:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#023).md).

[Luke 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 17:34</span></span>

two in one bed--the prepared and unprepared mingled in closest
intercourse together in the ordinary walks and fellowships of life, when
the moment of severance arrives. Awful truth! realized before the
destruction of Jerusalem, when the Christians found themselves forced by
their Lord's directions ([Luk 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#021).md)
at once and for ever away from their old associates; but most of all
when the second coming of Christ shall burst upon a heedless world.

[Luke 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 17:37</span></span>

Where--shall this occur?

Wheresoever, &c.--"As birds of prey scent out the carrion, so wherever
is found a mass of incurable moral and spiritual corruption, there will
be seen alighting the ministers of divine judgment," a proverbial saying
terrifically verified at the destruction of Jerusalem, and many times
since, though its most tremendous illustration will be at the world's
final day.
