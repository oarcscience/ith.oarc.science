### [Acts Chapter 28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001.md)

[Acts 28:1](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 28:1</span></span>

THE WINTERING AT MALTA, AND NOTABLE OCCURRENCES THERE--PROSECUTION OF
THE VOYAGE TO ITALY AS FAR AS PUTEOLI, AND LAND JOURNEY THENCE TO
ROME--SUMMARY OF THE APOSTLE'S LABORS THERE FOR THE TWO FOLLOWING YEARS.
(Acts 28:1-31)

knew the island was called Melita--(See on [Act
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#039).md). The opinion that this island
was not Malta to the south of Sicily, but Meleda in the Gulf of
Venice--which till lately had respectable support among Competent
judges--is now all but exploded; examination of all the places on the
spot, and of all writings and principles bearing on the question, by
gentlemen of the highest qualification, particularly SMITH (see on [Act
27:41](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#041).md), having set the question, it
may now be affirmed, at rest.

[Acts 28:2](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 28:2</span></span>

the barbarous people--so called merely as speaking neither the Greek nor
the Latin language. They were originally PhÅ“nician colonists.

showed us no little--"no ordinary"

kindness, for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of
the present rain--"the rain that was on us"--not now first falling, but
then falling heavily.

and because of the cold--welcomed us all, drenched and shivering, to
these most seasonable marks of friendship. In this these "barbarians"
contrast favorably with many since bearing the Christian name. The
lifelike style of the narrative here and in the following verses gives
it a great charm.

[Acts 28:3](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 28:3</span></span>

when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks--"a quantity of dry sticks."
The vigorous activity of Paul's character is observable in this
comparatively trifling action \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat--Having
laid itself up among the sticks on the approach of the cold winter
season, it had suddenly recovered from its torpor by the heat.

and fastened--its fangs.

on his hand--Vipers dart at their enemies sometimes several feet at a
bound. They have now disappeared from Malta, owing to the change which
cultivation has produced.

[Acts 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 28:4</span></span>

No doubt this man is a murderer--His chains, which they would see, might
strengthen the impression.

whom . . . vengeance suffereth not to live--They believed in a Supreme,
Resistless, Avenging Eye and Hand, however vague their notions of where
it resided.

[Acts 28:5](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 28:5</span></span>

shook off the beast and felt no harm--See [Mar
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md).

[Acts 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 28:6</span></span>

they looked--"continued looking."

when he should have swollen or fallen down dead--familiar with the
effects of such bites.

and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said . . . he
was a god--from "a murderer" to "a god," as the Lycaonian greeting of
Paul and Silas from "sacrificing to them" to "stoning them" ([Act
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#013.md), [Act
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019).md). What has not the Gospel done
for the uncultivated portion of the human family, while its effects on
the educated and refined, though very different, are not less
marvellous! Verily it is God's chosen restorative for the human spirit,
in all the multitudinous forms and gradations of its lapsed state.

[Acts 28:7](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 28:7</span></span>

possessions of the chief man--"the first man."

of the island--He would hardly be so styled in the lifetime of his
father, if his distinction was that of the family. But it is now
ascertained that this was the proper official title of the Maltese
representative of the Roman prÃ&brvbr;tor to Sicily, to whose province
Malta belonged; two inscriptions having been discovered in the island,
one in Greek, the other in Latin, containing the same words which Luke
here employs.

who received us--of Paul's company, but doubtless including the
"courteous" Julius.

and lodged us three days courteously--till proper winter lodgings could
be obtained for them.

[Acts 28:8](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 28:8</span></span>

the father of Publius lay sick of a fever--"fevers." The word was often
thus used in the plural number, probably to express recurring attacks.

and of a bloody flux--"of dysentery." (The medical accuracy of our
historian's style has been observed here.)

to whom Paul entered in, and prayed--thereby precluding the supposition
that any charm resided in himself.

and laid his hands on him, and healed him--Thus, as our Lord rewarded
Peter for the use of his boat ([Luk
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003), &c..md), so Paul richly repays
Publius for his hospitality. Observe the fulfilment here of two things
predicted in [Mar 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018.md) --the "taking
up serpents," and "recovering of the sick by laying hands on them."

[Acts 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 28:9</span></span>

this . . . done, others . . . came and were healed--"kept coming to
\[us\] and getting healed," that is, during our stay, not all at once
\[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 28:10](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 28:10</span></span>

who also honoured us . . . and when we departed they laded us, &c.--This
was not taking hire for the miracles wrought among them ([Mat
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#008).md), but such grateful expressions
of feeling, particularly in providing what would minister to their
comfort during the voyage, as showed the value they set upon the
presence and labors of the apostle among them, and such as it would have
hurt their feelings to refuse. Whether any permanent effects of this
three months' stay of the greatest of the apostles were left at Malta,
we cannot certainly say. But though little dependence is to be placed
upon the tradition that Publius became bishop of Malta and afterwards of
Athens, we may well believe the accredited tradition that the beginnings
of the Christian Church at Malta sprang out of this memorable visit.

[Acts 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 28:11</span></span>

we departed in a ship of Alexandria--(See on [Act
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006).md).

which had wintered in the isle--no doubt driven m by the same storm
which had wrecked on its shores the apostle's vessel--an incidental mark
of consistency in the narrative.

whose sign--or "figurehead"; the figure, carved or painted on the bow,
which gave name to the vessel. Such figureheads were anciently as common
as now.

was Castor and Pollux--the tutelar gods of mariners, to whom all their
good fortune was ascribed. St. Anthony is substituted for them in the
modern superstitions of Mediterranean (Romanist) sailors. They carry his
image in their boats and ships. It is highly improbable that two ships
of Alexandra should have been casually found, of which the owners were
able and willing to receive on board such a number of passengers ([Act
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#006).md). We may then reasonably conceive
that it was compulsory on the owners to convey soldiers and state
travellers \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 28:12</span></span>

landing at Syracuse--the ancient and celebrated capital of Sicily, on
its eastern coast, about eighty miles, or a day's sail, north from
Malta.

we tarried there three days--probably from the state of the wind.
Doubtless Paul would wish to go ashore, to find out and break ground
among the Jews and proselytes whom such a mercantile center would
attract to it; and if this was allowed at the outset of the voyage ([Act
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#003).md), much more readily would it be
now when he had gained the reverence and confidence of all classes with
whom he came in contact. At any rate we cannot wonder that he should be
regarded by the Sicilians as the founder of the Church of that island.

[Acts 28:13](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 28:13</span></span>

from thence we fetched a compass--that is, proceeded circuitously, or
tacked, working to windward probably, and availing themselves of the
sinuosities of the coast, the wind not being favorable \[SMITH\]. What
follows confirms this.

and came to Rhegium--now Reggio, a seaport on the southwest point of the
Italian coast, opposite the northeast point of Sicily, and at the
entrance of the narrow straits of Messina.

after one day the south wind blew--a south wind having sprung up; being
now favored with a fair wind, for want of which they had been obliged
first to stay three days at Syracuse, and then to tack and put in for a
day at Rhegium.

the next day to Puteoli--now Pozzuoli, situated on the northern part of
the magnificent bay of Naples about one hundred eighty miles north of
Rhegium, a distance which they might make, running before their "south
wind," in about twenty-six hours. The Alexandrian corn ships enjoyed a
privilege peculiar to themselves, of not being obliged to strike their
topsail on landing. By this they were easily recognized as they hove in
sight by the crowds that we find gathered on the shore on such occasions
\[HOWSON\].

[Acts 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 28:14</span></span>

Where we found brethren--not "the brethren" (see on [Act
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004).md), from which one would conclude
they did not expect to find such \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

and were desired--"requested."

to tarry with them seven days--If this request came from Julius, it may
have proceeded partly from a wish to receive instructions from Rome and
make arrangements for his journey thither, partly from a wish to gratify
Paul, as he seems studiously and increasingly to have done to the last.
One can hardly doubt that he was influenced by both considerations.
However this may be, the apostle had thus an opportunity of spending a
Sabbath with the Christians of the place, all the more refreshing from
his long privation in this respect, and as a seasoning for the unknown
future that lay before him at the metropolis.

so we went toward Rome.

[Acts 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 28:15</span></span>

And from thence, when the brethren--of Rome

heard of us--by letter from Puteoli, and probably by the same conveyance
which took Julius' announcement of his arrival.

they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum--a town forty-one miles from
Rome.

and the Three Taverns--thirty miles from Rome. Thus they came to greet
the apostle in two parties, one stopping short at the nearer, the other
going on to the more distant place.

whom when Paul saw, he thanked God--for such a welcome. How sensitive he
was to such Christian affection all his Epistles show ([Rom
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009), &c..md).

and took courage--his long-cherished purpose to "see Rome" ([Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021).md), there to proclaim the
unsearchable riches of Christ, and the divine pledge that in this he
should be gratified ([Act 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#011).md),
being now about to be auspiciously realized.

[Acts 28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 28:16</span></span>

when we came to Rome--the renowned capital of the ancient world,
situated on the Tiber.

the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard--the
PrÃ&brvbr;torian Prefect, to whose custody, as commander of the
PrÃ&brvbr;torian guard, the highest military authority in the city, were
committed all who were to come before the emperor for trial. Ordinarily
there were two such prefects; but from A.D. 51 to 62, one distinguished
general--Burrus Aframus, who had been Nero's tutor--held that office;
and as our historian speaks of "the captain," as if there were but one,
it is thought that this fixes the apostle's arrival at Rome to be not
later than the year 62 \[WIES\]. But even though there had been two when
Paul arrived, he would be committed only to one of them, who would be
"the captain" who got charge of him. (At most, therefore, this can
furnish no more than confirmation to the chronological evidence
otherwise obtained).

but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a--"the"

soldier that kept him--"guarded" him. (See on [Act
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006).md). This privilege was allowed in
the case of the better class of prisoners, not accused of any flagrant
offense, on finding security--which in Paul's case would not be
difficult among the Christians. The extension of this privilege to the
apostle may have been due to the terms in which Festus wrote about him;
but far more probably it was owing to the high terms in which Julius
spoke of him, and his express intercession in his behalf. It was
overruled, however, for giving the fullest scope to the labors of the
apostle compatible with confinement at all. As the soldiers who kept him
were relieved periodically, he would thus make the personal acquaintance
of a great number of the PrÃ&brvbr;torian guard; and if he had to appear
before the Prefect from time to time, the truth might thus penetrate to
those who surrounded the emperor, as we learn, from [Phi
1:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md), that it did.

[Acts 28:17](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 28:17</span></span>

Paul called the chief of the Jews together--Though banished from the
capital by Claudius, the Jews enjoyed the full benefit of the toleration
which distinguished the first period of Nero's reign, and were at this
time in considerable numbers, wealth, and influence settled at Rome. We
have seen that long before this a flourishing Christian Church existed
at Rome, to which Paul wrote his Epistle (see on [Act
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003).md), and the first members of which
were probably Jewish converts and proselytes. (See Introduction to
Romans.)

yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
Romans--the Roman authorities, Felix and Festus.

[Acts 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 28:19</span></span>

I was constrained to appeal . . . not that I had aught to accuse my
nation of--"I am here not as their accuser, but as my own defender, and
this not of choice but necessity." His object in alluding thus gently to
the treatment he had received from the Jews was plainly to avoid
whatever might irritate his visitors at the first; especially as he was
not aware whether any or what information against him had reached their
community.

[Acts 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 28:20</span></span>

For this cause . . . have I called for you . . . because . . . for the
hope of Israel--(See on [Act 26:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006).md).

I am bound with this chain--"This cause is not so much mine as yours; it
is the nation's cause; all that is dear to the heart and hope of Israel
is bound up with this case of mine." From the touching allusions which
the apostle makes to his chains, before Agrippa first, and here before
the leading members of the Jewish community at Rome, at his first
interview with them, one would gather that his great soul felt keenly
his being in such a condition; and it is to this keenness of feeling,
under the control of Christian principle, that we owe the noble use
which he made of it in these two cases.

[Acts 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 28:21</span></span>

We neither received letters out of Judea concerning thee, &c.--We need
not suppose (with THOLUCK and others) that there was any dishonest
concealment here. The distinction made between himself, against whom
they heard nothing, and his "sect," as "everywhere spoken against," is a
presumption in favor of their sincerity; and there is ground to think
that as the case took an unexpected turn by Paul's appealing to
CÃ&brvbr;sar, so no information on the subject would travel from
Jerusalem to Rome in advance of the apostle himself.

[Acts 28:22](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 28:22</span></span>

we desire--"deem it proper"

to hear of thee what thou thinkest--what are thy sentiments, views, &c.
The apparent freedom from prejudice here expressed may have arisen from
a prudent desire to avoid endangering a repetition of those dissensions
about Christianity to which, probably, SUETONIUS alludes, and which had
led to the expulsion of the Jews under Claudius \[HUMPHRY\]. See on [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md).

[Acts 28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 28:23</span></span>

there came many--"considerable numbers"

into his lodging--The word denotes one's place of stay as a guest ([Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022).md), not "his own hired house,"
mentioned in [Act 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md). Some
Christian friends--possibly Aquila and Priscilla, who had returned to
Rome ([Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003).md), would be glad to
receive him, though he would soon find himself more at liberty in a
house of his own.

to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God--opening up the
great spiritual principles of that kingdom in opposition to the
contracted and secular views of it entertained by the Jews.

persuading them concerning Jesus--as the ordained and predicted Head of
that kingdom.

out of the law . . . and the prophets--drawing his materials and
arguments from a source mutually acknowledged.

from morning till evening--"Who would not wish to have been present?"
exclaims BENGEL; but virtually we are present while listening to those
Epistles which he dictated from his prison at Rome, and to his other
epistolary expositions of Christian truth against the Jews.

[Acts 28:24](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 28:24</span></span>

and some believed . . . some not--What simplicity and candor are in this
record of a result repeated from age to age where the Gospel is
presented to a promiscuous assemblage of sincere and earnest inquirers
after truth, frivolous worldlings, and prejudiced bigots!

[Acts 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 28:25</span></span>

when they--the Jews.

agreed not among themselves--the discussion having passed into one
between the two parties into which the visitors were now divided,
respecting the arguments and conclusions of the apostle.

they departed--the material of discussion being felt by both parties to
be exhausted.

after Paul had spoken one word--one solemn parting testimony, from those
Scriptures regarded by both alike as "the Holy Ghost speaking" to
Israel.

[Acts 28:26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 28:26</span></span>

Hearing, ye shall hear, &c.--(See on [Mat
13:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013.md) and [Joh
12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038).md). With what pain would this
stern saying be wrung from him whose "heart's desire and prayer to God
for Israel was that they might be saved," and who "had great heaviness
and continual sorrow in his heart" on their account ([Rom
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md); [Rom
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002).md)!

[Acts 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 28:28</span></span>

the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear--(See
on [Act 13:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#044).md). "This departure to
the Gentiles" he had intimated to the perverse Jews at Antioch ([Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046).md), and at Corinth ([Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006).md); now at Rome: thus in Asia,
Greece, and Italy" \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 28:29</span></span>

the Jews departed, and had great--"much"

reasoning among themselves--"This verse is wanting in many manuscripts
\[and omitted by several recent editors\], but certainly without reason.
Probably the words were regarded as superfluous, as they seem to tell us
what we were told before, that Paul "departed" (see [Act
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025).md). But in [Act
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025.md) it is the breaking off of the
discourse that is meant, here the final departure from the house"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Acts 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 28:30</span></span>

in his own hired house--(See on [Act
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#023).md), yet still in custody, for he
only "received all that came to him"; and it is not said that he went to
the synagogue or anywhere else.

[Acts 28:31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 28:31</span></span>

with all confidence, no man forbidding him--enjoying, in the
uninterrupted exercise of his ministry, all the liberty of a guarded
man. Thus closes this most precious monument of the beginnings of the
Christian Church in its march from east to west, among the Jews first,
whose center was Jerusalem; next among the Gentiles, with Antioch for
its headquarters; finally, its banner is seen waving over imperial Rome,
foretokening its universal triumphs. That distinguished apostle whose
conversion, labors, and sufferings for "the faith which once he
destroyed" occupy more than half of this History, it leaves a prisoner,
unheard, so far as appears, for two years. His accusers, whose presence
was indispensable, would have to await the return of spring before
starting for the capital, and might not reach it for many months; nor,
even when there, would they be so sanguine of success--after Felix,
Festus, and Agrippa had all pronounced him innocent--as to be impatient
of delay. And if witnesses were required to prove the charge advanced by
Tertullus, that he was "a mover of sedition among all the Jews
throughout the \[Roman\] world" ([Act
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005).md), they must have seen that unless
considerable time was allowed them the case would certainly break down.
If to this be added the capricious delays which the emperor himself
might interpose, and the practice of Nero to hear but one charge at a
time, it will not seem strange that the historian should have no
proceedings in the case to record for two years. Begun, probably, before
the apostle's arrival, its progress at Rome under his own eye would
furnish exalted employment, and beguile many a tedious hour of his two
years' imprisonment. Had the case come on for hearing during this
period, much more if it had been disposed of, it is hardly conceivable
that the History should have closed as it does. But if, at the end of
this period, the Narrative only wanted the decision of the case, while
hope deferred was making the heart sick ([Pro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#012).md), and if, under the guidance of
that Spirit whose seal was on it all, it seemed of more consequence to
put the Church at once in possession of this History than to keep it
back indefinitely for the sake of what might come to be otherwise known,
we cannot wonder that it should be wound up as it is in its two
concluding verses. All that we know of the apostle's proceedings and
history beyond this must be gathered from the Epistles of the
Imprisonment--Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon--written
during this period, and the Pastoral Epistles--to Timothy and Titus,
which, in our judgment, are of subsequent date. From the former class of
Epistles we learn the following particulars: (1) That the trying
restraint laid upon the apostle's labors by his imprisonment had only
turned his influence into a new channel; the Gospel having in
consequence penetrated even into the palace, and pervaded the city,
while the preachers of Christ were emboldened; and though the Judaizing
portion of them, observing his success among the Gentiles, had been led
to inculcate with fresh zeal their own narrower Gospel, even this had
done much good by extending the truth common to both (See on [Phi
1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#012.md); [Phi
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022)); (2.md) That as in addition to all
his other labors, "the care of all the churches pressed upon him from
day to-day" ([Co2 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#028).md), so with
these churches he kept up an active correspondence by means of letters
and messages, and on such errands he lacked not faithful and beloved
brethren enough ready to be employed--Luke; Timotheus; Tychicus; (John)
Mark; Demas; Aristarchus; Epaphras; Onesimus; Jesus, called Justus; and,
for a short time, Epaphroditus (See on [Col

That the apostle suffered martyrdom under Nero at Rome has never been
doubted. But that the appeal which brought him to Rome issued in his
liberation, that he was at large for some years thereafter and took some
wide missionary circuits, and that he was again arrested, carried to
Rome, and then executed--was the undisputed belief of the early Church,
as expressed by CHRYSOSTOM, JEROME, and EUSEBIUS, in the fourth century,
up to CLEMENT OF ROME, the "fellow laborer" of the apostle himself ([Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003).md), in the first century. The
strongest possible confirmation of this is found in the Pastoral
Epistles, which bear marks throughout of a more advanced state of the
Church, and more matured forms of error, than can well have existed at
any period before the appeal which brought the apostle to Rome; which
refer to movements of himself and Timothy that cannot without some
straining (as we think) be made to fit into any prior period; and which
are couched in a manifestly riper style than any of his other Epistles.
(See Introduction to First Timothy, Introduction to Second Timothy
Introduction to Titus and Notes). All this has been called in question
by modern critics of great research and acuteness \[PETAVIUS, LARDNER,
DE WETTE, WIESELER, DAVIDSON, and others\]. But those who maintain the
ancient view are of equal authority and more numerous, while the weight
of argument appears to us to be decidedly on their side.
