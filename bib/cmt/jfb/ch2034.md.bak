### [2 Chronicles Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 34:1</span></span>

JOSIAH'S GOOD REIGN. ([Ch2 34:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#001).md)

Josiah was eight years old--(See on [Kg2
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#001).md). The testimony borne to the
undeviating steadfastness of his adherence to the cause of true religion
places his character and reign in honorable contrast with those of many
of his royal predecessors.

[2 Chronicles 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 34:3</span></span>

HE DESTROYS IDOLATRY. ([Ch2 34:3-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#003).md)

in the eighth year of his reign--This was the sixteenth year of his age,
and, as the kings of Judah were considered minors till they had
completed their thirteenth year, it was three years after he had
attained majority. He had very early manifested the piety and excellent
dispositions of his character. In the twelfth year of his reign, but the
twentieth of his age, he began to take a lively interest in the
purgation of his kingdom from all the monuments of idolatry which, in
his father's short reign, had been erected. At a later period, his
increasing zeal for securing the purity of divine worship led him to
superintend the work of demolition in various parts of his dominion. The
course of the narrative in this passage is somewhat different from that
followed in the Book of Kings. For the historian, having made allusion
to the early manifestation of Josiah's zeal, goes on with a full detail
of all the measures this good king adopted for the extirpation of
idolatry; whereas the author of the Book of Kings sets out with the
cleansing of the temple, immediately previous to the celebration of the
passover, and embraces that occasion to give a general description of
Josiah's policy for freeing the land from idolatrous pollution. The
exact chronological order is not followed either in Kings or Chronicles.
But it is clearly recorded in both that the abolition of idolatry began
in the twelfth and was completed in the eighteenth year of Josiah's
reign. Notwithstanding Josiah's undoubted sincerity and zeal and the
people's apparent compliance with the king's orders, he could not
extinguish a strongly rooted attachment to idolatries introduced in the
early part of Manasseh's reign. This latent predilection appears
unmistakably developed in the subsequent reigns, and the divine decree
for the removal of Judah, as well as Israel, into captivity was
irrevocably passed.

[2 Chronicles 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md)

the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them--He treated the graves
themselves as guilty of the crimes of those who were lying in them
\[BERTHEAU\].

[2 Chronicles 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 34:5</span></span>

he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars--A greater brand of
infamy could not have been put on idolatrous priests than the
disinterment of their bones, and a greater defilement could not have
been done to the altars of idolatry than the burning upon them the bones
of those who had there officiated in their lifetime.

[2 Chronicles 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 34:6</span></span>

with their mattocks--or, "in their deserts"--so that the verse will
stand thus: "And so did \[namely, break the altars and burn the bones of
priests\] he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even
unto Naphtali, in their deserted suburbs." The reader is apt to be
surprised on finding that Josiah, whose hereditary possessions were
confined to the kingdom of Judah, exercised as much authority among the
tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, Simeon, and others as far as Naphtali, as
he did within his own dominion. Therefore, it is necessary to observe
that, after the destruction of Samaria by Shalmaneser, the remnant that
continued on the mountains of Israel maintained a close intercourse with
Judah, and looked to the sovereigns of that kingdom as their natural
protectors. Those kings acquired great influence over them, which Josiah
exercised in removing every vestige of idolatry from the land. He could
not have done this without the acquiescence of the people in the
propriety of this proceeding, conscious that this was conformable to
their ancient laws and institutions. The Assyrian kings, who were now
masters of the country, might have been displeased at the liberties
Josiah took beyond his own territories. But either they were not
informed of his doings, or they did not trouble themselves about his
religious proceedings, relating, as they would think, to the god of the
land, especially as he did not attempt to seize upon any place or to
disturb the allegiance of the people \[CALMET\].

[2 Chronicles 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 34:8</span></span>

HE REPAIRS THE TEMPLE. ([Ch2 34:8-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md)

in the eighteenth year of his reign . . . he sent Shaphan--(See on [Kg2
22:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#003).md).

[2 Chronicles 34:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 34:19</span></span>

AND, CAUSING THE LAW TO BE READ, RENEWS THE COVENANT BETWEEN GOD AND THE
PEOPLE. ([Ch2 34:19-33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#019).md)

when the king had heard the words of the law, &c.--(See on [Kg2
22:11-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md); [Kg2
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#001).md).
