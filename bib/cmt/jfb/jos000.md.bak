### [Joshua Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

[Joshua](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001.md)

JOSHUA. The title of this book is derived from the pious and valiant
leader whose achievements it relates and who is commonly supposed to
have been its author. The objections to this idea are founded chiefly on
the clause, "unto this day," which occurs several times ([Jos
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#009.md); [Jos
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#025.md); [Jos
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028).md). But this, at least in the case
of Rahab, is no valid reason for rejecting the idea of his authorship;
for assuming what is most probable, that this book was composed toward
the close of Joshua's long career, or compiled from written documents
left by him, Rahab might have been still alive. A more simple and
satisfactory way of accounting for the frequent insertion of the clause,
"unto this day," is the opinion that it was a comment introduced by
Ezra, when revising the sacred canon; and this difficulty being removed,
the direct proofs of the book having been produced by a witness of the
transactions related in it, the strong and vivid descriptions of the
passing scenes, and the use of the words "we" and "us," ([Jos
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001).md), viewed in connection with the
fact, that, after his farewell address to the people, Joshua "wrote
these words in the book of the law of God" \[[Jos
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#026.md)\] --all afford strong
presumptive proof that the entire book was the work of that eminent
individual. Its inspiration and canonical authority are fully
established by the repeated testimonies of other Scripture writers
(compare [Jos 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#026.md) with [Kg1
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#034.md); compare [Jos
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013.md) with [Hab
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#011.md); [Jos
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#014.md) with [Act
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md); [Jos
6:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/jos006.htm#017.md) with [Heb
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#030.md); Jos. 2:1-24 with [Jam
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md); [Psa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md); [Psa
68:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012.md); [Psa
78:54-55](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#054).md). As a narrative of God's
faithfulness in giving the Israelites possession of the promised land,
this history is most valuable, and bears the same character as a sequel
to the Pentateuch, that the Acts of the Apostles do to the Gospels.
