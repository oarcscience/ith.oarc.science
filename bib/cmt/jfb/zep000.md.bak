### [Zephaniah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">zep 0:0</span></span>

ZEPHANIAH, ninth in order of the minor prophets, prophesied "in the days
of Josiah" ([Zep 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001).md), that is,
between 642 and 611 B.C. The name means "Jehovah hath guarded,"
literally, "hidden" ([Psa 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005.md); [Psa
83:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#003).md). The specification in the
introductory heading, of not only his father, but also his grandfather,
and great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather, implies that the
latter were persons of note, or else the design was to distinguish him
from another Zephaniah of note at the time of the captivity. The Jews'
supposition, that persons recorded as a prophet's ancestors were
themselves endowed with the prophetic spirit, seems groundless. There is
no impossibility of the Hezekiah, who was Zephaniah's
great-great-grandfather, being King Hezekiah as to the number of
generations; for Hezekiah's reign of twenty-nine years, and his
successor's reign of fifty-five years, admit of four generations
interposing between. Yet the omission of the designation, "king of
Judah," is fatal to the theory (compare [Pro
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#001.md); [Isa
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009).md).

He must have flourished in the earlier part of Josiah's reign. In [Zep
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#013.md) rhe foretells the doom of
Nineveh, which happened in 625 B.C.; and in [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md) he denounces various forms of
idolatry, and specially that of Baal. Now Josiah's reformation began in
the twelfth and was completed in the eighteenth year of his reign.
Zephaniah, therefore, in denouncing Baal worship, co-operated with that
good king in his efforts, and so must have prophesied somewhere between
the twelfth and eighteenth years of his reign. The silence of the
historical books is no argument against this, as it would equally apply
against Jeremiah's prophetical existence at the same time. Jewish
tradition says that Zephaniah had for his colleagues Jeremiah, whose
sphere of labor was the thoroughfares and market places, and Huldah the
prophetess, who exercised her vocation in the college in Jerusalem. The
prophecy begins with the nation's sin and the fearful retribution coming
at the hands of the Chaldeans. These are not mentioned by name, as in
Jeremiah; for the prophecies of the latter, being nearer the fulfilment,
become more explicit than those of an earlier date. The second chapter
dooms the persecuting states in the neighborhood as well as Judea
itself. The third chapter denounces Jerusalem, but concludes with the
promise of her joyful re-establishment in the theocracy.

The style, though not generally sublime, is graphic and vivid in details
(compare [Zep 1:4-12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004).md). The language is
pure, and free from Aramaisms. There are occasional coincidences with
former prophets (compare [Zep 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#014.md),
with [Isa 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md); [Zep
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#015.md), with [Isa
47:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#008.md); [Zep
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#010.md), with [Isa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md); [Zep
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#008.md), with [Isa
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006.md); also [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md), with [Jer
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#002.md); [Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md), with [Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011).md). Such coincidences in part
arise from the phraseology of Hebrew prophetic poetry being the common
language of the inspired brotherhood. The New Testament, at [Rom
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md), seems to refer to [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md).
