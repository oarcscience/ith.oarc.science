### [Genesis Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 3:1</span></span>

THE TEMPTATION. ([Gen 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001).md)

the serpent--The fall of man was effected by the seductions of a
serpent. That it was a real serpent is evident from the plain and
artless style of the history and from the many allusions made to it in
the New Testament. But the material serpent was the instrument or tool
of a higher agent, Satan or the devil, to whom the sacred writers apply
from this incident the reproachful name of "the dragon, that old
serpent" \[[Rev 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002.md)\]. Though Moses
makes no mention of this wicked spirit--giving only the history of the
visible world--yet in the fuller discoveries of the Gospel, it is
distinctly intimated that Satan was the author of the plot ([Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md); [Co2
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md); [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md); [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014.md); [Rev
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002).md).

more subtile--Serpents are proverbial for wisdom ([Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016).md). But these reptiles were at
first, probably, far superior in beauty as well as in sagacity to what
they are in their present state.

He said--There being in the pure bosoms of the first pair no principle
of evil to work upon, a solicitation to sin could come only from
"without," as in the analogous case of Jesus Christ ([Mat
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003).md); and as the tempter could not
assume the human form, there being only Adam and Eve in the world, the
agency of an inferior creature had to be employed. The dragon-serpent
\[BOCHART\] seemed the fittest for the vile purpose; and the devil was
allowed by Him who permitted the trial, to bring articulate sounds from
its mouth.

unto the woman--the object of attack, from his knowledge of her frailty,
of her having been but a short time in the world, her limited experience
of the animal tribes, and, above all, her being alone, unfortified by
the presence and counsels of her husband. Though sinless and holy, she
was a free agent, liable to be tempted and seduced.

yea, hath God said?--Is it true that He has restricted you in using the
fruits of this delightful place? This is not like one so good and kind.
Surely there is some mistake. He insinuated a doubt as to her sense of
the divine will and appeared as an angel of light ([Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014).md), offering to lead her to the
true interpretation. It was evidently from her regarding him as
specially sent on that errand, that, instead of being startled by the
reptile's speaking, she received him as a heavenly messenger.

[Genesis 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 3:2</span></span>

the woman said, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden--In
her answer, Eve extolled the large extent of liberty they enjoyed in
ranging at will amongst all the trees--one only excepted, with respect
to which, she declared there was no doubt, either of the prohibition or
the penalty. But there is reason to think that she had already received
an injurious impression; for in using the words "lest ye die," instead
of "ye shall surely die" \[[Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md)\], she spoke as if the tree had
been forbidden because of some poisonous quality of its fruit. The
tempter, perceiving this, became bolder in his assertions.

[Genesis 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 3:4</span></span>

Ye shall not surely die--He proceeded, not only to assure her of perfect
impunity, but to promise great benefits from partaking of it.

[Genesis 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 3:5</span></span>

your eyes shall be opened--His words meant more than met the ear. In one
sense her eyes were opened; for she acquired a direful experience of
"good and evil"--of the happiness of a holy, and the misery of a sinful,
condition. But he studiously concealed this result from Eve, who, fired
with a generous desire for knowledge, thought only of rising to the rank
and privileges of her angelic visitants.

[Genesis 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 3:6</span></span>

THE FALL. ([Gen 3:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#006).md)

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food--Her imagination
and feelings were completely won; and the fall of Eve was soon followed
by that of Adam. The history of every temptation, and of every sin, is
the same; the outward object of attraction, the inward commotion of
mind, the increase and triumph of passionate desire; ending in the
degradation, slavery, and ruin of the soul ([Jam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#015.md); [Jo1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016).md).

[Genesis 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 3:8</span></span>

they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden--The divine
Being appeared in the same manner as formerly--uttering the well-known
tones of kindness, walking in some visible form (not running hastily, as
one impelled by the influence of angry feelings). How beautifully
expressive are these words of the familiar and condescending manner in
which He had hitherto held intercourse with the first pair.

in the cool of the day--literally, "the breeze of the day," the evening.

hid themselves amongst the trees of the garden--Shame, remorse, fear--a
sense of guilt--feelings to which they had hitherto been strangers
disordered their minds and led them to shun Him whose approach they used
to welcome. How foolish to think of eluding His notice ([Psa
139:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001).md).

[Genesis 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 3:10</span></span>

THE EXAMINATION. ([Gen 3:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#010).md)

afraid, because . . . naked--apparently, a confession--the language of
sorrow; but it was evasive--no signs of true humility and
penitence--each tries to throw the blame on another.

[Genesis 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 3:12</span></span>

The woman . . . gave me--He blames God \[CALVIN\]. As the woman had been
given him for his companion and help, he had eaten of the tree from love
to her; and perceiving she was ruined, was determined not to survive her
\[M'KNIGHT\].

[Genesis 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 3:13</span></span>

beguiled--cajoled by flattering lies. This sin of the first pair was
heinous and aggravated--it was not simply eating an apple, but a love of
self, dishonor to God, ingratitude to a benefactor, disobedience to the
best of Masters--a preference of the creature to the Creator.

[Genesis 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 3:14</span></span>

THE SENTENCE. ([Gen 3:14-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014).md)

And the Lord God said unto the serpent--The Judge pronounces a doom:
first, on the material serpent, which is cursed above all creatures.
From being a model of grace and elegance in form, it has become the type
of all that is odious, disgusting, and low \[LE CLERC, ROSENMULLER\]; or
the curse has converted its natural condition into a punishment; it is
now branded with infamy and avoided with horror; next, on the spiritual
serpent, the seducer. Already fallen, he was to be still more degraded
and his power wholly destroyed by the offspring of those he had
deceived.

[Genesis 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 3:15</span></span>

thy seed--not only evil spirits, but wicked men.

seed of the woman--the Messiah, or His Church \[CALVIN, HENGSTENBERG\].

I will put enmity between thee and the woman--God can only be said to do
so by leaving "the serpent and his seed to the influence of their own
corruption; and by those measures which, pursued for the salvation of
men, fill Satan and his angels with envy and rage."

thou shalt bruise his heel--The serpent wounds the heel that crushes
him; and so Satan would be permitted to afflict the humanity of Christ
and bring suffering and persecution on His people.

it shall bruise thy head--The serpent's poison is lodged in its head;
and a bruise on that part is fatal. Thus, fatal shall be the stroke
which Satan shall receive from Christ, though it is probable he did not
at first understand the nature and extent of his doom.

[Genesis 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 3:16</span></span>

unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow--She was
doomed as a wife and mother to suffer pain of body and distress of mind.
From being the help meet of man and the partner of his affections \[[Gen
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md), [Gen
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#023.md)\], her condition would henceforth
be that of humble subjection.

[Genesis 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 3:17</span></span>

unto Adam he said--made to gain his livelihood by tilling the ground;
but what before his fall he did with ease and pleasure, was not to be
accomplished after it without painful and persevering exertion.

[Genesis 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 3:19</span></span>

till thou return unto the ground--Man became mortal; although he did not
die the moment he ate the forbidden fruit, his body underwent a change,
and that would lead to dissolution; the union subsisting between his
soul and God having already been dissolved, he had become liable to all
the miseries of this life and to the pains of hell for ever. What a
mournful chapter this is in the history of man! It gives the only true
account of the origin of all the physical and moral evils that are in
the world; upholds the moral character of God; shows that man, made
upright, fell from not being able to resist a slight temptation; and
becoming guilty and miserable, plunged all his posterity into the same
abyss ([Rom 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012).md). How astonishing the
grace which at that moment gave promise of a Saviour and conferred on
her who had the disgrace of introducing sin the future honor of
introducing that Deliverer ([Ti1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#015).md).

[Genesis 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 3:20</span></span>

Adam called his wife's name Eve--probably in reference to her being a
mother of the promised Saviour, as well as of all mankind.

[Genesis 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 3:21</span></span>

God made coats of skins--taught them to make these for themselves. This
implies the institution of animal sacrifice, which was undoubtedly of
divine appointment, and instruction in the only acceptable mode of
worship for sinful creatures, through faith in a Redeemer ([Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022).md).

[Genesis 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 3:22</span></span>

And God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us--not spoken in
irony as is generally supposed, but in deep compassion. The words should
be rendered, "Behold, what has become \[by sin\] of the man who was as
one of us"! Formed, at first, in our image to know good and evil--how
sad his condition now.

and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life--This tree being a pledge of that immortal life with which
obedience should be rewarded, man lost, on his fall, all claim to this
tree; and therefore, that he might not eat of it or delude himself with
the idea that eating of it would restore what he had forfeited, the Lord
sent him forth from the garden.

[Genesis 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 3:24</span></span>

placed . . . cherbim--The passage should be rendered thus: "And he dwelt
between the cherubim at the East of the Garden of Eden and a fierce
fire, or Shekinah, unfolding itself to preserve the way of the tree of
life." This was the mode of worship now established to show God's anger
at sin and teach the mediation of a promised Saviour as the way of life,
as well as of access to God. They were the same figures as were
afterwards in the tabernacle and temple; and now, as then, God said, "I
will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two
cherubims" ([Exo 25:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#022).md).
