### [2 Chronicles Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 21:1</span></span>

JEHORAM SUCCEEDS JEHOSHAPHAT. ([Ch2
21:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#001))

Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers . . . Jehoram . . . reigned--The late
king left seven sons; two of them are in our version named Azariah; but
in the Hebrew they appear considerably different, the one being spelt
"Azariah," and the other "Azariahu." Though Jehoshaphat had made his
family arrangements with prudent precaution, and while he divided the
functions of royalty in his lifetime (compare [Kg2
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#016)), as well as fixed the succession
to the throne in his oldest son, he appointed each of the others to the
government of a fenced city, thus providing them with an honorable
independence. But this good intentions were frustrated; for no sooner
did Jehoram find himself in the sole possession of sovereign power than,
from jealousy, or on account of their connections, he murdered all his
brothers, together with some leading influential persons who, he
suspected, were attached to their interest, or would avenge their
deaths. Similar tragedies have been sadly frequent in Eastern courts,
where the heir of the crown looks upon his brothers as his most
formidable enemies, and is therefore tempted to secure his power by
their death.

[2 Chronicles 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 21:6</span></span>

HIS WICKED REIGN. ([Ch2 21:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#005))

he walked . . . as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of
Ahab to wife--The precepts and examples of his excellent father were
soon obliterated by his matrimonial alliance with a daughter of the
royal house of Israel. Through the influence of Athaliah he abolished
the worship of the Lord, and encouraged an introduction of all the
corruptions prevalent in the sister kingdom. The divine vengeance was
denounced against him, and would have utterly destroyed him and his
house, had it not been for a tender regard to the promise made to David
([Sa2 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#029); [Kg2
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#019)).

[2 Chronicles 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 21:8</span></span>

EDOM AND LIBNAH REVOLT. ([Ch2 21:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008))

the Edomites revolted--That nation had been made dependent by David, and
down to the time of Jehoshaphat was governed by a tributary ruler ([Kg1
22:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047); [Kg2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009)). But that king having been slain
in an insurrection at home, his successor thought to ingratiate himself
with his new subjects by raising the flag of independence \[JOSEPHUS\].
The attempt was defeated in the first instance by Jehoram, who possessed
all the military establishments of his father; but being renewed
unexpectedly, the Edomites succeeded in completely emancipating their
country from the yoke of Judah ([Gen
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040)). Libnah, which lay on the
southern frontier and towards Edom, followed the example of that
country.

[2 Chronicles 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 21:12</span></span>

there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet--That prophet's
translation having taken place in the reign of Jehoshaphat \[[Kg2
2:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011)\], we must conclude that the
name of Elijah has, by the error of a transcriber, been put for that of
Elisha.

[2 Chronicles 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 21:13</span></span>

hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem . . . like to the
whoredoms of the house of Ahab--that is, introduced the superstitions
and vices of PhÅ“nician idolatry (see on [Deu
13:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006)). On this account, as well as
for his unnatural cruelties, divine vengeance was denounced against him,
which was soon after executed exactly as the prophet had foretold. A
series of overwhelming calamities befell this wicked king; for in
addition to the revolts already mentioned, two neighboring tribes (see
[Ch2 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#011)) made hostile incursions on
the southern and western portions of his kingdom. His country was
ravaged, his capital taken, his palace plundered, his wives carried off,
and all his children slain except the youngest. He himself was seized
with an incurable dysentery, which, after subjecting him to the most
painful suffering for the unusual period of two years, carried him off,
a monument of the divine judgment. To complete his degradation, his
death was unlamented, his burial unhonored by his subjects. This custom,
similar to what obtained in Egypt, seems to have crept in among the
Hebrews, of giving funeral honors to their kings, or withholding them,
according to the good or bad characters of their reign.
