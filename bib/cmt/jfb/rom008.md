### [Romans Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md)

[Romans 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 8:1</span></span>

CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE ARGUMENT--THE GLORIOUS COMPLETENESS OF THEM THAT
ARE IN CHRIST JESUS. (Rom. 8:1-39)

There is therefore now, &c.--referring to the immediately preceding
context \[OLSHAUSEN, PHILIPPI, MEYER, ALFORD, &c.\]. The subject with
which the seventh chapter concludes is still under consideration. The
scope of [Rom 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md) is to show how
"the law of sin and death" is deprived of its power to bring believers
again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the
homage of a living obedience \[CALVIN, FRASER, PHILIPPI, MEYER, ALFORD,
&c.\].

no condemnation: to them which are in Christ Jesus--As Christ, who "knew
no sin," was, to all legal effects, "made sin for us," so are we, who
believe in Him, to all legal effects, "made the righteousness of God in
Him" ([Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021).md); and thus, one with
Him in the divine reckoning. there is to such "NO CONDEMNATION."
(Compare [Joh 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#018.md); [Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024.md); [Rom
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018).md). But this is no mere legal
arrangement: it is a union in life; believers, through the indwelling of
Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head
and the members of the same body have one life.

who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit--The evidence of
manuscripts seems to show that this clause formed no part of the
original text of this verse, but that the first part of it was early
introduced, and the second later, from [Rom
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md), probably as an explanatory
comment, and to make the transition to [Rom
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md) easier.

[Romans 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 8:2</span></span>

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free--rather, "freed me"--referring to the time of his conversion, when
first he believed.

from the law of sin and death--It is the Holy Ghost who is here called
"the Spirit of life," as opening up in the souls of believers a fountain
of spiritual life (see on [Joh
7:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md); just as He is called "the
Spirit of truth," as "guiding them into all truth" ([Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md), and "the Spirit of counsel and
might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord" ([Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002).md), as the inspirer of these
qualities. And He is called "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,"
because it is as members of Christ that He takes up His abode in
believers, who in consequence of this have one life with their Head. And
as the word "law" here has the same meaning as in [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md), namely, "an inward principle of
action, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law," it thus
appears that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" here means,
"that new principle of action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up
within us--the law of our new being." This "sets us free," as soon as it
takes possession of our inner man, "from the law of sin and death" that
is, from the enslaving power of that corrupt principle which carries
death in its bosom. The "strong man armed" is overpowered by the
"stronger than he"; the weaker principle is dethroned and expelled by
the more powerful; the principle of spiritual life prevails against and
brings into captivity the principle of spiritual death--"leading
captivity captive." If this be the apostle's meaning, the whole verse is
to this effect: That the triumph of believers over their inward
corruption, through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, proves them to
be in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation. But this is
now explained more fully.

[Romans 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 8:3</span></span>

For what the law could not do, &c.--a difficult and much controverted
verse. But it is clearly, we think, the law's inability to free us from
the dominion of sin that the apostle has in view; as has partly appeared
already (see on [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md), and will
more fully appear presently. The law could irritate our sinful nature
into more virulent action, as we have seen in [Rom
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md), but it could not secure its own
fulfilment. How that is accomplished comes now to be shown.

in that it was weak through the flesh--that is, having to address itself
to us through a corrupt nature, too strong to be influenced by mere
commands and threatenings.

God, &c.--The sentence is somewhat imperfect in its structure, which
occasions a certain obscurity. The meaning is, that whereas the law was
powerless to secure its own fulfilment for the reason given, God took
the method now to be described for attaining that end.

sending--"having sent"

his own Son--This and similar expressions plainly imply that Christ was
God's "OWN SON" before He was sent--that is, in His own proper Person,
and independently of His mission and appearance in the flesh (see on
[Rom 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md) and [Gal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004).md); and if so, He not only has the
very nature of God, even as a son of his father, but is essentially of
the Father, though in a sense too mysterious for any language of ours
properly to define (see on the first through fourth chapters). And this
peculiar relationship is put forward here to enhance the greatness and
define the nature of the relief provided, as coming from beyond the
precincts of sinful humanity altogether, yea, immediately from the
Godhead itself.

in the likeness of sinful flesh--literally, "of the flesh of sin"; a
very remarkable and pregnant expression. He was made in the reality of
our flesh, but only in the likeness of its sinful condition. He took our
nature as it is in us, compassed with infirmities, with nothing to
distinguish Him as man from sinful men, save that He was without sin.
Nor does this mean that He took our nature with all its properties save
one; for sin is no property of humanity at all, but only the disordered
state of our souls, as the fallen family of Adam; a disorder affecting,
indeed, and overspreading our entire nature, but still purely our own.

and for sin--literally, "and about sin"; that is, "on the business of
sin." The expression is purposely a general one, because the design was
not to speak of Christ's mission to atone for sin, but in virtue of that
atonement to destroy its dominion and extirpate it altogether from
believers. We think it wrong, therefore, to render the words (as in the
Margin) "by a sacrifice for sin" (suggested by the language of the
Septuagint and approved by CALVIN, &c.); for this sense is too definite,
and makes the idea of expiation more prominent than it is.

condemned sin--"condemned it to lose its power over men" \[BEZA, BENGEL,
FRASER, MEYER, THOLUCK, PHILIPPI, ALFORD\]. In this glorious sense our
Lord says of His approaching death ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031).md), "Now is the judgment of this
world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out," and again (see
on [Joh 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011)), "When He (the Spirit.md)
shall come, He shall convince the world of . . . judgment, because the
prince of this world is judged," that is, condemned to let go his hold
of men, who, through the Cross, shall be emancipated into the liberty
and power to be holy.

in the flesh--that is, in human nature, henceforth set free from the
grasp of sin.

[Romans 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 8:4</span></span>

That the righteousness of the law--"the righteous demand," "the
requirement" \[ALFORD\], Or "the precept" of the law; for it is not
precisely the word so often used in this Epistle to denote "the
righteousness which justifies" ([Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017.md); [Rom
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md); [Rom
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md); [Rom
5:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017.md), [Rom
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021).md), but another form of the same
word, intended to express the enactment of the law, meaning here, we
believe, the practical obedience which the law calls for.

might be fulfilled in us--or, as we say, "realized in us."

who walk--the most ancient expression of the bent of one's life, whether
in the direction of good or of evil ([Gen
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md); [Psa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md); [Isa
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md); [Mic
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md); [Jo1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006).md).

not after--that is, according to the dictates of

the flesh, but after the spirit--From [Rom
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md) it would seem that what is more
immediately intended by "the spirit" here is our own mind as renewed and
actuated by the Holy Ghost.

[Romans 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 8:5</span></span>

For they that are after the flesh--that is, under the influence of the
fleshly principle.

do mind--give their attention to ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md).

the things of the flesh, &c.--Men must be under the predominating
influence of one or other of these two principles, and, according as the
one or the other has the mastery, will be the complexion of their life,
the character of their actions.

[Romans 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 8:6</span></span>

For--a mere particle of transition here \[THOLUCK\], like "but" or
"now."

to be carnally minded--literally, "the mind" or "minding of the flesh"
(Margin); that is, the pursuit of fleshly ends.

is death--not only "ends in" \[ALFORD, &c.\], but even now "is";
carrying death into its bosom, so that such are "dead while they live"
([Ti1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006.md); [Eph
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001.md), [Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md) \[PHILIPPI\].

but to be spiritually minded--"the mind" or "minding of the spirit";
that is, the pursuit of spiritual objects.

is life and peace--not "life" only, in contrast with the "death" that is
in the other pursuit, but "peace"; it is the very element of the soul's
deepest repose and true bliss.

[Romans 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 8:7</span></span>

Because the carnal mind is enmity against God--The desire and pursuit of
carnal ends is a state of enmity to God, wholly incompatible with true
life and peace in the soul.

for it is not subject--"doth not submit itself."

to the law of God, neither indeed can be--In such a state of mind there
neither is nor can be the least subjection to the law of God. Many
things may be done which the law requires, but nothing either is or can
be done because God's law requires it, or purely to please God.

[Romans 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 8:8</span></span>

So then--nearly equivalent to "And so."

they that are in--and, therefore, under the government of

the flesh cannot please God--having no obediential principle, no desire
to please Him.

[Romans 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 8:9</span></span>

But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit
of God dwell in you--This does not mean, "if the disposition or mind of
God dwell in you"; but "if the Holy Ghost dwell in you" (see [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md), [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md); [Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016), &c..md). (It thus appears that to
be "in the spirit" means here to be under the dominion of our own
renewed mind; because the indwelling of God's Spirit is given as the
evidence that we are "in the spirit").

Now--"But."

if any man have not the Spirit of Christ--Again, this does not mean "the
disposition or mind of Christ," but the Holy Ghost; here called "the
Spirit of Christ," just as He is called "the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus" (see on [Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002).md). It is as
"the Spirit of Christ" that the Holy Ghost takes possession of
believers, introducing into them all the gracious, dove-like disposition
which dwelt in Him ([Mat 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md). Now if any man's heart be void,
not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them, "the Spirit
of Christ."

he is none of his--even though intellectually convinced of the truth of
Christianity, and in a general sense influence by its spirit. Sharp,
solemn statement this!

[Romans 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 8:10</span></span>

And if Christ be in you--by His indwelling Spirit in virtue of which we
have one life with him.

the body--"the body indeed."

is dead because of--"by reason of"

sin; but the spirit is life because--or, "by reason"

of righteousness--The word "indeed," which the original requires, is of
the nature of a concession--"I grant you that the body is dead . . . and
so far redemption is incomplete, but," &c.; that is, "If Christ be in
you by His indwelling Spirit, though your 'bodies' have to pass through
the stage of 'death' in consequence of the first Adam's 'sin,' your
spirit is instinct with new and undying 'life,' brought in by the
'righteousness' of the second Adam" \[THOLUCK, MEYER, and ALFORD in
part, but only HODGE entirely\].

[Romans 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 8:11</span></span>

But--"And."

if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you--that is, "If He dwell in you as the Spirit of the Christ-raising
One," or, "in all the resurrection-power which He put forth in raising
Jesus."

he that raised up Christ from the dead--Observe the change of name from
Jesus, as the historical Individual whom God raised from the dead, to
CHRIST, the same Individual, considered as the Lord and Head of all His
members, or of redeemed Humanity \[ALFORD\].

shall also quicken--rather, "shall quicken even"

your mortal bodies by--the true reading appears to be "by reason of."

his Spirit that dwelleth in you--"Your bodies indeed are not exempt from
the death which sin brought in; but your spirits even now have in them
an undying life, and if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the
dead dwell in you, even these bodies of yours, though they yield to the
last enemy and the dust of them return to the dust as it was, shall yet
experience the same resurrection as that of their living Head, in virtue
of the indwelling of same Spirit in you that quickened Him."

[Romans 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 8:12</span></span>

Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the
flesh--"Once we were sold under sin ([Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md); but now that we have been set
free from that hard master and become servants to Righteousness ([Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022).md), we owe nothing to the flesh, we
disown its unrighteous claims and are deaf to its imperious demands."
Glorious sentiment!

[Romans 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 8:13</span></span>

For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die--in the sense of [Rom
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md).

but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body--(See on
[Rom 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023).md).

ye shall live--in the sense of [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md). The apostle is not satisfied
with assuring them that they are under no obligations to the flesh, to
hearken to its suggestions, without reminding them where it will end if
they do; and he uses the word "mortify" (put to death) as a kind of play
upon the word "die" just before. "If ye do not kill sin, it will kill
you." But he tempers this by the bright alternative, that if they do,
through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, such a course will
infallibly terminate in "life" everlasting. And this leads the apostle
into a new line of thought, opening into his final subject, the "glory"
awaiting the justified believer.

Note, (1) "There can be no safety, no holiness, no happiness, to those
who are out of Christ: No "safety," because all such are under the
condemnation of the law ([Rom 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001).md); no
holiness, because such only as are united to Christ have the spirit of
Christ ([Rom 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009).md); no happiness,
because to be "carnally minded is death" ([Rom
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#006))" \[HODGE\]. (2.md) The
sanctification of believers, as it has its whole foundation in the
atoning death, so it has its living spring in the indwelling of the
Spirit of Christ ([Rom 8:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002)). (3.md)
"The bent of the thoughts, affections, and pursuits, is the only
decisive test of character ([Rom 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005).md)"
\[HODGE\]. (4) No human refinement of the carnal mind will make it
spiritual, or compensate for the absence of spirituality. "Flesh" and
"spirit" are essentially and unchangeably opposed; nor can the carnal
mind, as such, be brought into real subjection to the law of God ([Rom
8:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#005)). Hence (5.md) the estrangement of
God and the sinner is mutual. For as the sinner's state of mind is
"enmity against God" ([Rom 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007).md), so in
this state he "cannot please God" ([Rom
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#008)). (6.md) Since the Holy Ghost is, in
the same breath, called indiscriminately "the Spirit of God," "the
Spirit of Christ," and "Christ" Himself (as an indwelling life in
believers), the essential unity and yet Personal distinctness of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, m the one adorable Godhead must be
believed, as the only consistent explanation of such language ([Rom
8:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)). (7.md) The consciousness of
spiritual life in our renewed souls is a glorious assurance of
resurrection life in the body also, in virtue of the same quickening
Spirit whose inhabitation we already enjoy ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)). (8.md) Whatever professions of
spiritual life men may make, it remains eternally true that "if we live
after the flesh we shall die," and only "if we through the Spirit do
mortify the deeds of the body we shall live" ([Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md), and compare [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md); [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md); [Phi
3:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#018.md); [Jo1
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007).md).

SECOND: The Sonship of Believers--Their Future Inheritance--The
Intercession of the Spirit for Them ([Rom
8:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014).md).

[Romans 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 8:14</span></span>

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God,
they, &c.--"these are sons of God." Hitherto the apostle has spoken of
the Spirit simply as a power through which believers mortify sin: now he
speaks of Him as a gracious, loving Guide, whose "leading"--enjoyed by
all in whom is the Spirit of God's dear Son--shows that they also are
"sons of God."

[Romans 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 8:15</span></span>

For, &c.--"For ye received not (at the time of your conversion) the
spirit of bondage," that is, "The spirit ye received was not a spirit of
bondage."

again--gendering.

to fear--as under the law which "worketh wrath," that is, "Such was your
condition before ye believed, living in legal bondage, haunted with
incessant forebodings under a sense of unpardoned sin. But it was not to
perpetuate that wretched state that ye received the Spirit."

but ye have received--"ye received."

the spirit of adoption, whereby--rather, "wherein."

we cry, Abba, Father--The word "cry" is emphatic, expressing the
spontaneousness, the strength, and the exuberance of the final emotions.
In [Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006.md) this cry is said to
proceed from the Spirit in us, drawing forth the filial exclamation in
our hearts. Here, it is said to proceed from our own hearts under the
vitalizing energy of the Spirit, as the very element of the new life in
believers (compare [Mat 10:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md); and
see on [Rom 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#004).md). "Abba" is the
Syro-Chaldaic word for "Father"; and the Greek word for that is added,
not surely to tell the reader that both mean the same thing, but for the
same reason which drew both words from the lips of Christ Himself during
his agony in the garden ([Mar 14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036).md).
He, doubtless, loved to utter His Father's name in both the accustomed
forms; beginning with His cherished mother tongue, and adding that of
the learned. In this view the use of both words here has a charming
simplicity and warmth.

[Romans 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 8:16</span></span>

The Spirit itself--It should be "Himself" (see on [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md).

beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children--"are
children"

of God--The testimony of our own spirit is borne in that cry of
conscious sonship, "Abba, Father"; but we are not therein alone; for the
Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw
forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, "in the mouth of
two witnesses" the thing is established. The apostle had before called
us "sons of God," referring to our adoption; here the word changes to
"children," referring to our new birth. The one expresses the dignity to
which we are admitted; the other the new life which we receive. The
latter is more suitable here; because a son by adoption might not be
heir of the property, whereas a son by birth certainly is, and this is
what the apostle is now coming to.

[Romans 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 8:17</span></span>

And if children, then heirs--"heirs also."

heirs of God--of our Father's kingdom.

and joint-heirs with Christ--as the "First-born among many brethren"
([Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md), and as "Heir of all
things" ([Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002).md).

if so be that we suffer--"provided we be suffering with Him."

that we may be also glorified together--with Him. This necessity of
conformity to Christ in suffering in order to participate in His glory,
is taught alike by Christ Himself and by His apostles ([Joh
12:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024.md); [Mat
16:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#024.md); [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012).md).

[Romans 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 8:18</span></span>

For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us--that is,
"True, we must suffer with Christ, if we would partake of His glory; but
what of that? For if such sufferings are set over against the coming
glory, they sink into insignificance."

[Romans 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md)

For, &c.--"The apostle, fired with the thought of the future glory of
the saints, pours forth this splendid passage, in which he represents
the whole creation groaning under its present degradation, and looking
and longing for the revelation of this glory as the end and consummation
of its existence" \[HODGE\].

principle of decay. The apostle, personifying creation, represents it as
only submitting to the vanity with which it was smitten, on man's
account, in obedience to that superior power which had mysteriously
linked its destinies with man's. And so he adds

in which the children of God, when raised up in glory, shall expatiate:

glorious sense, be delivered (So CALVIN, BEZA, BENGEL, THOLUCK,
OLSHAUSEN, DE WETTE, MEYER, PHILIPPI, HODGE, ALFORD, &c.).

[Romans 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 8:22</span></span>

For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now--If for man's sake alone the earth was cursed, it
cannot surprise us that it should share in his recovery. And if so, to
represent it as sympathizing with man's miseries, and as looking forward
to his complete redemption as the period of its own emancipation from
its present sin-blighted condition, is a beautiful thought, and in
harmony with the general teaching of Scripture on the subject. (See on
[Pe2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md).

[Romans 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md)

first-fruits" of our full redemption (compare [Co2

heavenly frame and attempering it to its future element.

even we ourselves--though we have so much of heaven already within us.

the manifold "vanity and vexation of spirit" that are written upon every
object and every pursuit and every enjoyment under the sun.

it observed) the deliverance of ourselves from the body, but the
redemption of the body itself from the grave" \[BENGEL\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 8:24</span></span>

For we are saved by hope--rather, "For in hope we are saved"; that is,
it is more a salvation in hope than as yet in actual possession.

but hope that is seen is not hope--for the very meaning of hope is, the
expectation that something now future will become present.

for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?--the latter ending when
the other comes.

[Romans 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 8:25</span></span>

But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
it--that is, then, patient waiting for it is our fitting attitude.

[Romans 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)

Likewise the Spirit also, &c.--or, "But after the like manner doth the
Spirit also help.

our infirmities--rather (according to the true reading), "our
infirmity"; not merely the one infirmity here specified, but the general
weakness of the spiritual life in its present state, of which one
example is here given.

for we know not what we should pray for as we ought--It is not the
proper matter of prayer that believers are at so much loss about, for
the fullest directions are given them on this head: but to ask for the
right things "as they ought" is the difficulty. This arises partly from
the dimness of our spiritual vision in the present veiled state, while
we have to "walk by faith, not by sight" (see on [Co1
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#009.md) and [Co2
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#007).md), and the large admixture of the
ideas and feelings which spring from the fleeting objects of sense that
there is in the very best views and affections of our renewed nature;
partly also from the necessary imperfection of all human language as a
vehicle for expressing the subtle spiritual feelings of the heart. In
these circumstances, how can it be but that much uncertainty should
surround all our spiritual exercises, and that in our nearest approaches
and in the freest outpourings of our hearts to our Father in heaven,
doubts should spring up within us whether our frame of mind in such
exercises is altogether befitting and well pleasing to God? Nor do these
anxieties subside, but rather deepen, with the depth and ripeness of our
spiritual experience.

but the Spirit itself--rather, "Himself." (See end of [Rom
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027).md).

maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered--that
is, which cannot be expressed in articulate language. Sublime and
affecting ideas, for which we are indebted to this passage alone! "As we
struggle to express in articulate language the desires of our hearts and
find that our deepest emotions are the most inexpressible, we 'groan'
under this felt inability. But not in vain are these groanings. For 'the
Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has
kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on
our part they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are
at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf."

[Romans 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 8:27</span></span>

And--rather, "But," inarticulate though these groanings be.

he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
because he--the Spirit

maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God--As the
Searcher of hearts, He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer,
and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He
draws forth within us, because that blessed Intercessor pleads by them
only for what God Himself designs to bestow.

Note, (1) Are believers "led by the Spirit of God" ([Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014).md)? How careful then should they be
not to "grieve the Holy Spirit of God" ([Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030).md)! Compare [Psa
32:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md) : "I will . . . guide thee with
Mine eye. Be not (then) as the horse, or as the mule," &c. (2) "The
spirit of bondage," to which many Protestants are "all their lifetime
subject," and the "doubtsome faith" which the Popish Church
systematically inculcates, are both rebuked here, being in direct and
painful contrast to that "spirit of adoption," and that witness of the
Spirit, along with our own spirit, to the fact of our sonship, which it
is here said the children of God, as such, enjoy ([Rom
8:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015)). (3.md) As suffering with Christ
is the ordained preparation for participating in this glory, so the
insignificance of the one as compared with the other cannot fail to
lighten the sense of it, however bitter and protracted ([Rom
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017)). (4.md) It cannot but swell the
heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature
has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only
awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a
corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying
life and unfading beauty ([Rom
8:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)). (5.md) It is not when
believers, through sinful "quenching of the Spirit," have the fewest and
faintest glimpses of heaven, that they sigh most fervently to be there;
but, on the contrary, when through the unobstructed working of the
Spirit in their hearts, "the first-fruits" of the glory to be revealed
are most largely and frequently tasted, then, and just for that reason,
is it that they "groan within themselves" for full redemption ([Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).md). For thus they reason: If such
be the drops, what will the ocean be? If thus "to see through a glass
darkly" be so very sweet, what will it be to "see face to face?" If when
"my Beloved stands behind our wall, looking forth at the windows,
showing Himself through the lattice" ([Sol
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009).md) --that thin veil which parts the
seen from the unseen--if He is even thus to me "Fairer than the children
of men," what shall He be when He stands confessed before my undazzled
vision, the Only-begotten of the Father in my own nature, and I shall be
like Him, for I shall see Him as He is? (6) "The patience of hope" ([Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003).md) is the fitting attitude for those
who with the joyful consciousness that they are already "saved" ([Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Tit
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md), have yet the painful
consciousness that they are saved but in part: or, "that being justified
by His grace, they are made (in the present state) heirs according to
the hope (only) of eternal life," [Tit
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#007.md) ([Rom
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024)). (7.md) As prayer is the breath
of the spiritual life, and the believer's only effectual relief under
the "infirmity" which attaches to his whole condition here below, how
cheering is it to be assured that the blessed Spirit, cognizant of it
all, comes in aid of it all; and in particular, that when believers,
unable to articulate their case before God, can at times do nothing but
lie "groaning" before the Lord, these inarticulate groanings are the
Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into "the ears of the Lord of
Sabaoth" their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of prayer as
the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf, and that they are
recognized by Him that sitteth on the Throne, as embodying only what His
own "will" determined before to bestow upon them ([Rom
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026))! (8.md) What a view do these two
verses ([Rom 8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md) give of the
relations subsisting between the Divine Persons in the economy of
redemption, and the harmony of their respective operations in the case
of each of the redeemed!

THIRD: Triumphant Summary of the Whole Argument ([Rom
8:28-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md).

[Romans 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 8:28</span></span>

And--or, "Moreover," or "Now"; noting a transition to a new particular.

we know, &c.--The order in the original is more striking: "We know that
to them that love God" (compare [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md); [Eph
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md); [Jam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md); [Jam
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005).md) "all things work together for
good \[even\] to them who are the called (rather, 'who are called')
according to His (eternal) purpose." Glorious assurance! And this, it
seems, was a "household word," a "known" thing, among believers. This
working of all things for good is done quite naturally to "them that
love God," because such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son
for them cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to
take in good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and
blood: and to them who are the called, according to "His purpose," all
things do in the same intelligible way "work together for good"; for,
even when "He hath His way in the whirlwind," they see "His chariot
paved with love" ([Sol 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#010).md). And
knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal "purpose" of love that
they have been "called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ"
([Co1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009).md), they naturally say within
themselves, "It cannot be that He 'of whom, and through whom, and to
whom are all things,' should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by
anything really adverse to us, or that He should not make all things,
dark as well as light, crooked as well as straight, to co-operate to the
furtherance and final completion of His high design."

[Romans 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 8:29</span></span>

For--as touching this "calling according to his purpose" ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md).

whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate--foreordain. In what sense
are we to take the word "foreknow" here? "Those who He foreknew would
repent and believe," say Pelagians of every age and every hue. But this
is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole spirit, and
even letter, of the apostle's teaching (see [Rom
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011.md); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009).md). In [Rom
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md), and [Psa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md), God's "knowledge" of His people
cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or
acquaintance with what is passing here below. Does "whom He did
foreknow," then, mean "whom He foreordained?" Scarcely, because both
"foreknowledge" and "foreordination" are here mentioned, and the one as
the cause of the other. It is difficult indeed for our limited minds to
distinguish them as states of the Divine Mind towards men; especially
since in [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md) "the counsel" is
put before "the foreknowledge of God," while in [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md) "election" is said to be
"according to the foreknowledge of God." But probably God's
foreknowledge of His own people means His "peculiar, gracious,
complacency in them," while His "predestinating" or "foreordaining" them
signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to "save them and call
them with an holy calling" ([Ti2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009).md).

to be conformed to the image of his Son--that is, to be His sons after
the pattern, model, or image of His Sonship in our nature.

that he might be the first-born among many brethren--"The First-born,"
the Son by nature; His "many brethren," sons by adoption: He, in the
Humanity of the Only-begotten of the Father, bearing our sins on the
accursed tree; they in that of mere men ready to perish by reason of
sin, but redeemed by His blood from condemnation and wrath, and
transformed into His likeness: He "the First-born from the dead"; they
"that sleep in Jesus," to be in due time "brought with Him"; "The
First-born," now "crowned with glory and honor"; His "many brethren,"
"when He shall appear, to be like Him, for they shall see Him as He is."

[Romans 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 8:30</span></span>

Moreover--"And," or "Now"; explanatory of [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md) --In "predestinating us to be
conformed to the image of His Son" in final glory, He settled all the
successive steps of it. Thus

whom he did predestinate, them he also called--The word "called" (as
HODGE and others truly observe) is never in the Epistles of the New
Testament applied to those who have only the outward invitation of the
Gospel (as in [Mat 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md); [Mat
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014).md). It always means "internally,
effectually, savingly called." It denotes the first great step in
personal salvation and answers to "conversion." Only the word conversion
expresses the change of character which then takes place, whereas this
"calling" expresses the divine authorship of the change, and the
sovereign power by which we are summoned, Matthew-like, Zaccheus-like,
out of our old, wretched, perishing condition, into a new, safe, blessed
life.

and whom he called--thus.

them he also justified--brought into the definite state of
reconciliation already so fully described.

and whom he justified, them he also glorified--brought to final glory
([Rom 8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).md). Noble climax, and so
rhythmically expressed! And all this is viewed as past; because,
starting from the past decree of "predestination to be conformed to the
image of God's Son" of which the other steps are but the successive
unfoldings--all is beheld as one entire, eternally completed salvation.

[Romans 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 8:31</span></span>

What shall we then say to these things?--"We can no farther go, think,
wish" \[BENGEL\]. This whole passage, to [Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md), and even to the end of the
chapter, strikes all thoughtful interpreters and readers, as
transcending almost every thing in language, while OLSHAUSEN notices the
"profound and colossal" character of the thought.

If God be for us, who can be against us?--If God be resolved and engaged
to bring us through, all our enemies must be His; and "Who would set the
briers and thorns against Him in battle? He would go through them. He
would burn them together" ([Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004).md).
What strong consolation is here! Nay, but the great Pledge of all has
already been given; for,

[Romans 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 8:32</span></span>

He--rather, "He surely." (It is a pity to lose the emphatic particle of
the original).

that spared not--"withheld not," "kept not back." This expressive
phrase, as well as the whole thought, is suggested by [Gen
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012.md), where Jehovah's touching
commendation of Abraham's conduct regarding his son Isaac seems designed
to furnish something like a glimpse into the spirit of His own act in
surrendering His own Son. "Take now (said the Lord to Abraham) thy son,
thine only, whom thou lovest, and . . . offer him for a burnt offering"
([Gen 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002).md); and only when Abraham had
all but performed that loftiest act of self-sacrifice, the Lord
interposed, saying, "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou HAST
NOT WITHHELD THY SON, THINE ONLY SON, from Me." In the light of this
incident, then, and of this language, our apostle can mean to convey
nothing less than this, that in "not sparing His own Son, but delivering
Him up," or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character,
a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice, which, though involving none of the
pain and none of the loss which are inseparable from the very idea of
self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real, but, on the contrary, as
far transcended any such acts of ours as His nature is above the
creature's. But this is inconceivable if Christ be not God's "own (or
proper) Son," partaker of His very nature, as really as Isaac was of his
father Abraham's. In that sense, certainly, the Jews charged our Lord
with making Himself "equal with God" (see on [Joh
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018).md), which He in reply forthwith
proceeded, not to disown, but to illustrate and confirm. Understand
Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of Scripture regarding it is
intelligible and harmonious; but take it to be an artificial
relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth,
or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all
of these together--and the passages which speak of it neither explain of
themselves nor harmonize with each other.

delivered him up--not to death merely (as many take it), for that is too
narrow an idea here, but "surrendered Him" in the most comprehensive
sense; compare [Joh 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md), "God so
loved the world that He GAVE His only-begotten Son."

for us all--that is, for all believers alike; as nearly every good
interpreter admits must be the meaning here.

how shall he not--how can we conceive that He should not.

with him also--rather, "also with Him." (The word "also" is often so
placed in our version as to obscure the sense; see on [Heb
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001).md).

freely give us all things?--all other gifts being not only immeasurably
less than this Gift of gifts, but virtually included in it.

[Romans 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 8:33</span></span>

Who shall lay anything to the charge of--or, "bring any charge against."

God's elect?--the first place in this Epistle where believers are styled
"the elect." In what sense this is meant will appear in next chapter.

[Romans 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">rom 8:34</span></span>

yea rather, that is risen again--to make good the purposes of His death.
Here, as in some other cases, the apostle delightfully corrects himself
(see [Gal 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md); and see on [Rom
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012).md); not meaning that the
resurrection of Christ was of more saving value than His death, but that
having "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself"--which though precious
to us was to Him of unmingled bitterness--it was incomparably more
delightful to think that He was again alive, and living to see to the
efficacy of His death in our behalf.

who is even--"also"

at the right hand of God--The right hand of the king was anciently the
seat of honor (compare [Sa1 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#025.md);
[Kg1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#019.md); [Psa
45:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#009).md), and denoted participation in
the royal power and glory ([Mat
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021).md). The classical writings contain
similar allusions. Accordingly Christ's sitting at the right hand of
God--predicted in [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md), and
historically referred to in [Mar
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md); [Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033.md); [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001.md); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md) --signifies the glory of the
exalted Son of man, and the power in the government of the world in
which He participates. Hence it is called "sitting on the right hand of
Power" ([Mat 26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064).md), and "sitting on
the right hand of the Majesty on high" ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md) \[PHILIPPI\].

who also maketh intercession for us--using all His boundless interest
with God in our behalf. This is the top of the climax. "His Session at
God's right hand denotes His power to save us; His Intercession, His
will to do it" \[BENGEL\]. But how are we to conceive of this
intercession? Not certainly as of one pleading "on bended knees and with
outstretched arms," to use the expressive language of CALVIN. But yet,
neither is it merely a figurative intimation that the power of Christ's
redemption is continually operative \[THOLUCK\], or merely to show the
fervor and vehemence of His love for us \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. It cannot be
taken to mean less than this: that the glorified Redeemer, conscious of
His claims, expressly signifies His will that the efficacy of His death
should be made good to the uttermost, and signifies it in some such
royal style as we find Him employing in that wonderful Intercessory
Prayer which He spoke as from within the veil (see on [Joh
17:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#011).md): "Father, I WILL that they
also whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am" (see on [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md). But in what form this will is
expressed is as undiscoverable as it is unimportant.

[Romans 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">rom 8:35</span></span>

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?--This does not mean "our
love to Christ," as if, Who shall hinder us from loving Christ? but
"Christ's love to us," as is clear from the closing words of the
chapter, which refer to the same subject. Nor would the other sense
harmonize with the scope of the chapter, which is to exhibit the ample
ground of the believer's confidence in Christ. "It is no ground of
confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake
Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that
His love will never change" \[HODGE\].

shall tribulation, &c.--"None of these, nor all together, how terrible
soever to the flesh, are tokens of God's wrath, or the least ground for
doubt of His love. From whom could such a question come better than from
one who had himself for Christ's sake endured so much? (See 2Co.
11:11-33; [Co1 4:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010).md). The apostle
says not (remarks CALVIN nobly) "What," but "Who," just as if all
creatures and all afflictions were so many gladiators taking arms
against the Christians \[THOLUCK\].

[Romans 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md)

As it is written, For thy sake, &c.-- ([Psa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022).md) --quoted as descriptive of what
God's faithful people may expect from their enemies at any period when
their hatred of righteousness is roused, and there is nothing to
restrain it (see [Gal 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md).

[Romans 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">rom 8:37</span></span>

Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that
loved us--not, "We are so far from being conquered by them, that they do
us much good" \[HODGE\]; for though this be true, the word means simply,
"We are pre-eminently conquerors." See on [Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md). And so far are they from
"separating us from Christ's love," that it is just "through Him that
loved us" that we are victorious over them.

[Romans 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">rom 8:38</span></span>

For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers--whether good or bad. But as the bad are not
called "angels," or "principalities," or "powers," save with some
addition to show that such are meant ([Mat
25:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015.md); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md); [Pe2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004.md) --except perhaps [Co1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#003).md), probably the good are meant
here, but merely as the same apostle supposes an angel from heaven to
preach a false gospel. (So the best interpreters).

nor things present, nor things to come--no condition of the present life
and none of the unknown possibilities of the life to come.

[Romans 8:39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">rom 8:39</span></span>

nor any other creature--rather, "created thing"--any other thing in the
whole created universe of God

shall be able to separate us, &c.--"All the terms here are to be taken
in their most general sense, and need no closer definition. The
indefinite expressions are meant to denote all that can be thought of,
and are only a rhetorical paraphrase of the conception of allness"
\[OLSHAUSEN\].

from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord--Thus does this
wonderful chapter, with which the argument of the Epistle properly
closes, leave us who are "justified by faith" in the arms of everlasting
Love, whence no hostile power or conceivable event can ever tear us.
"Behold what manner of love is this?" And "what manner of persons ought
we to be," who are thus "blessed with all spiritual blessings in
Christ?"

Note, (1) There is a glorious consistency between the eternal purposes
of God and the free agency of men, though the link of connection is
beyond human, perhaps created, apprehension ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)). (2.md) How ennobling is the
thought that the complicated movements of the divine government of the
world are all arranged in expressed furtherance of the "good" of God's
chosen ([Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028))! (3.md) To whatever
conformity to the Son of God in dignity and glory, believers are or
shall hereafter be raised, it will be the joy of everyone of them, as it
is most fitting, "that in all things He should have the pre-eminence"
([Col 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018).md), ([Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)). (4.md) "As there is a beautiful
harmony and necessary connection between the several doctrines of grace,
so must there be a like harmony in the character of the Christian. He
cannot experience the joy and confidence flowing from his election
without the humility which" the consideration of its being gratuitous
must produce; nor can he have the peace of one who is justified without
the holiness of one who is saved" ([Rom
8:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)) \[HODGE\]. (5.md) However
difficult it may be for finite minds to comprehend the emotions of the
Divine Mind, let us never for a moment doubt that in "not sparing His
own Son, but delivering Him up for us all," God made a real sacrifice of
all that was dearest to His heart, and that in so doing He meant for
ever to assure His people that all other things which they
need--inasmuch as they are nothing to this stupendous gift, and indeed
but the necessary sequel of it--will in due time be forthcoming ([Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)). (6.md) In return for such a
sacrifice on God's part, what can be considered too great on ours? (7)
If there could be any doubt as to the meaning of the all-important word
"JUSTIFICATION" in this Epistle--whether, as the Church of Rome teaches,
and many others affirm, it means "infusing righteousness into the
unholy, so as to make them righteous," or, according to Protestant
teaching, "absolving, acquitting, or pronouncing righteous the guilty"
[Rom 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md) ought to set such doubt
entirely at rest. For the apostle's question in this verse is, "Who
shall bring a charge against God's elect?" In other words, "Who shall
pronounce" or "hold them guilty?" seeing that "God justifies" them:
showing beyond all doubt, that to "justify" was intended to express
precisely the opposite of "holding guilty"; and consequently (as CALVIN
triumphantly argues) that it means "to absolve from the charge of
guilt." (8) If there could be any reasonable doubt in what light the
death of Christ is to be regarded in this Epistle, [Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md) ought to set that doubt entirely
at rest. For there the apostle's question is, Who shall "condemn" God's
elect, since "Christ died" for them; showing beyond all doubt (as
PHILIPPI justly argues) that it was the expiatory (character of that
death which the apostle had in view). (9) What an affecting view of the
love of Christ does it give us to learn that His greatest nearness to
God and most powerful interest with Him--as "seated on His right
hand"--is employed in behalf of His people here below ([Rom
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034))! (10.md) "The whole universe, with
all that it contains, so far as it is good, is the friend and ally of
the Christian; and, so far as it is evil, is more than a conquered foe"
([Rom 8:35-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035)) \[HODGE\]. (11.md) Are we
who "have tasted that the Lord is gracious," both "kept by the power of
God through faith unto salvation" ([Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).md), and embraced in the arms of
Invincible Love? Then surely, while "building ourselves up on our most
holy faith," and "praying in the Holy Ghost," only the more should we
feel constrained to "keep ourselves in the love of God, looking for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life" ([Jde
1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020).md).
