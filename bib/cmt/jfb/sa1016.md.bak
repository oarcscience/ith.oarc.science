### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 16:1</span></span>

SAMUEL SENT BY GOD TO BETHLEHEM. ([Sa1
16:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001).md)

the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul--Samuel's
grief on account of Saul's rejection, accompanied, doubtless, by earnest
prayers for his restitution, showed the amiable feelings of the man; but
they were at variance with his public duty as a prophet. The declared
purpose of God to transfer the kingdom of Israel into other hands than
Saul's was not an angry menace, but a fixed and immutable decree; so
that Samuel ought to have sooner submitted to the peremptory
manifestation of the divine will. But to leave him no longer room to
doubt of its being unalterable, he was sent on a private mission to
anoint a successor to Saul (see on [Sa1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#001).md). The immediate designation of a
king was of the greatest importance for the interests of the nation in
the event of Saul's death, which, to this time, was dreaded; it would
establish David's title and comfort the minds of Samuel and other good
men with a right settlement, whatever contingency might happen.

I have provided me a king--The language is remarkable, and intimates a
difference between this and the former king. Saul was the people's
choice, the fruit of their wayward and sinful desires for their own
honor and aggrandizement. The next was to be a king who would consult
the divine glory, and selected from that tribe to which the pre-eminence
had been early promised ([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 16:2</span></span>

How can I go?--This is another instance of human infirmity in Samuel.
Since God had sent him on this mission, He would protect him in the
execution.

I am come to sacrifice--It seems to have been customary with Samuel to
do this in the different circuits to which he went, that he might
encourage the worship of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 16:3</span></span>

call Jesse to the sacrifice--that is, the social feast that followed the
peace offering. Samuel, being the offerer, had a right to invite any
guest he pleased.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 16:4</span></span>

the elders of the town trembled at his coming--Beth-lehem was an obscure
town, and not within the usual circuit of the judge. The elders were
naturally apprehensive, therefore, that his arrival was occasioned by
some extraordinary reason, and that it might entail evil upon their
town, in consequence of the estrangement between Samuel and the king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 16:5</span></span>

sanctify yourselves--by the preparations described ([Exo
19:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#014).md). The elders were to sanctify
themselves. Samuel himself took the greatest care in the sanctification
of Jesse's family. Some, however, think that the former were invited
only to join in the sacrifice, while the family of Jesse were invited by
themselves to the subsequent feast.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 16:6</span></span>

Samuel said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him--Here Samuel, in
consequence of taking his impressions from the external appearance,
falls into the same error as formerly ([Sa1
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#024).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 16:11</span></span>

HE ANOINTS DAVID. ([Sa1 16:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011).md)

There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the
sheep--Jesse having evidently no idea of David's wisdom and bravery,
spoke of him as the most unfit. God, in His providence, so ordered it,
that the appointment of David might the more clearly appear to be a
divine purpose, and not the design either of Samuel or Jesse. David
having not been sanctified with the rest of his family, it is probable
that he returned to his pastoral duties the moment the special business
on which he had been summoned was done.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 16:12</span></span>

he was ruddy, &c.--JOSEPHUS says that David was ten, while most modern
commentators are of the opinion that he must have been fifteen years of
age.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 16:13</span></span>

Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him--This transaction
must have been strictly private.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sa1 16:14</span></span>

The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the
Lord troubled him--His own gloomy reflections, the consciousness that he
had not acted up to the character of an Israelitish king, the loss of
his throne, and the extinction of his royal house, made him jealous,
irritable, vindictive, and subject to fits of morbid melancholy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 16:19</span></span>

Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David--In the East
the command of a king is imperative; and Jesse, however reluctant and
alarmed, had no alternative but to comply.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 16:20</span></span>

Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and
sent them . . . unto Saul--as a token of homage and respect.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 16:21</span></span>

David came to Saul--Providence thus prepared David for his destiny, by
placing him in a way to become acquainted with the manners of the court,
the business of government, and the general state of the kingdom.

became his armour-bearer--This choice, as being an expression of the
king's partiality, shows how honorable the office was held to be.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">sa1 16:23</span></span>

David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and
was well--The ancients believed that music had a mysterious influence in
healing mental disorders.
