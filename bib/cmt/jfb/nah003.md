### [Nahum Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md)

[Nahum 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">nah 3:1</span></span>

REPETITION OF NINEVEH'S DOOM, WITH NEW FEATURES; THE CAUSE IS HER
TYRANNY, RAPINE, AND CRUELTY: NO-AMMON'S FORTIFICATIONS DID NOT SAVE
HER; IT IS VAIN, THEREFORE, FOR NINEVEH TO THINK HER DEFENSES WILL
SECURE HER AGAINST GOD'S SENTENCE. (Nah. 3:1-19)

the bloody city!--literally, "city of blood," namely, shed by Nineveh;
just so now her own blood is to be shed.

robbery--violence \[MAURER\]. Extortion \[GROTIUS\].

the prey departeth not--Nineveh never ceases to live by rapine. Or, the
Hebrew verb is transitive, "she (Nineveh) does not make the prey
depart"; she ceases not to plunder.

[Nahum 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">nah 3:2</span></span>

The reader is transported into the midst of the fight (compare [Jer
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003).md). The "noise of the whips" urging
on the horses (in the chariots) is heard, and of "the rattling of the
wheels" of war chariots, and the "horses" are seen "prancing," and the
"chariots jumping," &c.

[Nahum 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">nah 3:3</span></span>

horseman--distinct from "the horses" (in the chariots, [Nah
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002).md).

lifteth up--denoting readiness for fight \[EWALD\]. GESENIUS translates,
"lifteth up (literally, 'makes to ascend') his horse." Similarly MAURER,
"makes his horse to rise up on his hind feet." Vulgate translates,
"ascending," that is, making his horse to advance up to the assault.
This last is perhaps better than English Version.

the bright sword and the glittering spear--literally, "the glitter of
the sword and the flash of the spear!" This, as well as the translation,
"the horseman advancing up," more graphically presents the battle scene
to the eye.

they stumble upon their corpses--The Medo-Babylonian enemy stumble upon
the Assyrian corpses.

[Nahum 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">nah 3:4</span></span>

Because of the multitude of the whoredoms--This assigns the reason for
Nineveh's destruction.

of the well-favoured harlot--As Assyria was not a worshipper of the true
God, "whoredoms" cannot mean, as in the case of Israel, apostasy to the
worship of false gods; but, her harlot-like artifices whereby she
allured neighboring states so as to subject them to herself. As the
unwary are allured by the "well-favored harlot's" looks, so Israel,
Judah (for example, under Ahaz, who, calling to his aid Tiglath-pileser,
was made tributary by him, [Kg2
16:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md), and other nations, were
tempted by the plausible professions of Assyria, and by the lure of
commerce ([Rev 18:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002).md), to trust her.

witchcrafts-- ([Isa 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#009.md), [Isa
47:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#012).md). Alluding to the love
incantations whereby harlots tried to dement and ensnare youths;
answering to the subtle machinations whereby Assyria attracted nations
to her.

selleth--deprives of their liberty; as slaves used to be sold: and in
other property also sale was a usual mode of transfer. MAURER
understands it of depriving nations of their freedom, and literally
selling them as slaves to distant peoples ([Joe
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#002.md), [Joe
3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#006).md). But elsewhere there is no
evidence that the Assyrians did this.

families--peoples.

[Nahum 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">nah 3:5</span></span>

I will discover thy skirts upon thy face--that is, discover thy
nakedness by throwing up thy skirts upon thy face (the greatest possible
insult), pulling them up as as high as thy head ([Jer
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#022.md); [Eze
16:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#037).md). I will treat thee not as a
matron, but as a harlot whose shame is exposed; her gaudy finery being
lifted up off her ([Isa 47:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#002).md). So
Nineveh shall be stripped of all her glory and defenses on which she
prides herself.

[Nahum 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">nah 3:6</span></span>

cast abominable filth upon thee--as infamous harlots used to be treated.

gazing stock--exposed to public ignominy as a warning to others ([Eze
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017).md).

[Nahum 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">nah 3:7</span></span>

all . . . that look upon thee--when thou hast been made "a gazing stock"
([Nah 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#006).md).

shall flee from thee--as a thing horrible to look upon. Compare
"standing afar off," [Rev 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#010.md).

whence shall I seek comforters for thee?--Compare [Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019.md), which Nahum had before his
mind.

[Nahum 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">nah 3:8</span></span>

populous No--rather, as Hebrew, "No-ammon," the Egyptian name for Thebes
in Upper Egypt; meaning the portion or possession of Ammon, the Egyptian
Jupiter (whence the Greeks called the city Diospolis), who was
especially worshipped there. The Egyptian inscriptions call the god
Amon-re, that is, Amon the Sun; he is represented as a human figure with
a ram's head, seated on a chair ([Jer
46:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#025.md); [Eze
30:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#014).md). The blow inflicted on
No-ammon, described in [Nah 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md), was
probably by the Assyrian Sargon (see on [Isa
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#001.md); [Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001).md). As Thebes, with all her
resources, was overcome by Assyria, so Assyrian Nineveh, notwithstanding
all her might, in her turn, shall be overcome by Babylon. English
Version, "populous," if correct, implies that No's large population did
not save her from destruction.

situate among the rivers--probably the channels into which the Nile here
divides (compare [Isa 19:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006).md). Thebes
lay on both sides of the river. It was famed in HOMER'S time for its
hundred gates \[Iliad, 9.381\]. Its ruins still describe a circumference
of twenty-seven miles. Of them the temples of Luxor and Karnak, east of
the river, are most famous. The colonnade of the former, and the grand
hall of the latter, are of stupendous dimensions. One wall still
represents the expedition of Shishak against Jerusalem under Rehoboam
([Kg1 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#025.md); [Ch2
12:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002).md).

whose . . . wall was from the sea--that is, rose up "from the sea."
MAURER translates, "whose wall consisted of the sea." But this would be
a mere repetition of the former clause. The Nile is called a sea, from
its appearance in the annual flood ([Isa
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005).md).

[Nahum 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">nah 3:9</span></span>

Ethiopia--Hebrew, Cush. Ethiopia is thought at this time to have been
mistress of Upper Egypt.

Egypt--Lower Egypt.

her strength--her safeguard as an ally.

it was infinite--The resources of these, her allies, were endless.

Put--or Phut ([Gen 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006).md); descended
from Ham ([Eze 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010).md). From a root
meaning a bow; as they were famed as archers \[GESENIUS\]. Probably west
of Lower Egypt. JOSEPHUS \[Antiquities, 1:6.2\] identifies it with
Mauritania (compare [Jer 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009.md), Margin;
[Eze 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#005).md).

Lubim--the Libyans, whose capital was Cyrene; extending along the
Mediterranean west of Egypt ([Ch2
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003.md); [Ch2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#008.md); [Act
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#010).md). As, however, the Lubim are
always connected with the Egyptians and Ethiopians, they are perhaps
distinct from the Libyans. The Lubim were probably at first wandering
tribes, who afterwards were settled under Carthage in the region of
Cyrene, under the name Libyans.

thy--No's.

helpers--literally, "in thy help," that is, among thy auxiliaries.

[Nahum 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">nah 3:10</span></span>

Notwithstanding all her might, she was overcome.

cast lots for her honourable men--They divided them among themselves by
lot, as slaves ([Joe 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003).md).

[Nahum 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">nah 3:11</span></span>

drunken--made to drink of the cup of Jehovah's wrath ([Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), [Isa
51:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md); [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md).

hid--covered out of sight: a prediction remarkably verified in the state
in which the ruins of Nineveh have been found \[G. V. SMITH\]. But as
"hid" precedes "seek strength," &c., it rather refers to Nineveh's state
when attacked by her foe: "Thou who now so vauntest thyself, shalt be
compelled to seek a hiding-place from the foe" \[CALVIN\]; or, shalt be
neglected and slighted by all \[MAURER\].

seek strength because of the enemy--Thou too, like Thebes ([Nah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#009).md), shalt have recourse to other
nations for help against thy Medo-Babylonian enemy.

[Nahum 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">nah 3:12</span></span>

thy strongholds--on the borders of Assyria, protecting the approaches to
Nineveh: "the gates of thy land" ([Nah
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013).md).

fig trees with the first ripe figs--expressing the rapidity and ease of
the capture of Nineveh (compare [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004.md); [Rev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#013).md).

[Nahum 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">nah 3:13</span></span>

thy people--thy soldiers.

women--unable to fight for thee ([Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md); [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037.md); [Jer
51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030).md).

gates on thy land--the fortified passes or entrances to the region of
Nineveh (compare [Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007).md). Northeast
of Nineveh there were hills affording a natural barrier against an
invader; the guarded passes through these are probably "the gates of the
land" meant.

fire shall devour thy bars--the "bars" of the fortresses at the passes
into Assyria. So in Assyrian remains the Assyrians themselves are
represented as setting fire to the gates of a city \[BONOMI, Nineveh,
pp. 194, 197\].

[Nahum 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">nah 3:14</span></span>

Ironical exhortation to Nineveh to defend herself.

Draw . . . waters--so as not to be without water for drinking, in the
event of being cut off by the besiegers from the fountains.

make strong the brick-kiln--or "repair" so as to have a supply of bricks
formed of kiln-burnt clay, to repair breaches in the ramparts, or to
build new fortifications inside when the outer ones are taken by the
foe.

[Nahum 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">nah 3:15</span></span>

There--in the very scene of thy great preparations for defense; and
where thou now art so secure.

fire--even as at the former destruction; Sardanapalus (Pul?) perished
with all his household in the conflagration of his palace, having in
despair set it on fire, the traces of which are still remaining.

cankerworm--"the licking locust" \[HENDERSON\].

make thyself many as the locusts--"the swarming locusts" \[HENDERSON\];
that is, however "many" be thy forces, like those of "the swarming
locusts," or the "licking locusts," yet the foe shall consume thee as
the "licking locust" licks up all before it.

[Nahum 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">nah 3:16</span></span>

multiplied thy merchants-- ([Eze
27:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#023).md). Nineveh, by large canals,
had easy access to Babylon; and it was one of the great routes for the
people of the west and northwest to that city; lying on the Tigris it
had access to the sea. The PhÅ“nicians carried its wares everywhere.
Hence its merchandise is so much spoken of.

the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away--that is, spoiled thy
merchants. The "cankerworm," or licking locust, answers to the
Medo-Babylonian invaders of Nineveh \[G. V. SMITH\]. CALVIN explains
less probably, "Thy merchants spoiled many regions; but the same shall
befall them as befalls locusts, they in a moment shall be scattered and
flee away." MAURER, somewhat similarly, "The licking locust puts off
(the envelope in which his wings had been folded), and teeth away" ([Nah
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#009.md); compare [Joe
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004).md). The Hebrew has ten different
names for the locust, so destructive was it.

[Nahum 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">nah 3:17</span></span>

Thy crowned--Thy princes ([Rev 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#007).md).
The king's nobles and officers wore the tiara, as well as the king;
hence they are called here "thy crowned ones."

as the locusts--as many as the swarming locusts.

thy captains--Tiphsar, an Assyrian word; found also in [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md), meaning satraps \[MICHAELIS\];
or rather, "military leaders" \[MAURER\]. The last syllable, sar means a
"prince," and is found in Belshaz-zar, Nabopolas-sar, Nebuchadnez-zar.

as the great grasshoppers--literally, "as the locust of locusts," that
is, the largest locust. MAURER translates, "as many as locusts upon
locusts," that is, swarms of locusts. Hebrew idiom favors English
Version.

in the hedges in the cold--Cold deprives the locust of the power of
flight; so they alight in cold weather and at night, but when warmed by
the sun soon "flee away." So shall the Assyrian multitudes suddenly
disappear, not leaving a trace behind (compare PLINY, Natural History,
11.29).

[Nahum 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">nah 3:18</span></span>

Thy shepherds--that is, Thy leaders.

slumber--are carelessly secure \[MAURER\]. Rather, "lie in death's
sleep, having been slain" \[JEROME\] ([Exo
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016.md); [Psa
76:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#006).md).

shall dwell in the dust-- ([Psa 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#005.md);
[Psa 94:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#017).md).

thy people is scattered--the necessary consequence of their leaders
being laid low ([Kg1 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#017).md).

[Nahum 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">nah 3:19</span></span>

bruit--the report.

clap the hands--with joy at thy fall. The sole descendants of the
ancient Assyrians and Babylonians in the whole country are the Nestorian
Christians, who speak a Chaldean language \[LAYARD\].

upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?--implying God's
long forbearance, and the consequent enormity of Assyria's guilt,
rendering her case one that admitted no hope of restoration.
