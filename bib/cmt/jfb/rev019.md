### [Revelation Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 19:1</span></span>

THE CHURCH'S THANKSGIVING IN HEAVEN FOR THE JUDGMENT ON THE HARLOT. THE
MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB: THE SUPPER: THE BRIDE'S PREPARATION: JOHN IS
FORBIDDEN TO WORSHIP THE ANGEL: THE LORD AND HIS HOSTS COME FORTH FOR
WAR: THE BEAST AND THE FALSE PROPHET CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE: THE
KINGS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS SLAIN BY THE SWORD OUT OF CHRIST'S MOUTH.
(Rev. 19:1-21)

As in the case of the opening of the prophecy, [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md), &c.; so now, at one of the great
closing events seen in vision, the judgment on the harlot (described in
Rev. 18:1-24), there is a song of praise in heaven to God: compare [Rev
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#010.md), &c., toward the close of the
seals, and [Rev 11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md), at the close
of the trumpets: [Rev 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md), at the
saints' victory over the beast.

And--so ANDREAS. But A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic omit.

a great voice--A, B, C, Vulgate, Coptic, and ANDREAS read, "as it were a
great voice." What a contrast to the lamentations Rev. 18:1-24! Compare
[Jer 51:48](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#048.md). The great manifestation of
God's power in destroying Babylon calls forth a great voice of praise in
heaven.

people--Greek, "multitude."

Alleluia--Hebrew, "Praise ye JAH," or JEHOVAH: here first used in
Revelation, whence ELLICOTT infers the Jews bear a prominent part in
this thanksgiving. JAH is not a contraction of "JEHOVAH," as it
sometimes occurs jointly with the latter. It means "He who Is": whereas
Jehovah is "He who will be, is, and was." It implies God experienced as
a PRESENT help; so that "Hallelujah," says KIMCHI in BENGEL, is found
first in the Psalms on the destruction of the ungodly. "Hallelu-Jah"
occurs four times in this passage. Compare [Psa
149:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#004.md), which is plainly parallel,
and indeed identical in many of the phrases, as well as the general
idea. Israel, especially, will join in the Hallelujah, when "her warfare
is accomplished" and her foe destroyed.

Salvation, &c.--Greek, "The salvation . . . the glory . . . the power."

and honour--so Coptic. But A, B, C, and Syriac omit.

unto the Lord our God--so ANDREAS. But A, B, C, and Coptic read, "(Is)
of our God," that is, belongs to Him.

[Revelation 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 19:2</span></span>

which did corrupt the earth--Greek, "used to corrupt" continually.
"Instead of opposing and lessening, she promoted the sinful life and
decay of the world by her own earthliness, allowing the salt to lose its
savor" \[AUBERLEN\].

avenged--Greek, "exacted in retribution." A particular application of
the principle ([Gen 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005).md).

blood of his servants--literally shed by the Old Testament adulterous
Church, and by the New Testament apostate Church; also virtually, though
not literally, by all who, though called Christians, hate their brother,
or love not the brethren of Christ, but shrink from the reproach of the
cross, and show unkindness towards those who bear it.

[Revelation 19:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 19:3</span></span>

again--Greek, "a second time."

rose up--Greek, "goeth up."

for ever and ever--Greek, "to the ages of the ages."

[Revelation 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 19:4</span></span>

beasts--rather, "living creatures."

sat--Greek, "sitteth."

[Revelation 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 19:5</span></span>

out of--Greek, "out from the throne" in A, B, C.

Praise our God--Compare the solemn act of praise performed by the
Levites, [Ch1 16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md); [Ch1
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1023.htm#005.md), especially when the house of God
was filled with the divine glory ([Ch2
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013).md).

both--omitted in A, B, C, Vulgate, Coptic, and Syriac. Translate as
Greek, "the small and the great."

[Revelation 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 19:6</span></span>

many waters--Contrast the "many waters" on which the whore sitteth ([Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md). This verse is the hearty
response to the stirring call, "Alleluia! Praise our God" ([Rev
19:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#004).md).

the Lord God omnipotent--Greek, "the Omnipotent."

reigneth--literally, "reigned": hence reigneth once for all. His reign
is a fact already established. Babylon, the harlot, was one great
hindrance to His reign being recognized. Her overthrow now clears the
way for His advent to reign; therefore, not merely Rome, but the whole
of Christendom in so far as it is carnal and compromised Christ for the
world, is comprehended in the term "harlot." The beast hardly arises
when he at once "goeth into perdition": so that Christ is prophetically
considered as already reigning, so soon does His advent follow the
judgment on the harlot.

[Revelation 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 19:7</span></span>

glad . . . rejoice--Greek, "rejoice . . . exult."

give--so B and ANDREAS. But A reads, "we will give."

glory--Greek, "the glory."

the marriage of the Lamb is come--The full and final consummation is at
[Rev 21:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md), &c. Previously there must
be the overthrow of the beast, &c., at the Lord's coming, the binding of
Satan, the millennial reign, the loosing of Satan and his last
overthrow, and the general judgment. The elect-Church, the heavenly
Bride, soon after the destruction of the harlot, is transfigured at the
Lord's coming, and joins with Him in His triumph over the beast. On the
emblem of the heavenly Bridegroom and Bride, compare [Mat
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#002.md); [Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006.md), [Mat
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#010.md); [Co2
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002.md). Perfect union with Him
personally, and participation in His holiness; joy, glory, and kingdom,
are included in this symbol of "marriage"; compare Song of Solomon
everywhere. Besides the heavenly Bride, the transfigured, translated,
and risen Church, reigning over the earth with Christ, there is also the
earthly bride, Israel, in the flesh, never yet divorced, though for a
time separated, from her divine husband, who shall then be reunited to
the Lord, and be the mother Church of the millennial earth,
Christianized through her. Note, we ought, as Scripture does, restrict
the language drawn from marriage-love to the Bride, the Church as a
whole; not use it as individuals in our relation to Christ, which Rome
does in the case of her nuns. Individually, believers are
effectually-called guests; collectively, they constitute the bride. The
harlot divides her affections among many lovers: the bride gives hers
exclusively to Christ.

[Revelation 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 19:8</span></span>

granted--Though in one sense she "made herself ready," having by the
Spirit's work in her put on "the wedding garment," yet in the fullest
sense it is not she, but her Lord, who makes her ready by "granting to
her that she be arrayed in fine linen." It is He who, by giving Himself
for her, presents her to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, but
holy and without blemish. It is He also who sanctifies her, naturally
vile and without beauty, with the washing of water by the word, and puts
His own comeliness on her, which thus becomes hers.

clean and white--so ANDREAS. But A and B transpose. Translate, "bright
and pure"; at once brilliantly splendid and spotless as in the bride
herself.

righteousness--Greek, "righteousnesses"; distributively used. Each saint
must have this righteousness: not merely be justified, as if the
righteousness belonged to the Church in the aggregate; the saints
together have righteousnesses; namely, He is accounted as "the Lord our
righteousness" to each saint on his believing, their robes being made
white in the blood of the Lamb. The righteousness of the saint is not,
as ALFORD erroneously states, inherent, but is imputed: if it were
otherwise, Christ would be merely enabling the sinner to justify
himself. [Rom 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018.md) is decisive on
this. Compare Article XI, Church of England. The justification already
given to the saints in title and unseen possession, is now GIVEN them in
manifestation: they openly walk with Christ in white. To this, rather
than to their primary justification on earth, the reference is here.
Their justification before the apostate world, which had persecuted
them, contrasts with the judgment and condemnation of the harlot. "Now
that the harlot has fallen, the woman triumphs" \[AUBERLEN\]. Contrast
with the pure fine linen (indicating the simplicity and purity) of the
bride, the tawdry ornamentation of the harlot. Babylon, the apostate
Church, is the antithesis to new Jerusalem, the transfigured Church of
God. The woman ([Rev 12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md), the
harlot ([Rev 17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md), the bride ([Rev
19:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#001).md), are the three leading
aspects of the Church.

[Revelation 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 19:9</span></span>

He--God by His angel saith unto me.

called--effectually, not merely externally. The "unto," or into," seems
to express this: not merely invited to (Greek, "epi"), but called INTO,
so as to be partakers of (Greek, "eis"); compare [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md).

marriage supper--Greek, "the supper of the marriage." Typified by the
Lord's Supper.

true--Greek, "genuine"; veritable sayings which shall surely be
fulfilled, namely, all the previous revelations.

[Revelation 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 19:10</span></span>

at--Greek, "before." John's intending to worship the angel here, as in
[Rev 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md), on having revealed to him
the glory of the new Jerusalem, is the involuntary impulse of adoring
joy at so blessed a prospect. It forms a marked contrast to the
sorrowful wonder with which he had looked on the Church in her apostasy
as the harlot ([Rev 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#006).md). It
exemplifies the corrupt tendencies of our fallen nature that even John,
an apostle, should have all but fallen into "voluntary humility and
worshipping of angels," which Paul warns us against.

and of thy brethren--that is, a fellow servant of thy brethren.

have the testimony of Jesus--(See on [Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017).md).

the testimony of--that is, respecting Jesus.

is the spirit of prophecy--is the result of the same spirit of prophecy
in you as in myself. We angels, and you apostles, all alike have the
testimony of (bear testimony concerning) Jesus by the operation of one
and the same Spirit, who enables me to show you these revelations and
enables you to record them: wherefore we are fellow servants, not I your
lord to be worshipped by you. Compare [Rev
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009.md), "I am fellow servant of thee and
of thy brethren the prophets"; whence the "FOR the testimony," &c.,
here, may be explained as giving the reason for his adding "and (fellow
servant) of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus." I mean, of
the prophets; "for it is of Jesus that thy brethren, the prophets,
testify by the Spirit in them." A clear condemnation of Romish
invocation of saints as if they were our superiors to be adored.

[Revelation 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 19:11</span></span>

behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him--identical with [Rev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002.md). Here as there he comes forth
"conquering and to conquer." Compare the ass-colt on which He rode into
Jerusalem ([Mat 21:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#001).md). The horse was
used for war: and here He is going forth to war with the beast. The ass
is for peace. His riding on it into Jerusalem is an earnest of His reign
in Jerusalem over the earth, as the Prince of peace, after all hostile
powers have been overthrown. When the security of the world power, and
the distress of the people of God, have reached the highest point, the
Lord Jesus shall appear visibly from heaven to put an end to the whole
course of the world, and establish His kingdom of glory. He comes to
judge with vengeance the world power, and to bring to the Church
redemption, transfiguration, and power over the world. Distinguish
between this coming ([Mat 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#027.md), [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md), [Mat
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md), [Mat
24:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#039); Greek, "parousia".md) and the end,
or final judgment ([Mat 25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031.md); [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023).md). Powerful natural phenomena
shall accompany His advent \[AUBERLEN\].

[Revelation 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 19:12</span></span>

Identifying Him with the Son of man similarly described, [Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md).

many crowns--Greek, "diadems": not merely (Greek, "stephanoi") garlands
of victory, but royal crowns, as KING OF KINGS. Christ's diadem
comprises all the diadems of the earth and of heavenly powers too.
Contrast the papal tiara composed of three diadems. Compare also the
little horn (Antichrist) that overcomes the three horns or kingdoms,
[Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md) (QuÃ&brvbr;re, the Papacy? or
some three kingdoms that succeed the papacy, which itself, as a temporal
kingdom, was made up at first of three kingdoms, the exarchate of
Ravenna, the kingdom of the Lombards, and the state of Rome, obtained by
Pope Zachary and Stephen II from Pepin, the usurper of the French
dominion). Also, the seven crowns (diadems) on the seven heads of the
dragon ([Rev 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003).md), and ten diadems on
the ten heads of the beast. These usurpers claim the diadems which
belong to Christ alone.

he had a name written--B and Syriac insert, "He had names written, and a
name written," &c., meaning that the names of the dominion which each
diadem indicated were written on them severally. But A, Vulgate, ORIGEN,
and CYPRIAN omits the words, as English Version.

name . . . that no man knew but . . . himself-- ([Jdg
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md); [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), [Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md); [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002).md). The same is said of the "new
name" of believers. In this, as in all other respects, the disciple is
made like his Lord. The Lord's own "new name" is to be theirs, and to be
"in their foreheads"; whence we may infer that His as yet unknown name
also is written on His forehead; as the high priest had "Holiness to the
Lord" inscribed on the miter on his brow. John saw it as "written," but
knew not its meaning. It is, therefore, a name which in all its glorious
significancy can be only understood when the union of His saints with
Him, and His and their joint triumph and reign, shall be perfectly
manifested at the final consummation.

[Revelation 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 19:13</span></span>

vesture dipped in blood-- [Isa 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md) is
alluded to here, and in [Rev 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md),
end. There the blood is not His own, but that of His foes. So here the
blood on His "vesture," reminding us of His own blood shed for even the
ungodly who trample on it, is a premonition of the shedding of their
blood in righteous retribution. He sheds the blood, not of the godly, as
the harlot and beast did, but of the blood-stained ungodly, including
them both.

The Word of God--who made the world, is He also who under the same
character and attributes shall make it anew. His title, Son of God, is
applicable in a lower sense, also to His people; but "the Word of God"
indicates His incommunicable Godhead, joined to His manhood, which He
shall then manifest in glory. "The Bride does not fear the Bridegroom;
her love casteth out fear. She welcomes Him; she cannot be happy but at
His side. The Lamb \[[Rev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md), the
aspect of Christ to His people at His coming\] is the symbol of Christ
in His gentleness. Who would be afraid of a lamb? Even a little child,
instead of being scared, desires to caress it. There is nothing to make
us afraid of God but sin, and Jesus is the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sin of the world. What a fearful contrast is the aspect which He
will wear towards His enemies! Not as the Bridegroom and the Lamb, but
as the \[avenging\] judge and warrior stained in the blood of His
enemies."

[Revelation 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 19:14</span></span>

the armies . . . in heaven--Compare "the horse bridles," [Rev
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#020.md). The glorified saints whom God
"will bring with" Christ at His advent; compare [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md), "they that are with Him,
called, chosen, faithful"; as also "His mighty angels."

white and clean--Greek, "pure." A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, and CYPRIAN omit
"and," which ORIGEN and ANDREAS retain, as English Version.

[Revelation 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 19:15</span></span>

out of his mouth . . . sword-- ([Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016.md); [Rev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012.md), [Rev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016).md). Here in its avenging power,
[Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008.md), "consume with the Spirit of
His mouth" ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md), to which there
is allusion here); not in its convicting and converting efficacy ([Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017.md); [Heb
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md), where also the judicial
keenness of the sword-like word is included). The Father commits the
judgment to the Son.

he shall rule--The HE is emphatic, He and none other, in contrast to the
usurpers who have misruled on earth. "Rule," literally, "tend as a
shepherd"; but here in a punitive sense. He, who would have shepherded
them with pastoral rod and with the golden scepter of His love, shall
dash them in pieces, as refractory rebels, with "a rod of iron."

treadeth . . . wine-press-- ([Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).md).

of the fierceness and wrath--So ANDREAS reads. But A, B, Vulgate,
Coptic, and ORIGEN read, "of the fierceness (or boiling indignation) of
the wrath," omitting "and."

Almighty--The fierceness of Christ's wrath against His foes will be
executed with the resources of omnipotence.

[Revelation 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 19:16</span></span>

"His name written on His vesture and on His thigh," was written partly
on the vesture, partly on the thigh itself, at the part where in an
equestrian figure the robe drops from the thigh. The thigh symbolizes
Christ's humanity as having come, after the flesh, from the loins of
David, and now appearing as the glorified "Son of man." On the other
hand, His incommunicable divine name, "which no man knew," is on His
head ([Rev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012).md), \[MENOCHIUS\].

KING OF KINGS--Compare [Rev 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md), in
contrast with [Rev 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md), the beast
being in attempted usurpation a king of kings, the ten kings delivering
their kingdom to him.

[Revelation 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 19:17</span></span>

an--Greek, "one."

in the sun--so as to be conspicuous in sight of the whole world.

to all the fowls-- ([Eze 39:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md).

and gather yourselves--A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS read,
"be gathered," omitting "and."

of the great God--A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS read, "the
great supper (that is, banquet) of God."

[Revelation 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 19:18</span></span>

Contrast with this "supper," [Rev
19:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#017.md), the marriage supper of the
Lamb, [Rev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md).

captains--Greek, "captains of thousands," that is, chief captains. The
"kings" are "the ten" who "give their power unto the beast."

free and bond--specified in [Rev
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md), as "receiving the mark of the
beast." The repetition of flesh (in the Greek it is plural: masses of
flesh) five times in this verse, marks the gross carnality of the
followers of the beast. Again, the giving of their flesh to the fowls to
eat, is a righteous retribution for their not suffering the dead bodies
of Christ's witnesses to be put in graves.

[Revelation 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 19:19</span></span>

gathered together--at Armageddon, under the sixth vial. For "their
armies" in B and ANDREAS, there is found "His armies" in A.

war--so ANDREAS. But A and B read, "the war," namely, that foretold,
[Rev 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#014.md); [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md).

[Revelation 19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 19:20</span></span>

and with him the false prophet--A reads, "and those with him." B reads,
"and he who was with him, the false prophet."

miracles--Greek, "the miracles" (literally, "signs") recorded already
([Rev 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#014).md) as wrought by the second
beast before (literally, 'in sight of') the first beast. Hence it
follows the second beast is identical with the false prophet. Many
expositors represent the first beast to be the secular, the second beast
to be the ecclesiastical power of Rome; and account for the change of
title for the latter from the "other beast" to the "false prophet," is
because by the judgment on the harlot, the ecclesiastical power will
then retain nothing of its former character save the power to deceive. I
think it not unlikely that the false prophet will be the successor of
the spiritual pretensions of the papacy; while the beast in its last
form as the fully revealed Antichrist will be the secular representative
and embodiment of the fourth world kingdom, Rome, in its last form of
intensified opposition to God. Compare with this prophecy, Eze.
38:1-39:29; [Dan 2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034.md), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md); [Dan

3:9-17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#009.md); Zec. 12:1-14:21. Daniel ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008).md) makes no mention of the second
beast, or false prophet, but mentions that "the little horn" has "the
eyes of a man," that is, cunning and intellectual culture; this is not a
feature of the first beast in the thirteenth chapter, but is expressed
by the Apocalyptic "false prophet," the embodiment of man's unsanctified
knowledge, and the subtlety of the old serpent. The first beast is a
political power; the second is a spiritual power--the power of ideas.
But both are beasts, the worldly Antichristian wisdom serving the
worldly Antichristian power. The dragon is both lion and serpent. As the
first law in God's moral government is that "judgment should begin at
the house of God," and be executed on the harlot, the faithless Church,
by the world power with which she had committed spiritual adultery, so
it is a second law that the world power, after having served as God's
instrument of punishment, is itself punished. As the harlot is judged by
the beast and the ten kings, so these are destroyed by the Lord Himself
coming in person. So Zep. 1:1-18 compared with [Zep
2:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#001.md). And Jeremiah, after denouncing
Jerusalem's judgment by Babylon, ends with denouncing Babylon's own
doom. Between the judgment on the harlot and the Lord's destruction of
the beast, will intervene that season in which earthly-mindedness will
reach its culmination, and Antichristianity triumph for its short three
and a half days during which the two witnesses lie dead. Then shall the
Church be ripe for her glorification, the Antichristian world for
destruction. The world at the highest development of its material and
spiritual power is but a decorated carcass round which the eagles
gather. It is characteristic that Antichrist and his kings, in their
blindness, imagine that they can wage war against the King of heaven
with earthly hosts; herein is shown the extreme folly of Babylonian
confusion. The Lord's mere appearance, without any actual encounter,
shows Antichrist his nothingness; compare the effect of Jesus'
appearance even in His humiliation, [Joh
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md) \[AUBERLEN\].

them; that worshipped--literally, "them worshipping" not an act once for
all done, as the "received" implies, but those in the habit of
"worshipping."

These both were cast . . . into a lake--Greek, ". . . the lake of fire,"
Gehenna. Satan is subsequently cast into it, at the close of the
outbreak which succeeds the millennium ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md). Then Death and Hell, as well
those not found at the general judgment "written in the book of life";
this constitutes "the second death."

their fire is not quenched."
