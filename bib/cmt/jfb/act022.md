### [Acts Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001.md)

[Acts 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 22:2</span></span>

PAUL'S DEFENSE FROM THE STAIRS OF THE FORTRESS--THE RAGE OF THE AUDIENCE
BURSTING FORTH, THE COMMANDANT HAS HIM BROUGHT INTO THE FORT TO BE
EXAMINED BY SCOURGING, BUT LEARNING THAT HE IS A ROMAN, HE ORDERS HIS
RELEASE AND COMMANDS THE SAMHEDRIM TO TRY HIM. (Acts 22:1-30)

when they heard . . . the Hebrew tongue--(See on [Act
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040).md).

they kept the more silence--They could have understood him in Greek, and
doubtless fully expected the renegade to address them in that language,
but the sound of their holy mother tongue awed them into deeper silence.

[Acts 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 22:3</span></span>

a Jew of Tarsus, brought up in this city, at the feet--(See on [Luk
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039).md).

of Gamaliel--(See on [Act 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034).md); a
fact of great importance in the apostle's history, standing in the same
relation to his future career as Moses' education in the Egyptian court
to the work for which he was destined.

the perfect manner of the law of the fathers--the strictest form of
traditional Judaism.

zealous--"a zealot."

toward God as ye all are this day--his own former murderous zeal against
the disciples of the Lord Jesus being merely reflected in their present
treatment of himself.

[Acts 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 22:4</span></span>

I persecuted, &c.--(See on [Act 9:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md);
[Act 9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005).md).

[Acts 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 22:5</span></span>

the high priest--still alive.

doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders--the whole
Sanhedrim.

[Acts 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 22:8</span></span>

Jesus of Nazareth--the Nazarene. See on [Act
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md).

[Acts 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 22:9</span></span>

they that were with me--(See on [Act
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007), &c..md)

[Acts 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 22:12</span></span>

Ananias, a devout man, according to the law, having a good report of all
the Jews which dwelt there--One would not know from this description of
Ananias that he was a Christian at all, the apostles object being to
hold him up as unexceptionable, even to the most rigid Jews.

[Acts 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 22:13</span></span>

The God of our fathers hath chosen thee--studiously linking the new
economy upon the old, as but the sequel of it; both having one glorious
Author.

[Acts 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 22:14</span></span>

that thou shouldest . . . see that--"the"

Just One--compare [Act 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md); [Act
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md).

hear the voice of his mouth--in order to place him on a level with the
other apostles, who had "seen the \[risen\] Lord."

[Acts 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 22:16</span></span>

be baptized and wash away thy sins--This way of speaking arises from
baptism being the visible seal of remission.

calling on the name of the Lord--rather, "having called," that is, after
having done so; referring to the confession of Christ which preceded
baptism, as [Act 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037.md).

[Acts 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 22:17</span></span>

it came to pass, &c.--This thrilling dialogue between the glorified
Redeemer and his chosen vessel is nowhere else related.

when I was come again to Jerusalem--on the occasion mentioned in [Act
9:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md).

while I prayed in the temple--He thus calls their attention to the fact
that after his conversion he kept up his connection with the temple as
before.

[Acts 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 22:18</span></span>

get . . . quickly out of Jerusalem--compare [Act
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029.md).

for they will not receive thy testimony . . . And I said, Lord, they
know, &c.--"Can it be, Lord, that they will resist the testimony of one
whom they knew so well as among the bitterest of all against Thy
disciples, and whom nothing short of resistless evidence could have
turned to Thee?"

[Acts 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 22:21</span></span>

depart for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles--that is,
"Enough; thy testimony is not to be thrown away upon Jerusalem; the
Gentiles, afar off, are thy peculiar sphere."

[Acts 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 22:22</span></span>

gave him audience to this word . . . then . . . Away with such a fellow
from the earth, &c.--Their national prejudices lashed into fury at the
mention of a mission to the Gentiles, they would speedily have done to
him as they did to Stephen, but for the presence and protection of the
Roman officer.

[Acts 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 22:24</span></span>

examined by scourging--according to the Roman practice.

that he might know wherefore they cried so--Paul's speech being to him
in an unknown tongue, he concluded from the horror which it kindled in
the vast audience that he must have been guilty of some crime.

[Acts 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 22:25</span></span>

Paul said to the centurion that stood by--to superintend the torture and
receive the confession expected to be wrung from him.

Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, &c.--See on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md).

[Acts 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 22:27</span></span>

art thou a Roman?--showing that this being of Tarsus, which he had told
him before ([Act 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039).md) did not
necessarily imply that he was a Roman citizen.

[Acts 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 22:28</span></span>

With a great sum obtained I this freedom--Roman citizenship was bought
and sold in the reign of Claudius, we know, at a high price: at a
subsequent date, for next to nothing. But to put in a false claim to
this privilege was a capital crime.

I was free born--born to it, by purchase, or in reward of services, on
the part of his father or some ancestor.

[Acts 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 22:29</span></span>

chief captain also was afraid, &c.--See on [Act
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#038.md).

[Acts 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 22:30</span></span>

commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear--that is,
the Sanhedrim to be formally convened. Note here the power to order a
Sanhedrim to try this case, assumed by the Roman officers and acquiesced
in on their part.
