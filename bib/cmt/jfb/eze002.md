### [Ezekiel Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 2:1</span></span>

EZEKIEL'S COMMISSION. ([Eze 2:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#001))

Son of man--often applied to Ezekiel; once only to Daniel ([Dan
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#017)), and not to any other prophet.
The phrase was no doubt taken from Chaldean usage during the sojourn of
Daniel and Ezekiel in Chaldea. But the spirit who sanctioned the words
of the prophet implied by it the lowliness and frailty of the prophet as
man "lower than the angels," though now admitted to the vision of angels
and of God Himself, "lest he should be exalted through the abundance of
the revelations" ([Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)). He is
appropriately so called as being type of the divine "Son of man" here
revealed as "man" (see on [Eze 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#026)).
That title, as applied to Messiah, implies at once His lowliness and His
exaltation, in His manifestations as the Representative man, at His
first and second comings respectively ([Psa
8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004); [Mat
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013); [Mat
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#018); and on the other hand, [Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013); [Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064); [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027)).

[Ezekiel 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 2:2</span></span>

spirit entered . . . when he spake--The divine word is ever accompanied
by the Spirit ([Gen 1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002)).

set . . . upon . . . feet--He had been "upon his face" ([Eze
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#028)). Humiliation on our part is
followed by exaltation on God's part ([Eze
3:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#023); [Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029); [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)). "On the feet" was the fitting
attitude when he was called on to walk and work for God ([Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Eph
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015)).

that I heard--rather, "then I heard."

[Ezekiel 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 2:3</span></span>

nation--rather, "nations"; the word usually applied to the heathen or
Gentiles; here to the Jews, as being altogether heathenized with
idolatries. So in [Isa 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010), they are
named "Sodom" and "Gomorrah." They were now become "Lo-ammi," not the
people of God ([Hos 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009)).

[Ezekiel 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 2:4</span></span>

impudent--literally, "hard-faced" ([Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007), [Eze
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009)).

children--resumptive of "they" ([Eze
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#003)); the "children" walk in their
"fathers'" steps.

I . . . send thee--God opposes His command to all obstacles. Duties are
ours; events are God's.

Thus saith the Lord God--God opposes His name to the obstinacy of the
people.

[Ezekiel 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 2:5</span></span>

forbear--namely, to hear.

yet shall know--Even if they will not hear, at least they will not have
ignorance to plead as the cause of their perversity ([Eze
33:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#033)).

[Ezekiel 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 2:6</span></span>

briers--not as the Margin and GESENIUS, "rebels," which would not
correspond so well to "thorns." The Hebrew is from a root meaning "to
sting" as nettles do. The wicked are often so called ([Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006); [Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002); [Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018)).

scorpions--a reptile about six inches long with a deadly sting at the
end of the tail.

be not afraid-- ([Luk 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#004); [Pe1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014)).

[Ezekiel 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 2:7</span></span>

most rebellious--literally, "rebellion" itself: its very essence.

[Ezekiel 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 2:8</span></span>

eat--(See on [Jer 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016); [Rev
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#009)). The idea is to possess
himself fully of the message and digest it in the mind; not literal
eating, but such an appropriation of its unsavory contents that they
should become, as it were, part of himself, so as to impart them the
more vividly to his hearers.

[Ezekiel 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 2:9</span></span>

roll--the form in which ancient books were made.

[Ezekiel 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 2:10</span></span>

within and without--on the face and the back. Usually the parchment was
written only on its inside when rolled up; but so full was God's message
of impending woes that it was written also on the back.
