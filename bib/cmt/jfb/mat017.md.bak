### [Matthew Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001.md)

[Matthew 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mat 17:22</span></span>

HEALING OF A DEMONIAC BOY--SECOND EXPLICIT ANNOUNCEMENT BY OUR LORD OF
HIS APPROACHING DEATH AND RESURRECTION. ( = Mark 9:14-32; [Luk
9:37-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037).md). ([Mat
17:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#014).md)

And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them--Mark ([Mar
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030).md), as usual, is very precise here:
"And they departed thence"--that is, from the scene of the last
miracle--"and passed through Galilee; and He would not that any man
should know it." So this was not a preaching, but a private, journey
through Galilee. Indeed, His public ministry in Galilee was now all but
concluded. Though He sent out the Seventy after this to preach and heal,
He Himself was little more in public there, and He was soon to bid it a
final adieu. Till this hour arrived, He was chiefly occupied with the
Twelve, preparing them for the coming events.

The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men . . . And they
were exceeding sorry--Though the shock would not be so great as at the
first announcement ([Mat 16:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#021).md),
their "sorrow" would not be the less, but probably the greater, the
deeper the intelligence went down into their hearts, and a new wave
dashing upon them by this repetition of the heavy tidings. Accordingly,
Luke ([Luk 9:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043).md), connecting it
with the scene of the miracle just recorded, and the teaching which
arose out of it--or possibly with all His recent teaching--says our Lord
forewarned the Twelve that they would soon stand in need of all that
teaching: "But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus
did, He said unto His disciples, Let these sayings sink down into your
ears; for the Son of man shall be delivered," &c.: "Be not carried off
your feet by the grandeur you have lately seen in Me, but remember what
I have told you, and now tell you again, that that Sun in whose beams ye
now rejoice is soon to set in midnight gloom." Remarkable is the
antithesis in those words of our Lord preserved in all the three
narratives--"The son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men."
Luke adds ([Luk 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045).md) that "they
understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they
perceived it not"--for the plainest statements, when they encounter
long-continued and obstinate prejudices, are seen through a distorting
and dulling medium--"and were afraid to ask Him"; deterred partly by the
air of lofty sadness with which doubtless these sayings were uttered,
and on which they would be reluctant to break in, and partly by the fear
of laying themselves open to rebuke for their shallowness and timidity.
How artless is all this!

THE TRIBUTE MONEY. ([Mat 17:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#024).md)

And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
money--the double drachma; a sum equal to two Attic drachmas, and
corresponding to the Jewish "half-shekel," payable, towards the
maintenance of the temple and its services, by every male Jew of twenty
years old and upward. For the origin of this annual tax, see [Exo
30:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#013.md); [Ch2
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#006.md), [Ch2
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#009.md). Thus, it will be observed, it
was not a civil, but an ecclesiastical tax. The tax mentioned in [Mat
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025.md) was a civil one. The whole
teaching of this very remarkable scene depends upon this distinction.

came to Peter--at whose house Jesus probably resided while at Capernaum.
This explains several things in the narrative.

and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?--The question seems to imply
that the payment of this tax was voluntary, but expected; or what, in
modern phrase, would be called a "voluntary assessment."

[Matthew 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mat 17:25</span></span>

He saith, yes--that is, "To be sure He does"; as if eager to remove even
the suspicion of the contrary. If Peter knew--as surely he did--that
there was at this time no money in the bag, this reply must be regarded
as a great act of faith in his Master.

And when he was come into the house--Peter's.

Jesus prevented him--anticipated him; according to the old sense of the
word "prevent."

saying, What thinkest thou, Simon?--using his family name for
familiarity.

of whom do the kings of the earth take custom--meaning custom on goods
exported or imported.

or tribute--meaning the poll-tax, payable to the Romans by everyone
whose name was in the census. This, therefore, it will be observed, was
strictly a civil tax.

of their own children, or of strangers--This cannot mean "foreigners,"
from whom sovereigns certainly do not raise taxes, but those who are not
of their own family, that is, their subjects.

[Matthew 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mat 17:26</span></span>

Peter saith unto him, Of strangers--"of those not their children."

Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free--By "the children" our
Lord cannot here mean Himself and the Twelve together, in some loose
sense of their near relationship to God as their common Father. For
besides that our Lord never once mixes Himself up with His disciples in
speaking of their relation to God, but ever studiously keeps His
relation and theirs apart (see, for example, on the last words of this
chapter)--this would be to teach the right of believers to exemption
from the dues required for sacred services, in the teeth of all that
Paul teaches and that He Himself indicates throughout. He can refer
here, then, only to Himself; using the word "children" evidently in
order to express the general principle observed by sovereigns, who do
not draw taxes from their own children, and thus convey the truth
respecting His own exemption the more strikingly:--namely, "If the
sovereign's own family be exempt, you know the inference in My case"; or
to express it more nakedly than Jesus thought needful and fitting: "This
is a tax for upholding My Father's House. As His Son, then, that tax is
not due by Me--I AM FREE."

[Matthew 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mat 17:27</span></span>

Notwithstanding, lest we should offend--stumble.

them--all ignorant as they are of My relation to the Lord of the Temple,
and should misconstrue a claim to exemption into indifference to His
honor who dwells in it.

go thou to the sea--Capernaum, it will be remembered, lay on the Sea of
Galilee.

and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when
thou hast opened his mouth, thou shall find a piece of money--a stater.
So it should have been rendered, and not indefinitely, as in our
version, for the coin was an Attic silver coin equal to two of the
afore-mentioned "didrachms" of half a shekel's value, and so, was the
exact sum required for both. Accordingly, the Lord adds,

that take, and give unto them for me and thee--literally, "instead of Me
and thee"; perhaps because the payment was a redemption of the person
paid for ([Exo 30:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012).md) --in which view
Jesus certainly was "free." If the house was Peter's, this will account
for payment being provided on this occasion, not for all the Twelve, but
only for him and His Lord. Observe, our Lord does not say "for us," but
"for Me and thee"; thus distinguishing the Exempted One and His
non-exempted disciple.
