### [Psalms Chapter 125](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 125:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 125:1</span></span>

God honors the confidence of His people, by protection and deliverance,
and leaves hypocrites to the doom of the wicked. ([Psa
125:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#001).md)

Mount Zion--as an emblem of permanence, and locality of Jerusalem as one
of security, represent the firm and protected condition of God's people
(compare [Psa 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005).md), supported not
only by Providence, but by covenant promise. Even the mountains shall
depart, and the hills be removed, but God's kindness shall not depart,
nor His covenant of peace be removed ([Isa
54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010).md).

They that trust--are "His people," ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 125:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 125:3</span></span>

Though God may leave them for a time under the "rod," or power ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009).md), and oppression of the wicked for
a time, as a chastisement, He will not suffer them to be tempted so as
to fall into sin ([Co1 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013).md). The
wicked shall only prove a correcting rod to them, not a destroying
sword; even this rod shall not remain ("rest") on them, lest they be
tempted to despair and apostasy ([Psa
73:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013).md). God may even try His people
to the uttermost: when nothing is before our eyes but pure despair, then
He delivers us and gives life in death, and makes us blessed in the
curse ([Co2 1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008).md) \[LUTHER\].

the lot--the possession, literally, "Canaan," spiritually, the heavenly
inheritance of holiness and bliss which is appointed to the righteous.
Sin's dominion shall not permanently come between the believer and his
inheritance.

[Psalms 125:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 125:4</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#010.md); [Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 125:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 125:5</span></span>

Those who turn aside (under temptation) permanently show that they are
hypocrites, and their lot or portion shall be with the wicked ([Psa
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#003).md).

crooked ways--(Compare [Deu 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#016.md); [Mal
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008).md).

their--is emphatic; the "crooked ways" proceed from their own hearts.
The true Israel is here distinguished from the false. Scripture
everywhere opposes the Jewish delusion that mere outward descent would
save ([Rom 2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md); [Rom
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006.md); [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016).md). The byways of sin from the way
of life.
