### [Deuteronomy Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 10:1</span></span>

GOD'S MERCY IN RESTORING THE TWO TABLES. (Deu. 10:1-22)

At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first--It was when God had been pacified through the
intercessions of Moses with the people who had so greatly offended Him
by the worship of the golden calf. The obedient leader executed the
orders he had received as to the preparation both of the hewn stones,
and the ark or chest in which those sacred archives were to be laid.

[Deuteronomy 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 10:3</span></span>

And I made an ark of shittim wood--It appears, however, from [Exo
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo037.htm#001.md), that the ark was not framed till
his return from the mount, or most probably, he gave instructions to
Bezaleel, the artist employed on the work, before he ascended the
mount--that, on his descent, it might be finished, and ready to receive
the precious deposit.

[Deuteronomy 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 10:4</span></span>

he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing--that is, not
Moses, who under the divine direction acted as amanuensis, but God
Himself who made this inscription a second time with His own hand, to
testify the importance He attached to the ten commandments. Different
from other stone monuments of antiquity, which were made to stand
upright and in the open air, those on which the divine law was engraven
were portable, and designed to be kept as a treasure. JOSEPHUS says that
each of the tables contained five precepts. But the tradition generally
received, both among Jewish and Christian writers is, that one table
contained four precepts, the other six.

[Deuteronomy 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 10:5</span></span>

I . . . put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be,
as the Lord commanded me--Here is another minute, but important
circumstance, the public mention of which at the time attests the
veracity of the sacred historian.

[Deuteronomy 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 10:6</span></span>

the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children
of Jaakan to Mosera--So sudden a change from a spoken discourse to a
historical narrative has greatly puzzled the most eminent biblical
scholars, some of whom reject the parenthesis as a manifest
interpolation. But it is found in the most ancient Hebrew manuscripts,
and, believing that all contained in this book was given by inspiration
and is entitled to profound respect, we must receive it as it stands,
although acknowledging our inability to explain the insertion of these
encampment details in this place. There is another difficulty in the
narrative itself. The stations which the Israelites are said
successively to have occupied are enumerated here in a different order
from [Num 33:31](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#031.md). That the names of the
stations in both passages are the same there can be no doubt; but, in
Numbers, they are probably mentioned in reference to the first visit of
the Hebrews during the long wandering southwards, before their return to
Kadesh the second time; while here they have a reference to the second
passage of the Israelites, when they again marched south, in order to
compass the land of Edom. It is easy to conceive that Mosera (Hor) and
the wells of Jaakan might lie in such a direction that a nomadic horde
might, in different years, at one time take the former first in their
way, and at another time the latter \[ROBINSON\].

[Deuteronomy 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 10:10</span></span>

Moses here resumes his address, and having made a passing allusion to
the principal events in their history, concludes by exhorting them to
fear the Lord and serve Him faithfully.

[Deuteronomy 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 10:16</span></span>

Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart--Here he teaches them
the true and spiritual meaning of that rite, as was afterwards more
strongly urged by Paul ([Rom 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025.md),
[Rom 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029).md), and should be applied by
us to our baptism, which is "not the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God" \[[Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md)\].
