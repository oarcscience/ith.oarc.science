### [Psalms Chapter 55](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001)

[Psalms 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 55:1</span></span>

In great terror on account of enemies, and grieved by the treachery of a
friend, the Psalmist offers an earnest prayer for relief. He mingles
confident assurances of divine favor to himself with invocations and
predictions of God's avenging judgments on the wicked. The tone suits
David's experience, both in the times of Saul and Absalom, though
perhaps neither was exclusively before his mind. (Psa. 55:1-23)

hide not thyself, &c.--(compare [Psa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001); [Psa
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#009)), withhold not help.

[Psalms 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 55:2</span></span>

[Psalms 55:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 55:7</span></span>

Even a wilderness is a safer place than exposure to such evils, terrible
as storm and tempest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 55:11</span></span>

Wickedness--literally, "Mischief," evils resulting from others ([Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009); [Psa
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#002), [Psa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#007)).

streets--or literally, "wide places," markets, courts of justice, and
any public place.

[Psalms 55:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 55:12</span></span>

This description of treachery does not deny, but aggravates, the injury
from enemies.

among them--or, "within them," in their hearts ([Psa
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009); [Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011)).

[Psalms 55:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#016)

[Psalms 55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 55:20</span></span>

The treachery is aggravated by hypocrisy. The changes of number, [Psa
55:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#015), [Psa
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023), and here, enliven the picture,
and imply that the chief traitor and his accomplices are in view
together.

37:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025); [Mat
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011)).

to be moved--from the secure position of His favor (compare [Psa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#006)).

[Psalms 55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 55:23</span></span>

bloody . . . days--(compare [Psa 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006);
[Psa 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#014)), deceit and murderous
dispositions often united. The threat is directed specially (not as a
general truth) against the wicked, then in the writer's view.
