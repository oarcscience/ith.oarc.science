### [Psalms Chapter 93](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

[Psalms 93:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 93:1</span></span>

This and the six following Psalms were applied by the Jews to the times
of the Messiah. The theme is God's supremacy in creation and providence.
([Psa 93:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#001))

God is described as a King entering on His reign, and, for robes of
royalty, investing Himself with the glorious attributes of His nature.
The result of His thus reigning is the durability of the world.

[Psalms 93:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 93:2</span></span>

His underived power exceeds the most sublime exhibitions of the most
powerful objects in nature ([Psa
89:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#009)).

[Psalms 93:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa093.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 93:5</span></span>

While His power inspires dread, His revealed will should secure our
confidence (compare [Psa 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007); [Psa
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#010)), and thus fear and love
combined, producing all holy emotions, should distinguish the worship we
offer in His house, both earthly and heavenly.
