### [2 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 9:1</span></span>

REASONS FOR HIS SENDING TITUS. THE GREATER THEIR BOUNTIFULNESS, THE MORE
SHALL BE THE RETURN OF BLESSING TO THEM, AND THANKSGIVING TO GOD. ([Co2
9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001).md)

For--connected with [Co2 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016.md) : "Show
love to the messengers of the churches; for as concerns the ministration
for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you who are so
forward already."

write--emphatical: It is superfluous to "write," for you will have
witnesses present \[BENGEL\].

[2 Corinthians 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 9:2</span></span>

ready a year ago--to send off the money, owing to the apostle's former
exhortation ([Co1 16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001).md).

your zeal--Greek, "the zeal from you," that is, on your part; propagated
from you to others.

provoked--that is, stimulated.

very many--Greek, "the greater number," namely, of the Macedonians.

[2 Corinthians 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 9:3</span></span>

have I sent--we should say, "I send"; whereas the ancients put it in the
past, the time which it would be by the time that the letter arrived.

the brethren-- ([Co2 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018.md), [Co2
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#022).md) --Titus and the two others.

should be in vain in this behalf--"should be proved futile in this
particular," however true in general ([Co2
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004).md). A tacit compliment, softening
the sharp monition.

as I said--as I was saying ([Co2 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002).md).

[2 Corinthians 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 9:4</span></span>

if they of Macedonia--rather as Greek, "if Macedonians."

unprepared--with your collection; see [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002.md), "ready," Greek, "prepared."

we, not to say ye--Ye would naturally feel more ashamed for yourselves,
than we (who boasted of you) would for you.

confident boasting--The oldest manuscripts read simply "confidence,"
namely, in your liberality.

[2 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 9:5</span></span>

that they would go before--Translate, "that they should," &c.

whereof ye had notice before--rather, "promised before"; "long announced
by me to the Macedonians" ([Co2 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002).md)
\[BENGEL\]. "Your promised bounty" \[ELLICOTT and others\].

not as of covetousness--Translate, "not as matter of covetousness,"
which it would be, if you gave niggardly.

[2 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 9:6</span></span>

I say--ELLICOTT and others supply the ellipsis thus: "But remember
this."

bountifully--literally, "with," or "in blessings." The word itself
implies a beneficent spirit in the giver (compare [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007), end.md), and the plural implies the
abundance and liberality of the gifts. "The reaping shall correspond to
the proportions and spirit of the sowing" \[BENGEL\]. Compare [Eze
34:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#026.md), "Showers of blessing."

[2 Corinthians 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 9:7</span></span>

according as he purposeth in his heart--Let the full consent of the free
will go with the gift \[ALFORD\]. Opposed to "of necessity," as
"grudgingly" is opposed to "a cheerful giver" ([Pro
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#009.md); [Pro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#025.md); [Isa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008).md).

[2 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 9:8</span></span>

all grace--even in external goods, and even while ye bestow on others
\[BENGEL\].

that--"in order that." God's gifts are bestowed on us, not that we may
have them to ourselves, but that we may the more "abound in good works"
to others.

sufficiency--so as not to need the help of others, having yourselves
from God "bread for your food" ([Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010).md).

in all things--Greek, "in everything."

every good work--of charity to others, which will be "your seed sown"
([Co2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010).md).

[2 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 9:9</span></span>

As it is written--realizing the highly blessed character portrayed in
[Psa 112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md).

He--the "good man" ([Psa 112:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#005).md).

dispersed--as seed sown with full and open hand, without anxious thought
in what direction each grain may fall. It is implied also that he has
always what he may disperse \[BENGEL\]. So in [Psa
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009.md).

the poor--The Greek word is found here only in New Testament, "one in
straitened circumstances, who earns his bread by labor." The word
usually employed means "one so poor as to live by begging."

his righteousness--Here "beneficence": the evidence of his being
righteous before God and man. Compare [Deu
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#013.md); [Mat
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001.md), "alms"; Greek, "righteousness."

remaineth--unexhausted and unfailing.

[2 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 9:10</span></span>

Translate, as in [Isa 55:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010.md), "He that
ministereth (supplieth) seed to the sower and bread for food"
(literally, "bread for eating").

minister--rather future, as the oldest manuscripts, "Shall minister
(supply) and multiply."

your seed--your means for liberality.

the fruits of your righteousness--the heavenly rewards for your
Christian charity ([Mat 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042).md).
Righteousness shall be itself the reward, even as it is the thing
rewarded ([Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md); [Mat
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006.md); [Mat
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033).md).

[2 Corinthians 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 9:11</span></span>

Compare [Co2 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#008.md).

bountifulness--Greek, "single-minded liberality." Translated
"simplicity," [Rom 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md).

causeth through us--literally, "worketh through us"; that is, through
our instrumentality as the distributors.

thanksgiving--on the part of the recipients.

[2 Corinthians 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 9:12</span></span>

Greek, "The ministration of this public service (on your part) is not
only still further supplying the wants of the saints (besides the
supplies from other quarters), but is abounding also (namely, in respect
to relieving the necessities of others in poverty) through many
thanksgivings to God."

[2 Corinthians 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 9:13</span></span>

by--through occasion of.

experiment--Translate, "the experience" \[ELLICOTT and others\]. Or,
"the experimental proof" of your Christian character, afforded by "this
ministration."

they--the recipients.

for your professed subjection--Greek, "for the subjection of your
profession"; that is, your subjection in accordance with your
profession, in relation to the Gospel. Ye yield yourselves in willing
subjection to the Gospel precepts, evinced in acts, as well as in
profession.

your liberal distribution--Greek, "the liberality of your contribution
in relation to them," &c.

[2 Corinthians 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 9:14</span></span>

Translate, "Themselves also with prayer for you, longing after you on
account of the exceeding grace of God (resting) upon you." English
Version is, however, good sense: They glorify God ([Co2
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013).md) by the experimental proof, &c.,
"and by their prayer for you." But the Greek favors the former.

[2 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 9:15</span></span>

his unspeakable gift--the gift of His own Son, which includes all other
inferior gifts ([Co2 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009.md); [Rom
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032).md). If we have received from God
"His unspeakable gift," what great thing is it, if we give a few
perishing gifts for His sake?
