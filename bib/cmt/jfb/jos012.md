### [Joshua Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 12:1</span></span>

THE TWO KINGS WHOSE COUNTRIES MOSES TOOK AND DISPOSED OF. ([Jos
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#001).md)

Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote,
and possessed their land on the other side Jordan--This chapter contains
a recapitulation of the conquests made in the promised land, with the
additional mention of some places not formerly noted in the sacred
history. The river Arnon on the south and mount Hermon on the north were
the respective boundaries of the land acquired by the Israelites beyond
Jordan (see [Num 21:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#021.md); [Deu
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#036.md); [Deu
3:3-16](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#003.md) \[and see on [Deu
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#024)\].md).

[Joshua 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 12:7</span></span>

THE ONE AND THIRTY KINGS ON THE WEST SIDE OF JORDAN, WHICH JOSHUA SMOTE.
(Jos. 12:7-24)

Baal-gad . . . even unto . . . Halak--(See on [Jos
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017).md). A list of thirty-one chief
towns is here given; and, as the whole land contained a superficial
extent of only fifteen miles in length by fifty in breadth, it is
evident that these capital cities belonged to petty and insignificant
kingdoms. With a few exceptions, they were not the scenes of any
important events recorded in the sacred history, and therefore do not
require a particular notice.
