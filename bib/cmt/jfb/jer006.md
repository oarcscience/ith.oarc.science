### [Jeremiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 6:1</span></span>

ZION'S FOES PREPARE WAR AGAINST HER: HER SINS ARE THE CAUSE. (Jer.
6:1-30)

Benjamin--Jerusalem was situated in the tribe of Benjamin, which was
here separated from that of Judah by the valley of Hinnom. Though it was
inhabited partly by Benjamites, partly by men of Judah, he addresses the
former as being his own countrymen.

blow . . . trumpet . . . Tekoa--Tikehu, Tekoa form a play on sounds. The
birthplace of Amos.

Beth-haccerem--meaning in Hebrew, "vineyard-house." It and Tekoa were a
few miles south of Jerusalem. As the enemy came from the north, the
inhabitants of the surrounding country would naturally flee southwards.
The fire-signal on the hills gave warning of danger approaching.

[Jeremiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 6:2</span></span>

likened--rather, "I lay waste." Literally, "O comely and delicate one, I
lay waste the daughter of Zion," that is, "thee." So [Zac
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md), "before Joshua," that is, "before
thee" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 6:3</span></span>

shepherds--hostile leaders with their armies ([Jer
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); [Jer
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md); [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#045).md).

feed--They shall consume each one all that is near him; literally, "his
hand," that is, the place which he occupies ([Num
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md); see on [Isa
56:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 6:4</span></span>

The invading soldiers encourage one another to the attack on Jerusalem.

Prepare--literally, "Sanctify" war, that is, Proclaim it formally with
solemn rites; the invasion was solemnly ordered by God (compare [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md).

at noon--the hottest part of the day when attacks were rarely made ([Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md); [Jer
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#016).md). Even at this time they wished
to attack, such is their eagerness.

Woe unto us--The words of the invaders, mourning the approach of night
which would suspend their hostile operations; still, even in spite of
the darkness, at night they renew the attack ([Jer
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 6:6</span></span>

cast--Hebrew, "pour out"; referring to the emptying of the baskets of
earth to make the mound, formed of "trees" and earthwork, to overtop the
city walls. The "trees" were also used to make warlike engines.

this--pointing the invaders to Jerusalem.

visited--that is, punished.

wholly oppression--or join "wholly" with "visited," that is, she is
altogether (in her whole extent) to be punished \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 6:7</span></span>

fountain--rather, a well dug, from which water springs; distinct from a
natural spring or fountain.

casteth out--causeth to flow; literally, "causeth to dig," the cause
being put for the effect ([Kg2 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#016.md),
[Kg2 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#024.md); [Isa
57:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).md).

me--Jehovah.

[Jeremiah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 6:8</span></span>

Tender appeal in the midst of threats.

depart--Hebrew, "be torn away"; Jehovah's affection making Him unwilling
to depart; His attachment to Jerusalem was such that an effort was
needed to tear Himself from it ([Eze
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#018.md); [Hos
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 6:9</span></span>

The Jews are the grapes, their enemies the unsparing gleaners.

turn back . . . hand--again and again bring freshly gathered handfuls to
the baskets; referring to the repeated carrying away of captives to
Babylon ([Jer 52:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#028.md); [Kg2
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md); [Kg2
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 6:10</span></span>

ear is uncircumcised--closed against the precepts of God by the foreskin
of carnality ([Lev 26:41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#041.md); [Eze
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#007.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

word . . . reproach-- ([Jer 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 6:11</span></span>

fury of . . . Lord--His denunciations against Judah communicated to the
prophet.

weary with holding in-- ([Jer 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md).

I will pour--or else imperative: the command of God (see [Jer
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012).md), "Pour it out" \[MAURER\].

aged . . . full of days--The former means one becoming old; the latter a
decrepit old man \[MAURER\] ([Job
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026.md); [Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 6:12</span></span>

The very punishments threatened by Moses in the event of disobedience to
God ([Deu 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030).md).

turned--transferred.

[Jeremiah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 6:13</span></span>

([Jer 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#010.md); [Isa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011.md); [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 6:14</span></span>

hurt--the spiritual wound.

slightly--as if it were but a slight wound; or, in a slight manner,
pronouncing all sound where there is no soundness.

saying--namely, the prophets and priests ([Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013).md). Whereas they ought to warn the
people of impending judgments and the need of repentance, they say there
is nothing to fear.

peace--including soundness. All is sound in the nation's moral state, so
all will be peace as to its political state ([Jer
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md); [Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md); [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013.md); [Jer
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md); [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md), [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md); [Eze
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 6:15</span></span>

ROSENMULLER translates, "They ought to have been ashamed, because . . .
but," &c.; the Hebrew verb often expressing, not the action, but the
duty to perform it ([Gen 20:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#009.md); [Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md). MAURER translates, "They shall
be put to shame, for they commit abomination; nay (the prophet
correcting himself), there is no shame in them" ([Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Jer
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012.md); [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007.md); [Zep
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#005).md).

them that fall--They shall fall with the rest of their people who are
doomed to fall, that is, I will now cease from words; I will execute
vengeance \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 6:16</span></span>

Image from travellers who have lost their road, stopping and inquiring
which is the right way on which they once had been, but from which they
have wandered.

old paths--Idolatry and apostasy are the modern way; the worship of God
the old way. Evil is not coeval with good, but a modern degeneracy from
good. The forsaking of God is not, in a true sense, a "way cast up" at
all ([Jer 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#015.md); [Psa
139:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#024.md); [Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004).md).

rest-- ([Isa 28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012.md); [Mat
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029).md).

[Jeremiah 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 6:17</span></span>

watchmen--prophets, whose duty it was to announce impending calamities,
so as to lead the people to repentance ([Isa
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#011.md); [Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md); [Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md); [Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 6:18</span></span>

congregation--parallel to "nations"; it therefore means the gathered
peoples who are invited to be witnesses as to how great is the
perversity of the Israelites ([Jer
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md), and that they deserve the
severe punishment about to be inflicted on them ([Jer
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019).md).

what is among them--what deeds are committed by the Israelites ([Jer
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md) \[MAURER\]. Or, "what
punishments are about to be inflicted on them" \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 6:19</span></span>

([Isa 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002).md).

fruit of . . . thoughts-- ([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md).

nor to my law, but rejected it--literally, "and (as to) My law they have
rejected it." The same construction occurs in [Gen
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#024.md). Literally, "To what purpose is
this to Me, that incense cometh to Me?"

incense . . . cane-- ([Isa 43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md); [Isa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006).md). No external services are
accepted by God without obedience of the heart and life ([Jer
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md); [Psa
50:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#007.md); [Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006), &c..md).

sweet . . . sweet--antithesis. Your sweet cane is not sweet to Me. The
calamus.

[Jeremiah 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 6:21</span></span>

stumbling-blocks--instruments of the Jews' ruin (compare [Mat
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md); [Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008)). God Himself ("I".md) lays them
before the reprobate ([Psa 69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md); [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Rom
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009).md).

fathers . . . sons . . . neighbour . . . friend--indiscriminate ruin.

[Jeremiah 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 6:22</span></span>

north . . . sides of the earth--The ancients were little acquainted with
the north; therefore it is called the remotest regions (as the Hebrew
for "sides" ought to be translated, see on [Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013).md) of the earth. The Chaldees are
meant ([Jer 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md); [Jer
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015).md). It is striking that the very
same calamities which the Chaldeans had inflicted on Zion are threatened
as the retribution to be dealt in turn to themselves by Jehovah ([Jer
50:41-43](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041).md).

[Jeremiah 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 6:23</span></span>

like the sea-- ([Isa 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#030).md).

as men for war--not that they were like warriors, for they were
warriors; but "arrayed most perfectly as warriors" \[MAURER\].

[Jeremiah 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 6:24</span></span>

fame thereof--the report of them.

[Jeremiah 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 6:25</span></span>

He addresses "the daughter of Zion" ([Jer
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#023).md); caution to the citizens of
Jerusalem not to expose themselves to the enemy by going outside of the
city walls,

sword of the enemy--literally "there is a sword to the enemy"; the enemy
hath a sword.

[Jeremiah 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 6:26</span></span>

wallow . . . in ashes-- ([Jer 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md);
[Mic 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010).md). As they usually in
mourning only "cast ashes on the head," wallowing in them means
something more, namely, so entirely to cover one's self with ashes as to
be like one who had rolled in them ([Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030).md).

as for an only son-- ([Amo 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#010.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md).

lamentation--literally, "lamentation expressed by beating the breast."

[Jeremiah 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 6:27</span></span>

tower . . . fortress-- ([Jer 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018).md),
rather, "an assayer (and) explorer." By a metaphor from metallurgy in
[Jer 6:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027.md), Jehovah, in conclusion,
confirms the prophet in his office, and the latter sums up the
description of the reprobate people on whom he had to work. The Hebrew
for "assayer" (English Version, "tower") is from a root "to try" metals.
"Explorer" (English Version, "fortress") is from an Arabic root,
"keen-sighted"; or a Hebrew root, "cutting," that is, separating the
metal from the dross \[EWALD\]. GESENIUS translates as English Version,
"fortress," which does not accord with the previous "assayer."

[Jeremiah 6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 6:28</span></span>

grievous revolters--literally "contumacious of the contumacious," that
is, most contumacious, the Hebrew mode of expressing a superlative. So
"the strong among the mighty," that is, the strongest ([Eze
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#021).md). See [Jer
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#023.md); [Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md).

walking with slanders-- ([Jer 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004).md).
"Going about for the purpose of slandering" \[MAURER\].

brass, &c.--that is, copper. It and "iron" being the baser and harder
metals express the debased and obdurate character of the Jews ([Isa
48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md); [Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 6:29</span></span>

bellows . . . burned--So intense a heat is made that the very bellows
are almost set on fire. ROSENMULLER translates not so well from a Hebrew
root, "pant" or "snort," referring to the sound of the bellows blown
hard.

lead--employed to separate the baser metal from the silver, as
quicksilver is now used. In other words, the utmost pains have been used
to purify Israel in the furnace of affliction, but in vain ([Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).md).

consumed of the fire--In the Chetib, or Hebrew text, the "consumed" is
supplied out of the previous "burned." Translating as ROSENMULLER,
"pant," this will be inadmissible; and the Keri (Hebrew Margin) division
of the Hebrew words will have to be read, to get "is consumed of the
fire." This is an argument for the translation, "are burned."

founder--the refiner.

wicked . . . not plucked away--answering to the dross which has no good
metal to be separated, the mass being all dross.

[Jeremiah 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 6:30</span></span>

Reprobate--silver so full of alloy as to be utterly worthless ([Isa
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022).md). The Jews were fit only for
rejection.

The prophet stood at the gate of the temple in order that the multitudes
from the country might hear him. His life was threatened, it appears
from [Jer 26:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md), for this prophecy,
denouncing the fate of Shiloh as about to befall the temple at
Jerusalem. The prophecy given in detail here is summarily referred to
there. After Josiah's death the nation relapsed into idolatry through
Jehoiakim's bad influence; the worship of Jehovah was, however, combined
with it ([Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md), [Jer
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#010).md).
