### [Micah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

[Micah 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mic 4:1</span></span>

TRANSITION TO THE GLORY, PEACE, KINGDOM, AND VICTORY OF ZION. ([Mic
4:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001).md)

Almost identical with [Isa 2:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md).

the mountain of the house of the Lord--which just before ([Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012).md) had been doomed to be a wild
forest height. Under Messiah, its elevation is to be not that of
situation, but of moral dignity, as the seat of God's universal empire.

people shall flow into it--In Isaiah it is "all nations": a more
universal prophecy.

[Micah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mic 4:3</span></span>

rebuke--convict of sin ([Joh 16:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008).md);
and subdue with judgments ([Psa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#005.md),
[Psa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md); [Psa
110:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#005.md); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027.md); [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005).md).

many people . . . strong nations afar off--In [Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md) it is "the nations . . . many
people."

[Micah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mic 4:4</span></span>

sit every man under his vine, &c.--that is, enjoy the most prosperous
tranquillity ([Kg1 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#025.md); [Zac
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010).md). The "vine" and "fig tree" are
mentioned rather than a house, to signify, there will be no need of a
covert; men will be safe even in the fields and open air.

Lord of hosts hath spoken it--Therefore it must come to pass, however
unlikely now it may seem.

[Micah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mic 4:5</span></span>

For--rather, Though it be that all people walk after their several gods,
yet we (the Jews in the dispersion) will walk in the name of the Lord.
So the Hebrew particle means in the Margin, [Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Exo
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md); [Jos
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md). The resolution of the exile
Jews is: As Jehovah gives us hope of so glorious a restoration,
notwithstanding the overthrow of our temple and nation, we must in
confident reliance on His promise persevere in the true worship of Him,
however the nations around, our superiors now in strength and numbers,
walk after their gods \[ROSENMULLER\]. As the Jews were thoroughly
weaned from idols by the Babylonian captivity, so they shall be
completely cured of unbelief by their present long dispersion ([Zac
10:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008).md).

[Micah 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mic 4:6</span></span>

assemble her that halteth--feminine for neuter in Hebrew idiom,
"whatever halteth": metaphor from sheep wearied out with a journey: all
the suffering exiles of Israel ([Eze
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016.md); [Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019).md).

her . . . driven out--all Israel's outcasts. Called "the Lord's flock"
([Jer 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md); [Eze
34:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#013.md); [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021).md).

[Micah 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mic 4:7</span></span>

I will make her that halted a remnant--I will cause a remnant to remain
which shall not perish.

Lord shall reign . . . in . . . Zion--David's kingdom shall be restored
in the person of Messiah, who is the seed of David and at the same time
Jehovah ([Isa 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023).md).

for ever-- ([Isa 9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md), [Dan
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md); [Luk
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033.md); [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md).

[Micah 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mic 4:8</span></span>

tower of the flock--following up the metaphor of sheep (see on [Mic
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006).md). Jerusalem is called the "tower,"
from which the King and Shepherd observes and guards His flock: both the
spiritual Jerusalem, the Church now whose tower-like elevation is that
of doctrine and practice ([Sol 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004.md),
"Thy neck is like the tower of David"), and the literal hereafter ([Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017).md). In large pastures it was usual
to erect a high wooden tower, so as to oversee the flock. JEROME takes
the Hebrew for "flock," Eder or Edar, as a proper name, namely, a
village near Beth-lehem, for which it is put, Beth-lehem being taken to
represent the royal stock of David ([Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md); compare [Gen
35:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#021).md). But the explanatory words,
"the stronghold of the daughter of Zion," confirm English Version.

stronghold--Hebrew, "Ophel"; an impregnable height on Mount Zion ([Ch2
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003.md); [Ch2
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md); [Neh
3:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026).md).

unto thee shall . . . come . . . the first dominion--namely, the
dominion formerly exercised by thee shall come back to thee.

kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem--rather, "the kingdom of
the daughter of Jerusalem shall come (again)"; such as it was under
David, before its being weakened by the secession of the ten tribes.

[Micah 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mic 4:9</span></span>

Addressed to the daughter of Zion, in her consternation at the approach
of the Chaldeans.

is there no king in thee?--asked tauntingly. There is a king in her; but
it is the same as if there were none, so helpless to devise means of
escape are he and his counsellors \[MAURER\]. Or, Zion's pains are
because her king is taken away from her ([Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009.md); [Lam
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md); [Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013).md) \[CALVIN\]. The former is
perhaps the preferable view (compare [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007).md). The latter, however, describes
better Zion's kingless state during her present long dispersion ([Hos
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md).

[Micah 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mic 4:10</span></span>

Be in pain, and labour--carrying on the metaphor of a pregnant woman.
Thou shalt be affected with bitter sorrows before thy deliverance shall
come. I do not forbid thy grieving, but I bring thee consolation. Though
God cares for His children, yet they must not expect to be exempt from
trouble, but must prepare for it.

go forth out of the city--on its capture. So "come out" is used [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md); [Isa
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#016.md).

dwell in the field--namely, in the open country, defenseless, instead of
their fortified city. Beside the Chebar ([Psa
137:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md); [Eze
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#015).md).

Babylon--Like Isaiah, Micah looks beyond the existing Assyrian dynasty
to the Babylonian, and to Judah's captivity under it, and restoration
([Isa 39:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#007.md); [Isa
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#014.md); [Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020).md). Had they been, as rationalists
represent, merely sagacious politicians, they would have restricted
their prophecies to the sphere of the existing Assyrian dynasty. But
their seeing into the far-off future of Babylon's subsequent supremacy,
and Judah's connection with her, proves them to be inspired prophets.

there . . . there--emphatic repetition. The very scene of thy calamities
is to be the scene of thy deliverance. In the midst of enemies, where
all hope seems cut off, there shall Cyrus, the deliverer, appear
(compare [Jdg 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#014).md). Cyrus again
being the type of the greater Deliverer, who shall finally restore
Israel.

[Micah 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mic 4:11</span></span>

many nations--the subject peoples composing Babylon's armies: and also
Edom, Ammon, &c., who exulted in Judah's fall ([Lam
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#016.md); [Oba
1:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011).md).

defiled--metaphor from a virgin. Let her be defiled (that is, outraged
by violence and bloodshed), and let our eye gaze insultingly on her
shame and sorrow ([Mic 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010).md). Her foes
desired to feast their eyes on her calamities.

[Micah 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mic 4:12</span></span>

thoughts of the Lord--Their unsearchable wisdom, overruling seeming
disaster to the final good of His people, is the very ground on which
the restoration of Israel hereafter (of which the restoration from
Babylon is a type) is based in [Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md); compare with [Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md), [Mic
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#012.md), which prove that Israel, not
merely the Christian Church, is the ultimate subject of the prophecy;
also in [Rom 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md). God's counsel is
to discipline His people for a time with the foe as a scourge; and then
to destroy the foe by the hands of His people.

gather them as . . . sheaves--them who "gathered" themselves for Zion's
destruction ([Mic 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011).md) the Lord
"shall gather" for destruction by Zion ([Mic
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013).md), like sheaves gathered to be
threshed (compare [Isa 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#010.md); [Jer
51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033).md). The Hebrew is singular,
"sheaf." However great the numbers of the foe, they are all but as one
sheaf ready to be threshed \[CALVIN\]. Threshing was done by treading
with the feet: hence the propriety of the image for treading under foot
and breaking asunder the foe.

[Micah 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mic 4:13</span></span>

thresh--destroy thy foes "gathered" by Jehovah as "sheaves" ([Isa
41:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#015).md).

thine horn--Zion being compared to an ox treading corn, and an ox's
strength lying in the horns, her strength is implied by giving her a
horn of iron (compare [Kg1 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#011).md).

beat in pieces many-- ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044).md).

I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord--God subjects the nations to
Zion, not for her own selfish aggrandizement, but for His glory ([Isa
60:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#006.md), [Isa
60:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#009.md); [Zac
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020.md), with which compare [Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018).md) and for their ultimate good;
therefore He is here called, not merely God of Israel, but "Lord of the
whole earth."
