### [Psalms Chapter 123](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 123:1</span></span>

An earnest and expecting prayer for divine aid in distress. ([Psa
123:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001).md)

(Compare [Psa 121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001).md).

thou that dwellest--literally, "sittest as enthroned" (compare [Psa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004.md); [Psa
113:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 123:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 123:2</span></span>

Deference, submission, and trust, are all expressed by the figure. In
the East, servants in attending on their masters are almost wholly
directed by signs, which require the closest observance of the hands of
the latter. The servants of God should look (1) to His directing hand,
to appoint them their work; (2) to His supplying hand ([Psa
104:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#028).md), to give them their portion in
due season; (3) to His protecting hand, to right them when wronged; (4)
to His correcting hand ([Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md);
[Pe1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md); compare [Gen
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#006)); (5.md) to His rewarding hand.

[Psalms 123:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 123:3</span></span>

contempt--was that of the heathen, and, perhaps, Samaritans ([Neh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh001.htm#003.md); [Neh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#019).md).

[Psalms 123:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 123:4</span></span>

of those that are at ease--self-complacently, disregarding God's law,
and despising His people.
