### [Isaiah Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 7:1</span></span>

PREDICTION OF THE ILL SUCCESS OF THE SYRO-ISRAELITISH INVASION OF
JUDAH--AHAZ'S ALLIANCE WITH ASSYRIA, AND ITS FATAL RESULTS TO JUDEA--YET
THE CERTAINTY OF FINAL PRESERVATION AND OF THE COMING OF MESSIAH. (Isa.
7:1-9:7)

Ahaz--In the first years of his reign the design of the two kings
against Judah was carried out, which was formed in Jotham's reign ([Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037).md).

Syria--Hebrew, Aram ([Gen 10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#022).md),
originally the whole region between the Euphrates and Mediterranean,
including Assyria, of which Syria is an abbreviation; here the region
round Damascus, and along Mount Libanus.

Jerusalem--An actual siege of it took place, but was foiled ([Kg2
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 7:2</span></span>

is confederate with--rather, is encamped upon the territory of Ephraim
\[MAURER\], or better, as Rezin was encamped against Jerusalem, "is
supported by" \[LOWTH\] Ephraim, whose land lay between Syria and Judah.
The mention of "David" alludes, in sad contrast with the present, to the
time when David made Syria subject to him ([Sa2
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#006).md).

Ephraim--the ten tribes.

as . . . trees of . . . wood--a simultaneous agitation.

[Isaiah 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 7:3</span></span>

Go forth--out of the city, to the place where Ahaz was superintending
the works for defense and the cutting off of the water supply from the
enemy, and securing it to the city. So [Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009.md); [Ch2
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#004.md).

Shearjashub--that is, A remnant shall return ([Isa
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013).md). His very name [Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md); [Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md) was a standing memorial to Ahaz
and the Jews that the nation should not, notwithstanding the general
calamity ([Isa 7:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017.md); [Isa
8:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006).md), be utterly destroyed ([Isa
10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021).md).

conduit--an aqueduct from the pool or reservoir for the supply of the
city. At the foot of Zion was Fount Siloah ([Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006.md); [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md); [Joh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007).md), called also Gihon, on the west
of Jerusalem ([Ch2 32:30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#030).md). Two pools
were supplied from it, the Upper, or Old ([Isa
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#011).md), or King's ([Neh
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014).md), and the Lower ([Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009).md), which received the superfluous
waters of the upper. The upper pool is still to be seen, about seven
hundred yards from the Jaffa gate. The highway leading to the fullers'
field, which was in a position near water for the purposes of washing,
previous to drying and bleaching, the cloth, was probably alongside the
aqueduct.

[Isaiah 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 7:4</span></span>

Take heed, &c.--that is, See that thou be quiet (not seeking Assyrian
aid in a fit of panic).

tails--mere ends of firebrands, almost consumed themselves (about soon
to fall before the Assyrians, [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008).md), therefore harmless.

smoking--as about to go out; not blazing.

son of Remaliah--Pekah, a usurper ([Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025).md). The Easterners express
contempt by designating one, not by his own name, but by his father's,
especially when the father is but little known ([Sa1
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#027.md), [Sa1
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#031).md).

[Isaiah 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 7:6</span></span>

vex--rather, "throw into consternation" \[GESENIUS\].

make a breach--rather, "cleave it asunder." Their scheme was to divide a
large portion of the territory between themselves, and set up a vassal
king of their own over the rest.

son of Tabeal--unknown; a Syrian-sounding name, perhaps favored by a
party in Jerusalem ([Isa 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md), [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md), [Isa
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 7:7</span></span>

([Isa 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010.md); [Pro
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030).md).

[Isaiah 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 7:8</span></span>

head--that is, in both Syria and Israel the capital shall remain as it
is; they shall not conquer Judah, but each shall possess only his own
dominions.

threescore and five . . . not a people--As these words break the
symmetry of the parallelism in this verse, either they ought to be
placed after "Remaliah's son," in [Isa
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md), or else they refer to some older
prophecy of Isaiah, or of Amos (as the Jewish writers represent),
parenthetically; to which, in [Isa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#008.md), the words, "If ye will not
believe . . . not be established," correspond in parallelism. One
deportation of Israel happened within one or two years from this time,
under Tiglath-pileser ([Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md).
Another in the reign of Hoshea, under Shalmaneser ([Kg2
17:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001).md), was about twenty years after.
But the final one which utterly "broke" up Israel so as to be "not a
people," accompanied by a colonization of Samaria with foreigners, was
under Esar-haddon, who carried away Manasseh, king of Judah, also, in
the twenty-second year of his reign, sixty-five years from the utterance
of this prophecy (compare [Ezr 4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#002.md),
[Ezr 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#010.md), with [Kg2
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024.md); [Ch2
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#011).md) \[USHER\]. The event, though so
far off, was enough to assure the people of Judah that as God, the Head
of the theocracy, would ultimately interpose to destroy the enemies of
His people, so they might rely on Him now.

[Isaiah 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 7:9</span></span>

believe, . . . be established--There is a paronomasia, or play on the
words, in the Hebrew: "if ye will not confide, ye shall not abide." Ahaz
brought distress on himself by distrust in the Lord, and trust in
Assyria.

[Isaiah 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 7:11</span></span>

Ask thee--since thou dost not credit the prophet's words.

sign--a miraculous token to assure thee that God will fulfil His promise
of saving Jerusalem ([Isa 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#030.md); [Isa
38:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#007).md). "Signs," facts then present
or near at hand as pledges for the more distant future, are frequent in
Isaiah.

ask . . . in . . . depth--literally, "Make deep . . . ask it," that is,
Go to the depth of the earth or of Hades \[Vulgate and LOWTH\], or,
Mount high for it (literally, "Make high"). So in [Mat
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#001.md). Signs in heaven are contrasted
with the signs on earth and below it (raising the dead) which Jesus
Christ had wrought (compare [Rom
10:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md). He offers Ahaz the widest
limits within which to make his choice.

[Isaiah 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 7:12</span></span>

neither . . . tempt--hypocritical pretext of keeping the law ([Deu
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016).md); "tempt," that is, put God to
the proof, as in [Mat 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007.md), by seeking
His miraculous interposition without warrant. But here there was the
warrant of the prophet of God; to have asked a sign, when thus offered,
would not have been a tempting of God. Ahaz' true reason for declining
was his resolve not to do God's will, but to negotiate with Assyria, and
persevere in his idolatry ([Kg2
16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md), [Kg2
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003.md), [Kg2
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md). Men often excuse their
distrust in God, and trust in their own devices, by professed reverence
for God. Ahaz may have fancied that though Jehovah was the God of Judea
and could work a sign there, that was no proof that the local god of
Syria might not be more powerful. Such was the common heathen notion
([Isa 10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#010.md); [Isa
36:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 7:13</span></span>

Is it a small thing?--Is it not enough for you ([Num
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#009).md)? The allusion to "David" is in
order to contrast his trust in God with his degenerate descendant Ahaz'
distrust.

weary--try the patience of.

men--prophets. Isaiah as yet had given no outward proof that he was from
God; but now God has offered a sign, which Ahaz publicly rejects. The
sin is therefore now not merely against "men," but openly against "God."
Isaiah's manner therefore changes from mildness to bold reproof.

[Isaiah 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 7:14</span></span>

himself--since thou wilt not ask a sign, nay, rejectest the offer of
one.

you--for the sake of the house of believing "David" (God remembering His
everlasting covenant with David), not for unbelieving Ahaz' sake.

Behold--arresting attention to the extraordinary prophecy.

virgin--from a root, "to lie hid," virgins being closely kept from men's
gaze in their parents' custody in the East. The Hebrew, and the
Septuagint here, and Greek ([Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023).md), have the article, the virgin,
some definite one known to the speaker and his hearers; primarily, the
woman, then a virgin, about immediately to become the second wife, and
bear a child, whose attainment of the age of discrimination (about three
years) should be preceded by the deliverance of Judah from its two
invaders; its fullest significancy is realized in "the woman" ([Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md), whose seed should bruise the
serpent's head and deliver captive man ([Jer
31:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#022.md); [Mic
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#003).md). Language is selected such as,
while partially applicable to the immediate event, receives its fullest,
most appropriate, and exhaustive accomplishment in Messianic events. The
New Testament application of such prophecies is not a strained
"accommodation"; rather the temporary fulfilment of an adaptation of the
far-reaching prophecy to the present passing event, which foreshadows
typically the great central end of prophecy, Jesus Christ ([Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010).md). Evidently the wording is such
as to apply more fully to Jesus Christ than to the prophet's son;
"virgin" applies, in its simplest sense, to the Virgin Mary, rather than
to the prophetess who ceased to be a virgin when she "conceived";
"Immanuel," God with us ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md);
[Rev 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md), cannot in a strict sense
apply to Isaiah's son, but only to Him who is presently called expressly
([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md), "the Child, the Son,
Wonderful (compare [Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018).md), the
mighty God." Local and temporary features (as in [Isa
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015).md) are added in every type;
otherwise it would be no type, but the thing itself. There are
resemblances to the great Antitype sufficient to be recognized by those
who seek them; dissimilarities enough to confound those who do not
desire to discover them.

call--that is, "she shall," or as Margin, "thou, O Virgin, shalt call;"
mothers often named their children ([Gen
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md), [Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025.md); [Gen
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#037.md); [Gen
29:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#032).md). In [Mat
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023.md) the expression is strikingly
changed into, "They shall call"; when the prophecy received its full
accomplishment, no longer is the name Immanuel restricted to the
prophetess' view of His character, as in its partial fulfilment in her
son; all shall then call (that is, not literally), or regard Him as
peculiarly and most fitly characterized by the descriptive name,
"Immanuel" ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md).

name--not mere appellation, which neither Isaiah's son nor Jesus Christ
bore literally; but what describes His manifested attributes; His
character (so [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md). The name in
its proper destination was not arbitrary, but characteristic of the
individual; sin destroyed the faculty of perceiving the internal being;
hence the severance now between the name and the character; in the case
of Jesus Christ and many in Scripture, the Holy Ghost has supplied this
want \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Isaiah 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 7:15</span></span>

Butter--rather, curdled milk, the acid of which is grateful in the heat
of the East ([Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017).md).

honey--abundant in Palestine ([Jdg
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#008.md); [Sa1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#025.md); [Mat
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004).md). Physicians directed that the
first food given to a child should be honey, the next milk \[BARNABAS,
Epistle\]. HORSLEY takes this as implying the real humanity of the
Immanuel Jesus Christ, about to be fed as other infants ([Luk
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052).md). [Isa
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md) shows that besides the fitness of
milk and honey for children, a state of distress of the inhabitants is
also implied, when, by reason of the invaders, milk and honey, things
produced spontaneously, shall be the only abundant articles of food
\[MAURER\].

that he may know--rather, until He shall know.

evil . . . choose . . . good--At about three years of age moral
consciousness begins (compare [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md); [Deu
1:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#039.md); [Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 7:16</span></span>

For--The deliverance implied in the name "Immanuel," and the cessation
of distress as to food ([Isa 7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md),
shall last only till the child grows to know good and evil;

for . . . the land that . . . abhorrest . . . forsaken of . . .
kings--rather, desolate shall be the land, before whose two kings thou
art alarmed \[HENGSTENBERG and GESENIUS\].

the land--namely, Syria and Samaria regarded as one ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md); [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030).md), just two years after this
prophecy, as it foretells. HORSLEY takes it, "The land (Judah and
Samaria) of (the former of) which thou art the plague (literally,
'thorn') shall be forsaken," &c.; a prediction thus, that Judah and
Israel (appropriately regarded as one "land") should cease to be
kingdoms ([Luk 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md) before Immanuel came.

Though temporary deliverance ([Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md); [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004).md) was to be given then, and final
deliverance through Messiah, sore punishment shall follow the former.
After subduing Syria and Israel, the Assyrians shall encounter Egypt
([Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029).md), and Judah shall be the
battlefield of both ([Isa 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md), and
be made tributary to that very Assyria ([Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020.md); [Kg2
16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md) now about to be called in as
an ally ([Isa 39:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001).md). Egypt, too,
should prove a fatal ally ([Isa 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#006.md);
[Isa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001), &c..md).

[Isaiah 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md)

FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF AHAZ' ASSYRIAN POLICY. ([Isa
7:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017).md)

hiss--whistle, to bring bees to settle (see on [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026).md).

fly--found in numbers about the arms of the Nile and the canals from it
([Isa 19:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005.md); [Isa
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#003).md), here called "rivers." Hence
arose the plague of flies ([Exo 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#021).md).
Figurative, for numerous and troublesome foes from the remotest parts of
Egypt, for example, Pharaoh-nechoh.

bee-- ([Deu 1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md); [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012).md). As numerous in Assyria as the
fly in marshy Egypt. Sennacherib, Esar-haddon, and Nebuchadnezzar
fulfilled this prediction.

[Isaiah 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 7:19</span></span>

rest--image of flies and bees kept up. The enemy shall overspread the
land everywhere, even in "desolate valleys."

thorns--wild, contrasted with "bushes," which were valued and objects of
care (see Margin).

[Isaiah 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 7:20</span></span>

razor--The Assyrians are to be God's instrument of devastating Judea,
just as a razor sweeps away all hair before it ([Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Eze
29:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#019).md).

hired--alluding to Ahaz' hiring ([Kg2
16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007).md) Tiglath-pileser against Syria
and Israel; namely,

by them beyond the river--namely, the Euphrates; the eastern boundary of
Jewish geographical knowledge ([Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008).md); the river which Abram crossed;
the Nile also may be included ([Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md) \[G. V. SMITH\]. GESENIUS
translates, "With a razor hired in the parts beyond the river."

head . . . feet--the whole body, including the most honored parts. To
cut the "beard" is the greatest indignity to an Easterner ([Isa
50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006.md); [Sa2
10:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004.md); [Eze
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001).md).

THE COMING DESOLATE STATE OF THE LAND OWING TO THE ASSYRIANS AND
EGYPTIANS. ([Isa 7:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#021).md)

nourish--that is, own.

young cow--a heifer giving milk. Agriculture shall cease, and the land
become one great pasturage.

[Isaiah 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 7:22</span></span>

abundance--by reason of the wide range of land lying desolate over which
the cows and sheep (including goats) may range.

butter--thick milk, or cream.

honey--(See on [Isa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015).md). Food of
spontaneous growth will be the resource of the few inhabitants left.
Honey shall be abundant as the bees will find the wild flowers abounding
everywhere.

[Isaiah 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 7:23</span></span>

where there were, &c.--where up to that time there was so valuable a
vineyard as to have in it a 1000 vines, worth a silverling (shekel,
about 2s. 3d.; a large price) each, there shall be only briers ([Sol
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011).md). Vineyards are estimated by the
number of the vines, and the goodness of the kind of vine. Judea admits
of a high state of cultivation, and requires it, in order to be
productive; its present barrenness is due to neglect.

[Isaiah 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 7:24</span></span>

It shall become a vast hunting ground, abounding in wild beasts (compare
[Jer 49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 7:25</span></span>

shall be--rather, "were once."

digged--in order to plant and rear vines ([Isa
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006).md).

there shall not come--that is, none shall come who fear thorns, seeing
that thorns shall abound on all sides \[MAURER\]. Otherwise, "Thou shalt
not come for fear of thorns" \[GESENIUS\]. Only cattle shall be able to

The first seven verses of the ninth chapter belong to this section. The
eighth chapter continues the subject of the seventh chapter, but at a
later period (compare [Isa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004.md) with
[Isa 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016).md); implying that the interval
till the accomplishment is shorter now than then. The tone of [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md), [Isa
8:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#021.md), expresses calamity more
immediate and afflictive than [Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md), [Isa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#015.md), [Isa
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#022.md).
