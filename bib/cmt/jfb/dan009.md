### [Daniel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)

[Daniel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">dan 9:1</span></span>

DANIEL'S CONFESSION AND PRAYER FOR JERUSALEM: GABRIEL COMFORTS HIM BY
THE PROPHECY OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS. (Dan. 9:1-27)

first year of Darius--Cyaxares II, in whose name Cyrus, his nephew,
son-in-law, and successor, took Babylon, 538 B.C. The date of this
chapter is therefore 537 B.C., a year before Cyrus permitted the Jews to
return from exile, and sixty-nine years after Daniel had been carried
captive at the beginning of the captivity, 606 B.C.

son of Ahasuerus--called Astyages by XENOPHON. Ahasuerus was a name
common to many of the kings of Medo-Persia.

made king--The phrase implies that Darius owed the kingdom not to his
own prowess, but to that of another, namely, Cyrus.

[Daniel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">dan 9:2</span></span>

understood by books--rather, "letters," that is, Jeremiah's letter ([Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)) to the captives in Babylon;
also [Jer 25:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011); compare [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021); [Jer
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#018); [Jer
31:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038). God's promises are the ground
on which we should, like Daniel, rest sure hope; not so as to make our
prayers needless, but rather to encourage them.

[Daniel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">dan 9:3</span></span>

prayer . . . supplications--literally, "intercessions . . . entreaties
for mercy." Praying for blessings, and deprecating evils.

[Daniel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">dan 9:4</span></span>

my confession--according to God's promises in [Lev
26:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039), that if Israel in exile for
sin should repent and confess, God would remember for them His covenant
with Abraham (compare [Deu 30:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001);
[Jer 29:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012); [Jam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010)). God's promise was absolute, but
prayer also was ordained as about to precede its fulfilment, this too
being the work of God in His people, as much as the external restoration
which was to follow. So it shall be at Israel's final restoration ([Psa
102:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)). Daniel takes his
countrymen's place of confession of sin, identifying himself with them,
and, as their representative and intercessory priest, "accepts the
punishment of their iniquity." Thus he typifies Messiah, the Sin-bearer
and great Intercessor. The prophet's own life and experience form the
fit starting point of the prophecy concerning the sin atonement. He
prays for Israel's restoration as associated in the prophets (compare
[Jer 31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004), [Jer
31:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#011), [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031), &c.) with the hope of Messiah.
The revelation, now granted, analyzes into its successive parts that
which the prophets, in prophetical perspective, heretofore saw together
in one; namely, the redemption from captivity, and the full Messianic
redemption. God's servants, who, like Noah's father ([Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029)), hoped many a time that now the
Comforter of their afflictions was at hand, had to wait from age to age,
and to view preceding fulfilments only as pledges of the coming of Him
whom they so earnestly desired to see ([Mat
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017)); as now also Christians, who
believe that the Lord's second coming is nigh, are expected to continue
waiting. So Daniel is informed of a long period of seventy prophetic
weeks before Messiah's coming, instead of seventy years, as he might
have expected (compare [Mat 18:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021))
\[AUBERLEN\].

great and dreadful God--as we know to our cost by the calamities we
suffer. The greatness of God and His dreadful abhorrence of sin should
prepare sinners for reverent, humble acknowledgment of the justice of
their punishment.

keeping . . . covenant and mercy--that is, the covenant of Thy mercy,
whereby Thou hast promised to deliver us, not for our merits, but of Thy
mercy ([Eze 36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#022)). So weak and
sinful is man that any covenant for good on God's part with him, to take
effect, must depend solely on His grace. If He be a God to be feared for
His justice, He is one to be trusted for His "mercy."

love . . . keep his commandments--Keeping His commandments is the only
sure test of love to God ([Joh 14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015)).

[Daniel 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">dan 9:5</span></span>

Compare Nehemiah's confession (Neh. 9:1-38).

sinned . . . committed iniquity . . . done wickedly . . . rebelled--a
climax. Erred in ignorance . . . sinned by infirmity . . . habitually
and wilfully done wickedness . . . as open and obstinate rebels set
ourselves against God.

[Daniel 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">dan 9:6</span></span>

prophets . . . spake . . . to our kings . . . to all the people--They
fearlessly warned all without respect of persons.

[Daniel 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">dan 9:7</span></span>

confusion of faces, as at this day--Shame at our guilt, betrayed in our
countenance, is what belongs to us; as our punishment "at this day"
attests.

near, and . . . far off--the chastisement, however varied, some Jews not
being cast off so far from Jerusalem as others, all alike were sharers
in the guilt.

[Daniel 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">dan 9:9</span></span>

mercies--The plural intensifies the force; mercy manifold and exhibited
in countless ways. As it is humbling to recollect "righteousness
belongeth unto God," so it is comforting, that "mercies belong to the
Lord OUR God."

though we have rebelled--rather, "since," &c. \[Vulgate\], ([Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011)). Our punishment is not
inconsistent with His "mercies," since we have rebelled against Him.

[Daniel 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">dan 9:10</span></span>

set before us--not ambiguously, but plainly, so that we were without
excuse.

[Daniel 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">dan 9:11</span></span>

all-- ([Psa 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003); [Rom
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012)).

the curse . . . and . . . oath . . . in . . . law--the curse against
Israel, if disobedient, which God ratified by oath (Lev. 26:14-39; [Deu
27:15-26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#015); Deu. 28:15-68; Deu.
29:1-29).

[Daniel 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">dan 9:12</span></span>

confirmed his words--showed by the punishments we suffer, that His words
were no idle threats.

under . . . heaven hath not been done as . . . upon Jerusalem-- ([Lam
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012)).

[Daniel 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">dan 9:13</span></span>

yet made we not our prayer before--literally, "soothed not the face of."
Not even our chastisement has taught us penitence ([Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003); [Hos
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010)). Diseased, we spurn the healing
medicine.

that we might turn, &c.--Prayer can only be accepted when joined with
the desire to turn from sin to God ([Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009)).

understand thy truth--"attentively regard Thy faithfulness" in
fulfilling Thy promises, and also Thy threats \[CALVIN\]. Thy law ([Dan
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012)), \[MAURER\].

[Daniel 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">dan 9:14</span></span>

watched upon the evil--expressing ceaseless vigilance that His people's
sins might not escape His judgment, as a watchman on guard night and day
([Job 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#016); [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028); [Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027)). God watching upon the Jews
punishment forms a striking contrast to the Jews slumbering in their
sins.

God is righteous--True penitents "justify" God, "ascribing righteousness
to Him," instead of complaining of their punishment as too severe ([Neh
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033); [Job
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#003); [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004); [Lam
3:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#039)).

[Daniel 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">dan 9:15</span></span>

brought thy people . . . out of . . . Egypt--a proof to all ages that
the seed of Abraham is Thy covenant-people. That ancient benefit gives
us hope that Thou wilt confer a like one on us now under similar
circumstances ([Psa 80:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008); [Jer
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#021); [Jer
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007)).

as at this day--is known.

[Daniel 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">dan 9:16</span></span>

thy righteousness--not stern justice in punishing, but Thy faithfulness
to Thy promises of mercy to them who trust in Thee ([Psa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001); [Psa
143:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#001)).

thy city--chosen as Thine in the election of grace, which changes not.

for . . . iniquities of . . . fathers-- ([Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)). He does not impugn God's
justice in this, as did the murmurers ([Eze
18:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002); compare [Jer
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029)).

thy people . . . a reproach--which brings reproach on Thy name. "All the
nations that are about us" will say that Thou, Jehovah, wast not able to
save Thy peculiar people. So [Dan
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017), "for the Lord's sake"; [Dan
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019), "for Thine own sake" ([Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009), [Isa
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011)).

[Daniel 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">dan 9:17</span></span>

cause thy face to shine--metaphor from the sun, which gladdens all that
it beams upon ([Num 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#025); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)).

[Daniel 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">dan 9:18</span></span>

present . . . supplications--literally, "cause to fall," &c. (compare
Note, see on [Jer 36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007)).

[Daniel 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">dan 9:19</span></span>

The short broken ejaculations and repetitions show the intense fervor of
his supplications.

defer not--He implies that the seventy years are now all but complete.

thine own sake--often repeated, as being the strongest plea ([Jer
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#021)).

[Daniel 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">dan 9:20</span></span>

whiles I was speaking--repeated in [Dan
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021); emphatically marking that the
answer was given before the prayer was completed, as God promised ([Isa
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#019); [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024); compare [Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005)).

[Daniel 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">dan 9:21</span></span>

I had seen in the vision at the beginning--namely, in the former vision
by the river Ulai ([Dan 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#001), [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016)).

fly swiftly--literally, "with weariness," that is, move swiftly as one
breathless and wearied out with quick running \[GESENIUS\]. English
Version is better ([Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002); [Eze
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006); [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006)).

time of . . . evening oblation--the ninth hour, three o'clock (compare
[Kg1 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#036)). As formerly, when the
temple stood, this hour was devoted to sacrifices, so now to prayer.
Daniel, during the whole captivity to the very last, with pious
patriotism never forgot God's temple-worship, but speaks of its rites
long abolished, as if still in use.

[Daniel 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">dan 9:22</span></span>

to give thee . . . understanding-- [Dan
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016); [Dan
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026) shows that the symbolical vision
had not been understood. God therefore now gives "information" directly,
instead of by symbol, which required interpretation.

[Daniel 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">dan 9:23</span></span>

At the beginning of thy supplications, &c.--The promulgation of the
divine decree was made in heaven to the angels as soon as Daniel began
to pray.

came forth--from the divine throne; so [Dan
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#022).

thou art greatly beloved--literally, "a man of desires" (compare [Eze
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#006), [Eze
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012)); the object of God's delight.
As the apocalyptic prophet of the New Testament was "the disciple whom
Jesus loved," so the apocalyptic prophet of the Old Testament was
"greatly beloved" of God.

the vision--the further revelation as to Messiah in connection with
Jeremiah's prophecy of seventy years of the captivity. The charge to
"understand" is the same as in [Mat
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015), where Rome primarily, and
Antichrist ultimately, is referred to (compare Note, see on [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)).

[Daniel 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">dan 9:24</span></span>

Seventy weeks--namely, of years; literally, "Seventy sevens"; seventy
heptads or hebdomads; four hundred ninety years; expressed in a form of
"concealed definiteness" \[HENGSTENBERG\], a usual way with the
prophets. The Babylonian captivity is a turning point in the history of
the kingdom of God. It terminated the free Old Testament theocracy. Up
to that time Israel, though oppressed at times, was; as a rule, free.
From the Babylonian captivity the theocracy never recovered its full
freedom down to its entire suspension by Rome; and this period of
Israel's subjection to the Gentiles is to continue till the millennium
([Rev 20:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#001)), when Israel shall be
restored as head of the New Testament theocracy, which will embrace the
whole earth. The free theocracy ceased in the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar, and the fourth of Jehoiakim; the year of the world 3338,
the point at which the seventy years of the captivity. begin. Heretofore
Israel had a right, if subjugated by a foreign king, to shake off the
yoke (Jdg. 4:1-5:31; [Kg2 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#007)) as an
unlawful one, at the first opportunity. But the prophets ([Jer
27:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009)) declared it to be God's will
that they should submit to Babylon. Hence every effort of Jehoiakim,
Jeconiah, and Zedekiah to rebel was vain. The period of the world times,
and of Israel's depression, from the Babylonian captivity to the
millennium, though abounding more in afflictions (for example, the two
destructions of Jerusalem, Antiochus' persecution, and those which
Christians suffered), contains all that was good in the preceding ones,
summed up in Christ, but in a way visible only to the eye of faith.
Since He came as a servant, He chose for His appearing the period
darkest of all as to His people's temporal state. Always fresh
persecutors have been rising, whose end is destruction, and so it shall
be with the last enemy, Antichrist. As the Davidic epoch is the point of
the covenant-people's highest glory, so the captivity is that of their
lowest humiliation. Accordingly, the people's sufferings are reflected
in the picture of the suffering Messiah. He is no longer represented as
the theocratic King, the Antitype of David, but as the Servant of God
and Son of man; at the same time the cross being the way to glory
(compare Dan. 9:1-27 with [Dan
2:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#034), [Dan
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044); [Dan
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)). In the second and seventh
chapters, Christ's first coming is not noticed, for Daniel's object was
to prophesy to his nation as to the whole period from the destruction to
the re-establishment of Israel; but this ninth chapter minutely predicts
Christ's first coming, and its effects on the covenant people. The
seventy weeks date thirteen years before the rebuilding of Jerusalem;
for then the re-establishment of the theocracy began, namely, at the
return of Ezra to Jerusalem, 457 B.C. So Jeremiah's seventy years of the
captivity begin 606 B.C., eighteen years before the destruction of
Jerusalem, for then Judah ceased to exist as an independent theocracy,
having fallen under the sway of Babylon. Two periods are marked in Ezra:
(1) The return from the captivity under Jeshua and Zerubbabel, and
rebuilding of the temple, which was the first anxiety of the theocratic
nation. (2) The return of Ezra (regarded by the Jews as a second Moses)
from Persia to Jerusalem, the restoration of the city, the nationality,
and the law. Artaxerxes, in the seventh year of his reign, gave him the
commission which virtually includes permission to rebuild the city,
afterwards confirmed to, and carried out by, Nehemiah in the twentieth
year ([Ezr 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#009); [Ezr
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#011), &c.). [Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025), "from the going forth of the
commandment to build Jerusalem," proves that the second of the two
periods is referred to. The words in [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024) are not, "are determined upon the
holy city," but "upon thy people and thy holy city"; thus the
restoration of the religious national polity and the law (the inner work
fulfilled by Ezra the priest), and the rebuilding of the houses and
walls (the outer work of Nehemiah, the governor), are both included in
[Dan 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025), "restore and build
Jerusalem." "Jerusalem" represents both the city, the body, and the
congregation, the soul of the state. Compare [Psa
46:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001); [Psa
48:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001); [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001). The starting-point of the
seventy weeks dated from eighty-one years after Daniel received the
prophecy: the object being not to fix for him definitely the time, but
for the Church: the prophecy taught him that the Messianic redemption,
which he thought near, was separated from him by at least a half
millennium. Expectation was sufficiently kept alive by the general
conception of the time; not only the Jews, but many Gentiles looked for
some great Lord of the earth to spring from Judea at that very time
\[TACITUS, Histories, 5.13; SUETONIUS, Vespasian, 4\]. Ezra's placing of
Daniel in the canon immediately before his own book and Nehemiah's was
perhaps owing to his feeling that he himself brought about the beginning
of the fulfilment of the prophecy ([Dan
9:20-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)) \[ AUBERLEN\].

determined--literally, "cut out," namely, from the whole course of time,
for God to deal in a particular manner with Jerusalem.

thy . . . thy--Daniel had in his prayer often spoken of Israel as "Thy
people, Thy holy city"; but Gabriel, in reply, speaks of them as
Daniel's ("thy . . . thy") people and city, God thus intimating that
until the "everlasting righteousness" should be brought in by Messiah,
He could not fully own them as His \[TREGELLES\] (compare [Exo
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007)). Rather, as God is wishing to
console Daniel and the godly Jews, "the people whom thou art so
anxiously praying for"; such weight does God give to the intercessions
of the righteous ([Jam 5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)).

finish--literally "shut up"; remove from God's sight, that is, abolish
([Psa 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#009)) \[LENGKERKE\]. The seventy
years exile was a punishment, but not a full atonement, for the sin of
the people; this would come only after seventy prophetic weeks, through
Messiah.

make an end of--The Hebrew reading, "to steal," that is, to hide out of
sight (from the custom of sealing up things to be concealed, compare
[Job 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#007)), is better supported.

make reconciliation for--literally, "to cover," to overlay (as with
pitch, [Gen 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#014)). Compare [Psa
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001).

bring in everlasting righteousness--namely, the restoration of the
normal state between God and man ([Jer
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)); to continue eternally ([Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012); [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006)).

seal up . . . vision . . . prophecy--literally, "prophet." To give the
seal of confirmation to the prophet and his vision by the fulfilment.

anoint the Most Holy--primarily, to "anoint," or to consecrate after its
pollution "the Most Holy" place but mainly Messiah, the antitype to the
Most Holy place ([Joh 2:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019)). The
propitiatory in the temple (the same Greek word expresses the mercy seat
and propitiation, [Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025)), which
the Jews looked for at the restoration from Babylon, shall have its true
realization only in Messiah. For it is only when sin is "made an end of"
that God's presence can be perfectly manifested. As to "anoint," compare
[Exo 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#009), [Exo
40:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo040.htm#034). Messiah was anointed with the
Holy Ghost ([Act 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027); [Act
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038)). So hereafter, God-Messiah will
"anoint" or consecrate with His presence the holy place at Jerusalem
([Jer 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016); [Eze
37:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027)), after its pollution by
Antichrist, of which the feast of dedication after the pollution by
Antiochus was a type.

[Daniel 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">dan 9:25</span></span>

from the going forth of the commandment--namely the command from God,
whence originated the command of the Persian king ([Ezr
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#014)). AUBERLEN remarks, there is but
one Apocalypse in each Testament. Its purpose in each is to sum up all
the preceding prophecies, previous to the "troublous times" of the
Gentiles, in which there was to be no revelation. Daniel sums up all the
previous Messianic prophecy, separating into its individual phases what
the prophets had seen in one and the same perspective, the temporary
deliverance from captivity and the antitypical final Messianic
deliverance. The seventy weeks are separated ([Dan
9:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)) into three unequal parts,
seven, sixty-two, one. The seventieth is the consummation of the
preceding ones, as the Sabbath of God succeeds the working days; an idea
suggested by the division into weeks. In the sixty-nine weeks Jerusalem
is restored, and so a place is prepared for Messiah wherein to
accomplish His sabbatic work ([Dan
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)) of "confirming the covenant"
([Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)). The Messianic time is the
Sabbath of Israel's history, in which it had the offer of all God's
mercies, but in which it was cut off for a time by its rejection of
them. As the seventy weeks end with seven years, or a week, so they
begin with seven times seven, that is, seven weeks. As the seventieth
week is separated from the rest as a period of revelation, so it may be
with the seven weeks. The number seven is associated with revelation;
for the seven spirits of God are the mediators of all His revelations
([Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001); [Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005)). Ten is the number of what is
human; for example, the world power issues in ten heads and ten horns
([Dan 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#042); [Dan
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007)). Seventy is ten multiplied by
seven, the human moulded by the divine. The seventy years of exile
symbolize the triumph of the world power over Israel. In the seven times
seventy years the world number ten is likewise contained, that is, God's
people is still under the power of the world ("troublous times"); but
the number of the divine is multiplied by itself; seven times seven
years, at the beginning a period of Old Testament revelation to God's
people by Ezra, Nehemiah, and Malachi, whose labors extend over about
half a century, or seven weeks, and whose writings are last in the
canon; and in the end, seven years, the period of New Testament
revelation in Messiah. The commencing seven weeks of years of Old
Testament revelation are hurried over, in order that the chief stress
might rest on the Messianic week. Yet the seven weeks of Old Testament
revelation are marked by their separation from the sixty-two, to be
above those sixty-two wherein there was to be none.

Messiah the Prince--Hebrew, Nagid. Messiah is Jesus' title in respect to
Israel ([Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002); [Mat
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037), [Mat
27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042)). Nagid, as Prince of the
Gentiles ([Isa 55:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004)). Nagid is applied
to Titus, only as representative of Christ, who designates the Roman
destruction of Jerusalem as, in a sense, His coming ([Mat
24:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029); [Joh
21:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#022)). Messiah denotes His calling;
Nagid, His power. He is to "be cut off, and there shall be nothing for
Him." (So the Hebrew for "not for Himself," [Dan
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026), ought to be translated). Yet He
is "the Prince" who is to "come," by His representative at first, to
inflict judgment, and at last in person.

wall--the "trench" or "scarped rampart" \[TREGELLES\]. The street and
trench include the complete restoration of the city externally and
internally, which was during the sixty-nine weeks.

[Daniel 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">dan 9:26</span></span>

after threescore and two weeks--rather, the threescore and two weeks. In
this verse, and in [Dan 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027), Messiah
is made the prominent subject, while the fate of the city and sanctuary
are secondary, being mentioned only in the second halves of the verses.
Messiah appears in a twofold aspect, salvation to believers, judgment on
unbelievers ([Luk 2:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#034); compare [Mal
3:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001); [Mal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001)). He repeatedly, in Passion
week, connects His being "cut off" with the destruction of the city, as
cause and effect ([Mat 21:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037); [Mat
23:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037); [Luk
21:20-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#020); [Luk
23:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#028)). Israel might naturally
expect Messiah's kingdom of glory, if not after the seventy years'
captivity, at least at the end of the sixty-two weeks; but, instead of
that, shall be His death, and the consequent destruction of Jerusalem.

not for himself--rather, "there shall be nothing to Him"
\[HENGSTENBERG\]; not that the real object of His first coming (His
spiritual kingdom) should be frustrated; but the earthly kingdom
anticipated by the Jews should, for the present, come to naught, and not
then be realized. TREGELLES refers the title, "the Prince" ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)), to the time of His entering
Jerusalem on an ass's colt, His only appearance as a king, and six days
afterwards put to death as "King of the Jews."

the people of the prince--the Romans, led by Titus, the representative
of the world power, ultimately to be transferred to Messiah, and so
called by Messiah's title, "the Prince"; as also because sent by Him, as
His instrument of judgment ([Mat
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#007)).

end thereof--of the sanctuary. TREGELLES takes it, "the end of the
Prince," the last head of the Roman power, Antichrist.

with a flood--namely, of war ([Psa
90:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#005); [Isa
8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007); [Isa
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#018)). Implying the completeness of
the catastrophe, "not one stone left on another."

unto the end of the war--rather, "unto the end there is war."

determined--by God's decree ([Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023); [Isa
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#022)).

[Daniel 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">dan 9:27</span></span>

he shall confirm the covenant--Christ. The confirmation of the covenant
is assigned to Him also elsewhere. [Isa
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#006), "I will give thee for a covenant
of the people" (that is, He in whom the covenant between Israel and God
is personally expressed); compare [Luk
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#020), "The new testament in My
blood"; [Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001), "the angel of the
covenant"; [Jer 31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031), describes
the Messianic covenant in full. Contrast [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030), [Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032), "forsake the covenant," "do
wickedly against the covenant." The prophecy as to Messiah's confirming
the covenant with many would comfort the faithful in Antiochus' times,
who suffered partly from persecuting enemies, partly from false friends
([Dan 11:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#033)). Hence arises the
similarity of the language here and in [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030), [Dan
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032), referring to Antiochus, the
type of Antichrist.

with many-- ([Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Mat
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#028); [Rom
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015), [Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028)).

in . . . midst of . . . week--The seventy weeks extend to A.D. 33.
Israel was not actually destroyed till A.D. 79, but it was so virtually,
A.D. 33, about three or four years after Christ's death, during which
the Gospel was preached exclusively to the Jews. When the Jews
persecuted the Church and stoned Stephen ([Act
7:54-60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054)), the respite of grace granted
to them was at an end ([Luk 13:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#007)).
Israel, having rejected Christ, was rejected by Christ, and henceforth
is counted dead (compare [Gen 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017)
with [Gen 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#005); [Hos
13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001)), its actual destruction by
Titus being the consummation of the removal of the kingdom of God from
Israel to the Gentiles ([Mat 21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043)),
which is not to be restored until Christ's second coming, when Israel
shall be at the head of humanity ([Mat
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039); [Act
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006); [Rom
11:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025); Rom. 15:1-32). The interval
forms for the covenant-people a great parenthesis.

he shall cause the sacrifice . . . oblation to cease--distinct from the
temporary "taking away" of "the daily" (sacrifice) by Antiochus ([Dan
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011); [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031)). Messiah was to cause all
sacrifices and oblations in general to "cease" utterly. There is here an
allusion only to Antiochus' act; to comfort God's people when
sacrificial worship was to be trodden down, by pointing them to the
Messianic time when salvation would fully come and yet temple sacrifices
cease. This is the same consolation as Jeremiah and Ezekiel gave under
like circumstances, when the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar
was impending ([Jer 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016); [Jer
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031); [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019)). Jesus died in the middle of
the last week, A.D. 30. His prophetic life lasted three and a half
years; the very time in which "the saints are given into the hand" of
Antichrist ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)). Three and a
half does not, like ten, designate the power of the world in its
fulness, but (while opposed to the divine, expressed by seven) broken
and defeated in its seeming triumph; for immediately after the three and
a half times, judgment falls on the victorious world powers ([Dan
7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)). So Jesus' death seemed the
triumph of the world, but was really its defeat ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)). The rending of the veil marked
the cessation of sacrifices through Christ's death ([Lev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006), [Lev
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#017); [Lev
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#002), [Lev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#015); [Heb
10:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014)). There cannot be a covenant
without sacrifice ([Gen 8:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#020); [Gen
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#017); [Gen
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009), &c.; [Heb
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015)). Here the old covenant is to be
confirmed, but in a way peculiar to the New Testament, namely, by the
one sacrifice, which would terminate all sacrifices ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006), [Psa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011)). Thus as the Levitical rites
approached their end, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, with ever
increasing clearness, oppose the spiritual new covenant to the transient
earthly elements of the old.

for the overspreading of abominations--On account of the abominations
committed by the unholy people against the Holy One, He shall not only
destroy the city and sanctuary ([Dan
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025)), but shall continue its
desolation until the time of the consummation "determined" by God (the
phrase is quoted from [Isa 10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022)),
when at last the world power shall be judged and dominion be given to
the saints of the Most High ([Dan
7:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026)). AUBERLEN translates, "On
account of the desolating summit of abominations (compare [Dan
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#031); [Dan
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011); thus the repetition of the same
thing as in [Dan 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026) is avoided), and
till the consummation which is determined, it (the curse, [Dan
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011), foretold by Moses) will pour on
the desolated." Israel reached the summit of abominations, which drew
down desolation ([Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028)), nay,
which is the desolation itself, when, after murdering Messiah, they
offered sacrifices, Mosaic indeed in form, but heathenish in spirit
(compare [Isa 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013); [Eze
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#011)). Christ refers to this passage
([Mat 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#015)), "When ye see the
abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the
holy place" (the latter words being tacitly implied in "abominations" as
being such as are committed against the sanctuary). TREGELLES
translates, "upon the wing of abominations shall be that which causeth
desolation"; namely, an idol set up on a wing or pinnacle of the temple
(compare [Mat 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005)) by Antichrist, who
makes a covenant with the restored Jews for the last of the seventy
weeks of years (fulfilling Jesus' words, "If another shall come in his
own name, him ye will receive"), and for the first three and a half
years keeps it, then in the midst of the week breaks it, causing the
daily sacrifices to cease. TREGELLES thus identifies the last half week
with the time, times, and a half of the persecuting little horn ([Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)). But thus there is a gap of at
least 1830 years put between the sixty-nine weeks and the seventieth
week. SIR ISAAC NEWTON explains the wing ("overspreading") of
abominations to be the Roman ensigns (eagles) brought to the east gate
of the temple, and there sacrificed to by the soldiers; the war, ending
in the destruction of Jerusalem, lasted from spring A.D. 67 to autumn
A.D. 70, that is, just three and a half years, or the last half week of
years \[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 6.6\].

poured upon the desolate--TREGELLES translates, "the causer of
desolation," namely, Antichrist. Compare "abomination that maketh
desolate" ([Dan 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011)). Perhaps both
interpretations of the whole passage may be in part true; the Roman
desolator, Titus, being a type of Antichrist, the final desolator of
Jerusalem. BACON \[The Advancement of Learning, 2.3\] says, "Prophecies
are of the nature of the Author, with whom a thousand years are as one
day; and therefore are not fulfilled punctually at once, but have a
springing and germinant accomplishment through many years, though the
height and fulness of them may refer to one age."

The tenth through twelfth chapters more fully describe the vision in the
eighth chapter by a second vision on the same subject, just as the
vision in the seventh chapter explains more fully that in the second.
The tenth chapter is the prologue; the eleventh, the prophecy itself;
and the twelfth, the epilogue. The tenth chapter unfolds the spiritual
worlds as the background of the historical world ([Job
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007); [Job
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001), &c.; [Zac
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001); [Rev
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007)), and angels as the ministers of
God's government of men. As in the world of nature ([Joh
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#004); [Rev
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#001)), so in that of history here;
Michael, the champion of Israel, and with him another angel, whose aim
is to realize God's will in the heathen world, resist the God-opposed
spirit of the world. These struggles are not merely symbolical, but real
([Sa1 16:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013); [Kg1
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022); [Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)).
