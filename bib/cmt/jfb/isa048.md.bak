### [Isaiah Chapter 48](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 48:1</span></span>

THE THINGS THAT BEFALL BABYLON JEHOVAH PREDICTED LONG BEFORE, LEST
ISRAEL SHOULD ATTRIBUTE THEM, IN ITS "OBSTINATE" PERVERSITY, TO STRANGE
GODS ([Isa 48:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001)). (Isa. 48:1-22.md)

the waters of Judah--spring from the fountain of Judah ([Num
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#007.md); [Deu
33:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#028.md); [Psa
68:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#026); Margin.md). Judah has the
"fountain" attributed to it, because it survived the ten tribes, and
from it Messiah was to spring.

swear by . . . Lord-- ([Isa 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md);
[Isa 45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md); [Isa
65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016).md).

mention--in prayers and praises.

not in truth-- ([Jer 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#002.md); [Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 48:2</span></span>

For--Ye deserve these reproofs; "for" ye call yourselves citizens of
"the holy city" ([Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001).md), but not
in truth ([Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Neh
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md); [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024).md); so the inscription on their
coins of the time of the Maccabees. "Jerusalem the Holy."

[Isaiah 48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 48:3</span></span>

former--things which have happened in time past to Israel ([Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009.md); [Isa
44:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007.md); [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md); [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010).md).

suddenly--They came to pass so unexpectedly that the prophecy could not
have resulted from mere human sagacity.

[Isaiah 48:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 48:4</span></span>

obstinate--Hebrew, "hard" ([Deu 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#027.md);
[Eze 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007), Margin.md).

iron sinew--inflexible ([Act 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

brow brass--shameless as a harlot (see [Jer
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028.md); [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003.md); [Eze
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#007), Margin.md).

[Isaiah 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 48:5</span></span>

(See on [Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Isa
48:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 48:6</span></span>

Thou, &c.--So "ye are my witnesses" ([Isa
43:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010).md). Thou canst testify the
prediction was uttered long before the fulfilment: "see all this,"
namely, that the event answers to the prophecy.

declare--make the fact known as a proof that Jehovah alone is God ([Isa
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#008).md).

new things--namely, the deliverance from Babylon by Cyrus, new in
contradistinction from former predictions that had been fulfilled ([Isa
42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009.md); [Isa
43:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#019).md). Antitypically, the prophecy
has in view the "new things" of the gospel treasury ([Sol
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#013.md); [Mat
13:52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052.md); [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005).md). From this point forward, the
prophecies as to Messiah's first and second advents and the restoration
of Israel, have a new circumstantial distinctness, such as did not
characterize the previous ones, even of Isaiah. Babylon, in this view,
answers to the mystical Babylon of Revelation.

hidden--which could not have been guessed by political sagacity ([Dan
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022.md), [Dan
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029.md); [Co1
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 48:7</span></span>

Not like natural results from existing causes, the events when they took
place were like acts of creative power, such as had never before been
"from the beginning."

even before the day when--rather \[MAURER\], "And before the day (of
their occurrence) thou hast not heard of them"; that is, by any human
acuteness; they are only heard of by the present inspired announcement.

[Isaiah 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 48:8</span></span>

heardest not--repeated, as also "knewest not," from [Isa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#007.md).

from that time--Mine anger towards thee. Omit "that." "Yea, from "the
first thine ear did not open itself," namely, to obey them
\[ROSENMULLER\]. "To open the ear" denotes obedient attention ([Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005).md); or, "was not opened" to receive
them; that is, they were not declared by Me to thee previously, since,
if thou hadst been informed of them, such is thy perversity, thou
couldst not have been kept in check \[MAURER\]. In the former view, the
sense of the words following is, "For I knew that, if I had not foretold
the destruction of Babylon so plainly that there could be no perverting
of it, thou wouldst have perversely ascribed it to idols, or something
else than to Me" ([Isa 48:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#005).md). Thus
they would have relapsed into idolatry, to cure them of which the
Babylonian captivity was sent: so they had done ([Exo
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004).md). After the return, and ever
since, they have utterly forsaken idols.

wast called--as thine appropriate appellation ([Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

from the womb--from the beginning of Israel's national existence ([Isa
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 48:9</span></span>

refrain--literally, "muzzle"; His wrath, after the return, was to be
restrained a while, and then, because of their sins, let loose again
([Psa 78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038).md).

for thee--that is, that--omit "that": "From thee."

[Isaiah 48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 48:10</span></span>

(See on [Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025).md).

with silver--rather, "for silver." I sought by affliction to purify
thee, but thou wast not as silver obtained by melting, but as dross
\[GESENIUS\]. Thy repentance is not complete: thou art not yet as
refined silver. ROSENMULLER explains, "not as silver," not with the
intense heat needed to melt silver (it being harder to melt than gold),
that is, not with the most extreme severity. The former view is better
([Isa 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#025.md); [Isa
42:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#025.md); [Eze
22:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018.md), [Eze
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#022).md).

chosen--or else \[LOWTH\], tried . . . proved: according to GESENIUS,
literally, "to rub with the touchstone," or to cut in pieces so as to
examine ([Zac 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md); [Mal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003.md); [Pe1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 48:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 48:11</span></span>

how should my name--MAURER, instead of "My name" from [Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md), supplies "My glory" from the
next clause; and translates, "How (shamefully) My glory has been
profaned!" In English Version the sense is, "I will refrain ([Isa
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#009.md), that is, not utterly destroy
thee), for why should I permit My name to be polluted, which it would
be, if the Lord utterly destroyed His elect people" ([Eze
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009).md)?

not give my glory unto another--If God forsook His people for ever, the
heathen would attribute their triumph over Israel to their idols; so
God's glory would be given to another.

[Isaiah 48:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 48:12</span></span>

The Almighty, who has founded heaven and earth, can, and will, restore
His people.

the first . . . last-- ([Isa 41:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#004.md);
[Isa 44:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 48:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 48:13</span></span>

spanned--measured out ([Isa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#012).md).

when I call . . . stand up together-- ([Isa
40:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#026.md); [Jer
33:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#025).md). But it is not their creation
so much which is meant, as that, like ministers of God, the heavens and
the earth are prepared at His command to execute His decrees ([Psa
119:91](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#091).md) \[ROSENMULLER\].

[Isaiah 48:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 48:14</span></span>

among them--among the gods and astrologers of the Chaldees ([Isa
41:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md); [Isa
43:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#009.md); [Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007).md).

Lord . . . loved him; he will, &c.--that is, "He whom the Lord hath
loved will do," &c. \[LOWTH\]; namely, Cyrus ([Isa
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md), [Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013.md); [Isa
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011).md). However, Jehovah's language of
love is too strong to apply to Cyrus, except as type of Messiah, to whom
alone it fully applies ([Rev 5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#002).md).

his pleasure--not Cyrus' own, but Jehovah's.

[Isaiah 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 48:15</span></span>

brought--led him on his way.

he--change from the first to the third person \[BARNES\]. Jehovah shall
make his (Cyrus') way prosperous.

[Isaiah 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 48:16</span></span>

not . . . in secret-- ([Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019).md).
Jehovah foretold Cyrus' advent, not with the studied ambiguity of
heathen oracles, but plainly.

from the time, &c.--From the moment that the purpose began to be
accomplished in the raising up of Cyrus I was present.

sent me--The prophet here speaks, claiming attention to his announcement
as to Cyrus, on the ground of his mission from God and His Spirit. But
he speaks not in his own person so much as in that of Messiah, to whom
alone in the fullest sense the words apply ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036).md). Plainly, [Isa
49:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#001.md), which is the continuation of the
forty-eighth chapter, from [Isa 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md),
where the change of speaker from God ([Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md), [Isa
48:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012).md) begins, is the language of
Messiah. [Luk 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001.md), [Luk
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#014.md), [Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md), shows that the Spirit combined
with the Father in sending the Son: therefore "His Spirit" is nominative
to "sent," not accusative, following it.

[Isaiah 48:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 48:17</span></span>

teacheth . . . to profit--by affliction, such as the Babylonish
captivity, and the present long-continued dispersion of Israel ([Heb
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 48:18</span></span>

peace-- ([Psa 119:165](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#165).md). Compare the
desire expressed by the same Messiah ([Mat
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037.md); [Luk
19:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#042).md).

river-- ([Isa 33:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021.md); [Isa
41:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#018).md), a river flowing from God's
throne is the symbol of free, abundant, and ever flowing blessings from
Him ([Eze 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#008.md); [Rev
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001).md).

righteousness--religious prosperity; the parent of "peace" or national
prosperity; therefore "peace" corresponds to "righteousness" in the
parallelism ([Isa 32:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 48:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 48:19</span></span>

sand--retaining the metaphor of "the sea" ([Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018).md).

like the gravel thereof--rather, as the Hebrew, "like that (the
offspring) of its (the sea's) bowels"; referring to the countless living
creatures, fishes, &c., of the sea, rather than the gravel \[MAURER\].
JEROME, Chaldee, and Syriac support English Version.

his name . . . cut off--transition from the second person, "thy," to the
third "his." Israel's name was cut off "as a nation" during the
Babylonish captivity; also it is so now, to which the prophecy
especially looks ([Rom 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 48:20</span></span>

Go . . . forth . . . end of the earth--Primarily, a prophecy of their
joyful deliverance from Babylon, and a direction that they should leave
it when God opened the way. But the publication of it "to the ends of
the earth" shows it has a more world-wide scope antitypically; [Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004.md) shows that the mystical Babylon
is ultimately meant.

redeemed . . . Jacob-- ([Isa 43:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001.md);
[Isa 44:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 48:21</span></span>

Ezra, in describing the return, makes no mention of God cleaving the
rock for them in the desert \[KIMCHI\]. The circumstances, therefore, of
the deliverance from Egypt ([Exo 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md);
[Num 20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011.md); [Psa
78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md); [Psa
105:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#041).md) and of that from Babylon, are
blended together; the language, while more immediately referring to the
latter deliverance, yet, as being blended with circumstances of the
former not strictly applicable to the latter, cannot wholly refer to
either, but to the mystic deliverance of man under Messiah, and
literally to the final restoration of Israel.

[Isaiah 48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 48:22</span></span>

Repeated ([Isa 57:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#021).md). All the
blessings just mentioned ([Isa 48:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#021).md)
belong only to the godly, not to the wicked. Israel shall first cast
away its wicked unbelief before it shall inherit national prosperity
([Zac 12:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md), [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md); [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md), [Zac
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#014.md), [Zac
14:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020).md). The sentiment holds good
also as to all wicked men ([Job
15:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#020.md), [Job
15:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#031).md).

Messiah, as the ideal Israel ([Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003).md), states the object of His
mission, His want of success for a time, yet His certainty of ultimate
success.
