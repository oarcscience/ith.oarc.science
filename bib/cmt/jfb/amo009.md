### [Amos Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

[Amos 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 9:1</span></span>

FIFTH AND LAST VISION. ([Amo 9:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001).md)

None can escape the coming judgment in any hiding-place: for God is
omnipresent and irresistible ([Amo
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#001).md). As a kingdom, Israel shall
perish as if it never was in covenant with Him: but as individuals the
house of Jacob shall not utterly perish, nay, not one of the least of
the righteous shall fall, but only all the sinners ([Amo
9:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md). Restoration of the Jews
finally to their own land after the re-establishment of the fallen
tabernacle of David; consequent conversion of all the heathen ([Amo
9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md).

Lord . . . upon the altar--namely, in the idolatrous temple at Beth-el;
the calves which were spoken of in [Amo
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014.md). Hither they would flee for
protection from the Assyrians, and would perish in the ruins, with the
vain object of their trust \[HENDERSON\]. Jehovah stands here to direct
the destruction of it, them, and the idolatrous nation. He demands many
victims on the altar, but they are to be human victims. CALVIN and
FAIRBAIRN, and others, make it in the temple at Jerusalem. Judgment was
to descend both on Israel and Judah. As the services of both alike ought
to have been offered on the Jerusalem temple-altar, it is there that
Jehovah ideally stands, as if the whole people were assembled there,
their abominations lying unpardoned there, and crying for vengeance,
though in fact committed elsewhere (compare Eze. 8:1-18). This view
harmonizes with the similarity of the vision in Amos to that in [Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md), at Jerusalem. Also with the
end of this chapter ([Amo 9:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md),
which applies both to Judah and Israel: "the tabernacle of David,"
namely, at Jerusalem. His attitude, "standing," implies fixity of
purpose.

lintel--rather, the sphere-like capital of the column \[MAURER\].

posts--rather, "thresholds," as in [Isa
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#004.md), Margin. The temple is to be
smitten below as well as above, to ensure utter destruction.

cut them in the head--namely, with the broken fragments of the capitals
and columns (compare [Psa 68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md); [Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013).md).

slay the last of them--their posterity \[HENDERSON\]. The survivors
\[MAURER\]. Jehovah's directions are addressed to His angels, ministers
of judgment (compare [Eze 9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001).md).

he that fleeth . . . shall not flee away--He who fancies himself safe
and out of reach of the enemy shall be taken ([Amo
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#014).md).

[Amos 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 9:2</span></span>

Though they dig into hell--though they hide ever so deeply in the earth
([Psa 139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008).md).

though they climb up to heaven--though they ascend the greatest heights
([Job 20:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#006.md); [Jer
51:53](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#053.md); [Oba
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004).md).

[Amos 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 9:3</span></span>

Carmel--where the forests, and, on the west side, the caves, furnished
hiding-places ([Amo 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002.md); [Jdg
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#002.md); [Sa1
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md).

the sea--the Mediterranean, which flows at the foot of Mount Carmel;
forming a strong antithesis to it.

command the serpent--the sea-serpent, a term used for any great water
monster ([Isa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md). The symbol of
cruel and oppressive kings ([Psa
74:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013).md).

[Amos 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 9:4</span></span>

though they go into captivity--hoping to save their lives by voluntarily
surrendering to the foe.

[Amos 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 9:5</span></span>

As Amos had threatened that nowhere should the Israelites be safe from
the divine judgments, he here shows God's omnipotent ability to execute
His threats. So in the case of the threat in [Amo
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md), God is here stated to be the
first cause of the mourning of "all that dwell" in the land, and of its
rising "like a flood, and of its being "drowned, as by the flood of
Egypt."

[Amos 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 9:6</span></span>

stories--literally, "ascents," that is, upper chambers, to which the
ascent is by steps \[MAURER\]; evidently referring to the words in [Psa
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md), [Psa
104:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#013.md). GROTIUS explains it, God's
royal throne, expressed in language drawn from Solomon's throne, to
which the ascent was by steps (compare [Kg1
10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018).md).

founded his troop--namely, all animate creatures, which are God's troop,
or host ([Gen 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#001).md), doing His will
([Psa 103:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md); [Joe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#011).md). MAURER translates, "His vault,"
that is, the vaulted sky, which seems to rest on the earth supported by
the horizon.

[Amos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 9:7</span></span>

unto me--however great ye seem to yourselves. Do not rely on past
privileges, and on My having delivered you from Egypt, as if therefore I
never would remove you from Canaan. I make no more account of you than
of "the Ethiopian" (compare [Jer
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023)). "Have not I (who.md) brought you
out of Egypt," done as much for other peoples? For instance, did I not
bring "the Philistines (see on [Isa
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#029), &c..md) from Caphtor (compare [Deu
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023.md); see on [Jer
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004).md), where they had been
bond-servants, and the Syrians from Kir?" It is appropriate, that as the
Syrians migrated into Syria from Kir (compare Note, see on [Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md), so they should be carried back
captive into the same land (see on [Amo
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#015.md); [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009).md), just as elsewhere Israel is
threatened with a return to Egypt whence they had been delivered. The
"Ethiopians," Hebrew, "Cushites," were originally akin to the race that
founded Babylon: the cuneiform inscriptions in this confirming
independently the Scripture statement ([Gen
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#006.md), [Gen
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#008.md), [Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010).md).

[Amos 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 9:8</span></span>

eyes . . . upon the sinful kingdom--that is, I am watching all its
sinful course in order to punish it (compare [Amo
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#004.md); [Psa
34:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015).md).

not utterly destroy the house of Jacob--Though as a "kingdom" the nation
is now utterly to perish, a remnant is to be spared for "Jacob," their
forefather's sake (compare [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011).md); to fulfil the covenant whereby
"the seed of Israel" is hereafter to be "a nation for ever" ([Jer
31:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#036).md).

[Amos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 9:9</span></span>

sift--I will cause the Israelites to be tossed about through all nations
as corn is shaken about in a sieve, in such a way, however, that while
the chaff and dust (the wicked) fall through (perish), all the solid
grains (the godly elect) remain (are preserved), ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md); compare Note, see on [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014).md). So spiritual Israel's final
safety is ensured ([Luk 22:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#032.md); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039).md).

[Amos 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 9:10</span></span>

All the sinners--answering to the chaff in the image in [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009.md), which falls on the earth, in
opposition "to the grain" that does not "fall."

overtake . . . us--"come on us from behind" \[MAURER\].

[Amos 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 9:11</span></span>

In that day--quoted by James ([Act
15:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016).md), "After this," that is, in
the dispensation of Messiah ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); [Hos
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md); [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md); [Joe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#001).md).

tabernacle of David--not "the house of David," which is used of his
affairs when prospering ([Sa2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#001).md),
but the tent or booth, expressing the low condition to which his kingdom
and family had fallen in Amos' time, and subsequently at the Babylonian
captivity before the restoration; and secondarily, in the last days
preceding Israel's restoration under Messiah, the antitype to David
([Psa 102:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md); [Jer
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md); [Eze
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md); [Eze
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024.md); see on [Isa
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md). The type is taken from
architecture ([Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020).md). The
restoration under Zerubbabel can only be a partial, temporary
fulfilment; for it did not include Israel, which nation is the main
subject of Amos prophecies, but only Judah; also Zerubbabel's kingdom
was not independent and settled; also all the prophets end their
prophecies with Messiah, whose advent is the cure of all previous
disorders. "Tabernacle" is appropriate to Him, as His human nature is
the tabernacle which He assumed in becoming Immanuel, "God with us"
([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). "Dwelt," literally,
tabernacled "among us" (compare [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md). Some understand "the tabernacle
of David" as that which David pitched for the ark in Zion, after
bringing it from Obed-edom's house. It remained there all his reign for
thirty years, till the temple of Solomon was built, whereas the
"tabernacle of the congregation" remained at Gibeon ([Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003).md), where the priests ministered in
sacrifices ([Ch1 16:39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#039).md). Song and
praise was the service of David's attendants before the ark (Asaph,
&c.): a type of the gospel separation between the sacrificial service
(Messiah's priesthood now in heaven) and the access of believers on
earth to the presence of God, apart from the former (compare [Sa2
6:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012.md); [Ch1
16:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#037.md); [Ch2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2001.htm#003).md).

breaches thereof--literally, "of them," that is, of the whole nation,
Israel as well as Judah.

as in . . . days of old--as it was formerly in the days of David and
Solomon, when the kingdom was in its full extent and undivided.

[Amos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 9:12</span></span>

That they may possess . . . remnant of Edom, and of all the
heathen--"Edom," the bitter foe, though the brother, of Israel;
therefore to be punished ([Amo
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011).md), Israel shall be lord of the
"remnant" of Edom left after the punishment of the latter. James quotes
it, "That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
Gentiles," &c. For "all the heathen" nations stand on the same footing
as Edom: Edom is the representative of them all. The residue or remnant
in both cases expresses those left after great antecedent calamities
([Rom 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027.md); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md). Here the conversion of "all
nations" (of which the earnest was given in James's time) is represented
as only to be realized on the re-establishment of the theocracy under
Messiah, the Heir of the throne of David ([Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md). The possession of the heathen
nations by Israel is to be spiritual, the latter being the ministers to
the former for their conversion to Messiah, King of the Jews; just as
the first conversions of pagans were through the ministry of the
apostles, who were Jews. Compare [Isa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md), "thy seed shall inherit the
Gentiles" (compare [Isa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md); [Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013).md). A remnant of Edom became Jews
under John Hyrcanus, and the rest amalgamated with the Arabians, who
became Christians subsequently.

which are called by my name--that is, who belong to Me, whom I claim as
Mine ([Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008).md); in the purposes of
electing grace, God terms them already called by His name. Compare the
title, "the children," applied by anticipation, [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014.md). Hence as an act of sovereign
grace, fulfilling His promise, it is spoken of God. Proclaim His title
as sovereign, "the Lord that doeth this" ("all these things," [Act
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md), namely, all these and such like
acts of sovereign love).

[Amos 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 9:13</span></span>

the days come--at the future restoration of the Jews to their own land.

ploughman shall overtake . . . reaper . . . treader of grapes him that
soweth--fulfilling [Lev 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md). Such
shall be the abundance that the harvest and vintage can hardly be
gathered before the time for preparing for the next crop shall come.
Instead of the greater part of the year being spent in war, the whole
shall be spent in sowing and reaping the fruits of earth. Compare [Isa
65:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021.md), as to the same period.

soweth seed--literally, "draweth it forth," namely, from the sack in
order to sow it.

mountains . . . drop sweet wine--an appropriate image, as the vines in
Palestine were trained on terraces at the sides of the hills.

[Amos 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 9:14</span></span>

build the waste cities-- ([Isa 61:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#004.md);
[Eze 36:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#033).md).

[Amos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 9:15</span></span>

plant them . . . no more be pulled up-- ([Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041).md).

thy God--Israel's; this is the ground of their restoration, God's
original choice of them as His.
