### [2 Timothy Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Timothy 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti2 2:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS; TO FAITHFULNESS AS A GOOD SOLDIER OF CHRIST; ERRORS TO BE
SHUNNED; THE LORD'S SURE FOUNDATION; THE RIGHT SPIRIT FOR A SERVANT OF
CHRIST. (2Ti. 2:1-26)

Thou therefore--following my example ([Ti2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#008.md), [Ti2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012).md), and that of ONESIPHORUS ([Ti2
1:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016).md), and shunning that of those
who forsook me ([Ti2 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015).md).

my son--Children ought to imitate their father.

be strong--literally, "be invested with power." Have power, and show
thyself to have it; implying an abiding state of power.

in the grace--the element IN which the believer's strength has place.
Compare [Ti2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md), "God hath given us
the spirit of power."

[2 Timothy 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti2 2:2</span></span>

among--Greek, "through," that is, with the attestation (literally,
"intervention") of many witnesses, namely, the presbyters and others
present at his ordination or consecration ([Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md); [Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012).md).

commit--in trust, as a deposit ([Ti2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014).md).

faithful--the quality most needed by those having a trust committed to
them.

who--Greek, "(persons) such as shall be competent to teach (them to)
others also." Thus the way is prepared for inculcating the duty of
faithful endurance ([Ti2 2:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003).md). Thou
shouldest consider as a motive to endurance, that thou hast not only to
keep the deposit for thyself, but to transmit it unimpaired to others,
who in their turn shall fulfil the same office. This is so far from
supporting oral tradition now that it rather teaches how precarious a
mode of preserving revealed truth it was, depending, as it did, on the
trustworthiness of each individual in the chain of succession; and how
thankful we ought to be that God Himself has given the written Word,
which is exempt from such risk.

[2 Timothy 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti2 2:3</span></span>

Thou therefore endure hardness--The oldest manuscripts have no "Thou
therefore," and read, "Endure hardship with (me)." "Take thy share in
suffering" \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[2 Timothy 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti2 2:4</span></span>

"No one while serving as a soldier."

the affairs of (this) life--"the businesses of life" \[ALFORD\];
mercantile, or other than military.

him who hath chosen him--the general who at the first enlisted him as a
soldier. Paul himself worked at tent-making ([Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003).md). Therefore what is prohibited
here is, not all other save religious occupation, but the becoming
entangled, or over-engrossed therewith.

[2 Timothy 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti2 2:5</span></span>

And--"Moreover."

strive for masteries--"strive in the games" \[ALFORD\]; namely, the
great national games of Greece.

yet is he not crowned, except--even though he gain the victory.

strive lawfully--observing all the conditions of both the contest
(keeping within the bounds of the course and stript of his clothes) and
the preparation for it, namely, as to self-denying diet, anointing,
exercise, self-restraint, chastity, decorum, &c. ([Co1
9:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024).md).

[2 Timothy 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti2 2:6</span></span>

must be first partaker--The right of first partaking of the fruits
belongs to him who is laboring; do not thou, therefore, relax thy
labors, as thou wouldest be foremost in partaking of the reward.
CONYBEARE explains "first," before the idler.

[2 Timothy 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti2 2:7</span></span>

Consider the force of the illustrations I have given from the soldier,
the contender in the games, and the husbandmen, as applying to thyself
in thy ministry.

and the Lord give, &c.--The oldest manuscripts read, "for the Lord will
give thee understanding." Thou canst understand my meaning so as
personally to apply it to thyself; for the Lord will give thee
understanding when thou seekest it from Him "in all things." Not
intellectual perception, but personal appropriation of the truths
metaphorically expressed, was what he needed to be given him by the
Lord.

[2 Timothy 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti2 2:8</span></span>

Rather as Greek, "Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead." Remember
Christ risen, so as to follow Him. As He was raised after death, so if
thou wouldest share His risen "life," thou must now share His "death"
([Ti2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011).md). The Greek perfect passive
participle, implies a permanent character acquired by Jesus as the risen
Saviour, and our permanent interest in Him as such. Christ's
resurrection is put prominently forward as being the truth now assailed
([Ti2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018).md), and the one best
calculated to stimulate Timothy to steadfastness in sharing Paul's
sufferings for the Gospel's sake (see on [Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003).md).

of the seed of David--The one and only genealogy (as contrasted with the
"endless genealogies," [Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).md) worth
thinking of, for it proves Jesus to be the Messiah. The absence of the
article in the Greek, and this formula, "of the seed of David" (compare
[Rom 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003).md), imply that the words were
probably part of a recognized short oral creed. In His death He assured
us of His humanity; by His resurrection, of His divinity. That He was
not crucified for His own sin appears from His resurrection; that He was
crucified shows that He bore sin, on Him, though not in Him.

my gospel--that which I always taught.

[2 Timothy 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti2 2:9</span></span>

Wherein--in proclaiming which Gospel.

suffer trouble--literally, "evil." I am a sufferer of evil as though I
were a doer of evil.

bonds-- ([Ti2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#016).md).

word . . . not bound--Though my person is bound, my tongue and my pen
are not ([Ti2 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#017.md); [Act
28:31](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#031).md). Or he alludes not merely to
his own proclamation of the Gospel, though in chains, but to the freedom
of its circulation by others, even though his power of circulating it is
now prescribed ([Phi 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018).md). He also
hints to Timothy that he being free ought to be the more earnest in the
service of it.

[2 Timothy 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti2 2:10</span></span>

Therefore--Because of the anxiety I feel that the Gospel should be
extended; that anxiety being implied in [Ti2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md).

endure--not merely "I passively suffer," but "I actively and
perseveringly endure," and "am ready to endure patiently all things."

the elect's sakes--for the sake of the Church: all the members of
Christ's spiritual body ([Col 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024).md).

they . . . also--as well as myself: both God's elect not yet converted
and those already so.

salvation . . . glory--not only salvation from wrath, but glory in
reigning with Him eternally ([Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012).md). Glory is the full expansion of
salvation ([Act 2:47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#047.md); [Rom
8:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). So grace and glory ([Psa
84:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#012).md).

[2 Timothy 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti2 2:11</span></span>

Greek, "Faithful is the saying."

For--"For" the fact is so that, "if we be dead with Him (the Greek
aorist tense implies a state once for all entered into in past times at
the moment of regeneration, [Rom
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md), [Rom
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#008.md); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012).md), we shall also live with Him."
The symmetrical form of "the saying," [Ti2
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011.md), and the rhythmical balance of
the parallel clauses, makes it likely, they formed part of a Church hymn
(see on [Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md), or accepted
formula, perhaps first uttered by some of the Christian "prophets" in
the public assembly ([Co1 14:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026).md). The
phrase "faithful is the saying," which seems to have been the usual
formula (compare [Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md); [Ti1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md); [Ti1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008).md) in such cases, favors this.

[2 Timothy 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti2 2:12</span></span>

suffer--rather, as the Greek is the same as in [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010), "If we endure (with Him.md)" ([Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017).md).

reign with him--The peculiar privilege of the elect Church now suffering
with Christ, then to reign with Him (see on [Co1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002).md). Reigning is something more than
mere salvation ([Rom 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); [Rev
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#010.md); [Rev
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md).

deny--with the mouth. As "believe" with the heart follows, [Ti2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012.md). Compare the opposite, "confess
with thy mouth" and "believe in thine heart" ([Rom
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009).md).

he also will deny us-- ([Mat 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033).md).

[2 Timothy 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti2 2:13</span></span>

believe not--"If we are unbelievers (literally, 'unfaithful'), He
remains faithful" ([Deu 7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#009).md). The
oldest manuscripts read, "For He cannot (it is an impossibility that He
should) deny Himself." He cannot be unfaithful to His word that He will
deny those who deny Him, though we be not faithful to our profession of
faith in Him ([Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003).md). Three things
are impossible to God, to die, to lie, and to be deceived \[AUGUSTINE,
The Creed, 1.1\], ([Heb 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018).md). This
impossibility is not one of infirmity, but of infinite power and
majesty. Also, indirectly, comfort is suggested to believers, that He is
faithful to His promises to them; at the same time that apostates are
shaken out of their self-deceiving fancy, that because they change,
Christ similarly may change. A warning to Timothy to be steadfast in the
faith.

[2 Timothy 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti2 2:14</span></span>

them--those over whom thou dost preside ([Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001).md).

charging--Greek, "testifying continually": "adjuring them."

before the Lord-- ([Ti1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#021).md).

that they strive not about words--rather, "strive with words": "not to
have a (mere) war of words" ([Ti2
2:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md); [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004).md) where the most vital matters are
at stake ([Ti2 2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md); [Act
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015).md). The oldest manuscripts put a
stop at "charging them before the Lord" (which clause is thus connected
with "put them in remembrance") and read the imperative, "Strive not
thou in words," &c.

to no profit--not qualifying "words"; but Greek neuter, in apposition
with "strive in words," "(a thing tending) to no profit," literally,
"profitable for nothing"; the opposite of "meet for the master's use"
([Ti2 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021).md).

to the subverting--sure to subvert (overturn) the hearers: the opposite
of "edifying" (building up) ([Co2
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010).md).

[2 Timothy 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti2 2:15</span></span>

Study--Greek, "Be earnest," or "diligent."

to show--Greek, "present," as in [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md).

thyself--as distinguished from those whom Timothy was to charge ([Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014).md).

approved--tested by trial: opposed to "reprobate" ([Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016).md).

workman--alluding to [Mat 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md), &c.

not to be ashamed--by his work not being "approved" ([Phi
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020).md). Contrast "deceitful workers"
([Co2 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013).md).

rightly dividing--"rightly handling" \[Vulgate\]; "rightly
administering" \[ALFORD\]; literally, cutting "straight" or "right": the
metaphor being from a father or a steward ([Co1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001).md) cutting and distributing bread
among his children \[VITRINGA and CALVIN\], ([Luk
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042).md). The Septuagint, [Pro
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#006.md); [Pro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#005.md), use it of "making one's way": so
BENGEL here takes Paul to mean that Timothy may make ready a straight
way for "the word of truth," and may himself walk straight forward
according to this line, turning neither to the right nor to the left,
"teaching no other doctrine" ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003).md). The same image of a way appears
in the Greek for "increase" (see on [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016).md). The opposite to "rightly
handling," or "dispensing," is, [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md), "corrupt the word of God."

truth--Greek, "the truth" (compare [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018).md).

[2 Timothy 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti2 2:16</span></span>

shun--literally, "stand above," separate from, and superior to.

vain--opposed to "the truth" ([Ti2
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015).md).

babblings--with loud voice: opposed to the temperate "word" ([Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).md).

increase--Greek, advance"; literally, "strike forward": an image from
pioneers cutting away all obstacles before an advancing army. They
pretend progress; the only kind of progress they make is to a greater
pitch of impiety.

more ungodliness--Greek, "a greater degree of impiety."

[2 Timothy 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti2 2:17</span></span>

will eat--literally, "will have pasture." The consuming progress of
mortification is the image. They pretend to give rich spiritual pasture
to their disciples: the only pasture is that of a spiritual cancer
feeding on their vitals.

canker--a "cancer" or "gangrene."

Hymenaeus--(See on [Ti1 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md). After
his excommunication he seems to have been readmitted into the Church and
again to have troubled it.

[2 Timothy 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti2 2:18</span></span>

erred--Greek, "missed the aim" (see [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021).md).

is past already--has already taken place. The beginnings of the
subsequent Gnostic heresy already existed. They "wrested" ([Pe2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016).md) Paul's own words ([Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md); [Col
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012).md) "to their own destruction," as
though the resurrection was merely the spiritual raising of souls from
the death of sin. Compare [Co1 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012.md),
where he shows all our hopes of future glory rest on the literal reality
of the resurrection. To believe it past (as the Seleucians or Hermians
did, according to AUGUSTINE \[Epistles, 119.55, To Januarius, 4\]), is
to deny it in its true sense.

overthrow--trying to subvert "the foundation" on which alone faith can
rest secure ([Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md); compare [Tit
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011).md).

[2 Timothy 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti2 2:19</span></span>

Nevertheless--Notwithstanding the subversion of their faith, "the firm
foundation of God standeth" fast (so the Greek ought to be translated).
The "foundation" here is "the Church" \[ALFORD\], "the ground" or
basement support "of the truth" ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md), Christ Himself being the
ultimate "foundation" ([Co1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011).md). In
the steadfast standing of the Church there is involved the steadfast
certainty of the doctrine in question ([Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018).md). Thus the "house" ([Ti2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020).md) answers to the "foundation"; it
is made up of the elect whom "the Lord knoweth" (acknowledgeth,
recognizes, [Psa 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006.md); [Mat
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023.md); [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014.md); [Co1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003).md) as "His," and who persevere to
the end, though others "err concerning the faith" ([Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md); [Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028.md); [Rom
8:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md); [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).md). BENGEL takes "the foundation"
to be the immovable faithfulness of God (to His promises to His elect
\[CALVIN\]). This contrasts well with the erring from the faith on the
part of the reprobate, [Ti2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md).
Though they deny the faith, God abates not His faithfulness (compare
[Ti2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013).md).

having--seeing that it has \[ELLICOTT\].

seal--"inscription": indicating ownership and destination: inscriptions
were often engraven on a "foundation" stone ([Rev
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014).md) \[ALFORD\]. This will agree
with the view that "the foundation" is the Church ([Eph
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020).md). If it be taken God's immovable
faithfulness, the "seal" will be regarded as attached to His covenant
promise, with the inscription or legend, on one side of its round
surface, "The Lord knoweth (it is 'knew' in the Septuagint, [Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005.md), to which Paul here alludes,
altering it for his purpose by the Spirit) them that are His"; on the
observe side, "Let every one that nameth (as his Lord, [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md), or preacheth in His name, [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009).md) Christ."

depart--Greek, "stand aloof."

from iniquity-- ([Isa 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011).md). In both
clauses there may be an allusion to [Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005.md), [Num
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#026.md), Septuagint. God's part and
man's part are marked out. God chooseth and knoweth His elect; our part
is to believe, and by the Spirit depart from all iniquity, an
unequivocal proof of our being the Lord's (compare [Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md); [Luk
13:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#023).md). St. Lucian when asked by
his persecutors, "Of what country art thou?" replied, "I am a
Christian." "What is your occupation? . . . I am a Christian." "Of what
family? . . . I am a Christian." \[CHRYSOSTOM, Orations, 75\]. He cannot
be honored with the name Christian, who dishonors by iniquity, Christ,
the Author of the name. Blandina's refreshment amidst her tortures was
to say, "I am a Christian, and with us Christians no evil is done"
\[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 5.1\]. Apostasy from the faith is
sure soon to be followed by indulgence in iniquity. It was so with the
false teachers ([Ti2 3:2-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#002.md), [Ti2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#013).md).

[2 Timothy 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020.md)

in a great house--that is, the visible professing Christian Church ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015).md). Paul is speaking, not of those
without, but of the \[visible\] family of God \[CALVIN\]. So the parable
of the sweep-net ([Mat 13:47-49](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#047).md)
gathering together of every kind, good and bad: as the good and bad
cannot be distinguished while under the waves, but only when brought to
shore, so believers and unbelievers continue in the same Church, until
the judgment makes the everlasting distinction. "The ark of Noah is a
type of the Church; as in the former there were together the leopard and
the kid, the wolf and the lamb; so in the latter, the righteous and
sinners, vessels of gold and silver, with vessels of wood and earth"
\[JEROME, Dialogue against the Luciferians, 302\] (compare [Mat
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016).md).

vessels of gold . . . silver--precious and able to endure fire.

of wood and earth--worthless, fragile, and soon burnt ([Co1
3:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md); [Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047).md).

some . . . some--the former . . . the latter.

to dishonour-- ([Pro 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004.md); [Rom
9:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017).md).

[2 Timothy 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ti2 2:21</span></span>

If a man . . . purge himself from these--The Greek expresses "If one
(for example, thou, Timothy) purify himself (so as to separate) from
among these" (vessels unto dishonor).

sanctified--set apart as wholly consecrated to the Lord.

and meet--Some oldest manuscripts omit "and."

the master's--the Lord's. Paul himself was such a vessel: once one among
those of earth, but afterwards he became by grace one of gold.

prepared unto every good work-- ([Ti2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md); [Tit
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001).md). Contrast [Tit
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md).

[2 Timothy 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ti2 2:22</span></span>

Flee--There are many lusts from which our greatest safety is in flight
([Gen 39:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#012).md). Avoid occasions of sin.
From the abstemious character of Timothy ([Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023).md) it is likely that not animal
indulgences, but the impetuosity, rash self-confidence, hastiness,
strife, and vainglory of young men ([Jo1
2:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#014).md), are what he is here warned
against: though the Spirit probably intended the warning to include both
in its application to the Church in general.

also--Greek, "But"; in contrast to "every good work," [Ti2
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#021.md).

youthful--Timothy was a youth ([Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012).md).

righteousness--the opposite of "iniquity," that is, unrighteousness
([Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019.md); compare [Ti1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011).md).

peace, with, &c.--rather, put no comma, "peace with them that call on
the Lord out of a pure heart" ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md); [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md); [Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022).md). We are to love all men, but it
is not possible to be at peace with all men, for this needs community of
purpose and opinion; they alone who call on the Lord sincerely (as
contrasted with the false teachers who had only the form of godliness,
[Ti2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#005.md), [Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md); [Tit
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md) have this community
\[THEODORET\]. ([Rom 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018).md).

[2 Timothy 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ti2 2:23</span></span>

([Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009)..md)

unlearned--Greek, "undisciplined"; not tending to promote the discipline
of faith and morals ([Pro 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#023).md).
"Uninstructive"; in contrast with "instructing" ([Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025).md), and "wise unto salvation" ([Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md).

avoid--"decline."

[2 Timothy 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ti2 2:24</span></span>

not strive--"The servant of the Lord" must imitate his master in not
striving contentiously, though uncompromising in earnestly contending
for the faith ([Jde 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003.md); [Mat
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#019).md).

gentle unto all men--"patient" (Greek, "patient in bearing wrongs") in
respect to adversaries. He is to be gentle so that he may occasion no
evils; patient so that he may endure evils.

apt to teach--implying not only solid teaching and ease in teaching, but
patience and assiduity in it \[BENGEL\].

[2 Timothy 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ti2 2:25</span></span>

instructing--Greek, "disciplining," instructing with correction, which
those who deal in "uninstructive" or "undisciplined questions" need (see
on [Ti2 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023.md); [Ti1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020).md).

those that oppose themselves--Greek, "oppositely affected"; those of a
different opinion.

if . . . peradventure--Greek, "if at any time."

repentance--which they need as antecedent to the full knowledge (so the
Greek for 'acknowledgment') of the truth" ([Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004).md), their minds being corrupted
([Ti2 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md), and their lives immoral.
The cause of the spiritual ignorance which prompts such "questions" is
moral, having its seat in the will, not in the intellect ([Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md). Therefore repentance is their
first need. That, not man, but God alone can "give" ([Act
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031).md).

[2 Timothy 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ti2 2:26</span></span>

recover themselves--Greek, "awake to soberness," namely from the
spiritual intoxication whereby they have fallen into the snare of the
devil.

the snare-- ([Eph 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md), "the wiles of
the devil": [Ti1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md); [Ti1
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009).md).

taken captive by him at his will--so as to follow the will of "THAT"
(the Greek emphatically marks Satan thus) foe. However, different Greek
pronouns stand for "him" and "his"; and the Greek for "taken captive"
means not "captured for destruction," but "for being saved alive," as in
[Luk 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010.md), "Thou shalt catch men to
save them unto life"; also there is no article before the Greek
participle, which the English Version "who are taken captive," would
require. Therefore, translate, "That they may awake . . . taken as saved
(and willing) captives by him (the servant of the Lord, [Ti2
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024).md), so as to follow the will of HIM
(the Lord, [Ti2 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024.md), or "God," [Ti2
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025).md)." There are here two evils, the
"snare" and sleep, from which they are delivered: and two goods to which
they are translated, awaking and deliverance. Instead of Satan's thrall
comes the free and willing captivity of obedience to Christ ([Co2
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005).md). It is God who goes before,
giving repentance ([Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025).md); then
the work of His servant following is sure to be crowned with success,
leading the convert henceforth to "live to the will of God" ([Act
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md); [Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002).md).
