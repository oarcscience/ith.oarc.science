Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Acts Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

[Acts 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 21:1</span></span>

SAILING FROM EPHESUS, THEY LAND AT TYRE, AND THENCE SAILING TO
PTOLEMAIS, THEY PROCEED BY LAND TO CÃ†SAREA AND JERUSALEM. (Acts
21:1-16)

we were gotten--"torn."

from them--expressing the difficulty and pain of the parting.

with a straight course--running before the wind, as [Act
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#011.md).

unto Coos--Cos, an island due south from Miletus, which they would reach
in about six hours, and coming close to the mainland.

the day following unto Rhodes--another island, some fifty miles to the
southeast, of brilliant classic memory and beauty.

thence unto Patara--a town on the magnificent mainland of Lycia, almost
due east from Rhodes. It was the seat of a celebrated oracle of Apollo.

[Acts 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 21:2</span></span>

And finding a ship--their former one going no farther, probably.

to PhÅ“nica--(See on [Act 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019).md).

went abroad--One would almost think this extracted from a journal of the
voyage, so graphic are its details.

[Acts 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 21:3</span></span>

when we . . . discovered--"sighted," as the phrase is.

Cyprus, we left it on the left hand--that is, steered southeast of it,
leaving it on the northwest.

sailed into--"unto"

Syria, and landed at Tyre--the celebrated seat of maritime commerce for
East and West. It might be reached from Patara in about two days.

there the ship was to unlade her burden--which gave the apostle time for
what follows.

[Acts 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 21:4</span></span>

finding disciples--finding out the disciples, implying some search. They
would expect such, from what is recorded, [Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md). Perhaps they were not many; yet
there were gifted ones among them.

who said to Paul . . . that he should not go up to Jerusalem--(See on
[Act 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#023.md); also see on [Act
21:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011).md).

[Acts 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 21:5</span></span>

they all brought us on our way with wives and children . . . and we
kneeled down on the shore and prayed--(See on [Act
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036).md). Observe here that the children
of these Tyrian disciples not only were taken along with their parents,
but must have joined in this act of solemn worship. See on [Eph
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md).

[Acts 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 21:7</span></span>

when we had finished our course--completing the voyage

from Tyre, we came--which they would do the same day.

to Ptolemais--anciently called Accho ([Jdg
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031).md), now St. Jean d'Acre, or Acre.

and saluted the brethren, and abode, &c.--disciples gathered probably as
at Tyre, on the occasion mentioned ([Act
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019).md).

[Acts 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 21:8</span></span>

next day we that were of Paul's company departed--(The words "the were
of Paul's company" are omitted in the best manuscripts. They were
probably added as the connecting words at the head of some church
lessons).

and came to CÃ&brvbr;sarea--a run along the coast, southward, of some
thirty miles.

Philip the evangelist--a term answering apparently very much to our
missionary \[HOWSON\], by whose ministry such joy had been diffused over
Samaria and the Ethiopian eunuch had been baptized (Acts 8:4-40).

one of the seven--deacons, who had "purchased to himself a good degree"
([Ti1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#013).md). He and Paul now meet for
the first time, some twenty-five years after that time.

[Acts 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 21:9</span></span>

the same man had four daughters . . . which did prophesy--fulfilling
[Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md) (see [Act
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#018).md). This is mentioned, it would
seem, merely as a high distinction divinely conferred on so devoted a
servant of the Lord Jesus, and probably indicates the high tone of
religion in his family.

[Acts 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 21:10</span></span>

tarried there many--"a good many"

days--Finding himself in good time for Pentecost at Jerusalem, he would
feel it a refreshing thing to his spirit to hold Christian communion for
a few days with such a family.

there came down from Judea--the news of Paul's arrival having spread.

a certain prophet . . . Agabus--no doubt the same as in [Act
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md).

[Acts 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 21:11</span></span>

So shall the Jews bind the man that owneth this girdle, &c.--For though
the Romans did it, it was at the Jews' instigation ([Act
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033.md); [Act
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#017).md). Such dramatic methods of
announcing important future events would bring the old prophets to
remembrance. (Compare [Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md), &c.;
[Jer 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md), and [Eze
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001), &c..md). This prediction and that at
Tyre ([Act 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#004).md) were intended, not to
prohibit him from going, but to put his courage to the test and when he
stood the test, to deepen and mature it.

[Acts 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 21:12</span></span>

we and they at that place--the CÃ&brvbr;sarean Christians.

besought him--even with tears, [Act
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md).

not to go to Jerusalem.

[Acts 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 21:13</span></span>

Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart--Beautiful union of manly resoluteness and womanly tenderness,
alike removed from mawkishness and stoicism!

I am ready not to be bound only--"If that is all, let it come."

but to die, &c.--It was well he could add this, for he had that also to
do.

[Acts 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 21:15</span></span>

we took up our carriages--"our baggage."

and went up to Jerusalem--for the fifth time after his conversion, thus
concluding his third missionary tour, which proved his last, so far as
recorded; for though he accomplished the fourth and last part of the
missionary plan sketched out ([Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021).md) --"After I have been at
Jerusalem, I must also see Rome"--it was as "a prisoner of Jesus
Christ."

[Acts 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 21:16</span></span>

went with us . . . and brought with them--rather, "brought us to."

One Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, &c.--not an "aged" disciple, but
probably "a disciple of old standing," perhaps one of the three thousand
converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to the
Saviour Himself during His lifetime. He had come, probably, with the
other Cyprians ([Act 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020).md), to
Antioch, "preaching the Lord Jesus unto the Grecians," and now he
appears settled at Jerusalem.

[Acts 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 21:17</span></span>

PAUL REPORTS THE EVENTS OF HIS THIRD MISSIONARY JOURNEY--IN THE TEMPLE,
PURIFYING HIMSELF FROM A JEWISH VOW, HE IS SEIZED BY A MOB AND BEATEN TO
THE DANGER OF HIS LIFE--THE UPROAR BECOMING UNIVERSAL, THE ROMAN
COMMANDANT HAS HIM BROUGHT IN CHAINS TO THE FORTRESS, FROM THE STAIRS OF
WHICH HE IS PERMITTED TO ADDRESS THE PEOPLE. (Acts 21:17-40)

the brethren received us gladly--the disciples generally, as
distinguished from the official reception recorded in [Act
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md).

[Acts 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 21:18</span></span>

Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present--to
"report himself" formally to the acknowledged head of the church at
Jerusalem, and his associates in office. See on [Act
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md). Had any other of the apostles
been in Jerusalem on that occasion, it could hardly fail to have been
noted.

[Acts 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 21:19</span></span>

he declared particularly--in detail.

what God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry--as on previous
occasions ([Act 14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md); and see [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015).md); no doubt referring to the
insidious and systematic efforts of the Judaizing party in a number of
places to shrivel the Church of Christ into a Jewish sect, and his own
counter-procedure.

[Acts 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 21:20</span></span>

they glorified the Lord, &c.--constrained to justify his course,
notwithstanding the Jewish complexion of the Christianity of Jerusalem.

[Acts 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 21:21</span></span>

they are informed . . . that thou teachest all the Jews which are among
the Gentiles--those residing in heathen countries.

to forsake Moses, &c.--This calumny of the unbelieving Jews would find
easy credence among the Christian zealots for Judaism.

[Acts 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 21:23</span></span>

we have four men--Christian Jews, no doubt.

which have a vow--perhaps kept ready on purpose.

[Acts 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 21:24</span></span>

be at charges with them--that is, defray the expense of the sacrifices
legally required of them, along with his own, which was deemed a mark of
Jewish generosity.

[Acts 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 21:25</span></span>

touching the Gentiles . . . we have written and concluded that they
observe no such things, &c.--This shows that with all their conciliation
to Jewish prejudice, the Church of Jerusalem was taught to adhere to the
decision of the famous council held there ([Act
15:19-29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019).md).

[Acts 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 21:26</span></span>

to signify--that is, announce to the priest.

the accomplishment of the days of purification, &c.--(See on [Num
6:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#014).md).

[Acts 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 21:27</span></span>

the Jews . . . of Asia--in all likelihood those of Ephesus (since they
recognized Trophimus apparently as a townsman, [Act
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029).md), embittered by their
discomfiture ([Act 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009), &c..md).

[Acts 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 21:29</span></span>

Trophimus--(See on [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004).md).

[Acts 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 21:30</span></span>

took Paul, and drew him out of the temple; and forthwith the doors were
shut--that the murder they meant to perpetrate might not pollute that
holy place.

[Acts 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 21:31</span></span>

tidings came--literally, "went up," that is, to the fortress of Antonia,
where the commandant resided. See on [Act
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#032.md). This part of the narrative is
particularly graphic.

[Acts 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">act 21:32</span></span>

the chief captain--"the chiliarch," or tribune of the Roman cohort,
whose full number was one thousand men.

[Acts 21:33](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 21:33</span></span>

commanded him to be bound with two chains--(See on [Act
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006).md).

[Acts 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 21:34</span></span>

some cried one thing--The difficulty would be so to state his crimes as
to justify their proceedings to a Roman officer.

to be carried into the castle--rather, perhaps, "the barracks," or that
part of the fortress of Antonia appropriated to the soldiers. The fort
was built by Herod on a high rock at the northwest corner of the great
temple area, and called after Mark Antony.

[Acts 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 21:35</span></span>

Away with him--as before of his Lord ([Luk
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#018.md); [Joh
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015).md).

[Acts 21:37](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 21:37</span></span>

Art not thou that Egyptian, &c.--The form of the question implies that
the answer is to be in the negative, and is matter of some surprise:
"Thou art not then?" &c.

[Acts 21:38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 21:38</span></span>

madest an uproar, &c.--The narrative is given in JOSEPHUS \[Wars of the
Jews, 2.8.6; 13.5\], though his two allusions and ours seem to refer to
different periods of the rebellion.

[Acts 21:39](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 21:39</span></span>

a citizen of no mean city--(See on [Act
16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037).md).

[Acts 21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">act 21:40</span></span>

stood on the stairs--"What nobler spectacle than that of Paul at this
moment! There he stood, bound with two chains, ready to make his defense
to the people. The Roman commander sits by, to enforce order by his
presence. An enraged populace look up to him from below. Yet in the
midst of so many dangers, how self-possessed is he, how tranquil!"
\[CHRYSOSTOM (or in his name) in HACKETT\].

a great silence--the people awed at the permission given him by the
commandant, and seeing him sitting as a listener.

in the Hebrew tongue--the Syro-Chaldaic, the vernacular tongue of the
Palestine Jews since the captivity.
