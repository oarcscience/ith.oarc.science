### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 21:1</span></span>

DAVID, AT NOB, OBTAINS OF AHIMELECH HALLOWED BREAD. ([Sa1
21:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001).md)

Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech--Nob, a city of the priests ([Sa1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#019).md), was in the neighborhood of
Jerusalem, on the Mount of Olives--a little north of the top, and on the
northeast of the city. It is computed to have been about five miles
distant from Gibeah. Ahimelech, the same as Ahiah, or perhaps his
brother, both being sons of Ahitub (compare [Sa1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md), with [Sa1
22:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#004.md), [Sa1
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#020).md). His object in fleeing to this
place was partly for the supply of his necessities, and partly for
comfort and counsel, in the prospect of leaving the kingdom.

Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David--suspecting some
extraordinary occurrence by his appearing so suddenly, and in such a
style, for his attendants were left at a little distance.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 21:2</span></span>

The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
know--This was a direct falsehood, extorted through fear. David probably
supposed, like many other persons, that a lie is quite excusable which
is told for the sole purpose of saving the speaker's life. But what is
essentially sinful, can never, from circumstances, change its immoral
character; and David had to repent of this vice of lying ([Psa
119:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#029).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 21:4</span></span>

there is hallowed bread--There would be plenty of bread in his house;
but there was no time to wait for it. "The hallowed bread" was the old
shew-bread, which had been removed the previous day, and which was
reserved for the use of the priests alone ([Lev
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#009).md). Before entertaining the idea
that this bread could be lawfully given to David and his men, the high
priest seems to have consulted the oracle ([Sa1
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#010).md) as to the course to be followed
in this emergency. A dispensation to use the hallowed bread was
specially granted by God Himself.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 21:5</span></span>

these three days--as required by law ([Exo
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015).md). David and his attendants seem
to have been lurking in some of the adjoining caves, to elude pursuit,
and to have been, consequently, reduced to great extremities of hunger.

the bread is in a manner common--that is, now that it is no longer
standing on the Lord's table. It is eaten by the priests, and may also,
in our circumstances, be eaten by us.

yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel--that is, though
the hallowed bread had been but newly placed on the vessel, the ritual
ordinance would have to yield to the great law of necessity and mercy
(see on [Mat 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md); also see [Mar
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#025.md); [Luk
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#003).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 21:6</span></span>

there was no bread there--in the tabernacle. The removal of the old and
the substitution of the new bread was done on the Sabbath ([Lev
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#008).md), the loaves being kept warm in
an oven heated the previous day.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 21:7</span></span>

Doeg, an Edomite--who had embraced the Hebrew religion.

detained before the Lord--at the tabernacle, perhaps, in the performance
of a vow, or from its being the Sabbath, which rendered it unlawful for
him to prosecute his journey.

the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul--Eastern monarchs
anciently had large possessions in flocks and herds; and the office of
the chief shepherd was an important one.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 21:9</span></span>

HE TAKES GOLIATH'S SWORD. ([Sa1 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#009).md)

sword of Goliath--(See on [Sa1 17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054).md).

behind the ephod--in the place allowed for keeping the sacred vestments,
of which the ephod is mentioned as the chief. The giant's sword was
deposited in that safe custody as a memorial of the divine goodness in
delivering Israel.

There is none like that--not only for its size and superior temper, but
for its being a pledge of the divine favor to him, and a constant
stimulus to his faith.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 21:10</span></span>

AT GATH HE FEIGNS HIMSELF MAD. ([Sa1
21:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#010).md)

David . . . fled . . . to Achish the king of Gath--which was one of the
five principalities of the Philistines. In this place his person must
have been known, and to venture into that country, he their greatest
enemy, and with the sword of Goliath in his hand, would seem to have
been a perilous experiment; but, doubtless, the protection he received
implies that he had been directed by the divine oracle. Achish was
generous ([Sa1 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1027.htm#006).md). He might wish to
weaken the resources of Saul, and it was common in ancient times for
great men to be harbored by neighboring princes.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 21:13</span></span>

feigned himself mad--It is supposed to have been an attack of epilepsy,
real or perhaps only pretended. This disease is relieved by foaming at
the mouth.

let his spittle fall down upon his beard--No wonder that Achish supposed
him insane, as such an indignity, whether done by another, or one's
self, to the beard, is considered in the East an intolerable insult.
