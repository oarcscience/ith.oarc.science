### [Hosea Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 7:1</span></span>

REPROOF OF ISRAEL. (Hos. 7:1-16)

Probably delivered in the interreign and civil war at Pekah's death; for
[Hos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md), "all their kings . . .
fallen," refers to the murder of Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah,
and Pekah. In [Hos 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008.md) the reference
seems to be to Menahem's payment of tribute to Pul, in order to secure
himself in the usurped throne, also to Pekah's league with Rezin of
Syria, and to Hoshea's connection with Assyria during the interregnum at
Pekah's death \[MAURER\].

I would have healed Israel--Israel's restoration of the two hundred
thousand Jewish captives at God's command ([Ch2
28:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#008).md) gave hope of Israel's
reformation \[HENDERSON\]. Political, as well as moral, healing is
meant. When I would have healed Israel in its calamitous state, then
their iniquity was discovered to be so great as to preclude hope of
recovery. Then he enumerates their wickedness: "The thief cometh in
(indoors stealthily), and the troop of robbers spoileth without"
(out-of-doors with open violence).

[Hosea 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 7:2</span></span>

consider not in their hearts--literally "say not to," &c. ([Psa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md).

that I remember--and will punish.

their own doings have beset them about--as so many witnesses against
them ([Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md); [Pro
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#022).md).

before my face-- ([Psa 90:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#008).md).

[Hosea 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 7:3</span></span>

Their princes, instead of checking, "have pleasure in them that do" such
crimes ([Rom 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032).md).

[Hosea 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 7:4</span></span>

who ceaseth from raising--rather, "heating" it, from an Arabic root, "to
be hot." So the Septuagint. Their adulterous and idolatrous lust is
inflamed as the oven of a baker who has it at such a heat that he
ceaseth from heating it only from the time that he hath kneaded the
dough, until it be leavened; he only needs to omit feeding it during the
short period of the fermentation of the bread. Compare [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md), "that cannot cease from sin"
\[HENDERSON\].

[Hosea 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 7:5</span></span>

the day of our king--his birthday or day of inauguration.

have made him sick--namely, the king. MAURER translates, "make
themselves sick."

with bottles of wine--drinking not merely glasses, but bottles. MAURER
translates, "Owing to the heat of wine."

he stretched out his hand with scorners--the gesture of revellers in
holding out the cup and in drinking to one another's health. Scoffers
were the king's boon companions.

[Hosea 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 7:6</span></span>

they have made ready--rather, "they make their heart approach," namely
their king, in going to drink with him.

like an oven--following out the image in [Hos
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#004.md). As it conceals the lighted fire
all night while the baker sleeps but in the morning burns as a flaming
fire, so they brood mischief in their hearts while conscience is lulled
asleep, and their wicked designs wait only for a fair occasion to break
forth \[HORSLEY\]. Their heart is the oven, their baker the ringleader
of the plot. In [Hos 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md) their plots
appear, namely, the intestine disturbances and murders of one king after
another, after Jeroboam II.

[Hosea 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 7:7</span></span>

all hot--All burn with eagerness to cause universal disturbance (2Ki.
15:1-38).

devoured their judges--magistrates; as the fire of the oven devours the
fuel.

all their kings . . . fallen--See on [Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001.md).

none . . . calleth unto me--Such is their perversity that amid all these
national calamities, none seeks help from Me ([Isa
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md); [Isa
64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md).

[Hosea 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 7:8</span></span>

mixed . . . among the people--by leagues with idolaters, and the
adoption of their idolatrous practices ([Hos
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md), [Hos
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md); [Psa
106:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#035).md).

Ephraim . . . cake not turned--a cake burnt on one side and unbaked on
the other, and so uneatable; an image of the worthlessness of Ephraim.
The Easterners bake their bread on the ground, covering it with embers
([Kg1 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#006).md), and turning it every ten
minutes, to bake it thoroughly without burning it.

[Hosea 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 7:9</span></span>

Strangers--foreigners: the Syrians and Assyrians ([Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007.md); [Kg2
15:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019.md); [Kg2
17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md).

gray hairs--that is, symptoms of approaching national dissolution.

are here and there upon--literally, "are sprinkled on" him.

yet he knoweth not--Though old age ought to bring with it wisdom, he
neither knows of his senile decay, nor has the true knowledge which
leads to reformation.

[Hosea 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 7:10</span></span>

Repetition of [Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md).

not return to . . . Lord . . . for all this--notwithstanding all their
calamities ([Isa 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 7:11</span></span>

like a silly dove--a bird proverbial for simplicity: easily deceived.

without heart--that is, understanding.

call to Egypt--Israel lying between the two great rival empires Egypt
and Assyria, sought each by turns to help her against the other. As this
prophecy was written in the reign of Hoshea, the allusion is probably to
the alliance with So or Sabacho II (of which a record has been found on
the clay cylindrical seals in Koyunjik), which ended in the overthrow of
Hoshea and the deportation of Israel ([Kg2
17:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md). As the dove betrays its
foolishness by fleeing in alarm from its nest only to fall into the net
of the fowler, so Israel, though warned that foreign alliances would be
their ruin, rushed into them.

[Hosea 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 7:12</span></span>

When they shall go--to seek aid from this or that foreign state.

spread my net upon them--as on birds taken on the ground ([Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013).md), as contrasted with "bringing
them down" as the "fowls of the heavens," namely, by the use of
missiles.

as their congregation hath heard--namely, by My prophets through whom I
threatened "chastisement" ([Hos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md);
[Kg2 17:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#013).md).

[Hosea 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 7:13</span></span>

fled--as birds from their nest ([Pro
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#008.md); [Isa
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#002).md).

me--who both could and would have healed them ([Hos
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#001).md), had they applied to Me.

redeemed them--from Egypt and their other enemies ([Mic
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004).md).

lies-- ([Psa 78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036.md); [Jer
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#010).md). Pretending to be My
worshippers, when they all the while worshipped idols ([Hos
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md); [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md); also defrauding Me of the glory
of their deliverance, and ascribing it and their other blessings to
idols \[CALVIN\].

[Hosea 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 7:14</span></span>

not cried unto me--but unto other gods \[MAURER\], ([Job
35:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#009).md). Or, they did indeed cry unto
Me, but not "with their heart": answering to "lies," [Hos
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013.md) (see on [Hos
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013).md).

when they howled upon their beds--sleepless with anxiety; image of deep
affliction. Their cry is termed "howling," as it is the cry of anguish,
not the cry of repentance and faith.

assemble . . . for corn, &c.--namely in the temples of their idols, to
obtain from them a good harvest and vintage, instead of coming to Me,
the true Giver of these ([Hos 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md),
[Hos 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#008.md), [Hos
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#012).md), proving that their cry to God
was "not with their heart."

rebel against me--literally, "withdraw themselves against Me," that is,
not only withdraw from Me, but also rebel against Me.

[Hosea 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 7:15</span></span>

I . . . bound--when I saw their arms as it were relaxed with various
disasters, I bound them so as to strengthen their sinews; image from
surgery \[CALVIN\]. MAURER translates, "I instructed them" to war ([Psa
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#034.md); [Psa
144:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#001).md), namely, under Jeroboam II
([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md). GROTIUS explains,
"Whether I chastised them (Margin) or strengthened their arms, they
imagined mischief against Me." English Version is best.

[Hosea 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 7:16</span></span>

return, but not to the Most High--or, "to one who is not the Most High,"
one very different from Him, a stock or a stone. So the Septuagint.

deceitful bow-- ([Psa 78:57](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#057).md). A bow
which, from its faulty construction, shoots wide of the mark. So Israel
pretends to seek God, but turns aside to idols.

for the rage of their tongue--their boast of safety from Egyptian aid,
and their "lies" ([Hos 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#013).md), whereby
they pretended to serve God, while worshipping idols; also their
perverse defense for their idolatries and blasphemies against God and
His prophets ([Psa 73:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#009.md); [Psa
120:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#002).md).

their derision in . . . Egypt--Their "fall" shall be the subject of
"derision" to Egypt, to whom they had applied for help ([Hos
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#003.md), [Hos
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006.md); [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md).
