### [Psalms Chapter 113](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 113:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 113:1</span></span>

God's majesty contrasted with His condescension and gracious dealings
towards the humble furnish matter and a call for praise. The Jews, it is
said, used this and Psalms 114-118 on their great festivals, and called
them the Greater Hallel, or Hymn. ([Psa
113:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#001).md)

Earnestness and zeal are denoted by the emphatic repetitions.

servants of the Lord--or, all the people of God.

name of the Lord--perfections ([Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011.md); [Psa
111:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 113:3</span></span>

From the rising, &c.--all the world.

[Psalms 113:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 113:4</span></span>

God's exaltation enhances His condescension;

[Psalms 113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 113:7</span></span>

which condescension is illustrated as often in raising the worthy poor
and needy to honor (compare [Sa1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md);
[Psa 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#025).md).

[Psalms 113:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 113:9</span></span>

On this special case, compare [Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021.md). Barrenness was regarded as a
disgrace, and is a type of a deserted Church ([Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001).md).

the barren woman . . . house--literally, "the barren of the house," so
that the supplied words may be omitted.
