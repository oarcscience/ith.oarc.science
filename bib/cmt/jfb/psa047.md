### [Psalms Chapter 47](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 47:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 47:1</span></span>

Praise is given to God for victory, perhaps that recorded ([Ch2
20:20-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020).md); and His dominions over all
people, Jews and Gentiles, is asserted. ([Psa
47:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#001).md)

clap . . . hands . . . people--literally, "peoples," or "nations"
(compare [Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md); [Psa
18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md); [Psa
98:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#009).md).

[Psalms 47:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 47:2</span></span>

His universal sovereignty now exists, and will be made known.

[Psalms 47:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 47:3</span></span>

under us--that is, His saints; Israel's temporal victories were types of
the spiritual conquests of the true Church.

[Psalms 47:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 47:4</span></span>

He shall . . . inheritance--the heathen to be possessed by His Church
([Psa 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008).md), as Canaan by the Jews.

excellency of Jacob--literally, "pride," or, that in which he glories
(not necessarily, though often, in a bad sense), the privileges of the
chosen people--

whom he loved--His love being the sole cause of granting them.

[Psalms 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 47:5</span></span>

God, victorious over His enemies, reascends to heaven, amid the
triumphant praises of His people, who celebrate His sovereign dominion.
This sovereignty is what the Psalm teaches; hence he adds,

sing . . . praises with understanding--literally, "sing and play an
instructive (Psalm)." The whole typifies Christ's ascension (compare
[Psa 68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018).md).

[Psalms 47:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 47:8</span></span>

The instruction continued.

throne of . . . holiness--or, "holy throne" (see on [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 47:9</span></span>

princes--who represent peoples. For--

even--supply, "as," or, "to"--that is, they all become united under
covenant with Abraham's God.

shields--as in [Hos 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md), "rulers"
\[Margin\].
