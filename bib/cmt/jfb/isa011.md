Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)

[Isaiah 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 11:1</span></span>

(Isa. 11:1-16)

rod--When the proud "boughs" of "Lebanon" ([Isa
10:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#033), the Assyrians) are lopped,
and the vast "forests cut down" amidst all this rage, a seemingly humble
rod shall come out of Jesse (Messiah), who shall retrieve the injuries
done by the Assyrian "rod" to Israel ([Isa
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005), [Isa
10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018)).

stem--literally, "the stump" of a tree cut close by the roots: happily
expressing the depressed state of the royal house of David, owing to the
hostile storm ([Isa 10:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#018)), when
Messiah should arise from it, to raise it to more than its pristine
glory. [Luk 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007) proves this ([Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002); compare [Job
14:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007); see on [Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006)).

Branch--Scion. He is nevertheless also the "root" ([Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010); [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005); [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016). "Root and offspring" combines
both, [Zac 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 11:2</span></span>

Spirit of the Lord--JEHOVAH. The Spirit by which the prophets spake: for
Messiah was to be a Prophet ([Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001); [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015), [Deu
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018)). Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
are specified, to imply that the perfection of them was to be in Him.
Compare "the seven Spirits" ([Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004)), that is, the Holy Ghost in His
perfect fulness: seven being the sacred number. The prophets had only a
portion out of the "fulness" in the Son of God ([Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034); [Col
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#019)).

rest--permanently; not merely come upon Him ([Num
11:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025)).

wisdom-- ([Co1 1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030); [Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017); [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)).

understanding--coupled with "wisdom," being its fruit. Discernment and
discrimination ([Mat 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018); [Joh
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#025)).

counsel . . . might--the faculty of forming counsels, and that of
executing them ([Isa 28:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#029)).
Counsellor ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)).

knowledge--of the deep things of God ([Mat
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#027)). The knowledge of Him gives us
true knowledge ([Eph 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017)).

fear of the Lord--reverential, obedient fear. The first step towards
true "knowledge" ([Job 28:28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#028); [Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 11:3</span></span>

make him of quick understanding--literally, "quick-scented in the fear
of Jehovah"; endowed with a singular sagacity in discerning the genuine
principle of religious fear of God, when it lies dormant in the yet
unawakened sinner ([Mat 12:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#020); Acts
10:1-48; [Act 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)) \[HORSLEY\]. But
MAURER, "He shall delight in the fear of God." The Hebrew means "to
delight in the odors" of anything ([Exo
30:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#038); [Amo
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021)); "smell," that is, "delight in."

after . . . sight--according to mere external appearances ([Joh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024); [Joh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015); [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001); [Sa1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007)). Herein Messiah is represented a
just Judge and Ruler ([Deu 1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#016)).

reprove--"decide," as the parallelism shows.

after . . . ears--by mere plausible hearsays, but by the true merits of
each case ([Joh 6:64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064); [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023)).

[Isaiah 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 11:4</span></span>

judge--see that impartial justice is done them. "Judge" may mean here
"rule," as in [Psa 67:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#004).

reprove--or, "argue"; "decide." But LOWTH, "work conviction in."

earth--Compare with [Mat 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005), and [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).

earth--its ungodly inhabitants, answering to "the wicked" in the
parallel, and in antithesis to the "poor" and "meek," namely, in spirit,
the humble pious ([Mat 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003)). It is at
the same time implied that "the earth" will be extraordinarily wicked
when He shall come to judge and reign. His reign shall therefore be
ushered in with judgments on the apostates ([Psa
2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009); [Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008); [Rev
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#027)).

rod of . . . mouth--condemning sentences which proceed from His mouth
against the wicked ([Rev 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016); [Rev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021)).

breath of . . . lips--his judicial decisions ([Isa
30:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#028); [Job
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#030); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020); [Rev
20:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#009)). He as the Word of God ([Rev
19:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013)) comes to strike that blow
which shall decide His claim to the kingdom, previously usurped by
Satan, and "the beast" to whom Satan delegates his power. It will be a
day of judgment to the Gentile dispensation, as the first coming was to
the Jews. Compare a type of the "rod" ([Num
17:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#002)).

[Isaiah 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 11:5</span></span>

righteousness . . . girdle-- ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013); [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)). The antitypical High Priest
([Exo 28:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#004)). The girdle secures firmly
the rest of the garments ([Pe1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013)).
So "truth" gives firm consistency to the whole character ([Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)). In [Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017), "righteousness" is His
breastplate.

[Isaiah 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 11:6</span></span>

wolf . . . lamb--Each animal is coupled with that one which is its
natural prey. A fit state of things under the "Prince of Peace" ([Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025); [Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018)). These may be figures for men of
corresponding animal-like characters ([Eze
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027); [Eze
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013); [Jer
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#006); [Jer
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023); [Mat
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#015); [Luk
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#003)). Still a literal change in the
relations of animals to man and each other, restoring the state in Eden,
is a more likely interpretation. Compare [Gen
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019), with [Psa
8:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006), which describes the restoration
to man, in the person of "the Son of man," of the lost dominion over the
animal kingdom of which he had been designed to be the merciful
vicegerent under God, for the good of his animal subjects ([Rom
8:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 11:7</span></span>

feed--namely, "together"; taken from the second clause.

straw--no longer flesh and blood.

[Isaiah 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 11:8</span></span>

play--literally, "delight" himself in sport.

cockatrice--a fabulous serpent supposed to be hatched from the egg of a
cock. The Hebrew means a kind of adder, more venomous than the asp;
BOCHART supposes the basilisk to be meant, which was thought to poison
even with its breath.

[Isaiah 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 11:9</span></span>

my holy mountain--Zion, that is, Jerusalem. The seat of government and
of Messiah's throne is put for the whole earth ([Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017)).

sea--As the waters find their way into every cavern of its depths, so
Christianity shall pervade every recess of the earth ([Hab
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#014)). As [Isa
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001) describe the personal qualities
of Messiah, and [Isa 11:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006) the
regenerating effects of His coming on creation, so [Isa
11:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010) the results of it in the
restoration of His people, the Jews, and the conversion through them of
the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 11:10</span></span>

root--rather, "shoot from the root" (compare Note, see on [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002); [Rev
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005); [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)).

stand--permanently and prominently, as a banner lifted up to be the
rallying point of an army or people ([Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026); [Joh
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)).

the people--peoples, answering to "the Gentiles" in the parallel member.

to it . . . seek--diligently ([Job
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005)). They shall give in their
allegiance to the Divine King ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Isa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005); [Zac
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011)). HORSLEY translates, "Of Him
shall the Gentiles inquire"; namely, in a religious sense, resort as to
an oracle for consultation in difficulties" ([Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016)). Compare [Rom
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012), which quotes this passage, "In
Him shall the Gentiles trust."

rest--resting-place ([Isa 60:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#013); [Psa
132:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#008), [Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014); [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007)). The sanctuary in the temple of
Jerusalem was "the resting-place of the ark and of Jehovah." So the
glorious Church which is to be is described under the image of an oracle
to which all nations shall resort, and which shall be filled with the
visible glory of God.

[Isaiah 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 11:11</span></span>

set . . . hand--take in hand the work. Therefore the coming restoration
of the Jews is to be distinct from that after the Babylonish captivity,
and yet to resemble it. The first restoration was literal, therefore so
shall the second be; the latter, however, it is implied here, shall be
much more universal than the former ([Isa
43:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005); [Isa
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#012), [Isa
49:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#017); [Eze
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005); [Amo
9:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014); [Mic
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#006); [Zep
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019); [Zac
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010); [Jer
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#008)). As to the "remnant" destined by
God to survive the judgments on the nation, compare [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028).

Pathros--one of the three divisions of Egypt, Upper Egypt.

Cush--either Ethiopia, south of Egypt, now Abyssinia, or the southern
parts of Arabia, along the Red Sea.

Elam--Persia, especially the southern part of it now called Susiana.

Shinar--Babylonian Mesopotamia, the plain between the Euphrates and the
Tigris: in it Babel was begun ([Gen
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010)). In the Assyrian inscriptions
RAWLINSON distinguishes three periods: (1) The Chaldean; from 2300 B.C.
to 1500, in which falls Chedorlaomer (Gen. 14:1-17), called in the
cuneiform characters Kudur of Hur, or Ur of the Chaldees, and described
as the conqueror of Syria. The seat of the first Chaldean empire was in
the south, towards the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. (2) The
Assyrian, down to 625 B.C. (3) The Babylonian, from 625 to 538 B.C.,
when Babylon was taken by the Persian Cyrus.

islands of . . . sea--the far western regions beyond the sea \[JEROME\].

[Isaiah 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 11:12</span></span>

In the first restoration Judah alone was restored, with perhaps some few
of Israel (the ten tribes): in the future restoration both are expressly
specified ([Eze 37:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018)). To Israel are ascribed the
"outcasts" (masculine); to Judah the "dispersed" (feminine), as the
former have been longer and more utterly castaways (though not finally)
than the latter ([Joh 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052)). The
masculine and feminine conjoined express the universality of the
restoration.

from the four corners of the earth--Hebrew, "wings of the earth."

[Isaiah 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 11:13</span></span>

envy . . . of Ephraim . . . Judah--which began as early as the time
([Jdg 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001); [Jdg
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg012.htm#001), &c.). Joshua had sprung from,
and resided among the Ephraimites ([Num
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#009); [Jos
19:50](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#050)); the sanctuary was with them
for a time ([Jos 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001)). The jealousy
increased subsequently ([Sa2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#008), &c.;
[Sa2 19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041); [Sa2
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#002); [Sa2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#010)); and even before David's time
([Sa1 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1011.htm#008); [Sa1
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#004)), they had appropriated to
themselves the national name Israel. It ended in disruption ([Kg1
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#026), &c.; 1Ki. 12:1-33; compare [Kg2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009); Psa. 78:56-71).

adversaries of Judah--rather, "the adversaries from Judah"; those of
Judah hostile to the Ephraimites \[MAURER\]. The parallelism "the envy
of Ephraim," namely, against Judah, requires this, as also what follows;
namely, "Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim"
([Eze 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015), [Eze
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#017), [Eze
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#019)).

[Isaiah 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 11:14</span></span>

With united forces they shall subdue their foes ([Amo
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012)).

fly--as a bird of prey ([Hab 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#008)).

upon the shoulders--This expresses an attack made unexpectedly on one
from behind. The image is the more apt, as the Hebrew for "shoulders" in
[Num 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011) is used also of a maritime
coast ("side of the sea": Hebrew, "shoulder of the sea," Margin). They
shall make a sudden victorious descent upon their borders southwest of
Judea.

them of the east--Hebrew, "children of the East," the Arabs, who, always
hostile, are not to be reduced under regular government, but are only to
be despoiled ([Jer 49:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#028)).

lay . . . hand upon--take possession of ([Dan
11:42](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#042)).

Edom--south of Judah, from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea; "Moab"--east of
Jordan and the Dead Sea.

Ammon--east of Judea, north of Moab, between the Arnon and Jabbok.

[Isaiah 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 11:15</span></span>

There shall be a second exodus, destined to eclipse even the former one
from Egypt in its wonders. So the prophecies elsewhere ([Psa
68:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#022); [Exo
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022); [Zac
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#011)). The same deliverance furnishes
the imagery by which the return from Babylon is described ([Isa
48:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020)).

destroy--literally, "devote," or "doom," that is, dry up; for what God
dooms, perishes ([Psa 106:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#009) [Nah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004)).

tongue--the Bubastic branch of the Nile \[VITRINGA\]; but as the Nile
was not the obstruction to the exodus, it is rather the west tongue or
HeroÃ¶polite fork of the Red Sea.

with . . . mighty wind--such as the "strong east wind" ([Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021)), by which God made a way for
Israel through the Red Sea. The Hebrew for "mighty" means terrible.
MAURER translates, "With the terror of His anger"; that is, His terrible
anger.

in the seven streams--rather, "shall smite it (divide it by smiting)
into seven (many) streams, so as to be easily crossed" \[LOWTH\]. So
Cyrus divided the river Gyndes, which retarded his march against
Babylon, into three hundred sixty streams, so that even a woman could
cross it \[HERODOTUS, 1.189\]. "The river" is the Euphrates, the
obstruction to Israel's return "from Assyria" ([Isa
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016)), a type of all future
impediments to the restoration of the Jews.

dry shod--Hebrew, "in shoes." Even in sandals they should be able to
pass over the once mighty river without being wet ([Rev
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 11:16</span></span>

highway--a highway clear of obstructions ([Isa
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#023); [Isa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008)).

like as . . . Israel . . . Egypt-- ([Isa
51:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#010); [Isa
63:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012)).

Just as Miriam, after the deliverance of the Red Sea ([Isa
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016)), celebrated it with an ode of
praise (Exo. 15:1-19).
