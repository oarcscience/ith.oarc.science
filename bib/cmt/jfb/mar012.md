### [Mark Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#001.md)

[Mark 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 12:13</span></span>

ENTANGLING QUESTIONS ABOUT TRIBUTE THE RESURRECTION, AND THE GREAT
COMMANDMENT, WITH THE REPLIES--CHRIST BAFFLES THE PHARISEES BY A
QUESTION ABOUT DAVID, AND DENOUNCES THE SCRIBES. ( = Mat. 22:15-46; Luke
20:20-47). (Mark 12:13-40)

And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees--"their disciples," says
Matthew ([Mat 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016).md); probably young
and zealous scholars in that hardening school.

and of the Herodians--(See on [Mat
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#014).md). In [Luk
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#020.md) these willing tools are called
"spies, which should feign themselves just \[righteous\] men, that they
might take hold of His words, that so they might deliver Him unto the
power and authority of the governor." Their plan, then, was to entrap
Him into some expression which might be construed into disaffection to
the Roman government; the Pharisees themselves being notoriously
discontented with the Roman yoke.

Tribute to CÃ&brvbr;sar ([Mar
12:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#014).md).

[Mark 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 12:14</span></span>

And when they were come, they say unto him, Master--Teacher.

we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest
not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth--By such
flattery--though they said only the truth--they hoped to throw Him off
His guard.

Is it lawful to give tribute to CÃ&brvbr;sar, or not?--It was the civil
poll tax paid by all enrolled in the "census." See on [Mat
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#025.md).

[Mark 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 12:15</span></span>

Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
hypocrisy--"their wickedness" ([Mat
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018).md); "their craftiness" ([Luk
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#023).md). The malignity of their hearts
took the form of craft, pretending what they did not feel--an anxious
desire to be guided aright in a matter which to a scrupulous few might
seem a question of some difficulty. Seeing perfectly through this,

He said unto them, Why tempt ye me?--"hypocrites!"

bring me a penny that I may see it--"the tribute money" ([Mat
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#019).md).

[Mark 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 12:16</span></span>

And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
image--stamped upon the coin.

and superscription?--the words encircling it on the obverse side.

And they said unto him, CÃ&brvbr;sar's.

[Mark 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 12:17</span></span>

And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to CÃ&brvbr;sar the things
that are CÃ&brvbr;sar's--Putting it in this general form, it was
impossible for sedition itself to dispute it, and yet it dissolved the
snare.

and to God the things that are God's--How much is there in this profound
but to them startling addition to the maxim, and how incomparable is the
whole for fulness, brevity, clearness, weight!

and they marvelled at him--"at His answer, and held their peace" ([Luk
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#026).md), "and left Him, and went their
way" ([Mat 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#022).md).

The Resurrection ([Mar 12:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018).md).

[Mark 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 12:18</span></span>

Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
resurrection--"neither angel nor spirit" ([Act
23:7](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#007).md). They were the materialists of
the day. See on [Act 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md).

and they asked him, saying--as follows:

[Mark 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 12:19</span></span>

Master, Moses wrote unto us-- ([Deu
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005).md).

If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him . . . And the
seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.

[Mark 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 12:23</span></span>

In the resurrection therefore when they shall rise, &c.

[Mark 12:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 12:24</span></span>

Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures--regarding
the future state.

neither the power of God?--before which a thousand such difficulties
vanish.

[Mark 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">mar 12:25</span></span>

For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are
given in marriage--"neither can they die any more" ([Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036).md). Marriage is ordained to
perpetuate the human family; but as there will be no breaches by death
in the future state, this ordinance will cease.

but are as the angels which are in heaven--In Luke ([Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036).md) it is "equal unto the angels."
But as the subject is death and resurrection, we are not warranted to
extend the equality here taught beyond the one point--the immortality of
their nature. A beautiful clause is added in Luke ([Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036).md) --"and are the children of
God"--not in respect of character, which is not here spoken of, but of
nature--"being the children of the resurrection," as rising to an
undecaying existence ([Rom 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md), [Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).md), and so being the children of
their Father's immortality ([Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md).

[Mark 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 12:26</span></span>

And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book
of Moses--"even Moses" ([Luk 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037).md),
whom they had just quoted for the purpose of entangling Him.

how in the bush God spake unto him--either "at the bush," as the same
expression is rendered in [Luk 20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037.md),
that is, when he was there; or "in the \[section of his history
regarding the\] bush." The structure of our verse suggests the latter
sense, which is not unusual.

saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob?-- ([Exo 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006).md).

[Mark 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 12:27</span></span>

He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living--not "the God
of dead but \[the God\] of living persons." The word in brackets is
almost certainly an addition to the genuine text, and critical editors
exclude it. "For all live unto Him" ([Luk
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038).md) --"in His view," or "in His
estimation." This last statement--found only in Luke--though adding
nothing to the argument, is an important additional illustration. It is
true, indeed, that to God no human being is dead or ever will be, but
all mankind sustain an abiding conscious relation to Him; but the "all"
here means "those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world."
These sustain a gracious covenant relation to God which cannot be
dissolved. (Compare [Rom 6:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010).md). In
this sense our Lord affirms that for Moses to call the Lord the "GOD" of
His patriarchal servants, if at that moment they had no existence, would
be unworthy of Him. He "would be ashamed to be called their God, if He
had not prepared for them a city" ([Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md). It was concluded by some of
the early Fathers, from our Lord's resting His proof of the Resurrection
on such a passage as this, instead of quoting some much clearer
testimonies of the Old Testament, that the Sadducees, to whom this was
addressed, acknowledged the authority of no part of the Old Testament
but the Pentateuch; and this opinion has held its ground even till now.
But as there is no ground for it in the New Testament, so JOSEPHUS is
silent upon it; merely saying that they rejected the Pharisaic
traditions. It was because the Pentateuch was regarded by all classes as
the fundamental source of the Hebrew religion, and all the succeeding
books of the Old Testament but as developments of it, that our Lord
would show that even there the doctrine of the Resurrection was taught.
And all the rather does He select this passage, as being not a bare
annunciation of the doctrine in question, but as expressive of that
glorious truth out of which the Resurrection springs. "And when the
multitude heard this" (says [Mat
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023).md), "they were astonished at His
doctrine." "Then," adds [Luk 20:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#039.md),
"certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well
said"--enjoying His victory over the Sadducees. "And after that they
durst not ask Him any \[question at all\]"--neither party could; both
being for the time utterly foiled.

The Great Commandment ([Mar 12:28-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028).md).

"But when the Pharisees had heard that He had put the Sadducees to
silence, they were gathered together" ([Mat
22:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#034).md).

[Mark 12:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 12:28</span></span>

And one of the scribes--"a lawyer," says Matthew ([Mat
22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035).md); that is, teacher of the law.

came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he
had answered them well, asked him--manifestly in no bad spirit. When
Matthew ([Mat 22:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#035).md) therefore says he
came "tempting," or "trying him," as one of the Pharisaic party who
seemed to enjoy the defeat He had given to the Sadducees, we may suppose
that though somewhat priding himself upon his insight into the law, and
not indisposed to measure his knowledge with One in whom he had not yet
learned to believe, he was nevertheless an honest-hearted, fair
disputant.

Which is the first commandment of all?--first in importance; the
primary, leading commandment, the most fundamental one. This was a
question which, with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival
schools. Our Lord's answer is in a strain of respect very different from
what He showed to cavillers--ever observing His own direction, "Give not
that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend
you" ([Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).md).

[Mark 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 12:29</span></span>

And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is--The
readings here vary considerably. TISCHENDORF and TREGELLES read simply,
"the first is"; and they are followed by MEYER and ALFORD. But though
the authority for the precise form of the received text is slender, a
form almost identical with it seems to have most weight of authority.
Our Lord here gives His explicit sanction to the distinction between
commandments of a more fundamental and primary character, and
commandments of a more dependent and subordinate nature; a distinction
of which it is confidently asserted by a certain class of critics that
the Jews knew nothing, that our Lord and His apostles nowhere lay down,
and which has been invented by Christian divines. (Compare [Mat
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023).md).

Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord--This every devout Jew
recited twice every day, and the Jews do it to this day; thus keeping up
the great ancient national protest against the polytheisms and
pantheisms of the heathen world: it is the great utterance of the
national faith in One Living and Personal God--"ONE JEHOVAH!"

[Mark 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 12:30</span></span>

And thou shalt--We have here the language of law, expressive of God's
claims. What then are we here bound down to do? One word is made to
express it. And what a word! Had the essence of the divine law consisted
in deeds, it could not possibly have been expressed in a single word;
for no one deed is comprehensive of all others embraced in the law. But
as it consists in an affection of the soul, one word suffices to express
it--but only one. Fear, though due to God and enjoined by Him, is
limited in its sphere and distant in character. Trust, hope, and the
like, though essential features of a right state of heart towards God,
are called into action only by personal necessity, and so are--in a good
sense, it is true, but still are properly--selfish affections; that is
to say, they have respect to our own well-being. But LOVE is an
all-inclusive affection, embracing not only every other affection proper
to its object, but all that is proper to be done to its object; for as
love spontaneously seeks to please its object, so, in the case of men to
God, it is the native well spring of a voluntary obedience. It is,
besides, the most personal of all affections. One may fear an event, one
may hope for an event, one may rejoice in an event; but one can love
only a Person. It is the tenderest, the most unselfish, the most divine
of all affections. Such, then, is the affection in which the essence of
the divine law is declared to consist.

Thou shalt love--We now come to the glorious Object of that demanded
affection.

Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God--that is, Jehovah, the Self-Existent
One, who has revealed Himself as the "I AM," and there is none else;
who, though by His name JEHOVAH apparently at an unapproachable distance
from His finite creatures, yet bears to thee a real and definite
relationship, out of which arises His claim and thy duty--of LOVE. But
with what are we to love Him? Four things are here specified. First,
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"

with thy heart--This sometimes means "the whole inner man" (as [Pro
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#023).md); but that cannot be meant here;
for then the other three particulars would be superfluous. Very often it
means "our emotional nature"--the seat of feeling as distinguished from
our intellectual nature or the seat of thought, commonly called the
"mind" (as in [Phi 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007).md). But neither
can this be the sense of it here; for here the heart is distinguished
both from the "mind" and the "soul." The "heart," then, must here mean
the sincerity of both the thoughts and the feelings; in other words,
uprightness or true-heartedness, as opposed to a hypocritical or divided
affection. But next, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" with thy soul.
This is designed to command our emotional nature: Thou shalt put feeling
or warmth into thine affection. Further, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God"

with thy mind--This commands our intellectual nature: Thou shalt put
intelligence into thine affection--in opposition to a blind devotion, or
mere devoteeism. Lastly, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"

with thy strength--This commands our energies: Thou shalt put intensity
into thine affection--"Do it with thy might" ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010).md). Taking these four things
together, the command of the Law is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy powers--with a sincere, a fervid, an intelligent, an
energetic love." But this is not all that the Law demands. God will have
all these qualities in their most perfect exercise. "Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God," says the Law, "with all thy heart," or, with perfect
sincerity; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul," or,
with the utmost fervor; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
mind," or, in the fullest exercise of an enlightened reason; and "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy strength," or, with the whole
energy of our being! So much for the First Commandment.

[Mark 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 12:31</span></span>

And the second is like--"unto it" ([Mat
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039).md); as demanding the same
affection, and only the extension of it, in its proper measure, to the
creatures of Him whom we thus love--our brethren in the participation of
the same nature, and neighbors, as connected with us by ties that render
each dependent upon and necessary to the other.

Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself--Now, as we are not to love
ourselves supremely, this is virtually a command, in the first place,
not to love our neighbor with all our heart and soul and mind and
strength. And thus it is a condemnation of the idolatry of the creature.
Our supreme and uttermost affection is to be reserved for God. But as
sincerely as ourselves we are to love all mankind, and with the same
readiness to do and suffer for them as we should reasonably desire them
to show to us. The golden rule ([Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012).md) is here our best interpreter of
the nature and extent of these claims.

There is none other commandment greater than these--or, as in [Mat
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040.md), "On these two commandments hang
all the law and the prophets" (see on [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017).md). It is as if He had said, "This
is all Scripture in a nutshell; the whole law of human duty in a
portable, pocket form." Indeed, it is so simple that a child may
understand it, so brief that all may remember it, so comprehensive as to
embrace all possible cases. And from its very nature it is unchangeable.
It is inconceivable that God should require from his rational creatures
anything less, or in substance anything else, under any dispensation, in
any world, at any period throughout eternal duration. He cannot but
claim this--all this--alike in heaven, in earth, and in hell! And this
incomparable summary of the divine law belonged to the Jewish religion!
As it shines in its own self-evidencing splendor, so it reveals its own
true source. The religion from which the world has received it could be
none other than a God-given religion!

[Mark 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 12:32</span></span>

And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master--Teacher.

thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other
but he--The genuine text here seems clearly to have been, "There is
one," without the word "God"; and so nearly all critical editors and
expositors read.

[Mark 12:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 12:33</span></span>

And to love him with all the heart . . . and to love his neighbour as
himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices--more,
that is, than all positive institutions; thereby showing insight into
the essential difference between what is moral and in its own nature
unchangeable, and what is obligatory only because enjoined, and only so
long as enjoined.

[Mark 12:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 12:34</span></span>

And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly--rather, "intelligently,"
or "sensibly"; not only in a good spirit, but with a promising measure
of insight into spiritual things.

he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God--for he had
but to follow out a little further what he seemed sincerely to own, to
find his way into the kingdom. He needed only the experience of another
eminent scribe who at a later period said, "We know that the law is
spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin": who exclaimed, "O wretched
man that I am! Who shall deliver me?" but who added, "I thank God
through Jesus Christ!" ([Rom 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md),
[Rom 7:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024).md). Perhaps among the
"great company of the priests" and other Jewish ecclesiastics who "were
obedient to the faith," almost immediately after the day of Pentecost
([Act 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007).md), this upright lawyer was
one. But for all his nearness to the Kingdom of God, it may be he never
entered it.

And no man after that durst ask any question--all feeling that they were
no match for Him, and that it was vain to enter the lists with Him.

Christ Baffles the Pharisees Regarding David ([Mar
12:35-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035).md).

[Mark 12:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 12:35</span></span>

And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple--and "while
the Pharisees were gathered together" ([Mat
22:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#041).md).

How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?--How come they to
give it out that Messiah is to be the son of David? In Matthew ([Mat
22:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042).md), Jesus asks them, "What think
ye of Christ?" or of the promised and expected Messiah? "Whose son is He
\[to be\]? They say unto Him, The son of David." The sense is the same.
"He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord?" ([Mat
22:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#042).md).

[Mark 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 12:36</span></span>

For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit
thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool-- ([Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md).

[Mark 12:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 12:37</span></span>

David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his
son?--There is but one solution of this difficulty. Messiah is at once
inferior to David as his son according to the flesh, and superior to him
as the Lord of a kingdom of which David is himself a subject, not the
sovereign. The human and divine natures of Christ, and the spirituality
of His kingdom--of which the highest earthly sovereigns are honored if
they be counted worthy to be its subjects--furnish the only key to this
puzzle.

And the common people--the immense crowd.

heard him gladly--"And no man was able to answer Him a word; neither
durst any man from that day forth ask Him any more questions" ([Mat
22:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#046).md).

The Scribes Denounced ([Mar 12:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038).md).

[Mark 12:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 12:38</span></span>

And he said unto them in his doctrine--rather, "in His teaching";
implying that this was but a specimen of an extended discourse, which
Matthew gives in full (Mat. 23:1-39). Luke says ([Luk
20:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#045).md) this was "in the audience of
all the people said unto His disciples."

Beware of the scribes, which love--or like.

to go in long clothing--(see on [Mat
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#005).md).

and love salutations in the market-places,

[Mark 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 12:39</span></span>

And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms--or
positions.

at feasts--On this love of distinction, see on [Luk
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#007.md); [Mat
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md).

[Mark 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 12:40</span></span>

Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these
shall receive greater damnation--They took advantage of their helpless
condition and confiding character to obtain possession of their
property, while by their "long prayers" they made them believe they were
raised far above "filthy lucre." So much the "greater damnation" awaited
them. (Compare [Mat 23:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#033).md). A lifelike
description this of the Romish clergy, the true successors of "the
scribes."
