### [1 Chronicles Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 8:1</span></span>

SONS AND CHIEF MEN OF BENJAMIN. (1Ch. 8:1-32)

Now Benjamin begat, &c.--This chapter contains some supplementary
particulars in addition to what has been already said regarding the
tribe of Benjamin (see on [Ch1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006).md).
The names of many of the persons mentioned are different from those
given by Moses--a diversity which may be accounted for in part on
grounds formerly stated, namely, either that the persons had more than
one name, or that the word "sons" is used in a loose sense for grandsons
or descendants. But there are other circumstances to be taken into
account in considering the details of this chapter; namely, first, that
the genealogies of the Benjamites were disordered or destroyed by the
almost total extermination of this tribe (Jdg. 20:11-48); secondly, that
a great number of Benjamites, born in Assyria, are mentioned here, who
returned from the long captivity in Babylon, and established
themselves--some in Jerusalem, others in different parts of Judea. There
were more returned from Babylon of the families belonging to this tribe
than to any other except Judah; and hence many strange names are here
introduced; some of which will be found in the list of the restored
exiles (compare Ezra 2:1-70).

[1 Chronicles 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 8:6</span></span>

these are the sons of Ehud--most probably the judge of Israel ([Jdg
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#015).md). His descendants, who had at
first been established in Geba in Benjamin, emigrated in a body under
the direction of Gera ([Ch1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#007).md) to
Manahath, where their increased numbers would find more ample
accommodation. Manahath was within the territory of Judah.

[1 Chronicles 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch1 8:8</span></span>

Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab--He had probably been
driven to take refuge in that foreign land on the same calamitous
occasion that forced Elimelech to emigrate thither ([Rut
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#001).md). But, destitute of natural
affection, he forsook or divorced his two wives, and in the land of his
sojourn married a third, by whom he had several sons. But there is
another explanation given of the conduct of this Benjamite polygamist.
His children by Hushim are mentioned ([Ch1
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#011).md), while his other wife is
unnoticed. Hence it has been thought probable that it is Baara who is
mentioned under the name of Hodesh, so called because her husband, after
long desertion, returned and cohabited with her as before.

[1 Chronicles 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">ch1 8:28</span></span>

These dwelt in Jerusalem--The ordinary and stated inhabitants of
Jerusalem were Judahites, Benjamites, and Levites. But at the time
referred to here, the chiefs or heads of the principal families who are
enumerated ([Ch1 8:14-27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#014).md) established
themselves in the city after their return from the captivity.

[1 Chronicles 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch1 8:33</span></span>

STOCK OF SAUL AND JONATHAN. ([Ch1
8:33-40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#033).md)

Ner begat Kish--The father of Ner, though not mentioned here, is stated
([Ch1 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#035).md) to have been Jehiel.
Moreover, the father of Kish is said ([Sa1
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#001).md) to have been Abiel, the son of
Zeror, whence it would seem that Abiel and Ner were names of the same
person.

Abinadab--the same as Ishui ([Sa1
14:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#049).md).

Esh-baal--that is, Ish-bosheth.

[1 Chronicles 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">ch1 8:34</span></span>

Merib-baal--that is, Mephibosheth.

[1 Chronicles 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">ch1 8:36</span></span>

Jehoadah--or, Jara ([Ch1 9:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#042).md).

[1 Chronicles 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">ch1 8:40</span></span>

mighty men of valour, archers--(see on [Jdg
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#016).md). Great strength as well as
skill was requisite in ancient archery, as the bow, which was of steel,
was bent by treading with the feet, and pulling the string with both
hands.
