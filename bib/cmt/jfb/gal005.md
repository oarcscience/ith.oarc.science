### [Galatians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md)

[Galatians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 5:1</span></span>

PERORATION. EXHORTATION TO STAND FAST IN THE GOSPEL LIBERTY, JUST SET
FORTH, AND NOT TO BE LED BY JUDAIZERS INTO CIRCUMCISION, OR LAW
JUSTIFICATION: YET THOUGH FREE, TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER BY LOVE: TO WALK IN
THE SPIRIT, BEARING THE FRUIT THEREOF, NOT IN THE WORKS OF THE FLESH.
(Gal. 5:1-26)

The oldest manuscripts read, "in liberty (so ALFORD, MOBERLEY, HUMPHRY,
and ELLICOTT. But as there is no Greek for 'in,' as there is in
translating in [Co1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013.md); [Phi
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027.md); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md), I prefer 'It is FOR freedom
that') Christ hath made us free (not in, or for, a state of bondage).
Stand fast, therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage"
(namely, the law, [Gal 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md); [Act
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010).md). On "again," see on [Gal
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md).

[Galatians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 5:2</span></span>

Behold--that is, Mark what I say.

I Paul--Though you now think less of my authority, I nevertheless give
my name and personal authority as enough by itself to refute all
opposition of adversaries.

if ye be circumcised--not as ALFORD, "If you will go on being
circumcised." Rather, "If ye suffer yourselves to be circumcised,"
namely, under the notion of its being necessary to justification ([Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md); [Act
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001).md). Circumcision here is not
regarded simply by itself (for, viewed as a mere national rite, it was
practiced for conciliation's sake by Paul himself, [Act
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003).md), but as the symbol of Judaism
and legalism in general. If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace
is at an end. If the latter be the way of justification, then Judaism is
in no way so.

Christ . . . profit . . . nothing-- ([Gal
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#021).md). For righteousness of works and
justification by faith cannot co-exist. "He who is circumcised \[for
justification\] is so as fearing the law, and he who fears, disbelieves
the power of grace, and he who disbelieves can profit nothing by that
grace which he disbelieves \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Galatians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 5:3</span></span>

For--Greek, "Yea, more"; "Moreover."

I testify . . . to every man--as well as "unto you" ([Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002).md).

that is circumcised--that submits to be circumcised. Such a one became a
"proselyte of righteousness."

the whole law--impossible for man to keep even in part, much less wholly
([Jam 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010).md); yet none can be justified
by the law, unless he keep it wholly ([Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).md).

[Galatians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 5:4</span></span>

Literally, "Ye have become void from Christ," that is, your connection
with Christ has become void ([Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002).md). [Rom
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md), "Loosed from the law," where the
same Greek occurs as here.

whosoever of you are justified--"are being justified," that is, are
endeavoring to be justified.

by the law--Greek, "IN the law," as the element in which justification
is to take place.

fallen from grace--Ye no longer "stand" in grace ([Rom
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002).md). Grace and legal righteousness
cannot co-exist ([Rom 4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md); [Rom
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006).md). Christ, by circumcision ([Luk
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#021).md), undertook to obey all the law,
and fulfil all righteousness for us: any, therefore, that now seeks to
fulfil the law for himself in any degree for justifying righteousness,
severs himself from the grace which flows from Christ's fulfilment of
it, and becomes "a debtor to do the whole law" ([Gal
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#003).md). The decree of the Jerusalem
council had said nothing so strong as this; it had merely decided that
Gentile Christians were not bound to legal observances. But the
Galatians, while not pretending to be so bound, imagined there was an
efficacy in them to merit a higher degree of perfection ([Gal
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003).md). This accounts for Paul not
referring to the decree at all. He took much higher ground. See PALEY'S
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;. The natural mind loves outward fetters, and
is apt to forge them for itself, to stand in lieu of holiness of heart.

[Galatians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 5:5</span></span>

For--proof of the assertion, "fallen from grace," by contrasting with
the case of legalists, the "hope" of Christians.

through the Spirit--Greek, rather, "by the Spirit": in opposition to by
the flesh ([Gal 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029).md), or fleshly ways
of justification, as circumcision and legal ordinances. "We" is
emphatical, and contrasted with "whosoever of you would be justified by
the law" ([Gal 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004).md).

the hope of righteousness--"We wait for the (realization of the) hope
(which is the fruit) of the righteousness (that is, justification which
comes) by (literally, 'from--out of') faith," [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001.md), [Rom
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004.md); [Rom
8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md), "Hope . . . we with patience
wait for it." This is a farther step than being "justified"; not only
are we this, but "wait for the hope" which is connected with it, and is
its full consummation. "Righteousness," in the sense of justification,
is by the believer once for all already attained: but the consummation
of it in future perfection above is the object of hope to be waited for:
"the crown of righteousness laid up" ([Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md): "the hope laid up for you in
heaven" ([Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md); [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md).

[Galatians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 5:6</span></span>

For--confirming the truth that it is "by faith" ([Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005).md).

in Jesus Christ--Greek, "in Christ Jesus." In union with Christ (the
ANOINTED Saviour), that is, Jesus of Nazareth.

nor uncircumcision--This is levelled against those who, being not
legalists, or Judaizers, think themselves Christians on this ground
alone.

faith which worketh by love--Greek, "working by love." This corresponds
to "a new creature" ([Gal 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015).md), as
its definition. Thus in [Gal 5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005.md), we
have the three, "faith," "hope," and "love." The Greek expresses, "Which
effectually worketh"; which exhibits its energy by love (so [Th1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013).md). Love is not joined with faith
in justifying, but is the principle of the works which follow after
justification by faith. Let not legalists, upholding circumcision, think
that the essence of the law is set at naught by the doctrine of
justification by faith only. Nay, "all the law is fulfilled in one
word--love," which is the principle on which "faith worketh" ([Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014).md). Let them, therefore, seek this
"faith," which will enable them truly to fulfil the law. Again, let not
those who pride themselves on uncircumcision think that, because the law
does not justify, they are free to walk after "the flesh" ([Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013).md). Let them, then, seek that
"love" which is inseparable from true faith ([Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md), [Jam
2:12-22](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012).md). Love is utterly opposed to
the enmities which prevailed among the Galatians ([Gal
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015.md), [Gal
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020).md). The Spirit ([Gal
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#005).md) is a Spirit of "faith" and "love"
(compare [Rom 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md); [Co1
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019).md).

[Galatians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 5:7</span></span>

Translate, "Ye were running well" in the Gospel race ([Co1
9:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024.md); [Phi
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013).md).

who, &c.--none whom you ought to have listened to \[BENGEL\]: alluding
to the Judaizers (compare [Gal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001).md).

hinder--The Greek means, literally, "hinder by breaking up a road."

not obey the truth--not submit yourselves to the true Gospel way of
justification.

[Galatians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 5:8</span></span>

This persuasion--Greek, "The persuasion," namely, to which you are
yielding. There is a play on words in the original, the Greek for
persuasion being akin to "obey" ([Gal
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007).md). This persuasion which ye have
obeyed.

cometh not of--that is "from." Does not emanate from Him, but from an
enemy.

that calleth you-- ([Gal 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md); [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006.md); [Phi
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024).md). The calling is the rule of the
whole race \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 5:9</span></span>

A little leaven--the false teaching of the Judaizers. A small portion of
legalism, if it be mixed with the Gospel, corrupts its purity. To add
legal ordinances and works in the least degree to justification by
faith, is to undermine "the whole." So "leaven" is used of false
doctrine ([Mat 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#012.md) : compare [Mat
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033).md). In [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006.md) it means the corrupting influence
of one bad person; so BENGEL understands it here to refer to the person
([Gal 5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#007.md), [Gal
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010).md) who misled them. [Ecc
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md), "One sinner destroyeth much
good" ([Co1 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033).md). I prefer to refer
it to false doctrine, answering to "persuasion" ([Gal
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#008).md).

[Galatians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 5:10</span></span>

Greek, "I (emphatical: 'I on my part') have confidence in the Lord with
regard to you ([Th2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#004).md), that ye will
be none otherwise minded" (than what by this Epistle I desire you to be,
[Phi 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015).md).

but he that troubleth you-- ([Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007.md);
[Act 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024.md); [Jos
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#025.md); [Kg1
18:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#017).md). Some one, probably, was
prominent among the seducers, though the denunciation applies to them
all ([Gal 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007.md); [Gal
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#017).md).

shall bear--as a heavy burden.

his--his due and inevitable judgment from God. Paul distinguishes the
case of the seduced, who were misled through thoughtlessness, and who,
now that they are set right by him, he confidently hopes, in God's
goodness, will return to the right way, from that of the seducer who is
doomed to judgment.

whosoever he be--whether great ([Gal
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008).md) or small.

[Galatians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 5:11</span></span>

Translate, "If I am still preaching (as I did before conversion)
circumcision, why am I still persecuted?" The Judaizing troubler of the
Galatians had said, "Paul himself preaches circumcision," as is shown by
his having circumcised Timothy ([Act
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md); compare also [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md); [Act
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024).md). Paul replies by anticipation
of their objection, As regards myself, the fact that I am still
persecuted by the Jews shows plainly that I do not preach circumcision;
for it is just because I preach Christ crucified, and not the Mosaic
law, as the sole ground of justification, that they persecute me. If for
conciliation he lived as a Jew among the Jews, it was in accordance with
his principle enunciated ([Co1 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018.md),
[Co1 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#020.md); [Co1
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020).md). Circumcision, or
uncircumcision, are things indifferent in themselves: their lawfulness
or unlawfulness depends on the animus of him who uses them. The Gentile
Galatians' animus in circumcision could only be their supposition that
it influenced favorably their standing before God. Paul's living as a
Gentile among Gentiles, plainly showed that, if he lived as a Jew among
Jews, it was not that he thought it meritorious before God, but as a
matter indifferent, wherein he might lawfully conform as a Jew by birth
to those with whom he was, in order to put no needless stumbling-block
to the Gospel in the way of his countrymen.

then--Presuming that I did so, "then," in that case, "the offense of
(stumbling-block, [Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md) occasioned
to the Jews by) the cross has become done away." Thus the Jews'
accusation against Stephen was not that he preached Christ crucified,
but that "he spake blasphemous words against this holy place and the
law." They would, in some measure, have borne the former, if he had
mixed with it justification in part by circumcision and the law, and if
he had, through the medium of Christianity, brought converts to Judaism.
But if justification in any degree depended on legal ordinances,
Christ's crucifixion in that degree was unnecessary, and could profit
nothing ([Gal 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002.md), [Gal
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004).md). Worldly Wiseman, of the town of
Carnal Policy, turns Christian out of the narrow way of the Cross, to
the house of Legality. But the way to it was up a mountain, which, as
Christian advanced, threatened to fall on him and crush him, amidst
flashes of lightning from the mountain \[BUNYAN, Pilgrim's Progress\]
([Heb 12:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018).md).

[Galatians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 5:12</span></span>

they . . . which trouble you--Translate, as the Greek is different from
[Gal 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010.md), "they who are unsettling
you."

were even cut off--even as they desire your foreskin to be cut off and
cast away by circumcision, so would that they were even cut off from
your communion, being worthless as a castaway foreskin ([Gal
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#007.md); compare [Phi
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002).md). The fathers, JEROME, AMBROSE,
AUGUSTINE, and CHRYSOSTOM, explain it, "Would that they would even cut
themselves off," that is, cut off not merely the foreskin, but the whole
member: if circumcision be not enough for them, then let them have
excision also; an outburst hardly suitable to the gravity of an apostle.
But [Gal 5:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#009.md) plainly point to
excommunication as the judgment threatened against the troublers: and
danger of the bad "leaven" spreading, as the reason for it.

[Galatians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 5:13</span></span>

The "ye" is emphatical, from its position in the Greek, "Ye brethren";
as opposed to those legalists "who trouble you."

unto liberty--The Greek expresses, "on a footing of liberty." The state
or condition in which ye have been called to salvation, is one of
liberty. Gospel liberty consists in three things, freedom from the
Mosaic yoke, from sin, and from slavish fear.

only, &c.--Translate, "Only turn not your liberty into an occasion for
the flesh." Do not give the flesh the handle or pretext ([Rom
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008), "occasion".md) for its indulgence
which it eagerly seeks for; do not let it make Christian "liberty" its
pretext for indulgence ([Gal 5:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md);
[Pe1 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md); [Pe2
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).md).

but by love serve one another--Greek, "Be servants (be in bondage) to
one another." If ye must be servants, then be servants to one another in
love. While free as to legalism, be bound by Love (the article in the
Greek personifies love in the abstract) to serve one another ([Co1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019).md). Here he hints at their unloving
strifes springing out of lust of power. "For the lust of power is the
mother of heresies" \[CHRYSOSTOM\].

[Galatians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 5:14</span></span>

all the law--Greek, "the whole law," namely, the Mosaic law. Love to God
is presupposed as the root from which love to our neighbor springs; and
it is in this tense the latter precept (so "word" means here) is said to
be the fulfilling of "all the law" ([Lev
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018).md). Love is "the law of Christ"
([Gal 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md); [Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012.md); [Mat
22:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md); [Rom
13:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009).md).

is fulfilled--Not as received text "is being fulfilled," but as the
oldest manuscripts read, "has been fulfilled"; and so "receives its full
perfection," as rudimentary teachings are fulfilled by the more perfect
doctrine. The law only united Israelites together: the Gospel unites all
men, and that in relation to God \[GROTIUS\].

[Galatians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 5:15</span></span>

bite--backbite the character.

devour--the substance by injuring, extortion, &c. ([Hab
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#013.md); [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014.md); [Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020).md).

consumed, &c.--Strength of soul, health of body, character, and
resources, are all consumed by broils \[BENGEL\].

[Galatians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 5:16</span></span>

This I say then--Repeating in other words, and explaining the sentiment
in [Gal 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md), What I mean is this."

Walk in the Spirit--Greek, "By (the rule of) the (Holy) Spirit." Compare
[Gal 5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md), [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md), [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md); [Gal
6:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md), with [Rom
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022.md); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011.md). The best way to keep tares out
of a bushel is to fill it with wheat.

the flesh--the natural man, out of which flow the evils specified ([Gal
5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019).md). The spirit and the flesh
mutually exclude one another. It is promised, not that we should have no
evil lusts, but that we should "not fulfil" them. If the spirit that is
in us can be at ease under sin, it is not a spirit that comes from the
Holy Spirit. The gentle dove trembles at the sight even of a hawk's
feather.

[Galatians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 5:17</span></span>

For--the reason why walking by the Spirit will exclude fulfilling the
lusts of the flesh, namely, their mutual contrariety.

the Spirit--not "lusteth," but "tendeth (or some such word is to be
supplied) against the flesh."

so that ye cannot do the things that ye would--The Spirit strives
against the flesh and its evil influence; the flesh against the Spirit
and His good influence, so that neither the one nor the other can be
fully carried out into action. "But" ([Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018).md) where "the Spirit" prevails, the
issue of the struggle no longer continues doubtful ([Rom
7:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015).md) \[BENGEL\]. The Greek is,
"that ye may not do the things that ye would." "The flesh and Spirit are
contrary one to the other," so that you must distinguish what proceeds
from the Spirit, and what from the flesh; and you must not fulfil what
you desire according to the carnal self, but what the Spirit within you
desires \[NEANDER\]. But the antithesis of [Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018) ("But," &c..md), where the conflict
is decided, shows, I think, that here [Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md) contemplates the inability both
for fully accomplishing the good we "would," owing to the opposition of
the flesh, and for doing the evil our flesh would desire, owing to the
opposition of the Spirit in the awakened man (such as the Galatians are
assumed to be), until we yield ourselves wholly by the Spirit to "walk
by the Spirit" ([Gal 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md), [Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018).md).

[Galatians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 5:18</span></span>

"If ye are led (give yourselves up to be led) by (Greek) the Spirit, ye
are not under the law." For ye are not working the works of the flesh
([Gal 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md), [Gal
5:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019).md) which bring one "under the
law" ([Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md), [Rom
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014).md). The "Spirit makes free from the
law of sin and death" ([Gal 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023).md). The
law is made for a fleshly man, and for the works of the flesh ([Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md), "not for a righteous man" ([Rom
6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014).md).

[Galatians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gal 5:19</span></span>

Confirming [Gal 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md), by showing the
contrariety between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit.

manifest--The hidden fleshly principle betrays itself palpably by its
works, so that these are not hard to discover, and leave no doubt that
they come not from the Spirit.

which are these--Greek, "such as," for instance.

Adultery--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

lasciviousness--rather, "wantonness" petulance, capricious insolence; it
may display itself in "lasciviousness," but not necessarily or
constantly so ([Mar 7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021.md), where it
is not associated with fleshly lusts) \[TRENCH\]. "Works" (in the
plural) are attributed to the "flesh," because they are divided, and
often at variance with one another, and even when taken each one by
itself, betray their fleshly origin. But the "fruit of the Spirit" ([Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023).md) is singular, because, however
manifold the results, they form one harmonious whole. The results of the
flesh are not dignified by the name "fruit"; they are but works ([Eph
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009.md), [Eph
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011).md). He enumerates those fleshly
"works" (committed against our neighbor, against God, and against
ourselves) to which the Galatians were most prone (the Celts have always
been prone to disputations and internal strifes): and those
manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit most needed by them ([Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013.md), [Gal
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#015).md). This passage shows that "the
flesh" does not mean merely sensuality, as opposed to spirituality: for
"divisions" in the catalogue here do not flow from sensuality. The
identification of "the natural (Greek, 'animal-souled') man," with the
"carnal" or fleshly man ([Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).md),
shows that "the flesh" expresses human nature as estranged from God.
TRENCH observes, as a proof of our fallen state, how much richer is
every vocabulary in words for sins, than in those for graces. Paul
enumerates seventeen "works of the flesh," only nine manifestations of
"the fruit of the Spirit" (compare [Eph
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#031).md).

[Galatians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gal 5:20</span></span>

witchcraft--sorcery; prevalent in Asia ([Act
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019); compare Rev. 21.md).

hatred--Greek, "hatreds."

variance--Greek, "strife"; singular in the oldest manuscripts.

emulations--in the oldest manuscripts, singular--"emulation," or rather,
"jealousy"; for the sake of one's own advantage. "Envyings" ([Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021).md) are even without advantage to
the person himself \[BENGEL\].

wrath--Greek, plural, "passionate outbreaks" \[ALFORD\].

strife--rather as Greek, "factions," "cabals"; derived from a Greek
root, meaning "a worker for hire": hence, unworthy means for compassing
ends, factious practices.

seditions--"dissensions," as to secular matters.

heresies--as to sacred things (see on [Co1
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019).md). Self-constituted parties; from
a Greek root, to choose. A schism is a more recent split in a
congregation from a difference of opinion. Heresy is a schism become
inveterate \[AUGUSTINE, Con. Crescon. Don., 2,7\].

[Galatians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gal 5:21</span></span>

tell . . . before--namely, before the event.

I . . . told you in time past--when I was with you.

you--who, though maintaining justification by the law, are careless
about keeping the law ([Rom 2:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021).md).

not inherit . . . kingdom of God-- ([Co1
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md); [Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005).md).

[Galatians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gal 5:22</span></span>

love--the leader of the band of graces ([Co1
13:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001).md).

gentleness--Greek, "benignity," conciliatory to others; whereas
"goodness," though ready to do good, has not such suavity of manner
\[JEROME\]. ALFORD translates, "kindness."

faith--"faithfulness"; opposed to "heresies" \[BENGEL\]. ALFORD refers
to [Co1 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007.md), "Believeth all things":
faith in the widest sense, toward God and man. "Trustfulness"
\[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[Galatians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gal 5:23</span></span>

temperance--The Greek root implies self-restraint as to one's desires
and lusts.

against such--not persons, but things, as in [Gal
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#021.md).

no law--confirming [Gal 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md), "Not
under the law" ([Ti1 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md). The law
itself commands love ([Gal 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014).md); so
far is it from being "against such."

[Galatians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gal 5:24</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read, "They that are of Christ Jesus"; they that
belong to Christ Jesus; being "led by (His) Spirit" ([Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018).md).

have crucified the flesh--They nailed it to the cross once for all when
they became Christ's, on believing and being baptized ([Rom
6:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003).md): they keep it now in a state of
crucifixion ([Rom 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006).md): so that the
Spirit can produce in them, comparatively uninterrupted by it, "the
fruit of the Spirit" ([Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022).md).
"Man, by faith, is dead to the former standing point of a sinful life,
and rises to a new life ([Gal 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025).md) of
communion with Christ ([Col 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003).md). The
act by which they have crucified the flesh with its lust, is already
accomplished ideally in principle. But the practice, or outward
conformation of the life, must harmonize with the tendency given to the
inward life" ([Gal 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025).md) \[NEANDER\].
We are to be executioners, dealing cruelly with the body of sin, which
has caused the acting of all cruelties on Christ's body.

with the affections--Translate, "with its passions." Thus they are dead
to the law's condemning power, which is only for the fleshly, and their
lusts ([Gal 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023).md).

[Galatians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">gal 5:25</span></span>

in . . . in--rather, as Greek, "If we live (see on [Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024).md) BY the Spirit, let us also walk
([Gal 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#016.md); [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016).md) BY the Spirit." Let our life in
practice correspond to the ideal inner principle of our spiritual life,
namely, our standing by faith as dead to, and severed from, sin, and the
condemnation of the law. "Life by (or 'in') the Spirit" is not an
occasional influence of the Spirit, but an abiding state, wherein we are
continually alive, though sometimes sleeping and inactive.

[Galatians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gal 5:26</span></span>

Greek, "Let us not BECOME." While not asserting that the Galatians are
"vainglorious" now, he says they are liable to become so.

provoking one another--an effect of "vaingloriousness" on the stronger:
as "envying" is its effect on the weaker. A danger common both to the
orthodox and Judaizing Galatians.
