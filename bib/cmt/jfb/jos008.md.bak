### [Joshua Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 8:1</span></span>

GOD ENCOURAGES JOSHUA. (Jos. 8:1-28)

The Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not--By the execution of justice on
Achan, the divine wrath was averted, the Israelites were reassured,
defeat was succeeded by victory; and thus the case of Ai affords a
striking example of God's disciplinary government, in which
chastisements for sin are often made to pave the way for the bestowment
of those temporal benefits, which, on account of sin, have been
withdrawn, or withheld for a time. Joshua, who had been greatly
dispirited, was encouraged by a special communication promising him (see
[Jos 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#006.md); [Deu
31:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006).md) success in the next attempt,
which, however, was to be conducted on different principles.

take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai--The number
of fighting men amounted to six hundred thousand, and the whole force
was ordered on this occasion, partly because the spies, in their
self-confidence, had said that a few were sufficient to attack the place
([Jos 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#003).md), partly to dispel any
misgivings which the memory of the late disaster might have created, and
partly that the circumstance of the first spoil obtained in Canaan being
shared among all, might operate both as a reward for obedience in
refraining from the booty of Jericho, and as an incentive to future
exertions ([Deu 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#010).md). The rest of the
people, including the women and children, remained in the camp at
Gilgal. Being in the plains of Jericho, it was an ascent to Ai, which
was on a hill.

I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,
and his land . . . lay thee an ambush for the city--God assured Joshua
of Ai's capture, but allowed him to follow his own tactics in obtaining
the possession.

[Joshua 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 8:3</span></span>

So Joshua . . . chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour--Joshua
despatched thirty thousand men under cover of night, to station
themselves at the place appointed for the ambuscade. Out of this number
a detachment of five thousand was sent forward to conceal themselves in
the immediate precincts of the town, in order to seize the first
opportunity of throwing themselves into it \[[Jos
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#012.md)\].

[Joshua 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 8:4</span></span>

behind the city--is rendered ([Jos
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009).md), "on the west side of Ai."

[Joshua 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jos 8:9</span></span>

between Beth-el and Ai--Beth-el, though lying quite near in the
direction of west by north, cannot be seen from Tell-el-hajar; two rocky
heights rise between both places, in the wady El-Murogede, just as the
laying of an ambush to the west of Ai would require \[VAN DE VELDE;
ROBINSON\].

[Joshua 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jos 8:10</span></span>

Joshua . . . numbered the people--that is, the detachment of
liers-in-wait; he did this, to be furnished with clear evidence
afterwards, that the work had been done without any loss of men, whereby
the people's confidence in God would be strengthened and encouragement
given them to prosecute the war of invasion with vigor.

he and the elders of Israel--the chief magistrates and rulers, whose
presence and official authority were necessary to ensure that the cattle
and spoil of the city might be equally divided between the combatants
and the rest of the people ([Num
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#027).md) --a military rule in Israel,
that would have been very liable to be infringed, if an excited
soldiery, eager for booty, had been left to their own will.

[Joshua 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jos 8:11</span></span>

there was a valley between them and Ai--literally, "the valley."

[Joshua 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 8:13</span></span>

Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley--The deep and
steep-sided glen to the north of Tell-el-hajar, into which one looks
down from the tell, fully agrees with this account \[VAN DE VELDE\].
Joshua himself took up his position on the north side of "the
ravine"--the deep chasm of the wady El-Murogede; "that night"--means,
while it was dark, probably after midnight, or very early in the morning
([Joh 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001).md). The king of Ai, in the
early dawn, rouses his slumbering subjects and makes a hasty sally with
all his people who were capable of bearing arms, once more to surprise
and annihilate them.

[Joshua 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 8:14</span></span>

at a time appointed--either an hour concocted between the king and
people of Ai and those of Beth-el, who were confederates in this
enterprise, or perhaps they had fixed on the same time of day, as they
had fought successfully against Israel on the former occasion, deeming
it a lucky hour ([Jdg 20:38](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#038).md).

but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
city--It is evident that this king and his subjects were little
experienced in war; otherwise they would have sent out scouts to
reconnoitre the neighborhood; at all events, they would not have left
their town wholly unprotected and open. Perhaps an ambuscade may have
been a war stratagem hitherto unknown in that country, and among that
people.

[Joshua 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 8:15</span></span>

Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them--the
pretended flight in the direction of the wilderness; that is, southeast,
into the Ghor, the desert valley of the Jordan, decoyed all the
inhabitants of Ai out of the city, while the people of Beth-el hastened
to participate in the expected victory. It is supposed by some, from
"the city," and not "cities," being spoken of, that the effective force
of Beth-el had been concentrated in Ai, as the two places were closely
contiguous, and Ai the larger of the two. (See [Jos
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#009).md). It may be remarked, however,
that the words, "or Beth-el," are not in the Septuagint, and are
rejected by some eminent scholars, as an interpolation not found in the
most ancient manuscripts.

[Joshua 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 8:18</span></span>

Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the
city--The uplifted spear had probably a flag, or streamer on it, to
render it the more conspicuous from the height where he stood. At the
sight of this understood signal the ambush nearest the city, informed by
their scouts, made a sudden rush and took possession of the city,
telegraphing to their brethren by raising a smoke from the walls. Upon
seeing this, the main body, who had been reigning a flight, turned round
at the head of the pass upon their pursuers, while the twenty-five
thousand issuing from their ambuscade, fell back upon their rear. The
Ai-ites surprised, looked back, and found their situation now desperate.

[Joshua 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jos 8:23</span></span>

the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua--to be
reserved for a more ignominious death, as a greater criminal in God's
sight than his subjects. In the mingled attack from before and behind,
all the men were massacred.

[Joshua 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jos 8:24</span></span>

all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
sword--the women, children, and old persons left behind, amounting, in
all, to twelve thousand people \[[Jos
8:25](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#025.md)\].

[Joshua 8:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 8:26</span></span>

Joshua drew not his hand back--Perhaps, from the long continuance of the
posture, it might have been a means appointed by God, to animate the
people, and kept up in the same devout spirit as Moses had shown, in
lifting up his hands, until the work of slaughter had been
completed--the ban executed. (See on [Exo
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#010).md).

[Joshua 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jos 8:28</span></span>

Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever--"For ever" often
signifies "a long time" ([Gen 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003).md).
One of the remarkable things with regard to the tell we have identified
with Ai is its name--the tell of the heap of stones--a name which to
this day remains \[VAN DE VELDE\].

[Joshua 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 8:29</span></span>

THE KING HANGED. ([Jos 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#029).md)

The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide--that is, gibbeted. In
ancient, and particularly Oriental wars, the chiefs, when taken
prisoners, were usually executed. The Israelites were obliged, by the
divine law, to put them to death. The execution of the king of Ai would
tend to facilitate the conquest of the land, by striking terror into the
other chiefs, and making it appear a judicial process, in which they
were inflicting the vengeance of God upon His enemies.

take his carcass down . . . and raise thereon a great heap of stones--It
was taken down at sunset, according to the divine command ([Deu
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023).md), and cast into a pit dug "at
the entering of the gate," because that was the most public place. An
immense cairn was raised over his grave--an ancient usage, still
existing in the East, whereby is marked the sepulchre of persons whose
memory is infamous.

[Joshua 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jos 8:30</span></span>

JOSHUA BUILDS AN ALTAR. ([Jos 8:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030).md)

Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount
Ebal--(See on [Deu 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#011).md). This spot
was little short of twenty miles from Ai. The march through a hostile
country and the unmolested performance of the religious ceremonial
observed at this mountain, would be greatly facilitated, through the
blessing of God, by the disastrous fall of Ai. The solemn duty was to be
attended to at the first convenient opportunity after the entrance into
Canaan ([Deu 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002).md); and with this in
view Joshua seems to have conducted the people through the mountainous
region that intervened though no details of the journey have been
recorded. Ebal was on the north, opposite to Gerizim, which was on the
south side of the town Sichem (Nablous).

[Joshua 8:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 8:31</span></span>

an altar of whole stones--according to the instructions given to Moses
([Exo 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025.md); [Deu
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#005).md).

over which no man hath lifted up any iron--that is, iron tool. The
reason for this was that every altar of the true God ought properly to
have been built of earth ([Exo 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024).md);
and if it was constructed of stone, rough, unhewn stones were to be
employed that it might retain both the appearance and nature of earth,
since every bloody sacrifice was connected with sin and death, by which
man, the creature of earth, is brought to earth again \[KEIL\].

they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace
offerings--This had been done when the covenant was established ([Exo
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#005).md); and by the observance of these
rites ([Deu 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#006).md), the covenant was
solemnly renewed--the people were reconciled to God by the burnt
offering, and this feast accompanying the peace or thank offering, a
happy communion with God was enjoyed by all the families in Israel.

[Joshua 8:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 8:32</span></span>

he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses--(See on [Deu
27:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#002.md), [Deu
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#005).md); that is, the blessings and
curses of the law. Some think that the stones which contained this
inscription were the stones of the altar: but this verse seems rather to
indicate that a number of stone pillars were erected alongside of the
altar, and on which, after they were plastered, this duplicate of the
law was inscribed.

[Joshua 8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 8:33</span></span>

all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on
this side the ark and on that side--One half of Israel was arranged on
Gerizim, and the other half on Ebal--along the sides and base of each.

before the priests the Levites--in full view of them.

[Joshua 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jos 8:34</span></span>

afterward he read all the words of the law--caused the priests or
Levites to read it ([Deu 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#014).md).
Persons are often said in Scripture to do that which they only command
to be done.

[Joshua 8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jos 8:35</span></span>

There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read
not--It appears that a much larger portion of the law was read on this
occasion than the brief summary inscribed on the stones; and this must
have been the essence of the law as contained in Deuteronomy ([Deu
4:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#044.md); [Deu
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#009.md); [Deu
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#008).md). It was not written on the
stones, but on the plaster. The immediate design of this rehearsal was
attained by the performance of the act itself. It only related to
posterity, in so far as the record of the event would be handed down in
the Book of Joshua, or the documents which form the groundwork of it
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. Thus faithfully did Joshua execute the instructions
given by Moses. How awfully solemn must have been the assemblage and the
occasion! The eye and the ear of the people being both addressed, it was
calculated to leave an indelible impression; and with spirits elevated
by their brilliant victories in the land of promise, memory would often
revert to the striking scene on mounts Ebal and Gerizim, and in the vale
of Sychar.
