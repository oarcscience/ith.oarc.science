### [Zechariah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 2:1</span></span>

THIRD VISION. The man with the measuring-line. ([Zac
2:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001).md)

man with a measuring-line--the same image to represent the same future
fact as in [Eze 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#003.md); 41, 42. The
"man" is Messiah (see on [Zac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008).md),
who, by measuring Jerusalem, is denoted as the Author of its coming
restoration. Thus the Jews are encouraged in Zechariah's time to proceed
with the building. Still more so shall they be hereby encouraged in the
future restoration.

[Zechariah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 2:2</span></span>

To measure Jerusalem--(Compare [Rev
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001.md); [Rev
21:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015).md).

to see what is the breadth . . . what is the length--rather, "what is to
be the due breadth and length."

[Zechariah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 2:3</span></span>

angel that talked with me . . . another angel--The interpreting angel is
met by another angel sent by the measuring Divine Angel to "run" to
Zechariah ([Zac 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004).md). Those who
perform God's will must not merely creep, nor walk, but run with
alacrity.

went forth--namely, from me (Zechariah).

went out--from the measuring angel.

[Zechariah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 2:4</span></span>

this young man--So Zechariah is called as being still a youth when
prophetically inspired \[GROTIUS\]. Or, he is so called in respect to
his ministry or service (compare [Num
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#027.md); [Jos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#001).md) \[VATABLUS\]. Naturally the
"angel that talked with" Zechariah is desired to "speak to" him the
further communications to be made from the Divine Being.

towns without walls for the multitude . . . Cattle--So many shall be its
inhabitants that all could not be contained within the walls, but shall
spread out in the open country around ([Est
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/est009.htm#019).md); and so secure shall they be as
not to need to shelter themselves and their cattle behind walls. So
hereafter Judea is to be "the land of unwalled villages" ([Eze
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#011).md). Spiritually, now the Church
has extended herself beyond the walls ([Eph
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md) of Mosaic ordinances and has
spread from cities to country villages, whose inhabitants gave their
Latin name (pagani) to pagans, as being the last in parting with
heathenism.

[Zechariah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 2:5</span></span>

I . . . wall of fire round--Compare [Zac
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#004.md). Yet as a city needs some wall, I
JEHOVAH will act as one of fire which none durst approach ([Zac
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#008.md); [Isa
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001).md).

glory in the midst--not only a defense from foes outside, but a glory
within ([Isa 60:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019.md); [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023).md). The same combination of "glory
and defense" is found in [Isa 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md),
alluding to the pillar of cloud and fire which defended and enlightened
Israel in the desert. Compare Elisha in Dothan ([Kg2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017).md). As God is to be her "glory," so
she shall be His "glory" ([Isa 62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003).md).

[Zechariah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 2:6</span></span>

flee from the land of the north--that is, from Babylon: a type of the
various Gentile lands, from which the Jews are to be recalled hereafter;
hence "the four winds of heaven" are specified, implying that they are
to return from all quarters ([Deu
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md); [Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md); [Eze
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021).md). The reason why they should
flee from Babylon is: (1) because of the blessings promised to God's
people in their own land; (2) because of the evils about to fall on
their foe ([Zac 2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007).md). Babylon was
soon to fall before Darius, and its inhabitants to endure fearful
calamities ([Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md); [Jer
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045).md). Many of the Jews in
Zechariah's time had not yet returned to Judea. Their tardiness was
owing to (1) unbelief; (2) their land had long lain waste, and was
surrounded with bitter foes; (3) they regarded suspiciously the liberty
of return given by Cyrus and Darius, as if these monarchs designed
suddenly to crush them; (4) their long stay in Babylon had obliterated
the remembrance of their own land; (5) the wealth and security there
contrasted with Judea, where their temple and city were in ruins. All
this betrayed foul ingratitude and disregard of God's extraordinary
favor, which is infinitely to be preferred to all the wealth of the
world \[CALVIN and PEMBELLUS\].

for I have spread you abroad--The reasoning is: I who scattered you from
your land to all quarters, can also gather you again to it.

[Zechariah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 2:7</span></span>

O Zion . . . daughter of Babylon--Thou whose only sure dwelling is
"Zion," inseparably connected with the temple, art altogether out of thy
place in "dwelling with the daughter of Babylon" (that is, Babylon and
her people, [Psa 137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md); [Isa
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#008).md).

After the glory--After restoring the "glory" ([Zac
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md); [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md); [Rom
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004).md) of Jehovah's presence to
Jerusalem, He (God the Father) hath commissioned ME (God the Son, [Isa
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md), the Divine Angel: God thus
being at once the Sender and the Sent) to visit in wrath "the nations
which spoiled you." Messiah's twofold office from the Father is: (1) to
glorify His Church; (2) to punish its foes ([Th2
1:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007).md). Both offices manifest His
glory ([Pro 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#004).md).

toucheth . . . the apple of his eye--namely, of Jehovah's eye ([Deu
32:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#010.md); [Psa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md); [Pro
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#002).md). The pupil, or aperture, through
which rays pass to the retina, is the tenderest part of the eye; the
member which we most sedulously guard from hurt as being the dearest of
our members; the one which feels most acutely the slightest injury, and
the loss of which is irreparable.

[Zechariah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 2:9</span></span>

shake . . . hand--A mere wave of God's hand can prostrate all foes
(compare [Rut 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#013.md); [Job
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#021.md); [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015.md); [Isa
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#016.md); [Act
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011).md).

a spoil to their servants--to the Jews whom they had once as their
slaves (compare [Isa 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#002).md). As the
Jews' state between the return from Babylon and Christ's coming was
checkered with much adversity, this prophecy can only have its
fulfilment under Christ.

sent me-- ([Isa 48:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016.md); [Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md); [Joh
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#036).md).

[Zechariah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 2:10</span></span>

I will dwell in . . . midst of thee--primarily at Messiah's first advent
([Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md); [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md); more fully at His second advent
([Isa 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#010).md). So [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md), where see on [Zac
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md) ([Isa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006.md); [Eze
37:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027.md); [Zep
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014).md). Meanwhile God dwells
spiritually in His people ([Co2 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016).md).

[Zechariah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 2:11</span></span>

many nations . . . joined to the Lord in that day--The result of the
Jews' exile in Babylon was that, at their subsequent return, through the
diffusion of knowledge of their religion, many Gentiles became
proselytes, worshipping in the court of the Gentiles ([Kg1
8:41](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#041).md). Cyrus, Darius, Alexander,
Ptolemy Philadelphus, Augustus, and Tiberius, paid respect to the temple
by sending offerings \[GROTIUS\]. But all this is but a shadow of the
future conversion of the Gentiles which shall result from Jehovah
dwelling in Jerusalem ([Psa 102:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md);
[Phi 2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010).md).

sent me unto thee--"unto thee" is here added to the same formula ([Zac
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#009).md). Zion first shall "know
(generally) that Jehovah of hosts hath sent" Messiah, by the judgments
inflicted by Him on her foes. Subsequently, she shall know
experimentally the particular sending of Messiah unto her. Jehovah here
says, "I will dwell," and then that JEHOVAH of hosts sent Him; therefore
Jehovah the Sender and Jehovah the Sent must be One.

[Zechariah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 2:12</span></span>

Judah his portion in the holy land--Lest the joining of the Gentile
"nations to Jehovah" ([Zac 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#011).md)
should lead the Jews to fear that their peculiar relation to Him ([Deu
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md); [Deu
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#029.md); [Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md) as "His inheritance" should
cease, this verse is added to assure them of His making them so
hereafter "again."

choose Jerusalem again--The course of God's grace was interrupted for a
time, but His covenant was not set aside ([Rom
11:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md); the election was once for
all, and therefore shall hold good for ever.

[Zechariah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 2:13</span></span>

Be silent, O all flesh-- ([Hab 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020).md).
"Let all in silent awe and reverence await the Lord's coming
interposition in behalf of His people!" The address is both to the
Gentile foes, who prided themselves on their power as if irresistible,
and to the unbelieving Jews, who distrusted God's promises as
incredible. Three reasons why they must be silent are implied: (1) they
are but "flesh," weak and ignorant; (2) He is JEHOVAH, all-wise and
all-powerful; (3) He is already "raised up out of His place," and who
can stand before Him? \[PEMBELLUS\], ([Psa
76:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#008).md).

he is raised up out of his holy habitation--that is, out of heaven ([Deu
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#015.md); [Ch2
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027.md); [Isa
63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015).md), to judge and avenge His people
([Isa 26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021).md); or, "out of His holy"
temple, contemptible and incomplete as it looked then when Zechariah
urged them to rebuild it \[CALVIN\]. But the call to all to "be silent"
is rather when God has come forth from heaven where so long He has dwelt
unseen, and is about to inflict vengeance on the foe, before taking up
His dwelling in Zion and the temple. However, [Psa
50:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001) ("Out of Zion".md), [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md) (compare [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003).md), [Psa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004.md), favors CALVIN'S view. God is now
"silent" while the Gentile foe speaks arrogance against His people; but
"our God shall come and no longer keep silence"; then in turn must all
flesh "be silent" before Him.
