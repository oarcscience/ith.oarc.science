### [Exodus Chapter 35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 35:1</span></span>

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TABERNACLE. (Exo. 35:1-35)

Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel, &c.--On
the occasion referred to in the opening of this chapter, the Israelites
were specially reminded of the design to erect a magnificent tabernacle
for the regular worship of God, as well as of the leading articles that
were required to furnish that sacred edifice \[[Exo
35:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#011.md)\]. (See on Exo. 25:1-40; Exo.
27:1-21; Exo. 30:1-31:18).

[Exodus 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 35:20</span></span>

all the congregation of Israel departed from the presence of Moses--No
exciting harangues were made, nor had the people Bibles at home in which
they could compare the requirements of their leader and see if these
things were so. But they had no doubt as to his bearing to them the will
of God, and they were impressed with so strong a sense of its being
their duty, that they made a spontaneous offer of the best and most
valuable treasures they possessed.

[Exodus 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 35:21</span></span>

they came, every one whose heart stirred him up--One powerful element
doubtless of this extraordinary open-hearted liberality was the
remembrance of their recent transgression, which made them "zealous of
good works" (compare [Co2 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011).md). But
along with this motive, there were others of a higher and nobler kind--a
principle of love to God and devotedness to His service, an anxious
desire to secure the benefit of His presence, and gratitude for the
tokens of His divine favor: it was under the combined influence of these
considerations that the people were so willing and ready to pour their
contributions into that exchequer of the sanctuary.

every one whom his spirit made willing--Human nature is always the same,
and it is implied that while an extraordinary spirit of pious liberality
reigned in the bosoms of the people at large, there were
exceptions--some who were too fond of the world, who loved their
possessions more than their God, and who could not part with these; no,
not for the service of the tabernacle.

[Exodus 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">exo 35:22</span></span>

they came, both men and women, &c.--literally, "the men over and above
the women"; a phraseology which implies that the women acted a prominent
part, presented their offerings first, and then were followed by as many
of their male companions as were similarly disposed.

brought bracelets, &c.--There was in that early age no money in the form
of coins or bullion. What money passed current with the merchant
consisted of rings which were weighed, and principally of ornaments for
personal decoration. Astonishment at the abundance of their ornaments is
at an end when we learn that costly and elegant ornaments abounded in
proportion as clothing was simple and scarce among the Egyptians, and
some, entirely divested of clothing, yet wore rich necklaces
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. Among people with Oriental sentiments and tastes,
scarcely any stronger proof could have been given of the power of
religion than their willingness not only to lay aside, but to devote
those much-valued trinkets to the house of God; and thus all, like the
Eastern sages, laid the best they had at the service of God.

[Exodus 35:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 35:30</span></span>

See, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, &c.--Moses
had made this communication before \[see [Exo
31:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md); also see on [Exo
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md)\]. But now that the collection
had been made, the materials were contributed, and the operations of
building about to be commenced, it was with the greatest propriety he
reminded the people that the individuals entrusted with the application
of their gold and silver had been nominated to the work by authority to
which all would bow.

[Exodus 35:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 35:35</span></span>

Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart--A statement which not only
testifies that skill in art and science is a direct gift from God, but
that weaving was especially the business of men in Egypt (see [Exo
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#022.md); [Exo
39:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#022.md), [Exo
39:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#027).md). And in perfect harmony with
the testimony of the monuments is the account given by Moses to the
artists who were divinely taught the arts necessary for the
embellishment of the tabernacle. Others, whose limited means did not
admit of these expensive contributions, offered their gratuitous
services in fabricating such articles of tapestry as were needed; arts
which the Israelitish females learned as bondwomen, in the houses of
Egyptian princes.
