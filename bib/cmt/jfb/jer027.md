### [Jeremiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 27:1</span></span>

THE FUTILITY OF RESISTING NEBUCHADNEZZAR ILLUSTRATED TO THE AMBASSADORS
OF THE KING, DESIRING TO HAVE THE KING OF JUDAH CONFEDERATE WITH THEM,
UNDER THE TYPE OF YOKES. JEREMIAH EXHORTS THEM AND ZEDEKIAH TO YIELD.
(Jer. 27:1-22)

Jehoiakim--The prophecy that follows was according to this reading given
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, fifteen years before it was published
in the reign of Zedekiah to whom it refers; it was thus long deposited
in the prophet's bosom, in order that by it he might be supported under
trials in his prophetic career in the interim \[CALVIN\]. But "Zedekiah"
may be the true reading. So the Syriac and Arabic Versions. [Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md), [Jer
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md); [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md), confirm this; also, one of
KENNICOTT'S manuscripts. The English Version reading may have originated
from [Jer 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#001.md). "Son of Josiah"
applies to Zedekiah as truly as to "Jehoiakim" or "Eliakim." The fourth
year may, in a general sense here, as in [Jer
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md), be called "the beginning of his
reign," as it lasted eleven years ([Kg2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#018).md). It was not long after the
fourth year of his reign that he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar ([Jer
51:59](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#059.md); [Jer
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#003.md); [Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020).md), in violation of an oath before
God ([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 27:2</span></span>

bonds--by which the yoke is made fast to the neck ([Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005).md).

yokes--literally, the carved piece of wood attached at both ends to the
two yokes on the necks of a pair of oxen, so as to connect them. Here
the yoke itself. The plural is used, as he was to wear one himself, and
give the others to the ambassadors; ([Jer
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md); [Jer
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#010.md), [Jer
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#012).md) proves that the symbolical act
was in this instance (though not in others, [Jer
25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md) actually done (compare [Isa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md), &c.; [Eze
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#003.md), [Eze
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#011.md), [Eze
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 27:3</span></span>

And send them to the king of Edom, &c.--Appropriate symbol, as these
ambassadors had come to Jerusalem to consult as to shaking off the yoke
of Nebuchadnezzar. According to PHERECYDES in CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 567\], Idanthura, king of the Scythians, intimated to
Darius, who had crossed the Danube, that he would lead an army against
him, by sending him, instead of a letter, a mouse, a frog, a bird, an
arrow, and a plough. The task assigned to Jeremiah required great faith,
as it was sure to provoke alike his own countrymen and the foreign
ambassadors and their kings, by a seeming insult, at the very time that
all were full of confident hopes grounded on the confederacy.

[Jeremiah 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 27:5</span></span>

God here, as elsewhere, connects with the symbol doctrine, which is as
it were its soul, without which it would be not only cold and frivolous,
but even dead \[CALVIN\]. God's mention of His supreme power is in order
to refute the pride of those who rely on their own power ([Isa
45:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#012).md).

given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me-- ([Psa
115:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#015.md); [Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017.md), [Dan
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#025.md), [Dan
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#032).md). Not for his merits, but of My
own sole good pleasure \[ESTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 27:6</span></span>

beasts of the field--not merely the horses to carry his Chaldean
soldiers, and oxen to draw his provisions \[GROTIUS\]; not merely the
deserts, mountains, and woods, the haunts of wild beasts, implying his
unlimited extent of empire \[ESTIUS\]; but the beasts themselves by a
mysterious instinct of nature. A reproof to men that they did not
recognize God's will, which the very beasts acknowledged (compare [Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003).md). As the beasts are to submit to
Christ, the Restorer of the dominion over nature, lost by the first Adam
(compare [Gen 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#028.md); [Gen
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md); [Psa
8:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006).md), so they were appointed to
submit to Nebuchadnezzar, the representative of the world power and
prefigurer of Antichrist; this universal power was suffered to be held
by him to show the unfitness of any to wield it "until He come whose
right it is" ([Eze 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027).md).

[Jeremiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 27:7</span></span>

son . . . son's son-- ([Ch2 36:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#020).md).
Nebuchadnezzar had four successors--Evil-merodach, his son; Neriglissar,
husband of Nebuchadnezzar's daughter; his son, Labosodarchod; and
Naboned (with whom his son, Belshazzar, was joint king), son of
Evil-merodach. But Neriglissar and Labosodarchod were not in the direct
male line; so that the prophecy held good to "his son and his son's
son," and the intermediate two are omitted.

time of his land--that is, of its subjugation or its being "visited" in
wrath ([Jer 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md); [Jer
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md); [Jer
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md); [Dan
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#026).md).

serve themselves of him--make him their servant ([Jer
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md); [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md). So "his day" for the destined
day of his calamity ([Job 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 27:8</span></span>

until I have consumed them by his hand--until by these consuming
visitations I have brought them under his power.

[Jeremiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 27:9</span></span>

ye--the Jews especially, for whom the address to the rest was intended.

enchanters--augurs \[CALVIN\], from a root, the "eyes," that is, lookers
at the stars and other means of taking omens of futurity; or another
root, a "fixed time," observers of times: forbidden in the law ([Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026.md); [Deu
18:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md), [Deu
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 27:10</span></span>

to remove you--expressing the event which would result. The very thing
they profess by their enchantments to avert, they are by them bringing
on you. Better to submit to Nebuchadnezzar, and remain in your land,
than to rebel, and be removed from it.

[Jeremiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 27:11</span></span>

serve . . . till it--The same Hebrew root expresses "serve" and "till,"
or "cultivate." Serve ye the king of Babylon, and the land will serve
you \[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 27:12</span></span>

I spake also--translate, "And I spake," &c. Special application of the
subject to Zedekiah.

[Jeremiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 27:13</span></span>

Why . . . die--by running on your own ruin in resisting Nebuchadnezzar
after this warning ([Eze 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031).md).

[Jeremiah 27:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 27:14</span></span>

lie-- ([Jer 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 27:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 27:15</span></span>

in my name--The devil often makes God's name the plea for lies ([Mat
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md); [Mat
7:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#022.md); [Jer
27:15-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#015.md), the test whereby to know
false prophets).

[Jeremiah 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 27:16</span></span>

The "vessels" had been carried away to Babylon in the reign of Jeconiah
([Kg2 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#013).md); also previously in that
of Jehoiakim ([Ch2 36:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 27:18</span></span>

at Jerusalem--that is, in other houses containing such vessels, besides
the house of God and the king's palace. Nebuzara-dan, captain of the
guard under Nebuchadnezzar, carried all away ([Kg2
25:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#013.md); [Ch2
36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018).md). The more costly vessels had
been previously removed in the reigns of Jehoiakim and Jeconiah.

[Jeremiah 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 27:19</span></span>

([Jer 52:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#017.md), [Jer
52:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 27:22</span></span>

until . . . I visit them--in wrath by Cyrus ([Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005).md). In seventy years from the first
carrying away of captives in Jehoiachin's reign ([Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md); [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md).

restore them--by the hand of Cyrus ([Ezr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md). By Artaxerxes ([Ezr
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#019).md).
