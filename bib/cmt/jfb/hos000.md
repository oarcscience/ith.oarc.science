### [Hosea Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

[Hosea](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">hos 0:0</span></span>

THE first of the twelve minor prophets in the order of the canon (called
"minor," not as less in point of inspired authority, but simply in point
of size). The twelve are first mentioned by Jesus, the son of Sirach
(Ecclesiasticus 49:10). St. Stephen, in [Act
7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md) (in referring to [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027).md), quotes them as forming one
collective body of writings, "the book of the prophets." So JEROME and
MELITO, the first Greek father who has left us a catalogue of these
books. The collection of the sacred books is by Jewish tradition
attributed to the great synagogue of learned scribes formed by Ezra.
Many think Nehemiah completed this collection by adding to the books
already in the canon those of his own times. Malachi, the last in the
series, probably aided him in determining with infallible authority what
books were entitled to be ranked in the inspired canon. The
chronological order differs from the canonical. Joel, about 810 B.C.;
Jonah, about 810 B.C., or, as others, first, 862 B.C.; Amos, about 790
B.C.; Hosea, about 784 B.C. Hosea, the contemporary of Isaiah, Micah,
and Amos, seems to have entered on his prophetical office in the last
years of Jeroboam (contemporary in part with Uzziah), and to have ended
it in the beginning of Hezekiah's reign, 722 B.C., that is, about sixty
years in all, from 784 B.C. to 722 B.C. The prophets, however, were not
uninterruptedly engaged in prophesying. Considerable intervals elapsed,
though their office as divinely commissioned public teachers was never
wholly laid aside. The Book of Hosea which we have constitutes only that
portion of his public teachings which the Holy Spirit saw fit to
preserve for the benefit of the Church. The cause of his being placed
first of the twelve was, probably, the length, the vivid earnestness,
and patriotism of his prophecies, as well as their closer resemblance to
those of the greater prophets. His style is abrupt, sententious, and
unrounded; the connecting particles are few; there are changes of
person, and anomalies of gender, number, and construction. His name
means Salvation. He was son of Beeri, of the tribe of Issachar, born in
Beth-shemesh \[JEROME\]. His mention, in the inscription, of Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, is no proof that he belonged
to Judah: for the prophets in Israel regarded its separation from Judah,
civil as well as religious, as an apostasy from God, who promised the
dominion of the theocracy to the line of David. Hence Elijah in Israel
took twelve stones to represent Judah, as well as Israel ([Kg1
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#031).md). Hence Hosea dates from Judah's
kings, as well as from Jeroboam of Israel, though he belonged to Israel,
with whose sins and fate his book is chiefly occupied. He, however,
makes incidental references to Judah. His first prophecy foretells the
overthrow of Jehu's house, fulfilled on the death of Jeroboam, Jehu's
great-grandson ([Kg2 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#012).md), in
Zachariah, Jeroboam's son, the fourth and last from Jehu, conspired
against by Shallum. This first prediction was doubtless in Jeroboam's
life, as Zachariah, his son, was only suffered to reign six months; thus
the inscription is verified that "the word of the Lord came unto him in
the days of Jeroboam" ([Hos 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md).
Again, in [Hos 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md), Shalmaneser's
expedition against Israel is alluded to as past, that is, the first
inroad against King Hoshea, who began to reign in the twelfth year of
Ahaz; so that as Ahaz' whole reign was sixteen years, the prophecy seems
to have been given about the beginning of Hezekiah's reign. Thus the
inscription is confirmed that the exercise of his prophetical functions
was of such a protracted duration.

Hosea ([Hos 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001).md) is quoted in [Mat
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#015.md); also [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md) in [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md); [Mat
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#007.md); compare [Rom
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md), quoting [Hos
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); [Hos
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#001.md), [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md); [Co1
15:55](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#055.md), quoting [Hos
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md), quoting [Hos
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md); [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md). Messianic references are not
frequent; but the predictions of the future conversion of Israel to the
Lord their God, and David their king, and of the fulfilment of the
promise to Abraham that his spiritual seed should be as the sand of the
sea ([Hos 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md); [Hos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005).md), clearly refer to the New
Testament dispensation.

The first and third chapters are in prose, the rest of the book is
rhythmical.
