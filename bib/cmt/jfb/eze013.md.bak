### [Ezekiel Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 13:1</span></span>

DENUNCIATION OF FALSE PROPHETS AND PROPHETESSES; THEIR FALSE TEACHINGS,
AND GOD'S CONSEQUENT JUDGMENTS. (Eze. 13:1-23)

As the twelfth chapter denounced the false expectations of the people,
so this denounces the false leaders who fed those expectations. As an
independent witness, Ezekiel confirms at the Chebar the testimony of
Jeremiah ([Jer 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#021.md), [Jer
29:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#031).md) in his letter from Jerusalem to
the captive exiles, against the false prophets; of these some were
conscious knaves, others fanatical dupes of their own frauds; for
example, Ahab, Zedekiah, and Shemaiah. Hananiah must have believed his
own lie, else he would not have specified so circumstantial details
([Jer 28:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#002).md). The conscious knaves
gave only general assurances of peace ([Jer
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#031.md); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md); [Jer
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#013).md). The language of Ezekiel has
plain references to the similar language of Jeremiah (for example, Jer.
23:9-38); the bane of false prophecy, which had its stronghold in
Jerusalem, having in some degree extended to the Chebar; this chapter,
therefore, is primarily intended as a message to those still in the
Jewish metropolis; and, secondarily, for the good of the exiles at the
Chebar.

[Ezekiel 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 13:2</span></span>

that prophesy--namely, a speedy return to Jerusalem.

out of . . . own hearts--alluding to the words of Jeremiah ([Jer
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md), [Jer
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026).md); that is, what they prophesied
was what they and the people wished; the wish was father to the thought.
The people wished to be deceived, and so were deceived. They were
inexcusable, for they had among them true prophets (who spoke not their
own thoughts, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021).md), whom they might have known to
be such, but they did not wish to know ([Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 13:3</span></span>

foolish--though vaunting as though exclusively possessing "wisdom" ([Co1
1:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#019).md); the fear of God being the
only beginning of wisdom ([Psa
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010).md).

their own spirit--instead of the Spirit of God. A threefold distinction
lay between the false and the true prophets: (1) The source of their
messages respectively; of the false, "their own hearts"; of the true, an
object presented to the spiritual sense (named from the noblest of the
senses, a seeing) by the Spirit of God as from without, not produced by
their own natural powers of reflection. The word, the body of the
thought, presented itself not audibly to the natural sense, but directly
to the spirit of the prophet; and so the perception of it is properly
called a seeing, he perceiving that which thereafter forms itself in his
soul as the cover of the external word \[DELITZSCH\]; hence the peculiar
expression, "seeing the word of God" ([Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md); [Isa
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#001.md); [Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); [Mic
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001)). (2.md) The point aimed at; the
false "walking after their own spirit"; the true, after the Spirit of
God. (3) The result; the false saw nothing, but spake as if they had
seen; the true had a vision, not subjective, but objectively real
\[FAIRBAIRN\]. A refutation of those who set the inward word above the
objective, and represent the Bible as flowing subjectively from the
inner light of its writers, not from the revelation of the Holy Ghost
from without. "They are impatient to get possession of the kernel
without its fostering shell--they would have Christ without the Bible"
\[BENGEL\].

[Ezekiel 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 13:4</span></span>

foxes--which cunningly "spoil the vines" ([Sol
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015).md), Israel being the vineyard ([Psa
80:8-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008.md); [Isa
5:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md); [Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002.md); [Jer
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#021).md); their duty was to have guarded
it from being spoiled, whereas they themselves spoiled it by
corruptions.

in . . . deserts--where there is nothing to eat; whence the foxes become
so ravenous and crafty in their devices to get food. So the prophets
wander in Israel, a moral desert, unrestrained, greedy of gain which
they get by craft.

[Ezekiel 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 13:5</span></span>

not gone up into . . . gaps--metaphor from breaches made in a wall, to
which the defenders ought to betake themselves in order to repel the
entrance of the foe. The breach is that made in the theocracy through
the nation's sin; and, unless it be made up, the vengeance of God will
break in through it. Those who would advise the people to repentance are
the restorers of the breach ([Eze
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030.md); [Psa
106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023.md), [Psa
106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030).md).

hedge--the law of God ([Psa 80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012.md);
[Isa 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md), [Isa
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005).md); by violating it, the people
stripped themselves of the fence of God's protection and lay exposed to
the foe. The false prophets did not try to repair the evil by bringing
back the people to the law with good counsels, or by checking the bad
with reproofs. These two duties answer to the double office of defenders
in case of a breach made in a wall: (1) To repair the breach from
within; (2) To oppose the foe from without.

to stand--that is, that the city may "stand."

in . . . day of . . . Lord--In the day of the battle which God wages
against Israel for their sins, ye do not try to stay God's vengeance by
prayers, and by leading the nation to repentance.

[Ezekiel 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 13:6</span></span>

made others to hope, &c.--rather, "they hoped" to confirm (that is,
'make good') their word, by the event corresponding to their prophecy.
The Hebrew requires this \[HAVERNICK\]. Also the parallel clause, "they
have seen vanity," implies that they believed their own lie ([Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011).md). Subjective revelation is false
unless it rests on the objective.

[Ezekiel 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 13:8</span></span>

I am against you--rather understand, "I come against you," to punish
your wicked profanation of My name (compare [Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md), [Rev
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#016).md).

[Ezekiel 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 13:9</span></span>

mine hand--My power in vengeance.

not . . . in . . . assembly--rather, the "council"; "They shall not
occupy the honorable office of councillors in the senate of elders after
the return from Babylon" ([Ezr 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#001).md).

neither . . . written in . . . Israel--They shall not even have a place
in the register kept of all citizens' names; they shall be erased from
it, just as the names of those who died in the year, or had been
deprived of citizenship for their crimes, were at the annual revisal
erased. Compare [Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md); [Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md), as to those spiritually
Israelites; [Joh 1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047.md), and those not
so. Literally fulfilled ([Ezr 2:59](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#059.md),
[Ezr 2:62](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#062.md); compare [Neh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh007.htm#005.md); [Psa
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028).md).

neither . . . enter . . . land--They shall not so much as be allowed to
come back at all to their country.

[Ezekiel 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 13:10</span></span>

Because, even because--The repetition heightens the emphasis.

Peace--safety to the nation. Ezekiel confirms [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md); [Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md).

one--literally, "this one"; said contemptuously, as in [Ch2
28:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#022.md).

a wall--rather, "a loose wall." Ezekiel had said that the false prophets
did not "go up into the gaps, or make up the breaches" ([Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005).md), as good architects do; now he
adds that they make a bustling show of anxiety about repairing the wall;
but it is without right mortar, and therefore of no use.

one . . . others--besides individual effort, they jointly co-operated to
delude the people.

daubed . . . with untempered mortar--as sand without lime, mud without
straw \[GROTIUS\]. FAIRBAIRN translates, "plaster it with whitewash."
But besides the hypocrisy of merely outwardly "daubing" to make the wall
look fair ([Mat 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md), [Mat
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md); [Act
23:3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003).md), there is implied the
unsoundness of the wall from the absence of true uniting cement; the
"untempered cement" answering to the lie of the prophets, who say, in
support of their prophecies, "Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord hath
not spoken" ([Eze 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028).md).

[Ezekiel 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 13:11</span></span>

overflowing--inundating; such as will at once wash away the mere clay
mortar. The three most destructive agents shall co-operate against the
wall--wind, rain, and hailstones. These last in the East are more out of
the regular course of nature and are therefore often particularly
specified as the instruments of God's displeasure against His foes ([Exo
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#018.md); [Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md); [Job
38:22](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#022.md); [Psa
18:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md); [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002.md); [Isa
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030.md); [Rev
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#021).md). The Hebrew here is, literally,
"stones of ice." They fall in Palestine at times an inch thick with a
destructive velocity. The personification heightens the vivid effect, "O
ye hail stones." The Chaldeans will be the violent agency whereby God
will unmask and refute them, overthrowing their edifice of lies.

[Ezekiel 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 13:12</span></span>

shall it not be said--Your vanity and folly shall be so manifested that
it shall pass into a proverb, "Where is the daubing?"

[Ezekiel 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 13:13</span></span>

God repeats, in His own name, as the Source of the coming calamity, what
had been expressed generally in [Eze
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011.md).

[Ezekiel 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 13:14</span></span>

The repetition of the same threat (see on [Eze
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#011).md) is to awaken the people out of
their dream of safety by the certainty of the event.

foundation--As the "wall" represents the security of the nation, so the
"foundation" is Jerusalem, on the fortifications of which they rested
their confidence. GROTIUS makes the "foundation" refer to the false
principles on which they rested; [Eze
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016.md) supports the former view.

[Ezekiel 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 13:16</span></span>

prophesy concerning Jerusalem--With all their "seeing visions of peace
for her," they cannot ensure peace or safety to themselves.

[Ezekiel 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 13:17</span></span>

set thy face--put on a bold countenance, fearlessly to denounce them
([Eze 3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008.md); [Isa
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007).md).

daughters--the false prophetesses; alluded to only here; elsewhere the
guilt specified in the women is the active share they took in
maintaining idolatry ([Eze 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#014).md). It
was only in extraordinary emergencies that God bestowed prophecy on
women, for example on Miriam, Deborah, Huldah ([Exo
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Jdg
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004.md); [Kg2
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014).md); so in the last days to come
([Joe 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028).md). The rareness of such
instances enhanced their guilt in pretending inspiration.

[Ezekiel 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 13:18</span></span>

sew pillows to . . . armholes--rather, elbows and wrists, for which the
false prophetesses made cushions to lean on, as a symbolical act,
typifying the perfect tranquility which they foretold to those
consulting them. Perhaps they made their dupes rest on these cushions in
a fancied state of ecstasy after they had made them at first stand
(whence the expression, "every stature," is used for "men of every
age"). As the men are said to have built a wall ([Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010).md), so the women are said to sew
pillows, &c., both alike typifying the "peace" they promised the
impenitent.

make kerchiefs--magical veils, which they put over the heads of those
consulting them, as if to fit them for receiving a response, that they
might be rapt in spiritual trance above the world.

head of every stature--"men of every age," old and young, great and
small, if only these had pay to offer them.

hunt souls--eagerly trying to allure them to the love of yourselves
([Pro 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026.md); [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014).md), so as unwarily to become your
prey.

will ye save . . . souls . . . that come unto you--Will ye haul after
souls, and when they are yours ("come unto you"), will ye promise them
life? "Save" is explained ([Eze
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022).md), "promising life" \[GROTIUS\].
CALVIN explains, "Will ye hunt My people's souls and yet will ye save
your own souls"; I, the Lord God, will not allow it. But "save" is used
([Eze 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019).md) of the false prophetesses
promising life to the impenitent, so that English Version and GROTIUS
explain it best.

[Ezekiel 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 13:19</span></span>

handfuls--expressing the paltry gain for which they bartered immortal
souls (compare [Mic 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#005.md), [Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011.md); [Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md). They "polluted" God by making
His name the cloak under which they uttered falsehoods.

among my people--an aggravation of their sin, that they committed it
"among the people" whom God had chosen as peculiarly His own, and among
whom He had His temple. It would have been a sin to have done so even
among the Gentiles, who knew not God; much more so among the people of
God (compare [Pro 28:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#021).md).

slay . . . souls that should not die, &c.--to predict the slaying or
perdition of the godly whom I will save. As true ministers are said to
save and slay their hearers, according to the spirit respectively in
which these receive their message ([Co2
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015).md), so false ministers imitate
them; but they promise safety to those on the broad way to ruin and
predict ruin to those on the narrow way of God.

my people that hear your lies--who are therefore wilfully deceived, so
that their guilt lies at their own door ([Joh
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 13:20</span></span>

I am against your pillows--that is, against your lying ceremonial tricks
by which ye cheat the people.

to make them fly--namely, into their snares, as fowlers disturb birds so
as to be suddenly caught in the net spread for them. "Fly" is peculiarly
appropriate as to those lofty spiritual flights to which they pretended
to raise their dupes when they veiled their heads with kerchiefs and
made them rest on luxurious arm-cushions ([Eze
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#018).md).

let . . . souls go--"Ye make them fly" in order to destroy them; "I will
let them go" in order to save them ([Psa
91:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#003.md); [Pro
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#005.md); [Hos
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008).md).

[Ezekiel 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 13:21</span></span>

to be saved.

[Ezekiel 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 13:22</span></span>

ye have made . . . the righteous sad--by lying predictions of calamities
impending ever the godly.

23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014).md).

heart of . . . righteous . . . hands of . . . wicked--Heart is applied
to the righteous because the terrors foretold penetrated to their inmost
feelings; hands, to the wicked because they were so hardened as not only
to despise God in their minds, but also to manifest it in their whole
acts, as if avowedly waging war with Him.

[Ezekiel 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 13:23</span></span>

ye shall see no more vanity--The event shall confute your lies,
involving yourselves in destruction ([Eze
