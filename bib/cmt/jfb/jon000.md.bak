### [Jonah Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

[Jonah](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">jon 0:0</span></span>

JONAH was the son of Amittai, of Gath-hepher in Zebulun (called
Gittah-hepher in [Jos 19:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010).md), so
that he belonged to the kingdom of the ten tribes, not to Judah. His
date is to be gathered from [Kg2
14:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025), "He (Jeroboam II.md) restored
the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the
plain, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which He spake
by the hand of His servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which
was of Gath-hepher. For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it
was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
helper for Israel. And the Lord said not that He would blot out the name
of Israel from under heaven: but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam
the son of Joash." Now as this prophecy of Jonah was given at a time
when Israel was at the lowest point of depression, when "there was not
any shut up or left," that is, confined or left at large, none to act as
a helper for Israel, it cannot have been given in Jeroboam's reign,
which was marked by prosperity, for in it Syria was worsted in
fulfilment of the prophecy, and Israel raised to its former "greatness."
It must have been, therefore, in the early part of the reign of Joash,
Jeroboam's father, who had found Israel in subjection to Syria, but had
raised it by victories which were followed up so successfully by
Jeroboam. Thus Jonah was the earliest of the prophets, and close upon
Elisha, who died in Joash's reign, having just before his death given a
token prophetical of the thrice defeat of Syria ([Kg2
13:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#014).md). Hosea and Amos prophesied
also in the reign of Jeroboam II, but towards the closing part of his
forty-one years' reign. The transactions in the Book of Jonah probably
occurred in the latter part of his life; if so, the book is not much
older than part of the writings of Hosea and Amos. The use of the third
person is no argument against Jonah himself being the writer: for the
sacred writers in mentioning themselves do so in the third person
(compare [Joh 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#026).md). Nor is the use
of the past tense ([Jon 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md), "Now
Nineveh was an exceeding great city") a proof that Nineveh's greatness
was past when the Book of Jonah was being written; it is simply used to
carry on the negative uniformly,--"the word of the Lord came to Jonah .
. . so Jonah arose . . . now Nineveh was," &c. ([Jon
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#001.md); [Jon
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003).md). The mention of its greatness
proves rather that the book was written at an early date, before the
Israelites had that intimate knowledge of it which they must have had
soon afterwards through frequent Assyrian inroads.

As early as JULIAN and PORPHYRY, pagans ridiculed the credulity of
Christians in believing the deliverance of Jonah by a fish. Some
infidels have derived it from the heathen fable of the deliverance of
Andromeda from a sea monster by Perseus \[APOLLODORUS, The Library,
2.4,3\]; or from that of Arion the musician thrown into the sea by
sailors, and carried safe to shore on a dolphin \[HERODOTUS, History,
1.24\]; or from that of Hercules, who sprang into the jaws of a sea
monster, and was three days in its belly, when he undertook to save
Hesione \[DIODORUS SICULUS, Historical Library, 4.42; HOMER, The Iliad,
20.145; 21.442\]. Probably the heathen fables are, vice versa,
corruptions of the sacred narrative, if there be any connection. JEROME
states that near Joppa lay rocks, pointed out as those to which
Andromeda was bound when exposed to the sea monster. This fable implies
the likelihood of the story of Jonah having passed through the
PhÅ“nicians in a corrupted form to Greece. That the account of Jonah is
history, and not parable (as rationalists represent), appears from our
Lord's reference to it, in which the personal existence, miraculous
fate, and prophetical office of Jonah are explicitly asserted: "No sign
shall be given but the sign of the prophet Jonas: for, as Jonas was
three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of
man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth" ([Mat
12:39-40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039).md). The Lord recognizes his
being in the belly of the fish as a "sign," that is, a real miracle,
typical of a similar event in His own history; and assumes the execution
of the prophet's commission to Nineveh, "The men of Nineveh . . .
repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, a greater than Jonas is
here" ([Mat 12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041).md).

It seemed strange to KIMCHI, a Jew himself, that the Book of Jonah is
among the Scriptures, as the only prophecy in it concerns Nineveh, a
heathen city, and makes no mention of Israel, which is referred to by
every other prophet. The reason seems to be: a tacit reproof of Israel
is intended; a heathen people were ready to repent at the first
preaching of the prophet, a stranger to them; but Israel, who boasted of
being God's elect, repented not, though warned by their own prophets at
all seasons. This was an anticipatory streak of light before the dawn of
the full "light to lighten the Gentiles" ([Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032).md). Jonah is himself a strange
paradox: a prophet of God, and yet a runaway from God: a man drowned,
and yet alive: a preacher of repentance, yet one that repines at
repentance. Yet Jonah, saved from the jaws of death himself on
repentance, was the fittest to give a hope to Nineveh, doomed though it
was, of a merciful respite on its repentance. The patience and pity of
God stand in striking contrast with the selfishness and hard-heartedness
of man.

Nineveh in particular was chosen to teach Israel these lessons, on
account of its being capital of the then world kingdom, and because it
was now beginning to make its power felt by Israel. Our Lord ([Mat
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041).md) makes Nineveh's repentance a
reproof of the Jews' impenitence in His day, just as Jonah provoked
Israel to jealousy ([Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md) by the
same example. Jonah's mission to Nineveh implied that a heathen city
afforded as legitimate a field for the prophet's labors as Israel, and
with a more successful result (compare [Amo
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#007).md).

The book is prose narrative throughout, except the prayer of
thanksgiving in the second chapter ([Jon
2:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jon002.htm#001).md). The ChaldÃ&brvbr;isms in the
original do not prove spuriousness, or a later age, but were natural in
the language of one living in Zebulun on the borders of the north,
whence Aramaic peculiarities would readily arise; moreover, his message
to Nineveh implies acquaintance with Assyrian. Living as Jonah did in a
part of Israel exposed to Assyrian invasions, he probably stood in the
same relation to Assyria as Elijah and Elisha had stood to Syria. The
purity of the language implies the antiquity of the book, and the
likelihood of its being Jonah's own writing. Indeed, none but Jonah
could have written or dictated such peculiar details, known only to
himself.

The tradition that places the tomb of Jonah opposite to Mosul, and names
it "Nebbi Junus" (that is, "prophet Jonah"), originated probably in the
spot having been occupied by a Christian church or convent dedicated to
him \[LAYARD\]. A more ancient tradition of JEROME'S time placed the
tomb in Jonah's native village of Gath-hepher.
