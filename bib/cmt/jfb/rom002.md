Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Romans Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001)

[Romans 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 2:4</span></span>

THE JEW UNDER LIKE CONDEMNATION WITH THE GENTILE. (Rom. 2:1-29)

the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance--that is, is designed and
adapted to do so.

[Romans 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 2:5</span></span>

treasurest up unto thyself wrath against--rather "in."

the day of wrath--that is wrath to come on thee in the day of wrath.
What an awful idea is here expressed--that the sinner himself is
amassing, like hoarded treasure, an ever accumulating stock of divine
wrath, to burst upon him in "the day of the revelation of the righteous
judgment of God!" And this is said not of the reckless, but of those who
boasted of their purity of faith and life.

[Romans 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 2:7</span></span>

To them who, &c.--The substance of these verses is that the final
judgment will turn upon character alone.

by patient continuance in well-doing, &c.--Compare [Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015) : "That on the good ground are
they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it,
and bring forth fruit with patience"; denoting the enduring and
progressive character of the new life.

[Romans 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 2:8</span></span>

But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
&c.--referring to such keen and determined resistance to the Gospel as
he himself had too painfully witnessed on the part of his own
countrymen. (See [Act 13:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#044); [Act
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005), [Act
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013); [Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006), [Act
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012); and compare [Th1
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015)).

indignation and wrath--in the bosom of a sin-avenging God.

[Romans 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 2:9</span></span>

Tribulation and anguish--the effect of these in the sinner himself.

[Romans 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 2:10</span></span>

to the Jew first--first in perdition if unfaithful; but if obedient to
the truth, first in salvation ([Rom
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010)).

[Romans 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 2:12</span></span>

For as many as have sinned--not "as many as have sinned at all," but,
"as many as are found in sin" at the judgment of the great day (as the
whole context shows).

without law--that is, without the advantage of a positive Revelation.

shall also perish without law--exempt from the charge of rejecting or
disregarding it.

and as many as have sinned in the law--within the pale of a positive,
written Revelation.

shall be judged by the law--tried and condemned by the higher standard
of that written Revelation.

[Romans 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 2:13</span></span>

For not the hearers, &c.--As touching the Jews, in whose ears the
written law is continually resounding, the condemnation of as many of
them as are found sinners at the last involves no difficulty; but even
as respects the heathen, who are strangers to the law in its positive
and written form--since they show how deeply it is engraven on their
moral nature, which witnesses within them for righteousness and against
iniquity, accusing or condemning them according as they violate or obey
its stern dictates--their condemnation also for all the sin in which
they live and die will carry its dreadful echo in their own breasts.

[Romans 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 2:15</span></span>

their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing--that is, perhaps
by turns doing both.

[Romans 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 2:16</span></span>

In the day, &c.--Here the unfinished statement of [Rom
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012) is resumed and closed.

shall judge the secrets of men--here specially referring to the
unfathomed depths of hypocrisy in the self-righteous whom the apostle
had to deal with. (See [Ecc 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014);
[Co1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005)).

according to my gospel--to my teaching as a preacher of the Gospel.

[Romans 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 2:17</span></span>

Behold--"But if" is, beyond doubt, the true reading here. (It differs
but in a single letter from the received reading, and the sense is the
same).

[Romans 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 2:18</span></span>

approvest the things that are excellent--"triest the things that differ"
(Margin). Both senses are good, and indeed the former is but the result
of the latter action. (See on [Phi
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#010)).

[Romans 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 2:20</span></span>

hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law--not being left,
as the heathen are, to vague conjecture on divine things, but favored
with definite and precise information from heaven.

[Romans 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 2:22</span></span>

thou that abhorrest idols--as the Jews did ever after their captivity,
though bent on them before.

dost thou commit sacrilege?--not, as some excellent interpreters, "dost
thou rob idol temples?" but more generally, as we take it, "dost thou
profane holy things?" (as in [Mat
21:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012), and in other ways).

[Romans 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 2:24</span></span>

as it is written--(See [Isa 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005),
Marginal reference).

[Romans 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 2:25</span></span>

For circumcision--that is, One's being within the covenant of which
circumcision was the outward sign and seal.

verily profiteth, if thou keep the law--if the inward reality correspond
to the outward sign.

but if, &c.--that is, "Otherwise, thou art no better than the
uncircumcised heathen."

[Romans 2:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 2:26</span></span>

Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the . . . law, &c.--Two mistaken
interpretations, we think, are given of these words: First, that the
case here supposed is an impossible one, and put merely for illustration
\[HALDANE, CHALMERS, HODGE\]; second that it is the case of the heathen
who may and do please God when they act, as has been and is done, up to
the light of nature \[GROTIUS, OLSHAUSEN, &c.\]. The first
interpretation is, in our judgment, unnatural; the second, opposed to
the apostle's own teaching. But the case here put is, we think, such as
that of Cornelius (Acts 10:1-48), who, though outside the external pale
of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths
contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal
of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children,
though not called by the name of Abraham. Thus, this is but another way
of announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere
badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a
seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision (see on
[Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006)); and this interpretation is
confirmed by all that follows.

[Romans 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 2:28</span></span>

he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, &c.--In other words, the name of
"Jew" and the rite of "circumcision" were designed but as outward
symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world unto holy
devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation. Where this is
realized, the signs are full of significance; but where it is not, they
are worse than useless.

Note, (1) It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed and
fitted to melt only hardens the heart ([Rom
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004), and compare [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009); [Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)). (2) Amidst all the inequalities
of religious opportunity measured out to men, and the mysterious bearing
of this upon their character and destiny for eternity, the same great
principles of judgment, in a form suited to their respective discipline,
will be applied to all, and perfect equity will be seen to reign
throughout every stage of the divine administration ([Rom
2:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011)). (3) "The law written on the
heart" ([Rom 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014)) --or the Ethics
of Natural Theology--may be said to be the one deep foundation on which
all revealed religion reposes; and see on [Rom
1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019), where we have what we may
call its other foundation--the Physics and Metaphysics of Natural
Theology. The testimony of these two passages is to the theologian
invaluable, while in the breast of every teachable Christian it wakens
such deep echoes as are inexpressibly solemn and precious. (4) High
religious professions are a fearful aggravation of the inconsistencies
of such as make them ([Rom 2:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)).
See [Sa2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#014). (5) As no external
privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield the unholy from the
wrath of God, so neither will the want of them shut out from the kingdom
of heaven such as have experienced without them that change of heart
which the seals of God's covenant were designed to mark. In the sight of
the great Searcher of hearts, the Judge of quick and dead, the
renovation of the character in heart and life is all in all. In view of
this, have not all baptized, sacramented disciples of the Lord Jesus,
who "profess that they know God, but in works deny Him," need to
tremble--who, under the guise of friends, are "the enemies of the cross
of Christ?"
