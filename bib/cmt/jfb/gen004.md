### [Genesis Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 4:1</span></span>

BIRTH OF CAIN AND ABEL. (Gen. 4:1-26)

Eve said, I have gotten a man from the Lord--that is, "by the help of
the Lord"--an expression of pious gratitude--and she called him Cain,
that is, "a possession," as if valued above everything else; while the
arrival of another son reminding Eve of the misery she had entailed on
her offspring, led to the name Abel, that is, either weakness, vanity
([Psa 39:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#005).md), or grief, lamentation.
Cain and Abel were probably twins; and it is thought that, at this early
period, children were born in pairs ([Gen
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#004).md) \[CALVIN\].

[Genesis 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 4:2</span></span>

Abel was a keeper of sheep--literally, "a feeder of a flock," which, in
Oriental countries, always includes goats as well as sheep. Abel, though
the younger, is mentioned first, probably on account of the pre-eminence
of his religious character.

[Genesis 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 4:3</span></span>

in process of time--Hebrew, "at the end of days," probably on the
Sabbath.

brought . . . an offering unto the Lord--Both manifested, by the very
act of offering, their faith in the being of God and in His claims to
their reverence and worship; and had the kind of offering been left to
themselves, what more natural than that the one should bring "of the
fruits of the ground," and that the other should bring "of the
firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof" \[[Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)\].

[Genesis 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 4:4</span></span>

the Lord had respect unto Abel, not unto Cain, &c.--The words, "had
respect to," signify in Hebrew,--"to look at any thing with a keen
earnest glance," which has been translated, "kindle into a fire," so
that the divine approval of Abel's offering was shown in its being
consumed by fire (see [Gen 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017.md); [Jdg
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020).md).

[Genesis 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 4:7</span></span>

If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?--A better rendering is,
"Shalt thou not have the excellency"? which is the true sense of the
words referring to the high privileges and authority belonging to the
first-born in patriarchal times.

sin lieth at the door--sin, that is, a sin offering--a common meaning of
the word in Scripture (as in [Hos 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md);
[Co2 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). The purport of the divine
rebuke to Cain was this, "Why art thou angry, as if unjustly treated? If
thou doest well (that is, wert innocent and sinless) a thank offering
would have been accepted as a token of thy dependence as a creature. But
as thou doest not well (that is, art a sinner), a sin offering is
necessary, by bringing which thou wouldest have met with acceptance and
retained the honors of thy birthright." This language implies that
previous instructions had been given as to the mode of worship; Abel
offered through faith ([Heb 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#004).md).

unto thee shall be his desire--The high distinction conferred by
priority of birth is described ([Gen
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029).md); and it was Cain's conviction,
that this honor had been withdrawn from him, by the rejection of his
sacrifice, and conferred on his younger brother--hence the secret flame
of jealousy, which kindled into a settled hatred and fell revenge.

[Genesis 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 4:8</span></span>

And Cain talked with Abel his brother--Under the guise of brotherly
familiarity, he concealed his premeditated purpose till a convenient
time and place occurred for the murder ([Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md); [Jde
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#011).md).

[Genesis 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 4:9</span></span>

I know not--a falsehood. One sin leads to another.

[Genesis 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 4:10</span></span>

the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me--Cain, to lull
suspicion, had probably been engaging in the solemnities of religion
when he was challenged directly from the Shekinah itself.

[Genesis 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 4:11</span></span>

now art thou cursed from the earth--a curse superadded to the general
one denounced on the ground for Adam's sin.

[Genesis 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 4:12</span></span>

a fugitive--condemned to perpetual exile; a degraded outcast; the
miserable victim of an accusing conscience.

[Genesis 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 4:13</span></span>

And Cain said . . . My punishment is greater than I can bear--What an
overwhelming sense of misery; but no sign of penitence, nor cry for
pardon.

[Genesis 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 4:14</span></span>

every one that findeth me shall slay me--This shows that the population
of the world was now considerably increased.

[Genesis 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 4:15</span></span>

whosoever slayeth Cain--By a special act of divine forbearance, the life
of Cain was to be spared in the then small state of the human race.

set a mark--not any visible mark or brand on his forehead, but some sign
or token of assurance that his life would be preserved. This sign is
thought by the best writers to have been a wild ferocity of aspect that
rendered him an object of universal horror and avoidance.

[Genesis 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 4:16</span></span>

presence of the Lord--the appointed place of worship at Eden. Leaving
it, he not only severed himself from his relatives but forsook the
ordinances of religion, probably casting off all fear of God from his
eyes so that the last end of this man is worse than the first ([Mat
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045).md).

land of Nod--of flight or exile--thought by many to have been
Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a--which was cursed to sterility on his account.

[Genesis 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 4:17</span></span>

builded a city--It has been in cities that the human race has ever made
the greatest social progress; and several of Cain's descendants
distinguished themselves by their inventive genius in the arts.

[Genesis 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 4:19</span></span>

Lamech took unto him two wives--This is the first transgression of the
law of marriage on record, and the practice of polygamy, like all other
breaches of God's institutions, has been a fruitful source of corruption
and misery.

[Genesis 4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 4:23</span></span>

Lamech said unto his wives--This speech is in a poetical form, probably
the fragment of an old poem, transmitted to the time of Moses. It seems
to indicate that Lamech had slain a man in self-defense, and its drift
is to assure his wives, by the preservation of Cain, that an
unintentional homicide, as he was, could be in no danger.

[Genesis 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">gen 4:26</span></span>

men began to call upon the name of the Lord--rather, by the name of the
Lord. God's people, a name probably applied to them in contempt by the
world.
