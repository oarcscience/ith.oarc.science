### [2 Peter Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Peter 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe2 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS: EXHORTATION TO ALL GRACES, AS GOD HAS GIVEN US, IN THE
KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST, ALL THINGS PERTAINING TO LIFE: CONFIRMED BY THE
TESTIMONY OF APOSTLES, AND ALSO PROPHETS, TO THE POWER AND COMING OF
CHRIST. (2Pe. 1:1-21)

Simon--the Greek form: in oldest manuscripts, "Symeon" (Hebrew, that is,
"hearing), as in [Act 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md). His
mention of his original name accords with the design of this Second
Epistle, which is to warn against the coming false teachers, by setting
forth the true "knowledge" of Christ on the testimony of the original
apostolic eye-witnesses like himself. This was not required in the First
Epistle.

servant--"slave": so Paul, [Rom 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md).

to them, &c.--He addresses a wider range of readers (all believers) than
in the First Epistle, [Pe2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md), but
means to include especially those addressed in the First Epistle, as
[Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md) proves.

obtained--by grace. Applied by Peter to the receiving of the
apostleship, literally, "by allotment": as the Greek is, [Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md); [Joh
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024.md). They did not acquire it for
themselves; the divine election is as independent of man's control, as
the lot which is east forth.

like precious--"equally precious" to all: to those who believe, though
not having seen Christ, as well as to Peter and those who have seen Him.
For it lays hold of the same "exceeding great and precious promises,"
and the same "righteousness of God our Saviour." "The common salvation .
. . the faith once delivered unto the saints" ([Jde
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003).md).

with us--apostles and eye-witnesses ([Pe2
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#018).md). Though putting forward his
apostleship to enforce his exhortation, he with true humility puts
himself, as to "the faith," on a level with all other believers. The
degree of faith varies in different believers; but in respect to its
objects, present justification, sanctification, and future
glorification, it is common alike to all. Christ is to all believers
"made of God wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."

through--Greek, "in." Translate, as the one article to both nouns
requires, "the righteousness of Him who is (at once) our God and (our)
Saviour." Peter, confirming Pau;'s testimony to the same churches,
adopts Paul's inspired phraseology. The Gospel plan sets forth God's
righteousness, which is Christ's righteousness, in the brightest light.
Faith has its sphere IN it as its peculiar element: God is in redemption
"righteous," and at the same time a "Saviour"; compare [Isa
45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md), "a just God and a Saviour.

[2 Peter 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe2 1:2</span></span>

Grace . . . peace-- ([Pe1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md).

through--Greek, "in": the sphere IN which alone grace and peace can be
multiplied.

knowledge--Greek, "full knowledge."

of God, and of Jesus our Lord--The Father is here meant by "God," but
the Son in [Pe2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md) : marking how
entirely one the Father and Son are ([Joh
14:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007).md). The Vulgate omits "of God
and"; but oldest manuscripts support the words. Still the prominent
object of Peter's exhortation is "the knowledge of Jesus our Lord" (a
phrase only in [Rom 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024).md), and, only
secondarily, of the Father through Him ([Pe2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md); [Pe2
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020.md); [Pe2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#018).md).

[2 Peter 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe2 1:3</span></span>

According as, &c.--Seeing that \[ALFORD\]. "As He hath given us ALL
things (needful) for life and godliness, (so) do you give us ALL
diligence," &c. The oil and flame are given wholly of grace by God, and
"taken" by believers: their part henceforth is to "trim their lamps"
(compare [Pe2 1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md) with [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005), &c..md).

life and godliness--Spiritual life must exist first before there can be
true godliness. Knowledge of God experimentally is the first step to
life ([Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003).md). The child must have
vital breath. first, and then cry to, and walk in the ways of, his
father. It is not by godliness that we obtain life, but by life,
godliness. To life stands opposed corruption; to godliness, lust ([Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004).md).

called us-- ([Pe2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010).md); "calling"
([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009).md).

to glory and virtue--rather, "through (His) glory." Thus English Version
reads as one oldest manuscript. But other oldest manuscripts and Vulgate
read, "By His own (peculiar) glory and virtue"; being the explanation of
"His divine power"; glory and moral excellency (the same attribute is
given to God in [Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md), "praises,"
literally, "virtues") characterize God's "power." "Virtue," the standing
word in heathen ethics, is found only once in Paul ([Phi
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008).md), and in Peter in a distinct sense
from its classic usage; it (in the heathen sense) is a term too low and
earthly for expressing the gifts of the Spirit \[TRENCH, Greek Synonyms
of the New Testament\].

[2 Peter 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe2 1:4</span></span>

Whereby, &c.--By His glory and virtue: His glory making the "promises"
to be exceeding great; His virtue making them "precious" \[BENGEL\].
Precious promises are the object of precious faith.

given--The promises themselves are a gift: for God's promises are as
sure as if they were fulfilled.

by these--promises. They are the object of faith, and even now have a
sanctifying effect on the believer, assimilating him to God. Still more
so, when they shall be fulfilled.

might, &c.--Greek, "that ye MAY become partakers of the divine nature,"
even now in part; hereafter perfectly; [Jo1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), "We shall be like Him."

the divine nature--not God's essence, but His holiness, including His
"glory" and "virtue," [Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md); the
opposite to "corruption through lust." Sanctification is the imparting
to us of God Himself by the Holy Spirit in the soul. We by faith partake
also of the material nature of Jesus ([Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030).md). The "divine power" enables us
to be partakers of "the divine nature."

escaped the corruption--which involves in, and with itself, destruction
at last of soul and body; on "escaped" as from a condemned cell, compare
[Pe2 2:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#018.md); [Gen
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#017.md); [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md).

through--Greek, "in." "The corruption in the world" has its seat, not so
much in the surrounding elements, as in the "lust" or concupiscence of
men's hearts.

[2 Peter 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe2 1:5</span></span>

And beside this--rather, "And for this very reason," namely, "seeing
that His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life
and godliness" ([Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).md).

giving--literally, "introducing," side by side with God's gift, on your
part "diligence." Compare an instance, [Pe2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md); [Pe2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md); [Co2
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011.md).

all--all possible.

add--literally, "minister additionally," or, abundantly (compare Greek,
[Co2 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010).md); said properly of the one
who supplied all the equipments of a chorus. So accordingly, "there will
be ministered abundantly unto you an entrance into the everlasting
kingdom of our Saviour" ([Pe2 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011).md).

to--Greek, "in"; "in the possession of your faith, minister virtue.
Their faith (answering to "knowledge of Him," [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003).md) is presupposed as the gift of God
([Pe2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003.md); [Eph
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008).md), and is not required to be
ministered by us; in its exercise, virtue is to be, moreover,
ministered. Each grace being assumed, becomes the stepping stone to the
succeeding grace: and the latter in turn qualifies and completes the
former. Faith leads the band; love brings up the rear \[BENGEL\]. The
fruits of faith specified are seven, the perfect number.

virtue--moral excellency; manly, strenuous energy, answering to the
virtue (energetic excellency) of God.

and to--Greek, "in"; "and in (the exercise of) your virtue knowledge,"
namely, practical discrimination of good and evil; intelligent
appreciation of what is the will of God in each detail of practice.

[2 Peter 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe2 1:6</span></span>

Greek, "And in your knowledge self-control." In the exercise of
Christian knowledge or discernment of God's will, let there be the
practical fruit of self-control as to one's lusts and passions.
Incontinence weakens the mind; continence, or self-control, moves
weakness and imparts strength And in your self-control patient
endurance" amidst sufferings, so much dwelt on in the First Epistle,
second, third, and fourth chapters. "And in your patient endurance
godliness"; it is not to be mere stoical endurance, but united to \[and
flowing from\] God-trusting \[ALFORD\].

[2 Peter 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe2 1:7</span></span>

"And in your godliness brotherly kindness"; not suffering your godliness
to be moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind,
generous, and courteous \[ALFORD\]. Your natural affection and brotherly
kindness are to be sanctified by godliness. "And in your brotherly
kindness love," namely, to all men, even to enemies, in thought, word,
and deed. From brotherly kindness we are to go forward to love. Compare
[Th1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012.md), "Love one toward another
(brotherly kindness), and toward all men (charity)." So charity
completes the choir of graces in [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md). In a retrograde order, he who
has love will exercise brotherly kindness; he who has brotherly kindness
will feel godliness needful; the godly will mix nothing stoical with his
patience; to the patient, temperance is easy; the temperate weighs
things well, and so has knowledge; knowledge guards against sudden
impulse carrying away its virtue \[BENGEL\].

[2 Peter 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe2 1:8</span></span>

be--Greek, "subsist" that is, supposing these things to have an actual
subsistence in you; "be" would express the mere matter-of-fact being
([Act 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#020).md).

abound--more than in others; so the Greek.

make--"render," "constitute you," habitually, by the very fact of
possessing these graces.

barren--"inactive," and, as a field lying fallow and unworked (Greek),
so barren and useless.

unfruitful in--rather, . . . in respect to, "The full knowledge (Greek)
of Christ" is the goal towards which all these graces tend. As their
subsisting in us constitutes us not barren or idle, so their abounding
in us constitutes us not unfruitful in respect to it. It is through
doing His will, and so becoming like Him, that we grow in knowing Him
([Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md).

[2 Peter 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe2 1:9</span></span>

But--Greek, "For." Confirming the need of these graces ([Pe2
1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005).md) by the fatal consequences of
the want of them.

he that lacketh--Greek, "he to whom these are not present."

blind--as to the spiritual realities of the unseen world.

and cannot see afar off--explanatory of "blind." He closes his eyes
(Greek) as unable to see distant objects (namely, heavenly things), and
fixes his gaze on present and earthly things which alone he can see.
Perhaps a degree of wilfulness in the blindness is implied in the Greek,
"closing the eyes," which constitutes its culpability; hating and
rebelling against the light shining around him.

forgotten--Greek, "contracted forgetfulness," wilful and culpable
obliviousness.

that he was purged--The continually present sense of one's sins having
been once for all forgiven, is the strongest stimulus to every grace
([Psa 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004).md). This once-for-all
accomplished cleansing of unbelievers at their new birth is taught
symbolically by Christ, [Joh 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010.md),
Greek, "He that has been bathed (once for all) needeth not save to wash
his feet (of the soils contracted in the daily walk), but is clean every
whit (in Christ our righteousness)." "Once purged (with Christ's blood),
we should have no more consciousness of sin (as condemning us, [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002), because of God's promise.md)."
Baptism is the sacramental pledge of this.

[2 Peter 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe2 1:10</span></span>

Wherefore--seeking the blessed consequence of having, and the evil
effects of not having, these graces ([Pe2
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008).md).

the rather--the more earnestly.

brethren--marking that it is affection for them which constrains him so
earnestly to urge them. Nowhere else does he so address them, which
makes his calling them so here the more emphatical.

give diligence--The Greek aorist implies one lifelong effect \[ALFORD\].

to make--Greek middle voice; to make so far as it depends on you; to do
your part towards making. "To make" absolutely and finally is God's
part, and would be in the active.

your calling and election sure--by ministering additionally in your
faith virtue, and in your virtue knowledge, &c. God must work all these
graces in us, yet not so that we should be mere machines, but willing
instruments in His hands in making His election of us "secure." The
ensuring of our election is spoken of not in respect to God, whose
counsel is steadfast and everlasting, but in respect to our part. There
is no uncertainty on His part, but on ours the only security is our
faith in His promise and the fruits of the Spirit ([Pe2
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md), [Pe2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011).md). Peter subjoins election to
calling, because the calling is the effect and proof of God's election,
which goes before and is the main thing ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md), [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md), [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md), where God's "elect" are those
"predestinated," and election is "His purpose," according to which He
"called" them). We know His calling before His election, thereby calling
is put first.

fall--Greek, "stumble" and fall finally ([Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011).md). Metaphor from one stumbling in
a race ([Co1 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024).md).

[2 Peter 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe2 1:11</span></span>

an entrance--rather as Greek, "the entrance" which ye look for.

ministered--the same verb as in [Pe2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md). Minister in your faith virtue and
the other graces, so shall there be ministered to you the entrance into
that heaven where these graces shine most brightly. The reward of grace
hereafter shall correspond to the work of grace here.

abundantly--Greek, "richly." It answers to "abound," [Pe2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md). If these graces abound in you,
you shall have your entrance into heaven not merely "scarcely" (as he
had said, [Pe1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018).md), nor "so as by
fire," like one escaping with life after having lost all his goods, but
in triumph without "stumbling and falling."

[2 Peter 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe2 1:12</span></span>

Wherefore--as these graces are so necessary to your abundant entrance
into Christ's kingdom ([Pe2 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010).md).

I will not be negligent--The oldest manuscripts read, "I will be about
always to put you in remembrance" (an accumulated future: I will regard
you as always needing to be reminded): compare "I will endeavor," [Pe2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015.md). "I will be sure always to remind
you" \[ALFORD\]. "Always"; implying the reason why he writes the second
Epistle so soon after the first. He feels there is likely to be more and
more need of admonition on account of the increasing corruption ([Pe2
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001).md).

in the present truth--the Gospel truth now present with you: formerly
promised to Old Testament believers as about to be, now in the New
Testament actually present with, and in, believers, so that they are
"established" in it as a "present" reality. Its importance renders
frequent monitions never superfluous: compare Paul's similar apology,
[Rom 15:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md).

[2 Peter 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe2 1:13</span></span>

Yea--Greek, "But"; though "you know" the truth ([Pe2
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012).md).

this tabernacle--soon to be taken down ([Co2
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001).md): I therefore need to make the
most of my short time for the good of Christ's Church. The zeal of Satan
against it, the more intense as his time is short, ought to stimulate
Christians on the same ground.

by--Greek, "in" (compare [Pe2 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001).md).

[2 Peter 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe2 1:14</span></span>

shortly I must put off--Greek, "the putting off (as a garment) of my
tabernacle is speedy": implying a soon approaching, and also a sudden
death (as a violent death is). Christ's words, [Joh
21:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#018.md), "When thou art old," &c.,
were the ground of his "knowing," now that he was old, that his foretold
martyrdom was near. Compare as to Paul, [Ti2
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md). Though a violent death, he calls
it a "departure" (Greek for "decease," [Pe2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015).md), compare [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md).

[2 Peter 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe2 1:15</span></span>

endeavour--"use my diligence": the same Greek word as in [Pe2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#010.md) : this is the field in which my
diligence has scope. Peter thus fulfils Christ's charge, "Feed My sheep"
([Joh 21:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016).md).

decease--"departure." The very word ("exodus") used in the
Transfiguration, Moses and Elias conversing about Christ's decease
(found nowhere else in the New Testament, but [Heb
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#022.md), "the departing of Israel" out
of Egypt, to which the saints' deliverance from the present bondage of
corruption answers). "Tabernacle" is another term found here as well as
there ([Luk 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031.md), [Luk
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033).md): an undesigned coincidence
confirming Peter's authorship of this Epistle.

that ye may be able--by the help of this written Epistle; and perhaps
also of Mark's Gospel, which Peter superintended.

always--Greek, "on each occasion": as often as occasion may require.

to have . . . in remembrance--Greek, "to exercise remembrance of." Not
merely "to remember," as sometimes we do, things we care not about; but
"have them in (earnest) remembrance," as momentous and precious truths.

[2 Peter 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe2 1:16</span></span>

For--reason why he is so earnest that the remembrance of these things
should be continued after his death.

followed--out in detail.

cunningly devised--Greek, "devised by (man's) wisdom"; as distinguished
from what the Holy Ghost teaches (compare [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013).md). But compare also [Pe2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#003.md), "feigned words."

fables--as the heathen mythologies, and the subsequent Gnostic "fables
and genealogies," of which the germs already existed in the junction of
Judaism with Oriental philosophy in Asia Minor. A precautionary protest
of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel history
being myth.

when we made known unto you--not that Peter himself had personally
taught the churches in Pontus, Galatia, &c., but he was one of the
apostles whose testimony was borne to them, and to the Church in
general, to whom this Epistle is addressed ([Pe2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#001.md), including, but not restricted, as
First Peter, to the churches in Pontus, &c.).

power--the opposite of "fables"; compare the contrast of "word" and
"power," [Co1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#020.md). A specimen of His
power was given at the Transfiguration also of His "coming" again, and
its attendant glory. The Greek for "coming" is always used of His second
advent. A refutation of the scoffers ([Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).md): I, James and John, saw with our
own eyes a mysterious sample of His coming glory.

were--Greek, "were made."

eye-witnesses--As initiated spectators of mysteries (so the Greek), we
were admitted into His innermost secrets, namely, at the
Transfiguration.

his--emphatical (compare Greek): "THAT great ONE'S majesty."

[2 Peter 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe2 1:17</span></span>

received . . . honour--in the voice that spake to Him.

glory--in the light which shone around Him.

came--Greek, "was borne": the same phrase occurs only in [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md); one of several instances showing
that the argument against the authenticity of this Second Epistle, from
its dissimilarity of style as compared with First Peter, is not well
founded.

such a voice--as he proceeds to describe.

from the excellent glory--rather as Greek, "by (that is, uttered by) the
magnificent glory (that is, by God: as His glorious manifested presence
is often called by the Hebrews "the Glory," compare "His Excellency,"
[Deu 33:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#026.md); [Psa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#005).md)."

in whom--Greek, "in regard to whom" (accusative case); but [Mat
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005), "in whom" (dative case.md) centers
and rests My good pleasure. Peter also omits, as not required by his
purpose, "hear Him," showing his independence in his inspired testimony.

I am--Greek aorist, past time, "My good pleasure rested from eternity."

which came--rather as Greek, "we heard borne from heaven."

holy mount--as the Transfiguration mount came to be regarded, on account
of the manifestation of Christ's divine glory there.

we--emphatical: we, James and John, as well as myself.

We--all believers.

a more sure--rather as Greek, "we have the word of prophecy more sure
(confirmed)." Previously we knew its sureness by faith, but, through
that visible specimen of its hereafter entire fulfilment, assurance is
made doubly sure. Prophecy assures us that Christ's sufferings, now
past, are to be followed by Christ's glory, still future: the
Transfiguration gives us a pledge to make our faith still stronger, that
"the day" of His glory will "dawn" ere long. He does not mean to say
that "the word of prophecy," or Scripture, is surer than the voice of
God heard at the Transfiguration, as English Version; for this is
plainly not the fact. The fulfilment of prophecy so far in Christ's
history makes us the surer of what is yet to be fulfilled, His
consummated glory. The word was the "lamp (Greek for 'light') heeded" by
Old Testament believers, until a gleam of the "day dawn" was given at
Christ's first coming, and especially in His Transfiguration. So the
word is a lamp to us still, until "the day" burst forth fully at the
second coming of "the Sun of righteousness." The day, when it dawns upon
you, makes sure the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly,
the objects revealed by the lamp.

whereunto--to which word of prophecy, primarily the Old Testament in
Peter's day; but now also in our day the New Testament, which, though
brighter than the Old Testament (compare [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008), end.md), is but a lamp even still as
compared with the brightness of the eternal day (compare [Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002).md). Oral teachings and traditions of
ministers are to be tested by the written word ([Act
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011).md).

dark--The Greek implies squalid, having neither water nor light: such
spiritually is the world without, and the smaller world (microcosm)
within, the heart in its natural state. Compare the "dry places" [Luk
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#024.md) (namely, unwatered by the
Spirit), through which the unclean spirit goeth.

dawn--bursting through the darkness.

day star--Greek, the morning star," as [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md). The Lord Jesus.

in your hearts--Christ's arising in the heart by His Spirit giving full
assurance, creates spiritually full day in the heart, the means to which
is prayerfully giving heed to the word. This is associated with the
coming of the day of the Lord, as being the earnest of it. Indeed, even
our hearts shall not fully realize Christ in all His unspeakable glory
and felt presence, until He shall come ([Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002).md). [Isa
66:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014.md), "When you see this, your
heart shall rejoice . . . For, behold, the Lord will come." However,
TREGELLES' punctuation is best, "whereunto ye do well to take heed (as
unto a light shining in a dark place, until the day have dawned and the
morning star arisen) in your hearts." For the day has already dawned in
the heart of believers; what they wait for is its visible manifestation
at Christ's coming.

[2 Peter 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe2 1:20</span></span>

"Forasmuch as ye know this" ([Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md).

first--the foremost consideration in studying the word of prophecy.
Laying it down as a first principle never to be lost sight of.

is--Greek, not the simple verb, to be, but to begin to be, "proves to
be," "becometh." No prophecy is found to be the result of "private (the
mere individual writer's uninspired) interpretation" (solution), and so
origination. The Greek noun epilusis, does not mean in itself
origination; but that which the sacred writer could not always fully
interpret, though being the speaker or writer (as [Pe1
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010) implies.md), was plainly not of
his own, but of God's disclosure, origination, and inspiration, as Peter
proceeds to add, "But holy men . . . spake (and afterwards wrote) . . .
moved by the Holy Ghost": a reason why ye should "give" all "heed" to
it. The parallelism to [Pe2 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016.md) shows
that "private interpretation," contrasted with "moved by the Holy
Ghost," here answers to "fables devised by (human) wisdom," contrasted
with "we were eye-witnesses of His majesty," as attested by the "voice
from God." The words of the prophetical (and so of all) Scripture
writers were not mere words of the individuals, and therefore to be
interpreted by them, but of "the Holy Ghost" by whom they were "moved."
"Private" is explained, [Pe2 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md), "by
the will of man" (namely, the individual writer). In a secondary sense
the text teaches also, as the word is the Holy Spirit's, it cannot be
interpreted by its readers (any more than by its writers) by their mere
private human powers, but by the teaching of the Holy Ghost ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014).md). "He who is the author of
Scripture is its supreme interpreter" \[GERHARD\]. ALFORD translates,
"springs not out of human interpretation," that is, is not a
prognostication made by a man knowing what he means when he utters it,
but," &c. ([Joh 11:49-52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049).md). Rightly:
except that the verb is rather, doth become, or prove to be. It not
being of private interpretation, you must "give heed" to it, looking for
the Spirit's illumination "in your hearts" (compare Note, see on [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019).md).

[2 Peter 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe2 1:21</span></span>

came not in old time--rather, "was never at any time borne" (to us).

by the will of man--alone. [Jer 23:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026.md),
"prophets of the deceit of their own heart." Compare [Pe2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md), "willingly."

holy--One oldest manuscript has, "men FROM God": the emissaries from
God. "Holy," if read, will mean because they had the Holy Spirit.

moved--Greek, "borne" (along) as by a mighty wind: [Act
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#002), "rushing (the same Greek.md) wind":
rapt out of themselves: still not in fanatical excitement ([Co1
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032).md). The Hebrew "nabi," "prophet,"
meant an announcer or interpreter of God: he, as God's spokesman,
interpreted not his own "private" will or thought, but God's "Man of the
Spirit" ([Hos 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007), Margin.md). "Thou
testifiedst by Thy Spirit in Thy prophets." "Seer," on the other hand,
refers to the mode of receiving the communications from God, rather than
to the utterance of them to others. "Spake" implies that, both in its
original oral announcement, and now even when in writing, it has been
always, and is, the living voice of God speaking to us through His
inspired servants. Greek, "borne (along)" forms a beautiful antithesis
to "was borne." They were passive, rather than active instruments. The
Old Testament prophets primarily, but including also all the inspired
penmen, whether of the New or Old Testament ([Pe2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#002).md).
