### [1 Corinthians Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 9:1</span></span>

HE CONFIRMS HIS TEACHING AS TO NOT PUTTING A STUMBLING-BLOCK IN A
BROTHER'S WAY ([Co1 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013)) BY HIS OWN
EXAMPLE IN NOT USING HIS UNDOUBTED RIGHTS AS AN APOSTLE, SO AS TO WIN
MEN TO CHRIST. (1Co. 9:1-27)

Am I not an apostle? am I not free?--The oldest manuscripts read the
order thus, "Am I not free? am I not an apostle?" He alludes to [Co1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009), "this liberty of yours": If you
claim it, I appeal to yourselves as the witnesses, have not I also it?
"Am I not free?" If you be so, much more I. For "am I not an apostle?"
so that I can claim not only Christian, but also apostolic, liberty.

have I not seen Jesus--corporeally, not in a mere vision: compare [Co1
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008), where the fact of the
resurrection, which he wishes to prove, could only be established by an
actual bodily appearance, such as was vouchsafed to Peter and the other
apostles. In [Act 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007), [Act
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017) the contrast between "the men
with him seeing no man," and "Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way,"
shows that Jesus actually appeared to him in going to Damascus. His
vision of Christ in the temple ([Act
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017)) was "in a trance." To be a
witness of Christ's resurrection was a leading function of an apostle
([Act 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022)). The best manuscripts omit
"Christ."

ye my work in the Lord--Your conversion is His workmanship ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010)) through my instrumentality: the
"seal of mine apostleship" ([Co1 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002)).

[1 Corinthians 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 9:2</span></span>

yet doubtless--yet at least I am such to you.

seal of mine apostleship--Your conversion by my preaching, accompanied
with miracles ("the signs of an apostle," [Rom
15:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018); [Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012)), and your gifts conferred by me
([Co1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007)), vouch for the reality of
my apostleship, just as a seal set to a document attests its genuineness
([Joh 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033); [Rom
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011)).

[1 Corinthians 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 9:3</span></span>

to them that . . . examine me--that is, who call in question mine
apostleship.

is this--namely, that you are the seal of mine apostleship.

[1 Corinthians 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 9:4</span></span>

Have we not power--Greek, "right," or lawful power, equivalent to
"liberty" claimed by the Corinthians ([Co1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009)). The "we" includes with himself
his colleagues in the apostleship. The Greek interrogative expresses,
"You surely won't say (will you?) that we have not the power or right,"
&c.

eat and drink--without laboring with our hands ([Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011), [Co1
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)). Paul's not exercising this
right was made a plea by his opponents for insinuating that he was
himself conscious he was no true apostle ([Co2
12:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#013)).

[1 Corinthians 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 9:5</span></span>

lead about a sister, a wife--that is, "a sister as a wife"; "a sister"
by faith, which makes all believers brethren and sisters in the one
family of God: "a wife" by marriage covenant. Paul implies he did not
exercise his undoubted right to marry and "lead about" a believer, for
the sake of Christian expediency, as well to save the Church the expense
of maintaining her in his wide circuits, as also that he might give
himself more undistractedly to building up the Church of Christ ([Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026), [Co1
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#032), [Co1
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035)). Contrast the Corinthians' want
of self-sacrifice in the exercise of their "liberty" at the cost of
destroying, instead of edifying, the Church ([Co1
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009), Margin; [Co1
8:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010)).

as other apostles--implying that some of them had availed themselves of
the power which they all had, of marrying. We know from [Mat
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014), that Cephas (Peter) was a
married man. A confutation of Peter's self-styled followers, the
Romanists, who exclude the clergy from marriage. CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA
\[Miscellanies, 7.63\] records a tradition that he encouraged his wife
when being led to death by saying, "Remember, my dear one, the Lord."
Compare EUSEBIUS \[Eccleiastical History, 3.30\].

brethren of the Lord--held in especial esteem on account of their
relationship to Jesus ([Act 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014); [Gal
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009)). James, Joses, Simon, and Judas.
Probably cousins of Jesus: as cousins were termed by the Jews
"brethren." ALFORD makes them literally brothers of Jesus by Joseph and
Mary.

Cephas--probably singled out as being a name carrying weight with one
partisan section at Corinth. "If your favorite leader does so, surely so
may I" ([Co1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012); [Co1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#022)).

[1 Corinthians 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 9:6</span></span>

Barnabas--long the associate of Paul, and, like him, in the habit of
self-denyingly forbearing to claim the maintenance which is a minister's
right. So Paul supported himself by tent-making ([Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003); [Act
20:34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034); [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008)).

[1 Corinthians 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 9:7</span></span>

The minister is spiritually a soldier ([Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003)), a vine-dresser ([Co1
3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006); [Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)), and a shepherd ([Pe1
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#002), [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)).

of the fruit--The oldest manuscripts omit "of."

[1 Corinthians 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 9:8</span></span>

as a man--I speak thus not merely according to human judgment, but with
the sanction of the divine law also.

[1 Corinthians 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 9:9</span></span>

ox . . . treadeth . . . corn-- ([Deu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)). In the East to the present day
they do not after reaping carry the sheaves home to barns as we do, but
take them to an area under the open air to be threshed by the oxen
treading them with their feet, or else drawing a threshing instrument
over them (compare [Mic 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#013)).

Doth God . . . care for oxen?--rather, "Is it for the oxen that God
careth?" Is the animal the ultimate object for whose sake this law was
given? No. God does care for the lower animal ([Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006); [Mat
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029)), but it is with the ultimate
aim of the welfare of man, the head of animal creation. In the humane
consideration shown for the lower animal, we are to learn that still
more ought it to be exercised in the case of man, the ultimate object of
the law; and that the human (spiritual as well as temporal) laborer is
worthy of his hire.

[1 Corinthians 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 9:10</span></span>

altogether--Join this with "saith." "Does he (the divine lawgiver) by
all means say it for our sakes?" It would be untrue, that God saith it
altogether (in the sense of solely) for our sakes. But it is true, that
He by all means saith it for our sakes as the ultimate object in the
lower world. GROTIUS, however, translates, "mainly" or "especially,"
instead of altogether.

that--"meaning that" \[ALFORD\]; literally, "because."

should plough--ought to plough in hope. The obligation rests with the
people not to let their minister labor without remuneration.

he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope--The oldest
manuscript versions and Fathers read, "He that thresheth (should or
ought to thresh) in the hope of partaking" (namely, of the fruit of his
threshing). "He that plougheth," spiritually, is the first planter of a
church in a place (compare [Co1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006),
[Co1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009)); "he that thresheth," the
minister who tends a church already planted.

[1 Corinthians 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 9:11</span></span>

we . . . we--emphatical in the Greek. WE, the same persons who have sown
to you the infinitely more precious treasures of the Spirit, may at
least claim in return what is the only thing you have to give, namely,
the goods that nourish the flesh ("your carnal things").

[1 Corinthians 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 9:12</span></span>

others--whether true apostles ([Co1
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)) or false ones ([Co2
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#020)).

we rather--considering our greater labors for you ([Co2
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)).

suffer all things--without complaining of it. We desire to conceal
(literally, "hold as a water-tight vessel") any distress we suffer from
straitened circumstances. The same Greek is in [Co1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#007).

lest we . . . hinder . . . gospel--not to cause a hindrance to its
progress by giving a handle for the imputation of self-seeking, if we
received support from our flock. The less of incumbrance and expense
caused to the Church, and the more of work done, the better for the
cause of the Gospel ([Ti2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 9:13</span></span>

minister about holy things--the Jewish priests and Levites. The Greek
especially applies to the former, the priests offering sacrifices.

partakers with the altar--a part of the victims going to the service of
the altar, and the rest being shared by the priests ([Lev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#006); [Num
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#006), &c.; [Deu
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001), &c.).

[1 Corinthians 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 9:14</span></span>

Even so--The only inference to be drawn from this passage is, not that
the Christian ministry is of a sacrificial character as the Jewish
priesthood, but simply, that as the latter was supported by the
contributions of the people, so should the former. The stipends of the
clergy were at first from voluntary offerings at the Lord's Supper. At
the love-feast preceding it every believer, according to his ability,
offered a gift; and when the expense of the table had been defrayed, the
bishop laid aside a portion for himself, the presbyters, and deacons;
and with the rest relieved widows, orphans, confessors, and the poor
generally \[TERTULLIAN, Apology, 39\]. The stipend was in proportion to
the dignity and merits of the several bishops, presbyters, and deacons
\[CYPRIAN, c. 4, ep. 6\].

preach . . . gospel--plainly marked as the duty of the Christian
minister, in contrast to the ministering about sacrifices (Greek) and
waiting at the altar of the Jewish priesthood and Levites ([Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)). If the Lord's Supper were a
sacrifice (as the Mass is supposed to be), this fourteenth verse would
certainly have been worded so, to answer to [Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013). Note the same Lord Christ
"ordains" the ordinances in the Old and in the New Testaments ([Mat
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010); [Luk
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007)).

[1 Corinthians 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 9:15</span></span>

Paul's special gift of continency, which enabled him to abstain from
marriage, and his ability to maintain himself without interrupting
seriously his ministry, made that expedient to him which is ordinarily
inexpedient; namely, that the ministry should not be supported by the
people. What to him was a duty, would be the opposite to one, for
instance, to whom God had committed a family, without other means of
support.

I have used none of these things--none of these "powers" or rights which
I might have used ([Co1 9:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#004), [Co1
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#012)).

neither--rather, "Yet I have not written."

so done unto me--literally, "in my case": as is done in the case of a
soldier, a planter, a shepherd, a ploughman, and a sacrificing priest
([Co1 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007), [Co1
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#010), [Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)).

make my glorying void--deprive me of my privilege of preaching the
Gospel without remuneration ([Co2
11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#007)). Rather than hinder the
progress of the Gospel by giving any pretext for a charge of interested
motives ([Co2 12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#017)), Paul would
"die" of hunger. Compare Abraham's similar disinterestedness ([Gen
14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022)).

[1 Corinthians 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 9:16</span></span>

though I preach . . . I have nothing to glory of--that is, If I preach
the Gospel, and do so not gratuitously, I have no matter for "glorying."
For the "necessity" that is laid on me to preach (compare [Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009), and the case of Jonah) does away
with ground for "glorying." The sole ground for the latter that I have,
is my preaching without charge ([Co1
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018)): since there is no necessity
laid on me as to the latter, it is my voluntary act for the Gospel's
sake.

[1 Corinthians 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co1 9:17</span></span>

Translate, "If I be doing this (that is, preaching) of my own accord
(which I am not, for the 'necessity' is laid on me which binds a servant
to obey his master), I have a reward; but if (as is the case)
involuntarily ([Act 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015); [Act
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015); [Act
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016)); not of my own natural will,
but by the constraining grace of God; ([Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016); [Ti1
1:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)), I have had a dispensation
(of the Gospel) entrusted to me" (and so can claim no "reward," seeing
that I only "have done that which was my duty to do," [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010), but incur the "woe," [Co1
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016), if I fail in it).

[1 Corinthians 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 9:18</span></span>

What is my reward?--The answer is in [Co1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019); namely, that by making the
Gospel without charge, where I might have rightfully claimed
maintenance, I might "win the more."

of Christ--The oldest manuscripts and versions omit these words.

abuse--rather "that I use not to the full my power." This is his matter
for "glorying"; the "reward" ultimately aimed at is the gaining of the
more ([Co1 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019)). The former, as
involving the latter, is verbally made the answer to the question, "What
is my reward?" But really the "reward" is that which is the ultimate aim
of his preaching without charge, namely, that he may gain the more; it
was for this end, not to have matter of glorying, that he did so.

[1 Corinthians 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co1 9:19</span></span>

free from all men--that is, from the power of all men.

gain the more--that is, as many of them ("all men") as possible. "Gain"
is an appropriate expression in relation to a "reward" ([Th1
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019)); he therefore repeats it
frequently ([Co1 9:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020)).

[1 Corinthians 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 9:20</span></span>

I became as a Jew--in things not defined by the law, but by Jewish
usage. Not Judaizing in essentials, but in matters where there was no
compromise of principle (compare [Act
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003); [Act
21:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020)); an undesigned coincidence
between the history and the Epistle, and so a sure proof of genuineness.

to them that are under the law, as under the law--in things defined by
the law; such as ceremonies not then repugnant to Christianity. Perhaps
the reason for distinguishing this class from the former is that Paul
himself belonged nationally to "the Jews," but did not in creed belong
to the class of "them that are under the law." This view is confirmed by
the reading inserted here by the oldest manuscripts, versions, and
Fathers, "not being (that is, parenthetically, 'not that I am') myself
under the law."

[1 Corinthians 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 9:21</span></span>

To them . . . without law--that is, without revealed law: the heathen
(compare [Rom 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012) with [Co1
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015)).

as without law--not urging on them the ceremonies and "works of the
law," but "the hearing of faith" ([Gal
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002)). Also discoursing in their own
manner, as at Athens, with arguments from their own poets ([Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028)).

being not without law to God--"While thus conforming to others in
matters indifferent, taking care not to be without law in relation to
God, but responsible to law (literally, "IN LAW") in relation to
Christ." This is the Christian's true position in relation to the world,
to himself, and to God. Everything develops itself according to its
proper law. So the Christian, though no longer subject to the literal
law as constraining him from without, is subject to an inward principle
or law, the spirit of faith in Christ acting from within as the germ of
a new life. He does not in the Greek (as in English Version) say "under
the law (as he does in [Co1 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020)) to
Christ"; but uses the milder term, "in . . . law," responsible to law.
Christ was responsible to the law for us, so that we are no longer
responsible to it ([Gal 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013), [Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024)), but to Him, as the members to
the Head ([Co1 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022); [Rom
8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001); [Pe1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016)). Christians serve Christ in
newness of spirit, no longer in oldness of the letter (that is, the old
external law as such), [Rom 7:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004). To
Christ, as man's Head, the Father has properly delegated His authority
([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027)); whence here he substitutes
"Christ" for "God" in the second clause, "not without law to God, but
under the law to Christ." The law of Christ is the law of love ([Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002); compare [Gal
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#013)).

[1 Corinthians 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 9:22</span></span>

gain the weak--that is, establish, instead of being a stumbling-block to
inexperienced Christians ([Co1 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#007))
[Rom 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001), "Weak in the faith." ALFORD
thinks the "weak" are not Christians at all, for these have been already
"won"; but those outside the Church, who are yet "without strength" to
believe ([Rom 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006)). But when "weak"
Christians are by the condescending love of stronger brethren kept from
falling from faith, they are well said to be "gained" or won.

by all means . . . some--The gain of even "some" is worth the
expenditure of "all means." He conformed himself to the feelings of each
in the several classes, that out of them all he might gain some.

[1 Corinthians 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 9:23</span></span>

partaker thereof--Greek, "fellow partaker": of the Gospel blessings
promised at Christ's coming: "with" (not as English Version, "you": but)
them, namely, with those thus "gained" by me to the Gospel.

[1 Corinthians 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 9:24</span></span>

Know ye not--The Isthmian games, in which the foot race was a leading
one, were of course well known, and a subject of patriotic pride to the
Corinthians, who lived in the immediate neighborhood. These periodical
games were to the Greeks rather a passion than a mere amusement: hence
their suitableness as an image of Christian earnestness.

in a race--Greek, "in a race course."

all . . . one--Although we knew that one alone could be saved, still it
Would be well worth our while to run \[BENGEL\]. Even in the Christian
race not "all" who enter on the race win ([Co1
10:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001)).

So run, that ye may obtain--said parenthetically. These are the words in
which the instructors of the young in the exercise schools (gymnasia)
and the spectators on the race course exhorted their pupils to stimulate
them to put forth all exertions. The gymnasium was a prominent feature
in every Greek city. Every candidate had to take an oath that he had
been ten months in training, and that he would violate none of the
regulations ([Ti2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005); compare [Ti1
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007)). He lived on a strict
self-denying diet, refraining from wine and pleasant foods, and enduring
cold and heat and most laborious discipline. The "prize" awarded by the
judge or umpire was a chaplet of green leaves; at the Isthmus, those of
the indigenous pine, for which parsley leaves were temporarily
substituted ([Co1 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025)). The Greek for
"obtain" is fully obtain. It is in vain to begin, unless we persevere to
the end ([Mat 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022); [Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)). The "so" expresses, Run with
such perseverance in the heavenly course, as "all" the runners exhibit
in the earthly "race" just spoken of: to the end that ye may attain the
prize.

[1 Corinthians 9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025)

striveth--in wrestling: a still more severe contest than the foot race.

is temperate--So Paul exercised self-denial, abstaining from claiming
sustenance for the sake of the "reward," namely, to "gain the more"
([Co1 9:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#018)).

corruptible--soon withering, as being only of fir leaves taken from the
fir groves which surrounded the Isthmian race course or stadium.

incorruptible-- ([Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004); [Pe1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004); [Rev
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010)). "Crown" here is not that of a
king (which is expressed by a different Greek word, namely, "diadem"),
but a wreath or garland.

[1 Corinthians 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">co1 9:26</span></span>

I--Paul returns to his main subject, his own self-denial, and his motive
in it.

run, not as uncertainly--not as a runner uncertain of the goal. Ye
Corinthians gain no end in your entering idol temples or eating idol
meats. But I, for my part, in all my acts, whether in my becoming "all
things to all men," or in receiving no sustenance from my converts, have
a definite end in view, namely, to "gain the more." I know what 1 aim
at, and how to aim at it. He who runs with a clear aim, looks
straightforward to the goal, makes it his sole aim, casts away every
encumbrance ([Heb 12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#001)), is
indifferent to what the by-standers say, and sometimes even a fall only
serves to rouse him the more \[BENGEL\].

not as one that beateth the air--instead of beating the adversary.
Alluding to the sciamachia or sparring in the school in sham-fight
(compare [Co1 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#009)), wherein they
struck out into the air as if at an imaginary adversary. The real
adversary is Satan acting on us through the flesh.

[1 Corinthians 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">co1 9:27</span></span>

keep under--literally, "bruise the face under the eyes," so as to render
it black and blue; so, to chastise in the most sensitive part. Compare
"mortify the deeds of the body," [Rom
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013); also [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011). It is not ascetic fasts or
macerations of the body which are here recommended, but the keeping
under of our natural self-seeking, so as, like Paul, to lay ourselves
out entirely for the great work.

my body--the old man and the remainders of lust in my flesh. "My body,"
so far as by the flesh it opposes the spirit \[ESTIUS\] ([Gal
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017)). Men may be severe to their
bodies and yet indulge their lust. Ascetic "neglect of the body" may be
all the while a more subtile "satisfying of the flesh" ([Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)). Unless the soul keep the body
under, the body will get above the soul. The body may be made a good
servant, but is a bad master.

bring it into subjection--or bondage, as a slave or servant led away
captive; so the Greek.

preached--literally, "heralded." He keeps up the image from the races.
The heralds summoned the candidates for the foot race into the race
course \[PLATO, Laws, 8.833\], and placed the crowns on the brows of the
conquerors, announcing their names \[BENGEL\]. They probably proclaimed
also the laws of the combat; answering to the preaching of the apostles
\[ALFORD\]. The The Christian herald is also a combatant, in which
respect he is distinguished from the herald at the games.

a castaway--failing shamefully of the prize myself, after I have called
others to the contest. Rejected by God, the Judge of the Christian race,
notwithstanding my having, by my preaching, led others to be accepted.
Compare the equivalent term, "reprobate," [Jer
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#030); [Co2
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#006). Paul implies, if such earnest,
self-denying watchfulness over himself be needed still, with all his
labors for others, to make his own calling sure, much more is the same
needed by the Corinthians, instead of their going, as they do, to the
extreme limit of Christian liberty.
