### [Isaiah Chapter 63](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 63:1</span></span>

MESSIAH COMING AS THE AVENGER, IN ANSWER TO HIS PEOPLE'S PRAYERS. (Isa.
63:1-19)

Who--the question of the prophet in prophetic vision.

dyed--scarlet with blood ([Isa 63:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md);
[Rev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013).md).

Bozrah--(See on [Isa 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md).

travelling--rather, stately; literally, "throwing back the head"
\[GESENIUS\].

speak in righteousness--answer of Messiah. I, who have in faithfulness
given a promise of deliverance, am now about to fulfil it. Rather, speak
of righteousness ([Isa 45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019.md); [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013).md); salvation being meant as the
result of His "righteousness" \[MAURER\].

save--The same Messiah that destroys the unbeliever saves the believer.

[Isaiah 63:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 63:2</span></span>

The prophet asks why His garments are "dyed" and "red."

winefat--rather, the "wine-press," wherein the grapes were trodden with
the feet; the juice would stain the garment of him who trod them ([Rev
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md). The image was appropriate, as
the country round Bozrah abounded in grapes. This final blow inflicted
by Messiah and His armies ([Rev
19:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013).md) shall decide His claim to
the kingdoms u surped by Satan, and by the "beast," to whom Satan
delegates his power. It will be a day of judgment to the hostile
Gentiles, as His first coming was a day of judgment to the unbelieving
Jews.

[Isaiah 63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 63:3</span></span>

Reply of Messiah. For the image, see [Lam
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md). He "treads the wine-press" here
not as a sufferer, but as an inflicter of vengeance.

will tread . . . shall be . . . will stain--rather preterites, "I trod .
. . trampled . . . was sprinkled . . . I stained."

blood--literally, "spirited juice" of the grape, pressed out by treading
\[GESENIUS\].

[Isaiah 63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 63:4</span></span>

is--rather, "was." This assigns the reason why He has thus destroyed the
foe ([Zep 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#008).md).

my redeemed--My people to be redeemed.

day . . . year--here, as in [Isa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md);
[Isa 61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md), the time of "vengeance" is
described as a "day"; that of grace and of "recompense" to the
"redeemed," as a "year."

[Isaiah 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 63:5</span></span>

The same words as in [Isa 59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016.md),
except that there it is His "righteousness," here it is His "fury,"
which is said to have upheld Him.

[Isaiah 63:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 63:6</span></span>

Rather, preterites, "I trod down . . . made them drunk." The same image
occurs [Isa 51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md), [Isa
51:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#021.md); [Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); [Jer
25:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md).

will bring down . . . strength to . . . earth--rather, "I spilled their
life-blood (the same Hebrew words as in [Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003).md) on the earth" \[LOWTH and
Septuagint\].

[Isaiah 63:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 63:7</span></span>

Israel's penitential confession and prayer for restoration ([Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020).md), extending from Isa.
63:7-64:12.

loving-kindnesses . . . praises . . . mercies . . .
loving-kindnesses--The plurals and the repetitions imply that language
is inadequate to express the full extent of God's goodness.

us--the dispersed Jews at the time just preceding their final
restoration.

house of Israel--of all ages; God was good not merely to the Jews now
dispersed, but to Israel in every age of its history.

[Isaiah 63:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 63:8</span></span>

he--Jehovah "said," that is, thought, in choosing them as His
covenant-people; so "said" ([Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010).md). Not that God was ignorant that
the Jews would not keep faith with Him; but God is here said, according
to human modes of thought to say within Himself what He might naturally
have expected, as the result of His goodness to the Jews; thus the
enormity of their unnatural perversity is the more vividly set forth.

lie--prove false to Me (compare [Psa
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017).md).

so--in virtue of His having chosen them, He became their Saviour. So the
"therefore" ([Jer 31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033).md). His eternal
choice is the ground of His actually saving men ([Eph
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 63:9</span></span>

he was afflicted--English Version reads the Hebrew as the Keri (Margin),
does, "There was affliction to Him." But the Chetib (text) reads, "There
was no affliction" (the change in Hebrew being only of one letter); that
is, "In all their affliction there was no (utterly overwhelming)
affliction" \[GESENIUS\]; or, for "Hardly had an affliction befallen
them, when the angel of His presence saved them" \[MAURER\]; or, as best
suits the parallelism, "In all their straits there was no straitness in
His goodness to them" \[HOUBIGANT\], ([Jdg
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#016.md); [Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md); [Co2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#012).md).

angel of his presence--literally, "of His face," that is, who stands
before Him continually; Messiah ([Exo
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md); [Exo
23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Pro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#030).md), language applicable to no
creature ([Exo 32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); [Exo
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md), [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014.md); [Num
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#016.md); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001).md).

bare them-- ([Isa 46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md); [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011.md); [Exo
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#004.md); [Deu
32:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 63:10</span></span>

vexed--grieved ([Psa 78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md); [Psa
95:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#010.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md); [Heb
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#010.md), [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017).md).

he fought--rather, "He it was that fought," namely, the angel of His
presence \[HORSLEY\], ([Lam 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 63:11</span></span>

remembered--Notwithstanding their perversity, He forgot not His covenant
of old; therefore He did not wholly forsake them ([Lev
26:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md), [Lev
26:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#044.md); [Psa
106:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#045).md); the Jews make this their
plea with God, that He should not now forsake them.

saying--God is represented, in human language, mentally speaking of
Himself and His former acts of love to Israel, as His ground for pitying
them notwithstanding their rebellion.

sea--Red Sea.

shepherd--Moses; or if the Hebrew be read plural, "shepherds," Moses,
Aaron, and the other leaders (so [Psa
77:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa077.htm#020).md).

put . . . Spirit . . . within him--Hebrew, "in the inward parts of him,"
that is, Moses; or it refers to the flock, "in the midst of his people"
([Num 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#017.md), [Num
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#025.md); [Neh
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#020.md); [Hag
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 63:12</span></span>

The right hand of Moses was but the instrument; the arm of God was the
real mover ([Exo 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#006.md); [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021).md).

dividing the water-- ([Neh 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#011.md); [Psa
78:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 63:13</span></span>

deep--literally, "the tossing and roaring sea."

wilderness--rather, the "open plain" \[HORSLEY\], wherein there is no
obstacle to cause a horse in its course the danger of stumbling.

[Isaiah 63:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 63:14</span></span>

As a beast . . . rest--image from a herd led "down" from the hills to a
fertile and well-watered "valley" ([Psa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#002).md); so God's Spirit "caused Israel
to rest" in the promised land after their weary wanderings.

to make . . . name--(So [Isa 63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md);
[Sa2 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 63:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 63:15</span></span>

Here begins a fervent appeal to God to pity Israel now on the ground of
His former benefits.

habitation of . . . holiness-- ([Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md); [Deu
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#015.md); [Ch2
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027.md); [Psa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014.md); [Psa
80:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#014).md).

zeal . . . strength--evinced formerly for Thy people.

sounding of . . . bowels--Thine emotions of compassion ([Isa
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020.md); [Jer
48:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#036.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 63:16</span></span>

thou . . . father--of Israel, by right not merely of creation, but also
of electing adoption ([Isa 64:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008.md); [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md); [Ch1
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#010).md).

though Abraham . . . Israel--It had been the besetting temptation of the
Jews to rest on the mere privilege of their descent from faithful
Abraham and Jacob ([Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009.md); [Joh
8:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039.md); [Joh
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012).md); now at last they renounce this,
to trust in God alone as their Father, notwithstanding all appearances
to the contrary. Even though Abraham, our earthly father, on whom we
have prided ourselves, disown us, Thou wilt not ([Isa
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md); [Psa
27:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#010).md). Isaac is not mentioned,
because not all his posterity was admitted to the covenant, whereas all
Jacob's was; Abraham is specified because he was the first father of the
Jewish race.

everlasting--an argument why He should help them, namely, because of His
everlasting immutability.

[Isaiah 63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 63:17</span></span>

made us to err--that is, "suffer" us to err and to be hardened in our
heart. They do not mean to deny their own blameworthiness, but confess
that through their own fault God gave them over to a reprobate mind
([Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md); [Psa
119:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md); [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md).

Return-- ([Num 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#036.md); [Psa
90:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 63:18</span></span>

people of . . . holiness--Israel dedicated as holy unto God ([Isa
62:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#012.md); [Deu
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006).md).

possessed--namely, the Holy Land, or Thy "sanctuary," taken from the
following clause, which is parallel to this (compare [Isa
64:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#010.md); [Psa
74:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006).md).

thy--an argument why God should help them; their cause is His cause.

[Isaiah 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 63:19</span></span>

thine . . . never--rather, "We are Thine from of old; Thou barest not
rule over them" \[BARNES\]. LOWTH translates, "We for long have been as
those over whom Thou hast not ruled, who are not called by Thy name";
"for long" thus stands in contrast to "but a little while" ([Isa
63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018).md). But the analogy of [Isa
63:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#018.md) makes it likely that the first
clause in this verse refers to the Jews, and the second to their foes,
as English Version and BARNES translate it. The Jews' foes are aliens
who have unjustly intruded into the Lord's heritage.
