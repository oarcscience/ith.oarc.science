### [Ezekiel Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 22:2</span></span>

GOD'S JUDGMENT ON THE SINFULNESS OF JERUSALEM. (Eze. 22:1-31)

See [Eze 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004.md); that is, "Wilt thou not
judge?" &c. (compare [Eze 23:36](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#036).md).

the bloody city--literally, "the city of bloods"; so called on account
of murders perpetrated in her, and sacrifices of children to Molech
([Eze 22:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003.md), [Eze
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006.md), [Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md); [Eze
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006.md), [Eze
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 22:3</span></span>

sheddeth blood . . . that her time may come--Instead of deriving
advantage from her bloody sacrifices to idols, she only thereby brought
on herself "the time" of her punishment.

against herself-- ([Pro 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036).md).

[Ezekiel 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 22:4</span></span>

thy days--the shorter period, namely, that of the siege.

thy years--the longer period of the captivity. The "days" and "years"
express that she is ripe for punishment.

[Ezekiel 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 22:5</span></span>

infamous--They mockingly call thee, "Thou polluted one in name (Margin),
and full of confusion" \[FAIRBAIRN\], (referring to the tumultuous
violence prevalent in it). Thus the nations "far and near" mocked her as
at once sullied in character and in actual fact lawless. What a sad
contrast to the Jerusalem once designated "'the holy city!"

[Ezekiel 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 22:6</span></span>

Rather, "The princes . . . each according to his power, were in thee, to
shed blood" (as if this was the only object of their existence).
"Power," literally, "arm"; they, who ought to have been patterns of
justice, made their own arm of might their only law.

[Ezekiel 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 22:7</span></span>

set light by--Children have made light of, disrespected, father . . .
([Deu 27:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#016).md). At [Eze
22:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#007.md) are enumerated the sins
committed in violation of Moses' law.

[Ezekiel 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 22:9</span></span>

men that carry tales--informers, who by misrepresentations cause
innocent blood to be shed ([Lev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016).md). Literally, "one who goes to
and fro as a merchant."

[Ezekiel 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 22:10</span></span>

set apart for pollution--that is, set apart as unclean ([Lev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 22:12</span></span>

forgotten me-- ([Deu 32:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#018.md); [Jer
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#032.md); [Jer
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#021).md).

[Ezekiel 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 22:13</span></span>

smitten mine hand--in token of the indignant vengeance which I will
execute on thee (see on [Eze 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017).md).

[Ezekiel 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 22:14</span></span>

([Eze 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007).md).

[Ezekiel 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 22:15</span></span>

consume thy filthiness out of thee--the object of God in scattering the
Jews.

[Ezekiel 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 22:16</span></span>

take thine inheritance in thyself--Formerly thou wast Mine inheritance;
but now, full of guilt, thou art no longer Mine, but thine own
inheritance to thyself; "in the sight of the heathen," that is, even
they shall see that, now that thou hast become a captive, thou art no
longer owned as Mine \[VATABLUS\]. FAIRBAIRN and others needlessly take
the Hebrew from a different root, "thou shalt be polluted by ('in,'
\[HENDERSON\]) thyself," &c.; the heathen shall regard thee as a
polluted thing, who hast brought thine own reproach on thyself.

[Ezekiel 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 22:18</span></span>

dross . . . brass--Israel has become a worthless compound of the dross
of silver (implying not merely corruption, but degeneracy from good to
bad, [Isa 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022), especially offensive.md)
and of the baser metals. Hence the people must be thrown into the
furnace of judgment, that the bad may be consumed, and the good
separated ([Jer 6:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029).md).

[Ezekiel 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 22:23</span></span>

From this verse to the end he shows the general corruption of all ranks.

[Ezekiel 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 22:24</span></span>

land . . . not cleansed--not cleared or cultivated; all a scene of
desolation; a fit emblem of the moral wilderness state of the people.

nor rained upon--a mark of divine "indignation"; as the early and latter
rain, on which the productiveness of the land depended, was one of the
great covenant blessings. Joel ([Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md) promises the return of the
former and latter rain, with the restoration of God's favor.

[Ezekiel 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 22:25</span></span>

conspiracy--The false prophets have conspired both to propagate error
and to oppose the messages of God's servants. They are mentioned first,
as their bad influence extended the widest.

prey--Their aim was greed of gain, "treasure, and precious things" ([Hos
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md); [Zep
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#003.md); [Mat
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014).md).

made . . . many widows--by occasioning, through false prophecies, the
war with the Chaldeans in which the husbands fell.

[Ezekiel 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 22:26</span></span>

Her priests--whose "lips should have kept knowledge" ([Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007).md).

violated--not simply transgressed; but, have done violence to the law,
by wresting it to wrong ends, and putting wrong constructions on it.

put no difference between the holy and profane, &c.--made no distinction
between the clean and unclean ([Lev
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#010).md), the Sabbath and other days,
sanctioning violations of that holy day. "Holy" means, what is dedicated
to God; "profane," what is in common use; "unclean," what is forbidden
to be eaten; "clean," what is lawful to be eaten.

I am profaned among them--They abuse My name to false or unjust
purposes.

[Ezekiel 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 22:27</span></span>

princes--who should have employed the influence of their position for
the people's welfare, made "gain" their sole aim.

wolves--notorious for fierce and ravening cruelty ([Mic
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#002.md), [Mic
3:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#009.md); [Joh
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012).md).

[Ezekiel 22:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 22:28</span></span>

Referring to the false assurances of peace with which the prophets
flattered the people, that they should not submit to the king of Babylon
(see on [Eze 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010.md); [Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029.md); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md); [Jer
23:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#016.md); [Jer
27:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 22:29</span></span>

The people--put last, after the mention of those in office. Corruption
had spread downwards through the whole community.

wrongfully--that is, "without cause," gratuitously, without the stranger
proselyte giving any just provocation; nay, he of all others being one
who ought to have been won to the worship of Jehovah by kindness,
instead of being alienated by oppression; especially as the Israelites
were commanded to remember that they themselves had been "strangers in
Egypt" ([Exo 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#021.md); [Exo
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 22:30</span></span>

the hedge--the wall (see on [Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005).md); image for leading the people to
repentance.

the gap--the breach ([Psa 106:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023).md);
image for interceding between the people and God ([Gen
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#007.md); [Exo
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md); [Num
16:48](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#048).md).

I found none-- ([Jer 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#001).md) --not that
literally there was not a righteous man in the city. For Jeremiah,
Baruch, &c., were still there; but Jeremiah had been forbidden to pray
for the people ([Jer 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014).md), as being
doomed to wrath. None now, of the godly, knowing the desperate state of
the people, and God's purpose as to them, was willing longer to
interpose between God's wrath and them. And none "among them," that is,
among those just enumerated as guilty of such sins ([Eze
22:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#025).md), was morally able for such
an office.

[Ezekiel 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 22:31</span></span>

their own way . . . recompensed upon their heads-- ([Eze
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010.md); [Eze
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#021.md); [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043.md); [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031.md); [Isa
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#011.md); [Jer
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#019).md).

The imagery is similar to that in the sixteenth chapter; but here the
reference is not as there so much to the breach of the spiritual
marriage covenant with God by the people's idolatries, as by their
worldly spirit, and their trusting to alliances with the heathen for
safety, rather than to God.
