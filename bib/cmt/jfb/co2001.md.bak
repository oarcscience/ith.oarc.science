### [2 Corinthians Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 1:1</span></span>

THE HEADING; PAUL'S CONSOLATIONS IN RECENT TRIALS IN ASIA; HIS SINCERITY
TOWARDS THE CORINTHIANS; EXPLANATION OF HIS NOT HAVING VISITED THEM AS
HE HAD PURPOSED. (2Co. 1:1-24)

Timothy our brother--When writing to Timothy himself, he calls him "my
son" ([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018).md). Writing of him,
"brother," and "my beloved son" ([Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017).md). He had been sent before to
Macedonia, and had met Paul at Philippi, when the apostle passed over
from Troas to Macedonia (compare [Co2
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012.md); see on [Co1
16:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010).md).

in all Achaia--comprising Hellas and the Peloponnese. The Gentiles
themselves, and AnnÃ&brvbr;us Gallio, the proconsul ([Act
18:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012).md), strongly testified their
disapproval of the accusation brought by the Jews against Paul. Hence,
the apostle was enabled to labor in the whole province of Achaia with
such success as to establish several churches there ([Th1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#008.md); [Th2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004).md), where, writing from Corinth, he
speaks of the "churches," namely, not only the Corinthian, but others
also--Athens, Cenchrea, and, perhaps, Sicyon, Argos, &c. He addresses
"the Church in Corinth," directly, and all "the saints" in the province,
indirectly. In [Gal 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#002.md) all the
"churches" are addressed directly in the same circular Epistle. Hence,
here he does not say, all the churches, but "all the saints."

[2 Corinthians 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 1:3</span></span>

This thanksgiving for his late deliverance forms a suitable introduction
for conciliating their favorable reception of his reasons for not having
fulfilled his promise of visiting them ([Co2
1:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md).

Father of mercies--that is, the SOURCE of all mercies (compare [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).md).

comfort--which flows from His "mercies" experienced. Like a true man of
faith, he mentions "mercies" and "comfort," before he proceeds to speak
of afflictions ([Co2 1:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004).md). The
"tribulation" of believers is not inconsistent with God's mercy, and
does not beget in them suspicion of it; nay, in the end they feel that
He is "the God of ALL comfort," that is, who imparts the only true and
perfect comfort in every instance ([Psa
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md), [Psa
146:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#005.md), [Psa
146:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#008.md); [Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 1:4</span></span>

us--idiomatic for me ([Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018).md).

that we may . . . comfort them which are in any trouble--Translate, as
the Greek is the same as before, "tribulation." The apostle lived, not
to himself, but to the Church; so, whatever graces God conferred on him,
he considered granted not for himself alone, but that he might have the
greater ability to help others \[CALVIN\]. So participation in all the
afflictions of man peculiarly qualified Jesus to be man's comforter in
all his various afflictions ([Isa
50:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004.md); [Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 1:5</span></span>

sufferings--standing in contrast with "salvation" ([Co2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006).md); as "tribulation" (distress of
mind), with comfort or "consolation."

of Christ--Compare [Col 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md). The
sufferings endured, whether by Himself, or by His Church, with which He
considers Himself identified ([Mat
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040.md), [Mat
25:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045.md); [Act
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004.md); [Jo1
4:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017).md). Christ calls His people's
sufferings His own suffering: (1) because of the sympathy and mystical
union between Him and us ([Rom 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md);
[Co1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#010)); (2.md) They are borne for His
sake; (3) They tend to His glory ([Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md); [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md), [Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016).md).

abound in us--Greek, "abound unto us." The order of the Greek following
words is more forcible than in English Version, "Even so through Christ
aboundeth also our comfort." The sufferings (plural) are many; but the
consolation (though singular) swallows up them all. Comfort
preponderates in this Epistle above that in the first Epistle, as now by
the effect of the latter most of the Corinthians had been much
impressed.

[2 Corinthians 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 1:6</span></span>

we . . . afflicted . . . for your consolation--exemplifying the
communion of saints. Their hearts were, so to speak, mirrors reflecting
the likenesses of each other ([Phi
2:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#026).md) \[BENGEL\]. Alike the
afflictions and the consolations of the apostle tend, as in him so in
them, as having communion with him, to their consolation ([Co2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#004.md); [Co2
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015).md). The Greek for "afflicted" is
the same as before, and ought to be translated, "Whether we be in
tribulation."

which is effectual--literally, "worketh effectually."

in the enduring, &c.--that is, in enabling you to endure "the same
sufferings which we also suffer." Here follows, in the oldest
manuscripts (not as English Version in the beginning of [Co2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007).md), the clause, "And our hope is
steadfast on your behalf."

[2 Corinthians 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 1:7</span></span>

so shall ye be--rather, "So are ye." He means, there is a community of
consolation, as of suffering, between me and you.

[2 Corinthians 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 1:8</span></span>

Referring to the imminent risk of life which he ran in Ephesus (Acts
19:23-41) when the whole multitude were wrought up to fury by Demetrius,
on the plea of Paul and his associates having assailed the religion of
Diana of Ephesus. The words ([Co2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009).md), "we had the sentence of death in
ourselves," mean, that he looked upon himself as a man condemned to die
\[PALEY\]. ALFORD thinks the danger at Ephesus was comparatively so
slight that it cannot be supposed to be the subject of reference here,
without exposing the apostle to a charge of cowardice, very unlike his
fearless character; hence, he supposes Paul refers to some deadly
sickness which he had suffered under ([Co2
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009).md). But there is little doubt
that, had Paul been found by the mob in the excitement, he would have
been torn in pieces; and probably, besides what Luke in Acts records,
there were other dangers of an equally distressing kind, such as,
"lyings in wait of the Jews" ([Act
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#019).md), his ceaseless foes. They,
doubtless, had incited the multitude at Ephesus ([Act
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009).md), and were the chief of the "many
adversaries" and "\[wild\] beasts," which he had to fight with there
([Co1 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md); [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).md). His weak state of health at the
time combined with all this to make him regard himself as all but dead
([Co2 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029.md); [Co2
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010).md). What makes my supposition
probable is, that the very cause of his not having visited Corinth
directly as he had intended, and for which he proceeds to apologize
([Co2 1:15-23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015).md), was, that there might
be time to see whether the evils arising there not only from Greek, but
from Jewish disturbers of the Church ([Co2
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029).md), would be checked by his first
Epistle; there not being fully so was what entailed on him the need of
writing this second Epistle. His not specifying this here expressly is
just what we might expect in the outset of this letter; towards the
close, when he had won their favorable hearing by a kindly and firm
tone, he gives a more distinct reference to Jewish agitators ([Co2
11:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022).md).

above strength--that is, ordinary, natural powers of endurance.

despaired--as far as human help or hope from man was concerned. But in
respect to help from God we were "not in despair" ([Co2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 1:9</span></span>

But--"Yea."

in God which raiseth the dead--We had so given up all thoughts of life,
that our only hope was fixed on the coming resurrection; so in [Co1
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032.md) his hope of the resurrection was
what buoyed him up in contending with foes, savage as wild beasts. Here
he touches only on the doctrine of the resurrection, taking it for
granted that its truth is admitted by the Corinthians, and urging its
bearing on their practice.

[2 Corinthians 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 1:10</span></span>

doth deliver--The oldest manuscripts read, "will deliver," namely, as
regards immediately imminent dangers. "In whom we trust that He will
also (so the Greek) yet deliver us," refers to the continuance of God's
delivering help hereafter.

[2 Corinthians 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 1:11</span></span>

helping together by prayer for us--rather, "helping together on our
behalf by your supplication"; the words "for us" in the Greek following
"helping together," not "prayer."

that for the gift, &c.--literally, "That on the part of many persons the
gift (literally, 'gift of grace'; the mercy) bestowed upon us by means
of (that is, through the prayers of) many may be offered thanks for (may
have thanks offered for it) on our behalf."

[2 Corinthians 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 1:12</span></span>

For--reason why he may confidently look for their prayers for him.

our rejoicing--Greek, "our glorying." Not that he glories in the
testimony of his conscience, as something to boast of; nay, this
testimony is itself the thing in which his glorying consists.

in simplicity--Most of the oldest manuscripts read, "in holiness."
English Version reading is perhaps a gloss from [Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005.md) \[ALFORD\]. Some of the oldest
manuscripts and versions, however, support it.

godly sincerity--literally, "sincerity of God"; that is, sincerity as in
the presence of God ([Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008).md). We
glory in this in spite of all our adversities. Sincerity in Greek
implies the non-admixture of any foreign element. He had no sinister or
selfish aims (as some insinuated) in failing to visit them as he had
promised: such aims belonged to his adversaries, not to him ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017).md). "Fleshly wisdom" suggests
tortuous and insincere courses; but the "grace of God," which influenced
him by God's gifts ([Rom 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003.md); [Rom
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015).md), suggests holy
straightforwardness and sincere faithfulness to promises ([Co2
1:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017).md), even as God is faithful to
His promises. The prudence which subserves selfish interests, or employs
unchristian means, or relies on human means more than on the Divine
Spirit, is "fleshly wisdom."

in the world--even in relation to the world at large, which is full of
disingenuousness.

more abundantly to you-ward-- ([Co2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004).md). His greater love to them would
lead him to manifest, especially to them, proofs of his sincerity, which
his less close connection with the world did not admit of his exhibiting
towards it.

[2 Corinthians 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 1:13</span></span>

We write none other things (in this Epistle) than what ye read (in my
former Epistle \[BENGEL\]; present, because the Epistle continued still
to be read in the Church as an apostolic rule). CONYBEARE and HOWSON
think Paul had been suspected of writing privately to some individuals
in the Church in a different strain from that of his public letters; and
translates, "I write nothing else to you but what ye read openly (the
Greek meaning, 'ye read aloud,' namely, when Paul's Epistles were
publicly read in the congregation, [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027).md); yea, and what you acknowledge
inwardly."

or acknowledge--Greek, "or even acknowledge." The Greek for "read" and
for "acknowledge" are words kindred in sound and root. I would
translate, "None other things than what ye know by reading (by comparing
my former Epistle with my present Epistle), or even know as a matter of
fact (namely, the consistency of my acts with my words)."

even to the end--of my life. Not excluding reference to the day of the
Lord (end of [Co2 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Co1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#005).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 1:14</span></span>

in part--In contrast to "even to the end": the testimony of his life was
not yet completed \[THEOPHYLACT and BENGEL\]. Rather, "in part," that
is, some of you, not all \[GROTIUS, ALFORD\]. So in [Co2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005.md); [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md). The majority at Corinth had
shown a willing compliance with Paul's directions in the first Epistle:
but some were still refractory. Hence arises the difference of tone in
different parts of this Epistle. See Introduction.

your rejoicing--your subject of glorying or boast. "Are" (not merely
shall be) implies the present recognition of one another as a subject of
mutual glorying: that glorying being about to be realized in its fulness
"in the day (of the coming) of the Lord Jesus."

[2 Corinthians 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 1:15</span></span>

in this confidence--of my character for sincerity being "acknowledged"
by you ([Co2 1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012).md).

was minded--I was intending.

before--"to come unto you before" visiting Macedonia (where he now was).
Compare Note, see on [Co1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005.md); also
see on [Co1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md), which, combined with
the words here, implies that the insinuation of some at Corinth, that he
would not come at all, rested on the fact of his having thus
disappointed them. His change of intention, and ultimate resolution of
going through Macedonia first, took place before his sending Timothy
from Ephesus into Macedonia, and therefore ([Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017).md) before his writing the first
Epistle. Compare [Act 19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md) (the
order there is "Macedonia and Achaia," not Achaia, Macedonia); [Act
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md).

that ye might have a second benefit--one in going to, the other in
returning from, Macedonia. The "benefit" of his visits consisted in the
grace and spiritual gifts which he was the means of imparting ([Rom
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 1:16</span></span>

This intention of visiting them on the way to Macedonia, as well as
after having passed through it, must have reached the ears of the
Corinthians in some way or other--perhaps in the lost Epistle ([Co1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018.md); [Co1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009).md). The sense comes out more clearly
in the Greek order, "By you to pass into Macedonia, and from Macedonia
to come again unto you."

[2 Corinthians 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 1:17</span></span>

use lightness--Was I guilty of levity? namely, by promising more than I
performed.

or . . . according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea .
. . nay, nay?--The "or" expresses a different alternative: Did I act
with levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like
worldly (fleshly) men, so that my "yea" must at all costs be yea, and my
"nay" nay \[BENGEL, WINER, CALVIN\], ([Mat
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#007.md), [Mat
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#009).md)? The repetition of the "yea" and
"nay" hardly agrees with ALFORD'S view, "What I purpose do I purpose
according to the changeable purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that
there may be with me the yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both
affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)?" The repetition
will thus stand for the single yea and nay, as in [Mat
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037.md); [Jam
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#012.md). But the latter passage implies
that the double "yea" here is not equivalent to the single "yea":
BENGEL'S view, therefore, seems preferable.

[2 Corinthians 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 1:18</span></span>

He adds this lest they might think his DOCTRINE was changeable like his
purposes (the change in which he admitted in [Co2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017.md), while denying that it was due to
"lightness," and at the same time implying that not to have changed,
where there was good reason, would have been to imitate the
fleshly-minded who at all costs obstinately hold to their purpose).

true--Greek, "faithful" ([Co1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009).md).

our word--the doctrine we preach.

was not--The oldest manuscripts read "is not."

yea and nay--that is, inconsistent with itself.

[2 Corinthians 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">co2 1:19</span></span>

Proof of the unchangeableness of the doctrine from the unchangeableness
of the subject of it, namely, Jesus Christ. He is called "the Son of
God" to show the impossibility of change in One who is co-equal with God
himself (compare [Sa1 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#029.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md).

by me . . . Silvanus and Timotheus--The Son of God, though preached by
different preachers, was one and the same, unchangeable. Silvanus is
contracted into Silas ([Act 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md);
compare [Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012).md).

in him was yea--Greek, "is made yea in Him"; that is, our preaching of
the Son of God is confirmed as true in Him (that is, through Him;
through the miracles wherewith He has confirmed our preaching)
\[GROTIUS\]; or rather, by the witness of the Spirit which He has given
([Co2 1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021).md) and of which miracles
were only one, and that a subordinate manifestation.

[2 Corinthians 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co2 1:20</span></span>

Rather, How many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the "yea"
("faithfulness in His word": contrasted with the "yea and nay," [Co2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#019.md), that is, inconstancy as to one's
word).

and in him Amen--The oldest manuscripts read, "Wherefore through Him is
the Amen"; that is, In Him is faithfulness ("yea") to His word,
"wherefore through Him" is the immutable verification of it ("Amen"). As
"yea" is His word, so "Amen" is His oath, which makes our assurance of
the fulfilment doubly sure. Compare "two immutable things (namely, His
word and His oath) in which it was impossible for God to lie" ([Heb
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#018.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014).md). The whole range of Old
Testament and New Testament promises are secure in their fulfilment for
us in Christ.

unto the glory of God by us--Greek, "for glory unto God by us" (compare
[Co2 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#015).md), that is, by our
ministerial labors; by us His promises, and His unchangeable
faithfulness to them, are proclaimed. CONYBEARE takes the "Amen" to be
the Amen at the close of thanksgiving: but then "by us" would have to
mean what it cannot mean here, "by us and you."

[2 Corinthians 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co2 1:21</span></span>

stablisheth us . . . in Christ--that is, in the faith of Christ--in
believing in Christ.

anointed us--As "Christ" is the "Anointed" (which His name means), so
"He hath anointed (Greek, "chrisas") us," ministers and believing people
alike, with the Spirit ([Co2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md);
[Jo1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).md). Hence we become "a sweet savor
of Christ" ([Co2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co2 1:22</span></span>

sealed--A seal is a token assuring the possession of property to one;
"sealed" here answers to "stablisheth us" ([Co2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#021.md); [Co1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002).md).

the earnest of the Spirit--that is, the Spirit as the earnest (that is,
money given by a purchaser as a pledge for the full payment of the sum
promised). The Holy Spirit is given to the believer now as a first
instalment to assure him his full inheritance as a son of God shall be
his hereafter ([Eph 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013).md). "Sealed
with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance
until the redemption of the purchased possession" ([Rom
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023).md). The Spirit is the pledge of the
fulfilment of "all the promises" ([Co2
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md).

Moreover I--Greek, "But I (for my part)," in contrast to GOD who hath
assured us of His promises being hereafter fulfilled certainly ([Co2
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020).md).

call God--the all-knowing One, who avenges wilful unfaithfulness to
promises.

for a record upon my soul--As a witness as to the secret purposes of my
soul, and a witness against it, if I lie ([Mal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#005).md).

to spare you--in order not to come in a rebuking spirit, as I should
have had to come to you, if I had come then.

I came not as yet--Greek, "no longer"; that is, I gave up my purpose of
then visiting Corinth. He wished to give them time for repentance, that
he might not have to use severity towards them. Hence he sent Titus
before him. Compare [Co2 10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md),
which shows that his detractors represented him as threatening what he
had not courage to perform ([Co1
4:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#018).md).

[2 Corinthians 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#024.md)

Not for that--that is, Not that. "Faith" is here emphatic. He had
"dominion" or a right to control them in matters of discipline, but in
matters of "faith" he was only a "fellow helper of their joy" (namely,
in believing, [Rom 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md); [Phi
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#025).md). The Greek is, "Not that we lord
it over your faith." This he adds to soften the magisterial tone of [Co2
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023.md). His desire is to cause them not
sorrow ([Co2 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001).md), but "joy." The
Greek for "helpers" implies a mutual leaning, one on the other, like the
mutually supporting buttresses of a sacred building. "By faith ([Rom
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020).md) ye stand"; therefore it is that
I bestow such pains in "helping" your faith, which is the source of all
true "joy" ([Rom 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013).md). I want
nothing more, not to lord it over your faith.
