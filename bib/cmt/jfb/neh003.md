### [Nehemiah Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

[Nehemiah 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">neh 3:1</span></span>

THE NAMES AND ORDER OF THEM THAT BUILDED THE WALL OF JERUSALEM. (Neh.
3:1-32)

Then Eliashib the high priest--the grandson of Jeshua, and the first
high priest after the return from Babylon.

rose up with his brethren the priests--that is, set an example by
commencing the work, their labors being confined to the sacred
localities.

and they builded the sheep gate--close to the temple. Its name arose
either from the sheep market, or from the pool of Bethesda, which was
there ([Joh 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002).md). There the sheep were
washed and then taken to the temple for sacrifice.

they sanctified it, and set up the doors--Being the common entrance into
the temple, and the first part of the building repaired, it is probable
that some religious ceremonies were observed in gratitude for its
completion. "It was the first-fruits, and therefore, in the
sanctification of it, the whole lump and building was sanctified"
\[POOLE\].

the tower of Meah--This word is improperly considered, in our version,
as the name of a tower; it is the Hebrew word for "a hundred," so that
the meaning is: they not only rebuilt the sheep gate, but also a hundred
cubits of the wall, which extended as far as the tower of Hananeel.

[Nehemiah 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">neh 3:2</span></span>

next unto him builded the men of Jericho, &c.--The wall was divided into
portions, one of which was assigned respectively to each of the great
families which had returned from the captivity. This distribution, by
which the building was carried on in all parts simultaneously with great
energy, was eminently favorable to despatch. "The villages where the
restorers resided being mostly mentioned, it will be seen that this
circumstance affords a general indication of the part of the wall upon
which they labored, such places being on that side of the city nearest
their place of abode; the only apparent exception being, perhaps, where
they repaired more than their piece. Having completed their first
undertaking (if they worked any more), there being no more work to be
done on the side next their residence, or having arrived after the
repairs on that part of the city nearest them under operation were
completed, they would go wherever their services would be required"
\[BARCLAY, City of the Great King\].

[Nehemiah 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">neh 3:8</span></span>

they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall--or, "double wall,"
extending from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred
cubits in length, formerly broken down by Joash, king of Israel \[[Ch2
25:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#023.md)\], but afterwards rebuilt by
Uzziah \[[Ch2 26:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#009.md)\], who made it so
strong that the Chaldeans, finding it difficult to demolish, had left it
standing.

[Nehemiah 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">neh 3:12</span></span>

Shallum . . . he and his daughters--who were either heiresses or rich
widows. They undertook to defray the expenses of a part of the wall next
them.

[Nehemiah 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">neh 3:13</span></span>

the inhabitants of Zanoah--There were two towns so called in the
territory of Judah ([Jos 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#034.md), [Jos
15:56](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#056).md).

[Nehemiah 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">neh 3:14</span></span>

Beth-haccerem--a city of Judah, supposed to be now occupied by Bethulia,
on a hill of the same name, which is sometimes called also the mountain
of the Franks, between Jerusalem and Tekoa.

[Nehemiah 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">neh 3:16</span></span>

the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the
house of the mighty--that is, along the precipitous cliffs of Zion
\[BARCLAY\].

[Nehemiah 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">neh 3:19</span></span>

at the turning of the wall--that is, the wall across the TyropÅ“on,
being a continuation of the first wall, connecting Mount Zion with the
temple wall \[BARCLAY\].

[Nehemiah 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">neh 3:25</span></span>

the tower which lieth out from the king's high house--that is,
watchtower by the royal palace \[BARCLAY\].

[Nehemiah 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">neh 3:26</span></span>

the Nethinims--Not only the priests and the Levites, but the common
persons that belonged to the house of God, contributed to the work. The
names of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem are commemorated
because it was a work of piety and patriotism to repair the holy city.
It was an instance of religion and courage to defend the true
worshippers of God, that they might serve Him in quietness and safety,
and, in the midst of so many enemies, go on with this work, piously
confiding in the power of God to support them \[BISHOP PATRICK\].
