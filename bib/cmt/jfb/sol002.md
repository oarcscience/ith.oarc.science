### [Song of Solomon (Canticles) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001)

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sol 2:1</span></span>

rose--if applied to Jesus Christ, it, with the white lily (lowly, [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)), answers to "white and ruddy"
([Sol 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010)). But it is rather the
meadow-saffron: the Hebrew means radically a plant with a pungent bulb,
inapplicable to the rose. So Syriac. It is of a white and violet color
\[MAURER, GESENIUS, and WEISS\]. The bride thus speaks of herself as
lowly though lovely, in contrast with the lordly "apple" or citron tree,
the bridegroom ([Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003)); so the
"lily" is applied to her ([Sol 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002)),

Sharon-- ([Isa 35:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#001)). In North
Palestine, between Mount Tabor and Lake Tiberias ([Ch1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#016)). Septuagint and Vulgate
translate it, "a plain"; though they err in this, the Hebrew Bible not
elsewhere favoring it, yet the parallelism to valleys shows that, in the
proper name Sharon, there is here a tacit reference to its meaning of
lowliness. Beauty, delicacy, and lowliness, are to be in her, as they
were in Him ([Mat 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sol 2:2</span></span>

Jesus Christ to the Bride ([Mat 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016);
[Joh 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019)). Thorns, equivalent to the
wicked ([Sa2 23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006); [Psa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004)).

daughters--of men, not of God; not "the virgins." "If thou art the lily
of Jesus Christ, take heed lest by impatience, rash judgments, and
pride, thou thyself become a thorn" \[LUTHER\].

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sol 2:3</span></span>

Her reply. apple--generic including the golden citron, pomegranate, and
orange apple ([Pro 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011)). He combines
the shadow and fragrance of the citron with the sweetness of the orange
and pomegranate fruit. The foliage is perpetual; throughout the year a
succession of blossoms, fruit, and perfume ([Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)).

among the sons--parallel to "among the daughters" ([Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002)). He alone is ever fruitful among
the fruitless wild trees ([Psa 89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006);
[Heb 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009)).

I sat . . . with . . . delight--literally, "I eagerly desired and sat"
([Psa 94:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#019); [Mar
6:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#031); [Eph
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006); [Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008)).

shadow-- ([Psa 121:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#005); [Isa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006); [Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)). Jesus Christ interposes the
shadow of His cross between the blazing rays of justice and us sinners.

fruit--Faith plucks it ([Pro 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#018)).
Man lost the tree of life ([Gen
3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)). Jesus Christ regained it for
him; he eats it partly now ([Psa
119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103); [Joh
6:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#055), [Joh
6:57](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#057); [Pe1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003)); fully hereafter ([Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007); [Rev
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#002), [Rev
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014)); not earned by the sweat of his
brow, or by his righteousness (Rom. 10:1-21). Contrast the worldling's
fruit ([Deu 32:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032); [Luk
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#016)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sol 2:4</span></span>

Historically fulfilled in the joy of Simeon and Anna in the temple, over
the infant Saviour ([Luk 2:25-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025)), and
that of Mary, too (compare [Luk 1:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#053));
typified ([Exo 24:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#009)). Spiritually,
the bride or beloved is led ([Sol 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004))
first into the King's chambers, thence is drawn after Him in answer to
her prayer; is next received on a grassy couch under a cedar kiosk; and
at last in a "banqueting hall," such as, JOSEPHUS says, Solomon had in
his palace, "wherein all the vessels were of gold" (Antiquities, 8:5,2).
The transition is from holy retirement to public ordinances, church
worship, and the Lord's Supper ([Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008)). The bride, as the queen of
Sheba, is given "all her desire" ([Kg1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#013); [Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008), [Eph
3:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016); [Phi
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#019)); type of the heavenly feast
hereafter ([Isa 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006), [Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009)).

his banner . . . love--After having rescued us from the enemy, our
victorious captain ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)) seats
us at the banquet under a banner inscribed with His name, "love" ([Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008)). His love conquered us to
Himself; this banner rallies round us the forces of Omnipotence, as our
protection; it marks to what country we belong, heaven, the abode of
love, and in what we most glory, the cross of Jesus Christ, through
which we triumph ([Rom 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037); [Co1
15:57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#057); [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021)). Compare with "over me,"
"underneath are the everlasting arms" ([Deu
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sol 2:5</span></span>

flagons--MAURER prefers translating, "dried raisin cakes"; from the
Hebrew root "fire," namely, dried by heat. But the "house of wine" ([Sol
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#004), Margin) favors "flagons"; the
"new wine" of the kingdom, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

apples--from the tree ([Sol 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003)), so
sweet to her, the promises of God.

sick of love--the highest degree of sensible enjoyment that can be
attained here. It may be at an early or late stage of experience. Paul
([Co2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007)). In the last sickness of
J. Welch, he was overheard saying, "Lord, hold thine hand, it is enough;
thy servant is a clay vessel, and can hold no more" \[FLEMING,
Fulfilling of the Scriptures\]. In most cases this intensity of joy is
reserved for the heavenly banquet. Historically, Israel had it, when the
Lord's glory filled the tabernacle, and afterwards the temple, so that
the priests could not stand to minister: so in the Christian Church on
Pentecost. The bride addresses Christ mainly, though in her rapture she
uses the plural, "Stay (ye) me," speaking generally. So far from asking
the withdrawal of the manifestations which had overpowered her, she asks
for more: so "fainteth for" ([Psa
84:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002)): also Peter, on the mount of
transfiguration ([Luk 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033)), "Let us
make . . . not knowing what he said."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sol 2:6</span></span>

The "stay" she prayed for ([Sol 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005))
is granted ([Deu 33:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#012), [Deu
33:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#027); [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024); [Isa
41:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#016)). None can pluck from that
embrace ([Joh 10:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028)). His hand
keeps us from falling ([Mat 14:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#030));
to it we may commit ourselves ([Psa
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005)).

left hand--the left is the inferior hand, by which the Lord less
signally manifests His love, than by the right; the secret hand of
ordinary providence, as distinguished from that of manifested grace (the
"right"). They really go together, though sometimes they seem divided;
here both are felt at once. THEODORET takes the left hand, equivalent to
judgment and wrath; the right, equivalent to honor and love. The hand of
justice no longer is lifted to smite, but is under the head of the
believer to support ([Isa 42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021)); the
hand of Jesus Christ pierced by justice for our sin supports us. The
charge not to disturb the beloved occurs thrice: but the sentiment here,
"His left hand," &c., nowhere else fully; which accords with the
intensity of joy ([Sol 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#005)) found
nowhere else; in [Sol 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#003), it is only
conditional, "should embrace," not "doth."

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sol 2:7</span></span>

by the roes--not an oath but a solemn charge, to act as cautiously as
the hunter would with the wild roes, which are proverbially timorous; he
must advance with breathless circumspection, if he is to take them; so
he who would not lose Jesus Christ and His Spirit, which is easily
grieved and withdrawn, must be tender of conscience and watchful ([Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043); [Eph
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030); [Eph
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015); [Th1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)). In Margin, title of [Psa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001), Jesus Christ is called the "Hind
of the morning," hunted to death by the dogs (compare [Sol
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008), where He is represented as
bounding on the hills, [Psa 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033)).
Here He is resting, but with a repose easily broken ([Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017)). It is thought a gross rudeness
in the East to awaken one sleeping, especially a person of rank.

my love--in Hebrew, feminine for masculine, the abstract for concrete,
Jesus Christ being the embodiment of love itself ([Sol
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#005); [Sol
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#007)), where, as here, the context
requires it to be applied to Him, not her. She too is "love" ([Sol
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#006)), for His love calls forth her
love. Presumption in the convert is as grieving to the Spirit as
despair. The lovingness and pleasantness of the hind and roe ([Pro
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#019)) is included in this image of
Jesus Christ.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sol 2:8</span></span>

(CANTICLE II)--JOHN THE BAPTIST'S MINISTRY. (Son. 2:8-3:5)

voice--an exclamation of joyful surprise, evidently after a long
silence. The restlessness of sin and fickleness in her had disturbed His
rest with her, which she had professed not to wish disturbed "till He
should please." He left her, but in sovereign grace unexpectedly heralds
His return. She awakes, and at once recognizes His voice ([Sa1
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#009); [Joh
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#004)); her sleep is not so sinfully
deep as in [Sol 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#002).

leaping--bounding, as the roe does, over the roughest obstacles ([Sa2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#018); [Ch1
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1012.htm#008)); as the father of the prodigal
"had compassion and ran" ([Luk 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#020)).

upon the hills--as the sunbeams glancing from hill to hill. So Margin,
title of Jesus Christ ([Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)),
"Hind of the morning" (type of His resurrection). Historically, the
coming of the kingdom of heaven (the gospel dispensation), announced by
John Baptist, is meant; it primarily is the garden or vineyard; the
bride is called so in a secondary sense. "The voice" of Jesus Christ is
indirect, through "the friend of the bridegroom" ([Joh
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029)), John the Baptist. Personally,
He is silent during John's ministration, who awoke the long slumbering
Church with the cry. "Every hill shall be made low," in the spirit of
Elias, on the "rent mountains" ([Kg1
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#011); compare [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)). Jesus Christ is implied as
coming with intense desire ([Luk
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015); [Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007)), disregarding the mountain
hindrances raised by man's sin.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sol 2:9</span></span>

he standeth--after having bounded over the intervening space like a roe.
He often stands near when our unbelief hides Him from us ([Gen
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016); [Rev
3:14-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014)). His usual way; long promised
and expected; sudden at last: so, in visiting the second temple ([Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)); so at Pentecost ([Act
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#001)); so in visiting an individual
soul, Zaccheus ([Luk 19:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#005); [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)); and so, at the second coming
([Mat 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#048), [Mat
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#050); [Pe2
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004), [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)). So it shall be at His second
coming ([Th1 5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002)).

wall--over the cope of which He is first seen; next, He looks through
(not forth; for He is outside) at the windows, glancing suddenly and
stealthily (not as English Version, "showing Himself") through the
lattice. The prophecies, types, &c., were lattice glimpses of Him to the
Old Testament Church, in spite of the wall of separation which sin had
raised ([Joh 8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)); clearer glimpses
were given by John Baptist, but not unclouded ([Joh
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#026)). The legal wall of partition was
not to be removed until His death ([Eph
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014); [Heb
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020)). Even now, He is only seen by
faith, through the windows of His Word and the lattice of ordinances and
sacraments ([Luk 24:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#035); [Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021)); not full vision ([Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)); an incentive to our looking
for His second coming ([Isa 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#017);
[Tit 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sol 2:10</span></span>

Loving reassurance given by Jesus Christ to the bride, lest she should
think that He had ceased to love her, on account of her unfaithfulness,
which had occasioned His temporary withdrawal. He allures her to
brighter than worldly joys ([Mic
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010)). Not only does the saint wish to
depart to be with Him, but He still more desires to have the saint with
Him above ([Joh 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024)). Historically,
the vineyard or garden of the King, here first introduced, is "the
kingdom of heaven preached" by John the Baptist, before whom "the law
and the prophets were" ([Luk 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sol 2:11</span></span>

the winter--the law of the covenant of works ([Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016)).

rain is over-- ([Heb 12:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018); [Jo1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008)). Then first the Gentile Church is
called "beloved, which was not beloved" ([Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025)). So "the winter" of estrangement
and sin is "past" to the believer ([Isa
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#022); [Jer
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020); [Co2
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017); [Eph
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001)). The rising "Sun of
righteousness" dispels the "rain" ([Sa2
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#004); [Psa
126:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005); [Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)). The winter in Palestine is past
by April, but all the showers were not over till May. The time described
here is that which comes directly after these last showers of winter. In
the highest sense, the coming resurrection and deliverance of the earth
from the past curse is here implied ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004); [Rev
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003)). No more "clouds" shall then
"return after the rain" ([Ecc 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#002);
[Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003); compare [Gen
9:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#013)); "the rainbow round the
throne" is the "token" of this.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sol 2:12</span></span>

flowers--tokens of anger past, and of grace come. "The summoned bride is
welcome," say some fathers, "to weave from them garlands of beauty,
wherewith she may adorn herself to meet the King." Historically, the
flowers, &c., only give promise; the fruit is not ripe yet; suitable to
the preaching of John the Baptist, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand";
not yet fully come.

the time of . . . singing--the rejoicing at the advent of Jesus Christ.
GREGORY NYSSENUS refers the voice of the turtledove to John the Baptist.
It with the olive branch announced to Noah that "the rain was over and
gone" ([Gen 8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011)). So John the
Baptist, spiritually. Its plaintive "voice" answers to his preaching of
repentance ([Jer 8:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006)). Vulgate and
Septuagint translate, "The time of pruning," namely, spring ([Joh
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#002)). The mention of the "turtle's"
cooing better accords with our text. The turtledove is migratory ([Jer
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#007)), and "comes" early in May; emblem
of love, and so of the Holy Ghost. Love, too, shall be the keynote of
the "new song" hereafter ([Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010);
[Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005); [Rev
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#003); [Rev
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#006)). In the individual believer now,
joy and love are here set forth in their earlier manifestations ([Mar
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sol 2:13</span></span>

putteth forth--rather, "ripens," literally, "makes red" \[MAURER\]. The
unripe figs, which grow in winter, begin to ripen in early spring, and
in June are fully matured \[WEISS\].

vines with the tender grape--rather, "the vines in flower," literally,
"a flower," in apposition with "vines" \[MAURER\]. The vine flowers were
so sweet that they were often put, when dried, into new wine to give it
flavor. Applicable to the first manifestations of Jesus Christ, "the
true Vine," both to the Church and to individuals; as to Nathanael under
the fig tree ([Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048)).

Arise, &c.--His call, described by the bride, ends as it began ([Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010)); it is a consistent whole;
"love" from first to last ([Isa
52:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001); [Co2
6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017)). "Come," in the close of [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017), as at His earlier manifestation
([Mat 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">sol 2:14</span></span>

dove--here expressing endearment ([Psa
74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019)). Doves are noted for constant
attachment; emblems, also, in their soft, plaintive note, of softened
penitents ([Isa 59:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#011); [Eze
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016)); other points of likeness are
their beauty; "their wings covered with silver and gold" ([Psa
68:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#013)), typifying the change in the
converted; the dove-like spirit, breathed into the saint by the Holy
Ghost, whose emblem is the dove; the messages of peace from God to
sinful men, as Noah's dove, with the olive branch ([Gen
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#011)), intimated that the flood of
wrath was past; timidity, fleeing with fear from sin and self to the
cleft Rock of Ages ([Isa 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#004), Margin;
[Hos 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011)); gregarious, flocking
together to the kingdom of Jesus Christ ([Isa
60:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#008)); harmless simplicity ([Mat
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016)).

clefts--the refuge of doves from storm and heat ([Jer
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028); see [Jer
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#016)). GESENIUS translates the Hebrew
from a different root, "the refuges." But see, for "clefts," [Exo
33:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#018). It is only when we are in
Christ Jesus that our "voice is sweet (in prayer, [Sol
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#003), [Sol
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#011); [Mat
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006), because it is His voice in us;
also in speaking of Him, [Mal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016));
and our countenance comely" ([Exo
34:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029); [Psa
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005); [Psa
71:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#003); [Isa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016); [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018)).

stairs-- ([Eze 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#020), Margin), a steep
rock, broken into stairs or terraces. It is in "secret places" and
rugged scenes that Jesus Christ woos the soul from the world to Himself
([Mic 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#010); [Mic
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014)). So Jacob amid the stones of
Beth-el ([Gen 28:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#011)); Moses at
Horeb (Exo. 3:1-22); so Elijah ([Kg1
19:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#009)); Jesus Christ with the three
disciples on a "high mountain apart," at the transfiguration ([Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001)); John in Patmos ([Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009)). "Of the eight beatitudes, five
have an afflicted condition for their subject. As long as the waters are
on the earth, we dwell in the ark; but when the land is dry, the dove
itself will be tempted to wander" \[JEREMY TAYLOR\]. Jesus Christ does
not invite her to leave the rock, but in it (Himself), yet in holy
freedom to lay aside the timorous spirit, look up boldly as accepted in
Him, pray, praise, and confess Him (in contrast to her shrinking from
being looked at, [Sol 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)), ([Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019); [Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015); [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018)); still, though trembling, the
voice and countenance of the soul in Jesus Christ are pleasant to Him.
The Church found no cleft in the Sinaitic legal rock, though good in
itself, wherein to hide; but in Jesus Christ stricken by God for us, as
the rock smitten by Moses ([Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011)), there is a hiding-place ([Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)). She praised His "voice" ([Sol
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008), [Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010)); it is thus that her voice also,
though tremulous, is "sweet" to Him here.

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015)

Transition to the vineyard, often formed in "stairs" ([Sol
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#014)), or terraces, in which, amidst
the vine leaves, foxes hid.

foxes--generic term, including jackals. They eat only grapes, not the
vine flowers; but they need to be driven out in time before the grape is
ripe. She had failed in watchfulness before ([Sol
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#006)); now when converted, she is the
more jealous of subtle sins ([Psa
139:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#023)). In spiritual winter certain
evils are frozen up, as well as good; in the spring of revivals these
start up unperceived, crafty, false teachers, spiritual pride,
uncharitableness, &c. ([Psa 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012);
[Mat 13:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#026); [Luk
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#014); [Ti2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017); [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015)). "Little" sins are parents of
the greatest ([Ecc 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001); [Co1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006)). Historically, John the Baptist
spared not the fox-like Herod ([Luk
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032)), who gave vine-like promise of
fruit at first ([Mar 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#020)), at the
cost of his life; nor the viper-Sadducees, &c.; nor the varied subtle
forms of sin ([Luk 3:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#007)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">sol 2:16</span></span>

mine . . . his--rather, "is for me . . . for Him" ([Hos
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#003)), where, as here, there is the
assurance of indissoluble union, in spite of temporary absence. [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017), entreating Him to return, shows
that He has gone, perhaps through her want of guarding against the
"little sins" ([Sol 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#015)). The order
of the clauses is reversed in [Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003), when she is riper in faith: there
she rests more on her being His; here, on His being hers; and no doubt
her sense of love to Him is a pledge that she is His ([Joh
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#021), [Joh
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023); [Co1
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#003)); this is her consolation in His
withdrawal now.

I am his--by creation ([Psa 100:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa100.htm#003)), by
redemption ([Joh 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010); [Rom
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#008); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)).

feedeth--as a "roe," or gazelle ([Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017)); instinct is sure to lead him
back to his feeding ground, where the lilies abound. So Jesus Christ,
though now withdrawn, the bride feels sure will return to His favorite
resting-place ([Sol 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#010); [Psa
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)). So hereafter ([Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003)). [Psa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001), title, terms his lovely bride's
"lilies" \[HENGSTENBERG\] pure and white, though among thorns ([Sol
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002)).

[Song of Solomon (Canticles) 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sol 2:17</span></span>

Night--is the image of the present world ([Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)). "Behold men as if dwelling in
subterranean cavern" \[PLATO, Republic, 7.1\].

Until--that is, "Before that," &c.

break--rather, "breathe"; referring to the refreshing breeze of dawn in
the East; or to the air of life, which distinguishes morning from the
death-like stillness of night. MAURER takes this verse of the approach
of night, when the breeze arises after the heat of day (compare [Gen
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#008), Margin, with [Gen
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001)), and the "shadows" are lost in
night ([Psa 102:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#011)); thus our life
will be the day; death, the night ([Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004)). The English Version better
accords with ([Sol 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#001)). "By night"
([Rom 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)).

turn--to me.

Bether--Mountains of Bithron, separated from the rest of Israel by the
Jordan ([Sa2 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#029)), not far from
Bethabara, where John baptized and Jesus was first manifested. Rather,
as Margin, "of divisions," and Septuagint, mountains intersected with
deep gaps, hard to pass over, separating the bride and Jesus Christ. In
[Sol 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#014) the mountains are of spices,
on which the roe feeds, not of separation; for at His first coming He
had to overpass the gulf made by sin between Him and us ([Zac
4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006)); in His second, He will only
have to come down from the fragrant hill above to take home His prepared
bride. Historically, in the ministry of John the Baptist, Christ's call
to the bride was not, as later ([Sol
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#008)), "Come with me," but "Come away,"
namely, to meet Me ([Sol 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#002), [Sol
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#010), [Sol
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#013)). Sitting in darkness ([Mat
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016)), she "waited" and "looked"
eagerly for Him, the "great light" ([Luk
1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079); [Luk
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025), [Luk
2:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#038)); at His rising, the shadows of
the law ([Col 2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001)) were to "flee away." So we wait
for the second coming, when means of grace, so precious now, shall be
superseded by the Sun of righteousness ([Co1
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#010), [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012); [Rev
21:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022)). The Word is our light until
then ([Pe2 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)).
