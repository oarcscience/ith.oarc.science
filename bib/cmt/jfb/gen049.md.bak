### [Genesis Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 49:1</span></span>

PATRIARCHAL BLESSING. (Gen. 49:1-33)

Jacob called unto his sons--It is not to the sayings of the dying saint,
so much as of the inspired prophet, that attention is called in this
chapter. Under the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit he pronounced
his prophetic benediction and described the condition of their
respective descendants in the last days, or future times.

[Genesis 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 49:10</span></span>

JUDAH--A high pre-eminence is destined to this tribe ([Num
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#014.md); [Jdg
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002).md). Besides the honor of giving name
to the Promised Land, David, and a greater than David--the
Messiah--sprang from it. Chief among the tribes, "it grew up from a
lion's whelp"--that is, a little power--till it became "an old
lion"--that is, calm and quiet, yet still formidable. ([Gen
49:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008).md)

until Shiloh come--Shiloh--this obscure word is variously interpreted to
mean "the sent" ([Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003).md), "the
seed" ([Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001).md), the "peaceable or
prosperous one" ([Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md) --that is,
the Messiah ([Isa 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010.md); [Rom
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012).md); and when He should come, "the
tribe of Judah should no longer boast either an independent king or a
judge of their own" \[CALVIN\]. The Jews have been for eighteen
centuries without a ruler and without a judge since Shiloh came, and "to
Him the gathering of the people has been."

[Genesis 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gen 49:14</span></span>

ISSACHAR-- ([Gen 49:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#014).md)

a strong ass couching down between two burdens--that is, it was to be
active, patient, given to agricultural labors. It was established in
lower Galilee--a "good land," settling down in the midst of the
Canaanites, where, for the sake of quiet, they "bowed their shoulder to
bear, and became a servant unto tribute."

[Genesis 49:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 49:17</span></span>

DAN--though the son of a secondary wife, was to be "as one of the tribes
of Israel." ([Gen 49:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016).md)

Dan--"a judge."

a serpent . . . an adder--A serpent, an adder, implies subtlety and
stratagem; such was pre-eminently the character of Samson, the most
illustrious of its judges.

[Genesis 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">gen 49:22</span></span>

JOSEPH-- ([Gen 49:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022).md)

a fruitful bough, &c.--denotes the extraordinary increase of that tribe
(compare [Num 1:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#033.md); [Jos
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#017.md); [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017).md). The patriarch describes him as
attacked by envy, revenge, temptation, ingratitude; yet still, by the
grace of God, he triumphed over all opposition, so that he became the
sustainer of Israel; and then he proceeds to shower blessings of every
kind upon the head of this favorite son. The history of the tribes of
Ephraim and Manasseh shows how fully these blessings were realized.

[Genesis 49:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">gen 49:27</span></span>

BENJAMIN ([Gen 49:27-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#027).md)

shall ravin like a wolf--This tribe in its early history spent its
energies in petty or inglorious warfare and especially in the violent
and unjust contest (Jdg. 19:1-20:48), in which it engaged with the other
tribes, when, notwithstanding two victories, it was almost exterminated.

[Genesis 49:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 49:28</span></span>

all these are the twelve tribes of Israel--or ancestors. Jacob's
prophetic words obviously refer not so much to the sons as to the tribes
of Israel.

[Genesis 49:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">gen 49:29</span></span>

he charged them--The charge had already been given and solemnly
undertaken ([Gen 47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031).md). But in
mentioning his wishes now and rehearsing all the circumstances connected
with the purchase of Machpelah, he wished to declare, with his latest
breath, before all his family, that he died in the same faith as
Abraham.

[Genesis 49:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 49:33</span></span>

when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons--It is probable that
he was supernaturally strengthened for this last momentous office of the
patriarch, and that when the divine afflatus ceased, his exhausted
powers giving way, he yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his
people.
