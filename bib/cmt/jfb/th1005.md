### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 5:1</span></span>

THE SUDDENNESS OF CHRIST'S COMING A MOTIVE FOR WATCHFULNESS; VARIOUS
PRECEPTS: PRAYER FOR THEIR BEING FOUND BLAMELESS, BODY, SOUL, AND
SPIRIT, AT CHRIST'S COMING: CONCLUSION. (1Th. 5:1-28)

times--the general and indefinite term for chronological periods.

seasons--the opportune times ([Dan
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012); [Act
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)). Time denotes quantity; season,
quality. Seasons are parts of times.

ye have no need--those who watch do not need to be told when the hour
will come, for they are always ready \[BENGEL\].

cometh--present: expressing its speedy and awful certainty.

[1 Thessalonians 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 5:2</span></span>

as a thief in the night--The apostles in this image follow the parable
of their Lord, expressing how the Lord's coming shall take men by
surprise ([Mat 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#043); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010)). "The night is wherever there is
quiet unconcern" \[BENGEL\]. "At midnight" (perhaps figurative: to some
parts of the earth it will be literal night), [Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006). The thief not only gives no
notice of his approach but takes all precaution to prevent the household
knowing of it. So the Lord ([Rev
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#015)). Signs will precede the coming,
to confirm the patient hope of the watchful believer; but the coming
itself shall be sudden at last ([Mat
24:32-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#032); [Luk
21:25-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#025), [Luk
21:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 5:3</span></span>

they--the men of the world. [Th1
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005); [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013), "others," all the rest of the
world save Christians.

Peace-- ([Jdg 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#007), [Jdg
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#009), [Jdg
18:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg018.htm#027); [Jer
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014); [Eze
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#010)).

then--at the very moment when they least expect it. Compare the case of
Belshazzar, [Dan 5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#001), [Dan
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#009), [Dan
5:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#026); Herod, [Act
12:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021).

sudden--"unawares" ([Luk 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034)).

as travail--"As the labor pang" comes in an instant on the woman when
otherwise engaged ([Psa 48:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#006); [Isa
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#008)).

shall not escape--Greek, "shall not at all escape." Another awful
feature of their ruin: there shall be then no possibility of shunning it
however they desire it ([Amo 9:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002);
[Rev 6:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 5:4</span></span>

not in darkness--not in darkness of understanding (that is, spiritual
ignorance) or of the moral nature (that is, a state of sin), [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018).

that--Greek, "in order that"; with God results are all purposed.

that day--Greek, "THE day"; the day of the Lord ([Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025), "the day"), in contrast to
"darkness."

overtake--unexpectedly (compare [Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035)).

as a thief--The two oldest manuscripts read, "as (the daylight
overtakes) thieves" ([Job 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#017)). Old
manuscripts and Vulgate read as English Version.

[1 Thessalonians 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 5:5</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts read, "FOR ye are all," &c. Ye have no reason for
fear, or for being taken by surprise, by the coming of the day of the
Lord: "For ye are all sons (so the Greek) of light and sons of day"; a
Hebrew idiom, implying that as sons resemble their fathers, so you are
in character light (intellectually and morally illuminated in a
spiritual point of view), [Luk 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008);
[Joh 12:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#036).

are not of--that is, belong not to night nor darkness. The change of
person from "ye" to "we" implies this: Ye are sons of light because ye
are Christians; and we, Christians, are not of night nor darkness.

[1 Thessalonians 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 5:6</span></span>

others--Greek, "the rest" of the world: the unconverted ([Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)). "Sleep" here is worldly apathy
to spiritual things ([Rom 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011); [Eph
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014)); in [Th1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007), ordinary sleep; in [Th1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010), death.

watch--for Christ's coming; literally, "be wakeful." The same Greek
occurs in [Co1 15:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034); [Ti2
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026).

be sober--refraining from carnal indulgence, mental or sensual ([Pe1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 5:7</span></span>

This verse is to be taken in the literal sense. Night is the time when
sleepers sleep, and drinking men are drunk. To sleep by day would imply
great indolence; to be drunken by day, great shamelessness. Now, in a
spiritual sense, "we Christians profess to be day people, not night
people; therefore our work ought to be day work, not night work; our
conduct such as will bear the eye of day, and such has no need of the
veil of night" \[EDMUNDS\], ([Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 5:8</span></span>

Faith, hope, and love, are the three pre-eminent graces ([Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003); [Co1
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#013)). We must not only be awake and
sober, but also armed; not only watchful, but also guarded. The armor
here is only defensive; in [Eph
6:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013), also offensive. Here,
therefore, the reference is to the Christian means of being guarded
against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night.
The helmet and breastplate defend the two vital parts, the head and the
heart respectively. "With head and heart right, the whole man is right"
\[EDMUNDS\]. The head needs to be kept from error, the heart from sin.
For "the breastplate of righteousness," [Eph
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014), we have here "the breastplate of
faith and love"; for the righteousness which is imputed to man for
justification, is "faith working by love" ([Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003), [Rom
4:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#022); [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006)). "Faith," as the motive within,
and "love," exhibited in outward acts, constitute the perfection of
righteousness. In [Eph 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017) the helmet
is "salvation"; here, "the hope of salvation." In one aspect "salvation"
is a present possession ([Joh 3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036);
[Joh 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024); [Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013)); in another, it is a matter of
"hope" ([Rom 8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024)). Our Head
primarily wore the "breastplate of righteousness" and "helmet of
salvation," that we might, by union with Him, receive both.

[1 Thessalonians 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 5:9</span></span>

For--assigning the ground of our "hopes" ([Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008)).

appointed us--Translate, "set" ([Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047)), in His everlasting purpose of
love ([Th1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)). Contrast [Rom
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).

to--that is, unto wrath.

to obtain--Greek, "to the acquisition of salvation"; said, according to
BENGEL, Of One saved out of a general wreck, when all things else have
been lost: so of the elect saved out of the multitude of the lost ([Th2
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)). The fact of God's
"appointment" of His grace "through Jesus Christ" ([Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)), takes away the notion of our
being able to "acquire" salvation of ourselves. Christ "acquired (so the
Greek for 'purchased') the Church (and its salvation) with His own
blood" ([Act 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)); each member is
said to be appointed by God to the "acquiring of salvation." In the
primary sense, God does the work; in the secondary sense, man does it.

[1 Thessalonians 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 5:10</span></span>

died for us--Greek, "in our behalf."

whether we wake or sleep--whether we be found at Christ's coming awake,
that is, alive, or asleep, that is, in our graves.

together--all of us together; the living not preceding the dead in their
glorification "with Him" at His coming ([Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 5:11</span></span>

comfort yourselves--Greek, "one another." Here he reverts to the same
consolatory strain as in [Th1 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#018).

edify one another--rather as Greek, "edify (ye) the one the other";
"edify," literally, "build up," namely, in faith, hope, and love, by
discoursing together on such edifying topics as the Lord's coming, and
the glory of the saints ([Mal 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 5:12</span></span>

beseech--"Exhort" is the expression in [Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014); here, "we beseech you," as if it
were a personal favor (Paul making the cause of the Thessalonian
presbyters, as it were, his own).

know--to have a regard and respect for. Recognize their office, and
treat them accordingly (compare [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018)) with reverence and with
liberality in supplying their needs ([Ti1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017)). The Thessalonian Church having
been newly planted, the ministers were necessarily novices ([Ti1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006)), which may have been in part the
cause of the people's treating them with less respect. Paul's practice
seems to have been to ordain elders in every Church soon after its
establishment ([Act 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023)).

them which labour . . . are over . . . admonish you--not three classes
of ministers, but one, as there is but one article common to the three
in the Greek. "Labor" expresses their laborious life; "are over you,"
their pre-eminence as presidents or superintendents ("bishops," that is,
overseers, [Phi 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001), "them that have
rule over you," literally, leaders, [Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017); "pastors," literally,
shepherds, [Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)); "admonish you,"
one of their leading functions; the Greek is "put in mind," implying not
arbitrary authority, but gentle, though faithful, admonition ([Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014), [Ti2
2:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024); [Pe1
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003)).

in the Lord--Their presidency over you is in divine things; not in
worldly affairs, but in things appertaining to the Lord.

[1 Thessalonians 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 5:13</span></span>

very highly--Greek, "exceeding abundantly."

for their work's sake--The high nature of their work alone, the
furtherance of your salvation and of the kingdom of Christ, should be a
sufficient motive to claim your reverential love. At the same time, the
word "work," teaches ministers that, while claiming the reverence due to
their office, it is not a sinecure, but a "work"; compare "labor" (even
to weariness: so the Greek), [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012).

be at peace among yourselves--The "and" is not in the original. Let
there not only be peace between ministers and their flocks, but also no
party rivalries among yourselves, one contending in behalf of some one
favorite minister, another in behalf of another ([Mar
9:50](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050); [Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012); [Co1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 5:14</span></span>

brethren--This exhortation to "warm (Greek, 'admonish,' as in [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)) the unruly (those 'disorderly'
persons, [Th2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006), [Th2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#011), who would not work, and yet
expected to be maintained, literally, said of soldiers who will not
remain in their ranks, compare [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011); also those insubordinate as to
Church discipline, in relation to those 'over' the Church, [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)), comfort the feeble-minded (the
faint-hearted, who are ready to sink 'without hope' in afflictions, [Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013), and temptations)," applies to
all clergy and laity alike, though primarily the duty of the clergy (who
are meant in [Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012))."

support--literally, "lay fast hold on so as to support."

the weak--spiritually. Paul practiced what he preached ([Co1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#022)).

be patient toward all men--There is no believer who needs not the
exercise of patience "toward" him; there is none to whom a believer
ought not to show it; many show it more to strangers than to their own
families, more to the great than to the humble; but we ought to show it
"toward all men" \[BENGEL\]. Compare "the long-suffering of our Lord"
([Co2 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001); [Pe2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#015)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 5:15</span></span>

([Rom 12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017); [Pe1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009).)

unto any man--whether unto a Christian, or a heathen, however great the
provocation.

follow--as a matter of earnest pursuit.

[1 Thessalonians 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 5:16</span></span>

In order to "rejoice evermore," we must "pray without ceasing" ([Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017)). He who is wont to thank God for
all things as happening for the best, will have continuous joy
\[THEOPHYLACT\]. [Eph 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018); [Phi
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004), [Phi
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006), "Rejoice in the Lord . . . by
prayer and supplication with thanksgiving"; [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017), "in the Holy Ghost"; [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012), "in hope"; [Act
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041), "in being counted worthy to
suffer shame for Christ's name"; [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002), in falling "into divers
temptations."

[1 Thessalonians 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 5:17</span></span>

The Greek is, "Pray without intermission"; without allowing prayerless
gaps to intervene between the times of prayer.

[1 Thessalonians 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">th1 5:18</span></span>

In every thing--even what seems adverse: for nothing is really so
(compare [Rom 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028); [Eph
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020)). See Christ's example ([Mat
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#036); [Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027); [Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021); [Joh
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#041)).

this--That ye should "rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, (and) in
every thing give thanks," "is the will of God in Christ Jesus (as the
Mediator and Revealer of that will, observed by those who are in Christ
by faith, compare [Phi 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014))
concerning you." God's will is the believer's law. LACHMANN rightly
reads commas at the end of the three precepts ([Th1
5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016)), making "this" refer to all
three.

[1 Thessalonians 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">th1 5:19</span></span>

Quench not--the Spirit being a holy fire: "where the Spirit is, He
burns" \[BENGEL\] ([Mat 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011); [Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051)). Do not throw cold water on
those who, under extraordinary inspiration of the Spirit, stand up to
speak with tongues, or reveal mysteries, or pray in the congregation.
The enthusiastic exhibitions of some (perhaps as to the nearness of
Christ's coming, exaggerating Paul's statement, [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002), By spirit), led others (probably
the presiding ministers, who had not always been treated with due
respect by enthusiastic novices, [Th1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012)), from dread of enthusiasm, to
discourage the free utterances of those really inspired, in the Church
assembly. On the other hand, the caution ([Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021)) was needed, not to receive "all"
pretended revelations as divine, without "proving" them.

[1 Thessalonians 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">th1 5:20</span></span>

prophesyings--whether exercised in inspired teaching, or in predicting
the future. "Despised" by some as beneath "tongues," which seemed most
miraculous; therefore declared by Paul to be a greater gift than
tongues, though the latter were more showy ([Co1
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#005)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">th1 5:21</span></span>

Some of the oldest manuscripts insert "But." You ought indeed not to
"quench" the manifestations of "the Spirit," nor "despise prophesyings";
"but," at the same time, do not take "all" as genuine which professes to
be so; "prove (test) all" such manifestations. The means of testing them
existed in the Church, in those who had the "discerning of spirits"
([Co1 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010); [Co1
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)). Another sure test, which we also
have, is, to try the professed revelation whether it accords with
Scripture, as the noble Bereans did ([Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020); [Act
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011); [Gal
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008)). This precept negatives the
Romish priest's assumption of infallibly laying down the law, without
the laity having the right, in the exercise of private judgment, to test
it by Scripture. LOCKE says, Those who are for laying aside reason in
matters of revelation, resemble one who would put out his eyes in order
to use a telescope.

hold fast that which is good--Join this clause with the next clause
([Th1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022)), not merely with the
sentence preceding. As the result of your "proving all things," and
especially all prophesyings, "hold fast ([Luk
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#015); [Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002); [Heb
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)) the good, and hold yourselves
aloof from every appearance of evil" ("every evil species" \[BENGEL and
WAHL\]). Do not accept even a professedly spirit-inspired communication,
if it be at variance with the truth taught you ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)).

[1 Thessalonians 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">th1 5:22</span></span>

TITTMANN supports English Version, "from every evil appearance" or
"semblance." The context, however, does not refer to evil appearances IN
OURSELVES which we ought to abstain from, but to holding ourselves aloof
from every evil appearance IN OTHERS; as for instance, in the pretenders
to spirit-inspired prophesyings. In many cases the Christian should not
abstain from what has the semblance ("appearance") of evil, though
really good. Jesus healed on the sabbath, and ate with publicans and
sinners, acts which wore the appearance of evil, but which were not to
be abstained from on that account, being really good. I agree with
TITTMANN rather than with BENGEL, whom ALFORD follows. The context
favors this sense: However specious be the form or outward appearance of
such would-be prophets and their prophesyings, hold yourselves aloof
from every such form when it is evil, literally, "Hold yourselves aloof
from every evil appearance" or "form."

[1 Thessalonians 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">th1 5:23</span></span>

the very God--rather as the Greek, "the God of peace Himself"; who can
do for you by His own power what I cannot do by all my monitions, nor
you by all your efforts ([Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020);
[Heb 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020)), namely, keep you from all
evil, and give you all that is good.

sanctify you--for holiness is the necessary condition of "peace" ([Phi
4:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006)).

wholly--Greek, "(so that you should be) perfect in every respect"
\[TITTMANN\].

and--that is, "and so (omit 'I pray God'; not in the Greek) may your . .
. spirit and soul and body be preserved," &c.

whole--A different Greek word from "wholly." Translate, "entire"; with
none of the integral parts wanting \[TITTMANN\]. It refers to man in his
normal integrity, as originally designed; an ideal which shall be
attained by the glorified believer. All three, spirit, soul, and body,
each in its due place, constitute man "entire." The "spirit" links man
with the higher intelligences of heaven, and is that highest part of man
which is receptive of the quickening Holy Spirit ([Co1
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#047)). In the unspiritual, the spirit
is so sunk under the lower animal soul (which it ought to keep under)
that such are termed "animal" (English Version. "sensual," having merely
the body of organized matter, and the soul the immaterial animating
essence), having not the Spirit (compare [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014); see on [Co1
15:44](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044); [Co1
15:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#046); [Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006)). The unbeliever shall rise with
an animal (soul-animated) body, but not like the believer with a
spiritual (spirit-endued) body like Christ's ([Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)).

blameless unto--rather as Greek, "blamelessly (so as to be in a
blameless state) at the coming of Christ." In Hebrew, "peace" and
"wholly" (perfect in every respect) are kindred terms; so that the
prayer shows what the title "God of peace" implies. BENGEL takes
"wholly" as collectively, all the Thessalonians without exception, so
that no one should fail. And "whole (entire)," individually, each one of
them entire, with "spirit, soul, and body." The mention of the
preservation of the body accords with the subject ([Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016)). TRENCH better regards "wholly"
as meaning, "having perfectly attained the moral end," namely, to be a
full-grown man in Christ. "Whole," complete, with no grace which ought
to be wanting in a Christian.

[1 Thessalonians 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">th1 5:24</span></span>

Faithful--to His covenant promises ([Joh
10:27-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009); [Co1
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)).

he that calleth you--God, the caller of His people, will cause His
calling not to fall short of its designed end.

do it--preserve and present you blameless at the coming of Christ ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Rom
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030); [Pe1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#010)). You must not look at the foes
before and behind, on the right hand and on the left, but to God's
faithfulness to His promises, God's zeal for His honor, and God's love
for those whom He calls.

[1 Thessalonians 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">th1 5:25</span></span>

Some oldest manuscripts read, "Pray ye also for (literally,
'concerning') us"; make us and our work the subject of your prayers,
even as we have been just praying for you ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023)). Others omit the "also." The
clergy need much the prayers of their flocks. Paul makes the same
request in the Epistles to Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,
Philemon, and in Second Corinthians; not so in the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, whose intercessions, as his spiritual sons, he was already
sure of; nor in the Epistles, I Corinthians, and Galatians, as these
Epistles abound in rebuke.

[1 Thessalonians 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">th1 5:26</span></span>

Hence it appears this Epistle was first handed to the elders, who
communicated it to "the brethren."

holy kiss--pure and chaste. "A kiss of charity" ([Pe1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#014)). A token of Christian fellowship
in those days (compare [Luk 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#045); [Act
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#037)), as it is a common mode of
salutation in many countries. The custom hence arose in the early Church
of passing the kiss through the congregation at the holy communion
\[JUSTIN MARTYR, Apology, 1.65; Apostolic Constitutions, 2.57\], the men
kissing the men, and the women the women, in the Lord. So in the Syrian
Church each takes his neighbor's right hand and gives the salutation,
"Peace."

[1 Thessalonians 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">th1 5:27</span></span>

I charge--Greek, "I adjure you."

read unto all--namely, publicly in the congregation at a particular
time. The Greek aorist tense implies a single act done at a particular
time. The earnestness of his adjuration implies how solemnly important
he felt this divinely inspired message to be. Also, as this was the
FIRST of the Epistles of the New Testament, he makes this the occasion
of a solemn charge, that so its being publicly read should be a sample
of what should be done in the case of the others, just as the Pentateuch
and the Prophets were publicly read under the Old Testament, and are
still read in the synagogue. Compare the same injunction as to the
public reading of the Apocalypse, the LAST of the New Testament canon
([Rev 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#003)). The "all" includes women
and children, and especially those who could not read it themselves
([Deu 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#012); [Jos
8:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#033)). What Paul commands with an
adjuration, Rome forbids under a curse \[BENGEL\]. Though these Epistles
had difficulties, the laity were all to hear them read ([Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010); even the very young, [Ti2
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005); [Ti2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015)). "Holy" is omitted before
"brethren" in most of the oldest manuscripts, though some of them
support it.

[1 Thessalonians 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">th1 5:28</span></span>

(See on [Co2 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#014).) Paul ends as he
began ([Th1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#001)), with "grace." The
oldest manuscripts omit "Amen," which probably was the response of the
Church after the public reading of the Epistle.

The subscription is a comparatively modern addition. The Epistle was
not, as it states, written from Athens, but from Corinth; for it is
written in the names of Silas and Timothy (besides Paul), who did not
join the apostle before he reached the latter city ([Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)).
