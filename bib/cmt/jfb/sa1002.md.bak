### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 2:1</span></span>

HANNAH'S SONG IN THANKFULNESS TO GOD. ([Sa1
2:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#001).md)

Hannah prayed, and said--Praise and prayer are inseparably conjoined in
Scripture ([Col 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002.md); [Ti1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001).md). This beautiful song was her
tribute of thanks for the divine goodness in answering her petition.

mine horn is exalted in the Lord--Allusion is here made to a peculiarity
in the dress of Eastern women about Lebanon, which seems to have
obtained anciently among the Israelite women, that of wearing a tin or
silver horn on the forehead, on which their veil is suspended. Wives,
who have no children, wear it projecting in an oblique direction, while
those who become mothers forthwith raise it a few inches higher,
inclining towards the perpendicular, and by this slight but observable
change in their headdress, make known, wherever they go, the maternal
character which they now bear.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 2:5</span></span>

they that were hungry ceased--that is, to hunger.

the barren hath born seven--that is, many children.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 2:6</span></span>

he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up--that is, He reduces to
the lowest state of degradation and misery, and restores to prosperity
and happiness.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 2:8</span></span>

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from
the dunghill--The dunghill, a pile of horse, cow, or camel offal, heaped
up to dry in the sun, and used as fuel, was, and is, one of the common
haunts of the poorest mendicants; and the change that had been made in
the social position of Hannah, appeared to her grateful heart as
auspicious and as great as the elevation of a poor despised beggar to
the highest and most dignified rank.

inherit the throne of glory--that is, possesses seats of honor.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">sa1 2:10</span></span>

the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth . . . exalt the horn of his
anointed--This is the first place in Scripture where the word
"anointed," or Messiah, occurs; and as there was no king in Israel at
the time, it seems the best interpretation to refer it to Christ. There
is, indeed, a remarkable resemblance between the song of Hannah and that
of Mary ([Luk 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#046).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">sa1 2:11</span></span>

the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest--He must have
been engaged in some occupation suited to his tender age, as in playing
upon the cymbals, or other instruments of music; in lighting the lamps,
or similar easy and interesting services.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 2:12</span></span>

THE SIN OF ELl'S SONS. ([Sa1 2:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#012).md)

Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial--not only careless and
irreligious, but men loose in their actions, and vicious and scandalous
in their habits. Though professionally engaged in sacred duties, they
were not only strangers to the power of religion in the heart, but they
had thrown off its restraints, and even ran, as is sometimes done in
similar cases by the sons of eminent ministers, to the opposite extreme
of reckless and open profligacy.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">sa1 2:13</span></span>

the priests' custom with the people--When persons wished to present a
sacrifice of peace offering on the altar, the offering was brought in
the first instance to the priest, and as the Lord's part was burnt, the
parts appropriated respectively to the priests and offerers were to be
sodden. But Eli's sons, unsatisfied with the breast and shoulder, which
were the perquisites appointed to them by the divine law ([Exo
29:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#027.md); [Lev
7:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031).md), not only claimed part of the
offerer's share, but rapaciously seized them previous to the sacred
ceremony of heaving or waving (see on [Lev
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#029).md); and moreover they committed the
additional injustice of taking up with their fork those portions which
they preferred, while still raw. Pious people revolted at such rapacious
and profane encroachments on the dues of the altar, as well as what
should have gone to constitute the family and social feast of the
offerer. The truth is, the priests having become haughty and unwilling
in many instances to accept invitations to those feasts, presents of
meat were sent to them; and this, though done in courtesy at first,
being, in course of time, established into a right, gave rise to all the
rapacious keenness of Eli's sons.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 2:18</span></span>

SAMUEL'S MINISTRY. ([Sa1 2:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018).md)

But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child--This notice of his
early services in the outer courts of the tabernacle was made to pave
the way for the remarkable prophecy regarding the high priest's family.

girded with a linen ephod--A small shoulder-garment or apron, used in
the sacred service by the inferior priests and Levites; sometimes also
by judges or eminent persons, and hence allowed to Samuel, who, though
not a Levite, was devoted to God from his birth.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 2:19</span></span>

his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to
year--Aware that he could not yet render any useful service to the
tabernacle, she undertook the expense of supplying him with wearing
apparel. All weaving stuffs, manufacture of cloth, and making of suits
were anciently the employment of women.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 2:20</span></span>

Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife--This blessing, like that which he had
formerly pronounced, had a prophetic virtue; which, before long,
appeared in the increase of Hannah's family ([Sa1
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021).md), and the growing qualifications
of Samuel for the service of the sanctuary.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 2:22</span></span>

the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle--This was an
institution of holy women of a strictly ascetic order, who had
relinquished worldly cares and devoted themselves to the Lord; an
institution which continued down to the time of Christ ([Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037).md). Eli was, on the whole, a good
man, but lacking in the moral and religious training of his family. He
erred on the side of parental indulgence; and though he reprimanded them
(see on [Deu 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018).md), yet, from fear or
indolence, he shrank from laying on them the restraints, or subjecting
them to the discipline, their gross delinquencies called for. In his
judicial capacity, he winked at their flagrant acts of maladministration
and suffered them to make reckless encroachments on the constitution, by
which the most serious injuries were inflicted both on the rights of the
people and the laws of God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 2:25</span></span>

they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because--it should be
therefore.

the Lord would slay them--It was not God's preordination, but their own
wilful and impenitent disobedience which was the cause of their
destruction.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">sa1 2:27</span></span>

A PROPHECY AGAINST ELI'S HOUSE. ([Sa1
2:27-35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027).md)

there came a man of God unto Eli, and said . . . that there shall not be
an old man in thine house--So much importance has always, in the East,
been attached to old age, that it would be felt to be a great calamity,
and sensibly to lower the respectability of any family which could boast
of few or no old men. The prediction of this prophet was fully confirmed
by the afflictions, degradation, poverty, and many untimely deaths with
which the house of Eli was visited after its announcement (see [Sa1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#011.md); [Sa1
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#003.md); [Sa1
22:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018.md); [Kg1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#027).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">sa1 2:31</span></span>

I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house--By the
withdrawal of the high priesthood from Eleazar, the elder of Aaron's two
sons (after Nadab and Abihu were destroyed, \[[Num
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#004)\].md), that dignity had been
conferred on the family of Ithamar, to which Eli belonged, and now that
his descendants had forfeited the honor, it was to be taken from them
and restored to the elder branch.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 2:32](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">sa1 2:32</span></span>

thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation--A successful rival for the
office of high priest shall rise out of another family ([Sa2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#035.md); [Ch1
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003.md); [Ch1
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#022).md). But the marginal reading,
"thou shalt see the affliction of the tabernacle," seems to be a
preferable translation.
