Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Mark Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001)

[Mark 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">mar 5:1</span></span>

And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of
the Gadarenes.

[Mark 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">mar 5:2</span></span>

And when he was come out of the ship, immediately--(see [Mar
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#006)).

there met him a man with an unclean spirit--"which had devils \[demons\]
long time" ([Luk 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027)). In Matthew
([Mat 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028)), "there met him two men
possessed with devils." Though there be no discrepancy between these two
statements--more than between two witnesses, one of whom testifies to
something done by one person, while the other affirms that there were
two--it is difficult to see how the principal details here given could
apply to more than one case.

[Mark 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">mar 5:3</span></span>

Who had his dwelling among the tombs--Luke ([Luk
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027)) says, "He ware no clothes,
neither abode in any house." These tombs were hewn out of the rocky
caves of the locality, and served for shelters and lurking places ([Luk
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026)).

[Mark 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">mar 5:4</span></span>

Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, &c.--Luke
says ([Luk 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#029)) that "oftentimes it
\[the unclean spirit\] had caught him"; and after mentioning how they
had vainly tried to bind him with chains and fetters, because, "he brake
the bands," he adds, "and was driven of the devil \[demon\] into the
wilderness." The dark tyrant--power by which he was held clothed him
with superhuman strength and made him scorn restraint. Matthew ([Mat
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028)) says he was "exceeding fierce,
so that no man might pass by that way." He was the terror of the whole
locality.

[Mark 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">mar 5:5</span></span>

And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs,
crying, and cutting himself with stones--Terrible as he was to others,
he himself endured untold misery, which sought relief in tears and
self-inflicted torture.

[Mark 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">mar 5:6</span></span>

But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him--not with the
spontaneous alacrity which says to Jesus, "Draw me, we will run after
thee," but inwardly compelled, with terrific rapidity, before the Judge,
to receive sentence of expulsion.

[Mark 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">mar 5:7</span></span>

What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure
thee by God, that thou torment me not--or, as in [Mat
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029), "Art Thou come to torment us
before the time?" (See on [Mar 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024)).
Behold the tormentor anticipating, dreading, and entreating exemption
from torment! In Christ they discern their destined Tormentor; the time,
they know, is fixed, and they feel as if it were come already! ([Jam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019)).

[Mark 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">mar 5:8</span></span>

For he said unto him--that is, before the unclean spirit cried out.

Come out of the man, unclean spirit!--Ordinarily, obedience to a command
of this nature was immediate. But here, a certain delay is permitted,
the more signally to manifest the power of Christ and accomplish His
purposes.

[Mark 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">mar 5:9</span></span>

And he asked him, What is thy name?--The object of this question was to
extort an acknowledgment of the virulence of demoniacal power by which
this victim was enthralled.

And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many--or, as in
Luke ([Luk 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#030)) "because many devils
\[demons\] were entered into him." A legion, in the Roman army,
amounted, at its full complement, to six thousand; but here the word is
used, as such words with us, and even this one, for an indefinitely
large number--large enough however to rush, as soon as permission was
given, into two thousand swine and destroy them.

[Mark 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">mar 5:10</span></span>

And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the
country--The entreaty, it will be observed, was made by one spirit, but
in behalf of many--"he besought Him not to send them, &c."--just as in
[Mar 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009), "he answered we are many."
But what do they mean by entreating so earnestly not to be ordered out
of the country? Their next petition ([Mar
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#012)) will make that clear enough.

[Mark 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">mar 5:11</span></span>

Now there was there, nigh unto the mountains--rather, "to the mountain,"
according to what is clearly the true reading. In [Mat
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030), they are said to have been "a
good way off." But these expressions, far from being inconsistent, only
confirm, by their precision, the minute accuracy of the narrative.

a great herd of swine feeding--There can hardly be any doubt that the
owners of these were Jews, since to them our Lord had now come to
proffer His services. This will explain what follows.

[Mark 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">mar 5:12</span></span>

And all the devils besought him, saying--"if thou cast us out" ([Mat
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#031)).

Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them--Had they spoken out
all their mind, perhaps this would have been it: "If we must quit our
hold of this man, suffer us to continue our work of mischief in another
form, that by entering these swine, and thus destroying the people's
property, we may steel their hearts against Thee!"

[Mark 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">mar 5:13</span></span>

And forthwith Jesus gave them leave--In Matthew ([Mat
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032)) this is given with majestic
brevity--"Go!" The owners, if Jews, drove an illegal trade; if heathens,
they insulted the national religion: in either case the permission was
just.

And the unclean spirits went out--of the man.

and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently--rushed.

down a steep place--down the hanging cliff.

into the sea (they were about two thousand)--The number of them is given
by this graphic Evangelist alone.

and were choked in the sea--"perished in the waters" ([Mat
8:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032)).

[Mark 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">mar 5:14</span></span>

And they that fed the swine fled, and told it--"told everything, and
what was befallen to the possessed of the devils" ([Mat
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#033)).

in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was
that was done--Thus had they the evidence, both of the herdsmen and of
their own senses, to the reality of both miracles.

[Mark 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">mar 5:15</span></span>

And they come to Jesus--Matthew ([Mat
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#034)) says, "Behold, the whole city
came out to meet Jesus."

and see him that was possessed with the devil--the demonized person.

and had the legion, sitting--"at the feet of Jesus," adds Luke ([Luk
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#035)); in contrast with his former
wild and wandering habits.

and clothed--As our Evangelist had not told us that he "ware no
clothes," the meaning of this statement could only have been conjectured
but for "the beloved physician" ([Luk
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027)), who supplies the missing piece
of information here. This is a striking case of what are called
Undesigned Coincidences amongst the different Evangelists; one of them
taking a thing for granted, as familiarly known at the time, but which
we should never have known but for one or more of the others, and
without the knowledge of which some of their statements would be
unintelligible. The clothing which the poor man would feel the want of
the moment his consciousness returned to him, was doubtless supplied to
him by some of the Twelve.

and in his right mind--but now, oh, in what a lofty sense! (Compare an
analogous, though a different kind of case, [Dan
4:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#034)).

and they were afraid--Had this been awe only, it had been natural
enough; but other feelings, alas! of a darker kind, soon showed
themselves.

[Mark 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">mar 5:16</span></span>

And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed
with the devil--("the demonized person").

and also concerning the swine--Thus had they the double testimony of the
herdsmen and their own senses.

[Mark 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">mar 5:17</span></span>

And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts--Was it the
owners only of the valuable property now lost to them that did this?
Alas, no! For Luke ([Luk 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#037)) says,
"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about
besought Him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear."
The evil spirits had thus, alas! their object. Irritated, the people
could not suffer His presence; yet awe-struck, they dared not order Him
off: so they entreat Him to withdraw, and--He takes them at their word.

[Mark 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">mar 5:18</span></span>

he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be
with him--the grateful heart, fresh from the hand of demons, clinging to
its wondrous Benefactor. How exquisitely natural!

[Mark 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">mar 5:19</span></span>

Howbeit, Jesus suffered him not, &c.--To be a missionary for Christ, in
the region where he was so well known and so long dreaded, was a far
nobler calling than to follow Him where nobody had ever heard of him,
and where other trophies not less illustrious could be raised by the
same power and grace.

[Mark 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">mar 5:20</span></span>

And he departed, and began to publish--not only among his friends, to
whom Jesus immediately sent him, but

in Decapolis--so called, as being a region of ten cities. (See on [Mat
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#025)).

how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did
marvel--Throughout that considerable region did this monument of mercy
proclaim his new-found Lord; and some, it is to be hoped, did more than
"marvel."

[Mark 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">mar 5:21</span></span>

THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS RAISED TO LIFE--THE WOMAN WITH AN ISSUE OF BLOOD
HEALED. ( = [Mat 9:18-26](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018); Luke
8:41-56). (Mark 5:21-43)

And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side--from
the Gadarene side of the lake, where He had parted with the healed
demoniac, to the west side, at Capernaum.

much people gathered unto him--who "gladly received Him; for they were
all waiting for Him" ([Luk 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#040)). The
abundant teaching earlier that day ([Mar
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#001), &c., and Mat. 13:1-58) had only
whetted the people's appetite: and disappointed, as would seem, that He
had left them in the evening to cross the lake, they remain hanging
about the beach, having got a hint, probably through some of His
disciples, that He would be back the same evening. Perhaps they
witnessed at a distance the sudden calming of the tempest. The tide of
our Lord's popularity was now fast rising.

and he was nigh unto the sea.

[Mark 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">mar 5:22</span></span>

And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue--of which
class there were but few who believed in Jesus ([Joh
7:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#048)). One would suppose from this
that the ruler had been with the multitude on the shore, anxiously
awaiting the return of Jesus, and immediately on His arrival had
accosted Him as here related. But Matthew ([Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)) tells us that the ruler came to
Him while He was in the act of speaking at His own table on the subject
of fasting; and as we must suppose that this converted publican ought to
know what took place on that memorable occasion when he made a feast to
his Lord, we conclude that here the right order is indicated by the
First Evangelist alone.

Jairus by name--or "Jaeirus." It is the same name as Jair, in the Old
Testament ([Num 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#041); [Jdg
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#003); [Est
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#005)).

and when he saw him, he fell at his feet--in Matthew ([Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)), "worshipped Him." The meaning
is the same in both.

[Mark 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">mar 5:23</span></span>

And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter--Luke ([Luk
8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042)) says, "He had one only daughter,
about twelve years of age." According to a well-known rabbin, quoted by
LIGHTFOOT, a daughter. till she had completed her twelfth year, was
called "little," or "a little maid"; after that, "a young woman."

lieth at the point of death--Matthew ([Mat
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#018)) gives it thus: "My daughter is
even now dead"--"has just expired." The news of her death reached the
father after the cure of the woman with the issue of blood: but
Matthew's brief account gives only the result, as in the case of the
centurion's servant ([Mat 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005), &c.).

come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall
live--or, "that she may be healed and live," according to a fully
preferable reading. In one of the class to which this man belonged, so
steeped in prejudice, such faith would imply more than in others.

The Woman with an Issue of Blood Healed ([Mar
5:24-34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#024)).

[Mark 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">mar 5:24</span></span>

And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged
him--The word in Luke ([Luk 8:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#042)) is
stronger--"choked," "stifled Him."

[Mark 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">mar 5:26</span></span>

And had suffered many things of many physicians--The expression perhaps
does not necessarily refer to the suffering she endured under medical
treatment, but to the much varied treatment which she underwent.

and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather
grew worse--pitiable case, and affectingly aggravated; emblem of our
natural state as fallen creatures ([Eze
16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#005)), and illustrating the worse
than vanity of all human remedies for spiritual maladies ([Hos
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013)). The higher design of all our
Lord's miracles of healing irresistibly suggests this way of viewing the
present case, the propriety of which will still more appear as we
proceed.

[Mark 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">mar 5:27</span></span>

When she had heard of Jesus, came--This was the right experiment at
last. What had she "heard of Jesus?" No doubt it was His marvellous
cures she had heard of; and the hearing of these, in connection with her
bitter experience of the vanity of applying to any other, had been
blessed to the kindling in her soul of a firm confidence that He who had
so willingly wrought such cures on others was able and would not refuse
to heal her also.

in the press behind--shrinking, yet seeking.

touched his garment--According to the ceremonial law, the touch of
anyone having the disease which this woman had would have defiled the
person touched. Some think that the recollection of this may account for
her stealthily approaching Him in the crowd behind, and touching but the
hem of His garment. But there was an instinct in the faith which brought
her to Jesus, which taught her, that if that touch could set her free
from the defiling disease itself, it was impossible to communicate
defilement to Him, and that this wondrous Healer must be above such
laws.

[Mark 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">mar 5:28</span></span>

For she said--"within herself" ([Mat
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#021)).

If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole--that is, if I may but
come in contact with this glorious Healer at all. Remarkable faith this!

[Mark 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">mar 5:29</span></span>

And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up--Not only was her
issue of blood stanched ([Luk 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#044)),
but the cause of it was thoroughly removed, insomuch that by her bodily
sensations she immediately knew herself perfectly cured.

[Mark 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">mar 5:30</span></span>

And Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue--or "efficacy."

had gone out of him--He was conscious of the forthgoing of His healing
power, which was not--as in prophets and apostles--something foreign to
Himself and imparted merely, but what He had dwelling within Him as "His
own fulness."

turned him about in the press--crowd.

and said, Who touched my clothes?

[Mark 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">mar 5:31</span></span>

And his disciples said unto him--Luke says ([Luk
8:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#045)), "When all denied, Peter and
they that were with Him said, Master."

Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched
me?--"Askest thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who touched Thee
not in such a throng." "And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched Me"--"a
certain person has touched Me"--"for I perceive that virtue is gone out
of Me" ([Luk 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#046)). Yes, the multitude
"thronged and pressed Him"--they jostled against Him, but all
involuntarily; they were merely carried along; but one, one only--"a
certain person--TOUCHED HIM," with the conscious, voluntary, dependent
touch of faith, reaching forth its hand expressly to have contact with
Him. This and this only Jesus acknowledges and seeks out. Even so, as
AUGUSTINE long ago said, multitudes still come similarly close to Christ
in the means of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the
crowd. The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric conductor
which alone draws virtue out of Him.

[Mark 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 5:32</span></span>

And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing--not for
the purpose of summoning forth a culprit, but, as we shall presently
see, to obtain from the healed one a testimony to what He had done for
her.

[Mark 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 5:33</span></span>

But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
her--alarmed, as a humble, shrinking female would naturally be, at the
necessity of so public an exposure of herself, yet conscious that she
had a tale to tell which would speak for her.

came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth--In Luke ([Luk
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047)) it is, "When the woman saw that
she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before Him, she
declared unto Him before all the people for what cause she had touched
Him, and how she was healed immediately." This, though it tried the
modesty of the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging
her forth, her public testimony to the facts of her case--the disease,
with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and perfect
relief which her touching the Great Healer had brought her.

[Mark 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 5:34</span></span>

And he said unto her, Daughter--"be of good comfort" ([Luk
8:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#048)).

thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy
plague--Though healed as soon as she believed, it seemed to her a stolen
cure--she feared to acknowledge it. Jesus therefore sets His royal seal
upon it. But what a glorious dismissal from the lips of Him who is "our
Peace" is that, "Go in peace!"

Jairus' Daughter Raised to Life ([Mar
5:35-43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035)).

[Mark 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 5:35</span></span>

Thy daughter is dead; why troublest thou the Master any further?--the
Teacher.

[Mark 5:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 5:36</span></span>

he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only
believe--Jesus, knowing how the heart of the agonized father would sink
at the tidings, and the reflections at the delay which would be apt to
rise in his mind, hastens to reassure him, and in His accustomed style:
"Be not afraid, only believe"--words of unchanging preciousness and
power! How vividly do such incidents bring out Christ's knowledge of the
human heart and tender sympathy! ([Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)).

[Mark 5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 5:37</span></span>

And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James--(See on [Mar
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#029)).

[Mark 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 5:38</span></span>

And he cometh--rather, "they come."

to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and
them that wept and wailed greatly--"the minstrels and the people making
a noise" ([Mat 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023)) --lamenting for
the dead. (See [Ch2 35:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#025); [Jer
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#020); [Amo
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016)).

[Mark 5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 5:39</span></span>

And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and
weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth--so brief her state of death
as to be more like a short sleep.

[Mark 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 5:40</span></span>

And they laughed him to scorn--rather, simply, "laughed at
Him"--"knowing that she was dead" ([Luk
8:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#053)); an important testimony this to
the reality of her death.

But when he had put them all out--The word is strong--"turned them all
out"; meaning all those who were making this noise, and any others that
may have been there from sympathy, that only those might be present who
were most nearly concerned, and those whom He had Himself brought as

and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

[Mark 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041)

precipitately to a crisis.

and commanded that something should be given her to eat--in token of
perfect restoration.
