### [1 Peter Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

[1 Peter 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 4:1</span></span>

LIKE THE RISEN CHRIST, BELIEVERS HENCEFORTH OUGHT TO HAVE NO MORE TO DO
WITH SIN. (1Pe. 4:1-19)

for us--supported by some oldest manuscripts and versions, omitted by
others.

in the flesh--in His mortal body of humiliation.

arm-- ([Eph 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011.md), [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013).md).

the same mind--of suffering with patient willingness what God wills you
to suffer.

he that hath suffered--for instance, Christ first, and in His person the
believer: a general proposition.

hath ceased--literally, "has been made to cease," has obtained by the
very fact of His having suffered once for all, a cessation from sin,
which had heretofore lain on Him ([Rom
6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md), especially, [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007).md). The Christian is by faith one
with Christ: as then Christ by death is judicially freed from sin; so
the Christian who has in the person of Christ died, has no more to do
with it judicially, and ought to have no more to do with it actually.
"The flesh" is the sphere in which sin has place.

[1 Peter 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 4:2</span></span>

That he, &c.--"That he (the believer, who has once for all obtained
cessation from sin by suffering, in the person of Christ, namely, in
virtue of his union with the crucified Christ) should no longer live the
rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of
God" as his rule. "Rest of his time in the flesh" (the Greek has the
preposition "in" here, not in [Pe1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md)
as to Christ) proves that the reference is here not to Christ, but to
the believer, whose remaining time for glorifying God is short ([Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md). "Live" in the truest sense, for
heretofore he was dead. Not as ALFORD, "Arm yourselves . . . with a view
no longer to live the rest of your time."

[1 Peter 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 4:3</span></span>

may suffice--Greek, "is sufficient." Peter takes the lowest ground: for
not even the past time ought to have been wasted in lust; but since you
cannot recall it, at least lay out the future to better account.

us--omitted in oldest manuscripts.

wrought--Greek, "wrought out."

Gentiles--heathen: which many of you were.

when, &c.--"walking as ye have done \[ALFORD\] in lasciviousness"; the
Greek means petulant, immodest, wantonness, unbridled conduct: not so
much filthy lust.

excess of wine--"wine-bibbings" \[ALFORD\].

abominable--"nefarious," "lawless idolatries," violating God's most
sacred law; not that all Peter's readers (see on [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001).md) walked in these, but many,
namely, the Gentile portion of them.

[1 Peter 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 4:4</span></span>

Wherein--In respect to which abandonment of your former walk ([Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md).

run not with them--eagerly, in troops \[BENGEL\].

excess--literally, "profusion"; a sink: stagnant water remaining after
an inundation.

riot--profligacy.

speaking evil--charging you with pride, singularity, hypocrisy, and
secret crimes ([Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md); [Pe2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#002).md). However, there is no "of you" in
the Greek, but simply "blaspheming." It seems to me always to be used,
either directly or indirectly, in the sense of impious reviling against
God, Christ, or the Holy Spirit, and the Christian religion, not merely
against men as such; Greek, [Pe1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md),
below.

[1 Peter 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 4:5</span></span>

They who now call you to account falsely, shall have to give account
themselves for this very evil-speaking ([Jde
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#015).md), and be condemned justly.

ready--very speedily ([Pe1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md). Christ's coming is to the
believer always near.

[1 Peter 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 4:6</span></span>

For--giving the reason for [Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md),
"judge the dead."

gospel preached also to . . . dead--as well as to them now living, and
to them that shall be found alive at the coming of the Judge. "Dead"
must be taken in the same literal sense as in [Pe1
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md), which refutes the explanation
"dead" in sins. Moreover, the absence of the Greek article does not
necessarily restrict the sense of "dead" to particular dead persons, for
there is no Greek article in [Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md)
also, where "the dead" is universal in meaning. The sense seems to be,
Peter, as representing the true attitude of the Church in every age,
expecting Christ at any moment, says, The Judge is ready to judge the
quick and dead--the dead, I say, for they, too, in their lifetime, have
had the Gospel preached to them, that so they might be judged at last in
the same way as those living now (and those who shall be so when Christ
shall come), namely, "men in the flesh," and that they might, having
escaped condemnation by embracing the Gospel so preached, live unto God
in the spirit (though death has passed over their flesh), [Luk
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038.md), thus being made like Christ in
death and in life (see on [Pe1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018).md).
He says, "live," not "made alive" or quickened; for they are supposed to
have been already "quickened together with Christ" ([Eph
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#005).md). This verse is parallel to [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md); compare Note, see on [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md). The Gospel, substantially, was
"preached" to the Old Testament Church; though not so fully as to the
New Testament Church. It is no valid objection that the Gospel has not
been preached to all that shall be found dead at Christ's coming. For
Peter is plainly referring only to those within reach of the Gospel, or
who might have known God through His ministers in Old and New Testament
times. Peter, like Paul, argues that those found living at Christ's
coming shall have no advantage above the dead who shall then be raised,
inasmuch as the latter live unto, or "according to," God, even already
in His purpose. ALFORD'S explanation is wrong, "that they might be
judged according to men as regards the flesh," that is, be in the state
of the completed sentence on sin, which is death after the flesh. For
"judged" cannot have a different meaning in this verse from what "judge"
bears in [Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md). "Live according to
God" means, live a life with God, such as God lives, divine; as
contrasted with "according to men in the flesh," that is, a life such as
men live in the flesh.

[1 Peter 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 4:7</span></span>

Resuming the idea in [Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005.md).

the end of all things--and therefore also of the wantonness ([Pe1
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md) of the wicked, and of the
sufferings of the righteous \[BENGEL\]. The nearness meant is not that
of mere "time," but that before the Lord; as he explains to guard
against misapprehension, and defends God from the charge of
procrastination: We live in the last dispensation, not like the Jews
under the Old Testament. The Lord will come as a thief; He is "ready"
([Pe1 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#005).md) to judge the world at any
moment; it is only God's long-suffering and His will that the Gospel
should be preached as a witness to all nations, that induces Him to
lengthen out the time which is with Him still as nothing.

sober--"self-restrained." The opposite duties to the sins in [Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003.md) are here inculcated. Thus "sober"
is the opposite of "lasciviousness" ([Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md).

watch--Greek, "be soberly vigilant"; not intoxicated with worldly cares
and pleasures. Temperance promotes wakefulness or watchfulness, and both
promote prayer. Drink makes drowsy, and drowsiness prevents prayer.

prayer--Greek, "prayers"; the end for which we should exercise
vigilance.

[1 Peter 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 4:8</span></span>

above all things--not that "charity" or love is placed above "prayer,"
but because love is the animating spirit, without which all other duties
are dead. Translate as Greek, "Having your mutual (literally, 'towards
yourselves') charity intense." He presupposes its existence among them;
he urges them to make it more fervent.

charity shall cover the multitude, &c.--The oldest manuscripts have
"covereth." Quoted from [Pro 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md);
compare [Pro 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md). "Covereth" so as
not harshly to condemn or expose faults; but forbearingly to bear the
other's burdens, forgiving and forgetting past offenses. Perhaps the
additional idea is included, By prayer for them, love tries to have them
covered by God; and so being the instrument of converting the sinner
from his error, "covereth a (not 'the,' as English Version) multitude of
sins"; but the former idea from Proverbs is the prominent one. It is
not, as Rome teaches, "covereth" his own sins; for then the Greek middle
voice would be used; and [Pro 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#012.md);
[Pro 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#009.md) support the Protestant view.
"As God with His love covers my sins if I believe, so must I also cover
the sins of my neighbor" \[LUTHER\]. Compare the conduct of Shem and
Japheth to Noah ([Gen 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#023).md), in
contrast to Ham's exposure of his father's shame. We ought to cover
others' sins only where love itself does not require the contrary.

[1 Peter 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 4:9</span></span>

([Rom 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#013.md); [Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002)..md) Not the spurious hospitality
which passes current in the world, but the entertaining of those needing
it, especially those exiled for the faith, as the representatives of
Christ, and all hospitality to whomsoever exercised from genuine
Christian love.

without grudging--Greek, "murmuring." "He that giveth, let him do it
with simplicity," that is open-hearted sincerity; with cordiality. Not
secretly speaking against the person whom we entertain, or upbraiding
him with the favor we have conferred in him.

[1 Peter 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 4:10</span></span>

every--"even as each man hath received," in whatever degree, and of
whatever kind. The Spirit's gifts (literally, "gift of grace," that is,
gratuitously bestowed) are the common property of the Christian
community, each Christian being but a steward for the edifying of the
whole, not receiving the gift merely for his own use.

minister the same--not discontentedly envying or disparaging the gift of
another.

one to another--Greek as in [Pe1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md),
"towards yourselves"; implying that all form but one body, and in
seeking the good of other members they are promoting the good of
themselves.

stewards--referring to [Mat 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015.md),
&c.; [Luk 19:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013.md).

[1 Peter 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 4:11</span></span>

If any . . . speak--namely, as a prophet, or divinely taught teacher in
the Church assembly.

as the, &c.--The Greek has no article: "as oracles of God." This may be
due to Greek: "God," having no article, it being a principle when a
governed noun omits the Greek article that the governing noun should
omit it, too. In [Act 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md) also, the
Greek article is wanting; thus English Version, "as the oracles of God,"
namely, the Old Testament, would be "right," and the precept be similar
to [Rom 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md), "prophesy according to
the analogy of the faith." But the context suits better thus, "Let him
speak as (becomes one speaking) oracles OF GOD." His divinely inspired
words are not his own, but God's, and as a steward ([Pe1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#010).md) having them committed to him, he
ought so to speak them. Jesus was the pattern in this respect ([Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029.md); [Joh
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#049.md); [Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md); compare Paul, [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017).md). Note, the very same term as is
applied in the only other passages where it occurs ([Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md); [Rom
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002.md); [Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012).md), to the Old Testament inspired
writings, is here predicated of the inspired words (the substance of
which was afterwards committed to writing) of the New Testament
prophets.

minister--in acts; the other sphere of spiritual activity besides
speaking.

as of--"out of" the store of his "strength" (Greek, physical power in
relation to outward service, rather than moral and intellectual
"ability"; so in [Mar 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030).md).

giveth--Greek, "supplieth"; originally said of a choragus, who supplied
the chorus with all necessaries for performing their several parts.

that God in all things may be glorified--the final end of all a
Christian's acts.

through Jesus Christ--the mediator through whom all our blessings come
down to us, and also through whom all our praises ascend to God. Through
Christ alone can God be glorified in us and our sayings and doings.

to whom--Christ.

be--Greek, "is."

for ever and ever--Greek, "unto the ages of the ages."

[1 Peter 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 4:12</span></span>

strange--they might think it strange that God should allow His chosen
children to be sore tried.

fiery trial--like the fire by which metals are tested and their dross
removed. The Greek adds, "in your case."

which is to try you--Greek, "which is taking place for a trial to you."
Instead of its "happening to you" as some strange and untoward chance,
it "is taking place" with the gracious design of trying you; God has a
wise design in it--a consolatory reflection.

[1 Peter 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 4:13</span></span>

inasmuch as--The oldest manuscripts read, "in proportion as"; "in as far
as" ye by suffering are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that is, by
faith enter into realizing fellowship with them; willingly for His sake
suffering as He suffered.

with exceeding joy--Greek, "exulting joy"; now ye rejoice amidst
sufferings; then ye shall EXULT, for ever free from sufferings ([Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md), [Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008).md). If we will not bear suffering
for Christ now, we must bear eternal sufferings hereafter.

[1 Peter 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 4:14</span></span>

for--Greek, "IN the name of Christ," namely, as Christians ([Pe1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md); [Pe1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014), above.md); "in My name, because ye
belong to Christ." The emphasis lies on this: [Pe1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015.md), "as a murderer, thief," &c.,
stands in contrast. Let your suffering be on account of Christ, not on
account of evil-doing ([Pe1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md).

reproached--Reproach affects noble minds more than loss of goods, or
even bodily sufferings.

the spirit . . . upon you--the same Spirit as rested on Christ ([Luk
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018).md). "The Spirit of glory" is His
Spirit, for He is the "Lord of glory" ([Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001).md). Believers may well overcome the
"reproach" (compare [Heb 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026).md),
seeing that "the Spirit of glory" rests upon them, as upon Him. It
cannot prevent the happiness of the righteous, if they are reproached
for Christ, because they retain before God their glory entire, as having
the Spirit, with whom glory is inseparably joined \[CALVIN\].

and of God--Greek, "and the (Spirit) of God"; implying that the Spirit
of glory (which is Christ's Spirit) is at the same time also the Spirit
of God.

on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is
glorified--omitted in the two oldest Greek manuscripts and Syriac and
Coptic versions, but supported by one very old manuscript, Vulgate,
Sahidic, CYPRIAN, &c. "Evil spoken of," literally, "blasphemed"; not
merely do they "speak against you," as in [Pe1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#016.md), but blasphemously mock Christ
and Christianity itself.

[1 Peter 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 4:15</span></span>

But--Greek, "For." "Reproached in the name of Christ" I say ([Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014).md), "FOR let none," &c.

as . . . as . . . as . . . as--the "as" twice in italics is not in the
Greek. The second Greek, "as," distinguishes the class "busybody in
other men's matters," from the previous class of delinquents.
Christians, from mistaken zeal, under the plea of faithfulness, might
readily step out of their own calling and make themselves judges of the
acts of unbelievers. Literally, "a bishop in what is (not his own, but)
another's" province; an allusion to the existing bishops or overseers of
the Church; a self-constituted bishop in others' concerns.

[1 Peter 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 4:16</span></span>

a Christian--the name given in contempt first at Antioch. [Act
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026.md); [Act
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md); the only three places where the
term occurs. At first believers had no distinctive name, but were called
among themselves "brethren," [Act 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003.md);
"disciples," [Act 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md); "those of the
way," [Act 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md); "saints," [Rom
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md); by the Jews (who denied that
Jesus was the CHRIST, and so would never originate the name Christian),
in contempt, "Nazarenes." At Antioch, where first idolatrous Gentiles
(Cornelius, [Act 10:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md), was not an
idolater, but a proselyte) were converted, and wide missionary work
began, they could be no longer looked on as a Jewish sect, and so the
Gentiles designated them by the new name "Christians." The rise of the
new name marked a new epoch in the Church's life, a new stage of its
development, namely, its missions to the Gentiles. The idle and witty
people of Antioch, we know from heathen writers, were famous for
inventing nicknames. The date of this Epistle must have been when this
had become the generally recognized designation among Gentiles (it is
never applied by Christians to each other, as it was in after ages--an
undesigned proof that the New Testament was composed when it professes),
and when the name exposed one to reproach and suffering, though not
seemingly as yet to systematic persecution.

let him not be ashamed--though the world is ashamed of shame. To suffer
for one's own faults is no honor ([Pe1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#015.md); [Pe1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#020).md), --for Christ, is no shame ([Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md); [Pe1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013).md).

but let him glorify God--not merely glory in persecution; Peter might
have said as the contrast, "but let him esteem it an honor to himself";
but the honor is to be given to God, who counts him worthy of such an
honor, involving exemption from the coming judgments on the ungodly.

on this behalf--The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "in this name,"
that is, in respect of suffering for such a name.

[1 Peter 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 4:17</span></span>

Another ground of consolation to Christians. All must pass under the
judgment of God; God's own household first, their chastisement being
here, for which they should glorify Him as a proof of their membership
in His family, and a pledge of their escape from the end of those whom
the last judgment shall find disobedient to the Gospel.

the time--Greek, "season," "fit time."

judgment must begin at the house of God--the Church of living believers.
Peter has in mind [Eze 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md); compare
[Amo 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002.md); [Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md). Judgment is already begun, the
Gospel word, as a "two-edged sword," having the double effect of saving
some and condemning others, and shall be consummated at the last
judgment. "When power is given to the destroyer, he observes no
distinction between the righteous and the wicked; not only so, but he
begins first at the righteous" \[WETSTEIN from Rabbins\]. But God limits
the destroyer's power over His people.

if . . . at us, what shall the end be of them, &c.--If even the godly
have chastening judgments now, how much more shall the ungodly be doomed
to damnatory judgments at last.

gospel of God--the very God who is to judge them.

[1 Peter 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 4:18</span></span>

scarcely--Compare "so as by fire," [Co1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#015.md); having to pass through trying
chastisements, as David did for his sin. "The righteous" man has always
more or less of trial, but the issue is certain, and the entrance into
the kingdom abundant at last. The "scarcely" marks the severity of the
ordeal, and the unlikelihood (in a mere human point of view) of the
righteous sustaining it; but the righteousness of Christ and God's
everlasting covenant make it all sure.

ungodly--having no regard for God; negative description.

sinner--loving sin; positive; the same man is at once God-forgetting and
sin-loving.

appear--in judgment.

[1 Peter 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 4:19</span></span>

General conclusion from [Pe1 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md).
Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are by God's will, to
chasten them that they may not perish with the world, they have good
reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings, persevering in
well-doing.

let them--Greek, "let them also," "let even them," as well as those not
suffering. Not only under ordinary circumstances, but also in time of
