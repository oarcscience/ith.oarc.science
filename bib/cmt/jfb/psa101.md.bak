In this Psalm the profession of the principles of his domestic and
political government testifies, as well as actions in accordance with
it, David's appreciation of God's mercy to him, and His judgment on his

A froward heart--or, "perverse heart" ([Psa
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026).md). Such a temper I will not
indulge, nor even know evil or wickedness.

[Psalms 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 101:5</span></span>

The slanderers and haughty persons, so mischievous in society, I will
disown; but--

[Psalms 101:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 101:6</span></span>

Mine eyes . . . upon--or, I will select reliable and honest men for my
servants.

[Psalms 101:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#007.md)

city of the Lord--or, "holy place" ([Psa
48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002).md), where wicked men shall not be
tolerated.
