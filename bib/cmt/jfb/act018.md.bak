### [Acts Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)

[Acts 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 18:1</span></span>

PAUL'S ARRIVAL AND LABORS AT CORINTH, WHERE HE IS REJOINED BY SILAS AND
TIMOTHY, AND, UNDER DIVINE ENCOURAGEMENT, MAKES A LONG STAY--AT LENGTH,
RETRACING HIS STEPS, BY EPHESUS, CÃ†SAREA, AND JERUSALEM, HE RETURNS FOR
THE LAST TIME TO ANTIOCH, THUS COMPLETING HIS SECOND MISSIONARY JOURNEY.
(Acts 18:1-22)

came to Corinth--rebuilt by Julius CÃ&brvbr;sar on the isthmus between
the Ã†gean and Ionian Seas; the capital of the Roman province of Achaia,
and the residence of the proconsul; a large and populous mercantile
city, and the center of commerce alike for East and West; having a
considerable Jewish population, larger, probably, at this time than
usual, owing to the banishment of the Jews from Rome by Claudius
CÃ&brvbr;sar ([Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md). Such a city
was a noble field for the Gospel, which, once established there, would
naturally diffuse itself far and wide.

[Acts 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 18:2</span></span>

a Jew . . . Aquila . . . with his wife Priscilla--From these Latin names
one would conclude that they had resided so long in Rome as to lose
their Jewish family names.

born in Pontus--the most easterly province of Asia Minor, stretching
along the southern shore of the Black Sea. From this province there were
Jews at Jerusalem on the great Pentecost ([Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009).md), and the Christians of it are
included among "the strangers of the dispersion," to whom Peter
addressed his first Epistle ([Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001).md). Whether this couple were
converted before Paul made their acquaintance, commentators are much
divided. They may have brought their Christianity with them from Rome
\[OLSHAUSEN\], or Paul may have been drawn to them merely by like
occupation, and, lodging with them, have been the instrument of their
conversion \[MEYER\]. They appear to have been in good circumstances,
and after travelling much, to have eventually settled at Ephesus. The
Christian friendship now first formed continued warm and unbroken, and
the highest testimony is once and again borne to them by the apostle.

Claudius, &c.--This edict is almost certainly that mentioned by
SUETONIUS, in his life of this emperor \[Lives of the CÃ&brvbr;sars,
"Claudius," 25\].

[Acts 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">act 18:3</span></span>

tentmakers--manufacturers, probably, of those hair-cloth tents supplied
by the goats of the apostle's native province, and hence, as sold in the
markets of the Levant, called cilicium. Every Jewish youth, whatever the
pecuniary circumstances of his parents, was taught some trade (see on
[Luk 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042).md), and Paul made it a point
of conscience to work at that which he had probably been bred to, partly
that he might not be burdensome to the churches, and partly that his
motives as a minister of Christ might not be liable to misconstruction.
To both these he makes frequent reference in his Epistles.

[Acts 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 18:4</span></span>

the Greeks--that is, Gentile proselytes; for to the heathen, as usual,
he only turned when rejected by the Jews ([Act
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006).md).

[Acts 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 18:5</span></span>

And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia--that is, from
Thessalonica, whither Silas had probably accompanied Timothy when sent
back from Athens (see on [Act 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015).md).

Paul was pressed in the spirit--rather (according to what is certainly
the true reading) "was pressed with the word"; expressing not only his
zeal and assiduity in preaching it, but some inward pressure which at
this time he experienced in the work (to convey which more clearly was
probably the origin of the common reading). What that pressure was we
happen to know, with singular minuteness and vividness of description,
from the apostle himself, in his first Epistles to the Corinthians and
Thessalonians ([Co1 2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md); [Th1
3:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001).md). He had come away from Athens,
as he remained there, in a depressed and anxious state of mind, having
there met, for the first time, with unwilling Gentile ears. He
continued, apparently for some time, laboring alone in the synagogue of
Corinth, full of deep and anxious solicitude for his Thessalonian
converts. His early ministry at Corinth was colored by these feelings.
Himself deeply humbled, his power as a preacher was more than ever felt
to lie in demonstration of the Spirit. At length Silas and Timotheus
arrived with exhilarating tidings of the faith and love of his
Thessalonian children, and of their earnest longing again to see their
father in Christ; bringing with them also, in token of their love and
duty, a pecuniary contribution for the supply of his wants. This seems
to have so lifted him as to put new life and vigor into his ministry. He
now wrote his FIRST EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS, in which the
"pressure" which resulted from all this strikingly appears. (See
Introduction to First Thessalonians). Such emotions are known only to
the ministers of Christ, and, even of them, only to such as "travail in
birth until Christ be formed in" their hearers.

[Acts 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 18:6</span></span>

Your blood be upon your own heads, &c.--See [Eze
33:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#004.md), [Eze
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#009.md).

from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles--Compare [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md).

[Acts 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 18:7</span></span>

he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named
Justus--not changing his lodging, as if Aquila and Priscilla up to this
time were with the opponents of the apostle \[ALFORD\], but merely
ceasing any more to testify in the synagogue, and henceforth carrying on
his labors in this house of Justus, which "joining hard to the
synagogue," would be easily accessible to such of its worshippers as
were still open to light. Justus, too, being probably a proselyte, would
more easily draw a mixed audience than the synagogue. From this time
forth conversions rapidly increased.

[Acts 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 18:8</span></span>

Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all
his house--an event felt to be so important that the apostle deviated
from his usual practice ([Co1 1:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014).md)
and baptized him, as well as Caius (Gaius) and the household of
Stephanas, with his own hand \[HOWSON\].

many of the Corinthians . . . believed and were baptized--The beginning
of the church gathered there.

[Acts 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 18:9</span></span>

Then spake the Lord to Paul . . . by a vision, Be not afraid . . . no
man shall set on thee to hurt thee, &c.--From this it would seem that
these signal successes were stirring up the wrath of the unbelieving
Jews, and probably the apostle feared being driven by violence, as
before, from this scene of such promising labor. He is reassured,
however, from above.

[Acts 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 18:10</span></span>

I have much people in this city--"whom in virtue of their election to
eternal life He already designates as His" (compare [Act
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048).md) \[BAUMGARTEN\].

[Acts 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 18:11</span></span>

continued there a year and six months--the whole period of this stay at
Corinth, and not merely up to what is next recorded. During some part of
this period he wrote his SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS. (See
Introduction to Second Thessalonians.)

[Acts 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 18:12</span></span>

when Gallio was the deputy--"the proconsul." See on [Act
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007.md). He was brother to the celebrated
philosopher SENECA, the tutor of Nero, who passed sentence of death on
both.

[Acts 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 18:13</span></span>

contrary to the--Jewish

law--probably in not requiring the Gentiles to be circumcised.

[Acts 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 18:14</span></span>

If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness--any offense punishable
by the magistrate.

[Acts 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 18:15</span></span>

if it be a question of words and names, and of your law . . . I will be
no judge, &c.--in this only laying down the proper limits of his office.

[Acts 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 18:16</span></span>

drave them, &c.--annoyed at such a case.

[Acts 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 18:17</span></span>

all the Greeks--the Gentile spectators.

took Sosthenes--perhaps the successor of Crispus, and certainly the head
of the accusing party. It is very improbable that this was the same
Sosthenes as the apostle afterwards calls "his brother" ([Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001).md).

and beat him before the judgment-seat--under the very eye of the judge.

And Gallio cared for none of those things--nothing loath, perhaps, to
see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves
getting what they hoped to inflict on another, and indifferent to
whatever was beyond the range of his office and case. His brother
eulogizes his loving and lovable manners. Religious indifference, under
the influence of an easy and amiable temper, reappears from age to age.

[Acts 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 18:18</span></span>

Paul . . . tarried . . . yet a good while--During his long residence at
Corinth, Paul planted other churches in Achaia ([Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001).md).

then took . . . leave of the brethren, and sailed . . . into--rather,
"for"

Syria--to Antioch, the starting-point of all the missions to the
Gentiles, which he feels to be for the present concluded.

with him Priscilla and Aquila--In this order the names also occur in
[Act 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md) (according to the true
reading); compare [Rom 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md); [Ti2
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019.md), which seem to imply that the
wife was the more prominent and helpful to the Church. Silas and
Timotheus doubtless accompanied the apostle, as also Erastus, Gaius, and
Aristarchus ([Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md), [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029).md). Of Silas, as Paul's associate,
we read no more. His name occurs last in connection with Peter and the
churches of Asia Minor \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

having shorn his head in Cenchrea--the eastern harbor of Corinth, about
ten miles distant, where a church had been formed ([Rom
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001).md).

for he--Paul.

had a vow--That it was the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:1-27) is not likely. It
was probably one made in one of his seasons of difficulty or danger, in
prosecution of which he cuts off his hair and hastens to Jerusalem to
offer the requisite sacrifice within the prescribed thirty days
\[JOSEPHUS, Wars of the Jews, 2.15.1\]. This explains the haste with
which he leaves Ephesus ([Act 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021).md),
and the subsequent observance, on the recommendation of the brethren, of
a similar vow ([Act 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024).md). This one
at Corinth was voluntary, and shows that even in heathen countries he
systematically studied the prejudices of his Jewish brethren.

[Acts 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 18:19</span></span>

he came to Ephesus--the capital of the Roman province of Asia. (See
Introduction to Ephesians). It was a sail, right across from the west to
the east side of the Ã†gean Sea, of some eight or ten days, with a fair
wind.

left them there--Aquila and Priscilla.

but he himself entered into the synagogue--merely taking advantage of
the vessel putting in there.

and reasoned with the Jews--the tense here not being the usual one
denoting continuous action (as in [Act
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md); [Act
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004).md), but that expressing a transient
act. He had been forbidden to preach the word in Asia ([Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006).md), but he would not consider that
as precluding this passing exercise of his ministry when Providence
brought him to its capital; nor did it follow that the prohibition was
still in force.

[Acts 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 18:20</span></span>

when they desired him to tarry--The Jews seldom rose against the Gospel
till the successful preaching of it stirred them up, and there was no
time for that here.

[Acts 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 18:21</span></span>

I must . . . keep this feast--probably Pentecost, presenting a noble
opportunity of preaching the Gospel.

but I will return--the fulfilment of which promise is recorded in [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md).

[Acts 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 18:22</span></span>

And when he had landed at CÃ&brvbr;sarea--where he left the vessel.

and gone up--that is, to Jerusalem.

and saluted the church--In these few words does the historian despatch
the apostle's FOURTH VISIT TO JERUSALEM after his conversion. The
expression "going up" is invariably used of a journey to the metropolis;
and thence he naturally "went down to Antioch." Perhaps the vessel
reached too late for the feast, as he seems to have done nothing in
Jerusalem beyond "saluting the Church," and privately offering the
sacrifice with which his vow ([Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018).md) would conclude. It is left to
be understood, as on his arrival from his first missionary tour, that
"when he was come, and had gathered the church together, he rehearsed
all that God had done with him" ([Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027).md) on this his second missionary
journey.

[Acts 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 18:23</span></span>

PAUL'S THIRD AND LAST MISSIONARY JOURNEY--HE VISITS THE CHURCHES OF
GALATIA AND PHRYGIA. (Acts 18:23-21:16)

And after he had spent some time there--but probably not long.

he departed--little thinking, probably, he was never more to return to
Antioch.

went over all . . . Galatia and Phrygia in order--visiting the several
churches in succession. See on [Act
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md). Galatia is mentioned first here,
as he would come to it first from Antioch. It was on this visitation
that he ordained the weekly collection ([Co1
16:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001).md), which has been since adopted
generally, and converted into a public usage throughout Christendom.
Timotheus and Erastus, Gaius and Aristarchus, appear to have accompanied
him on this journey ([Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md), [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001).md), and from Second Corinthians we
may presume, Titus also. The details of this visit, as of the former
([Act 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006).md), are not given.

[Acts 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 18:24</span></span>

EPISODE CONCERNING APOLLOS AT EPHESUS AND IN ACHAIA. ([Act
18:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024).md)

a . . . Jew named Apollos--a contraction from Apollonius.

born at Alexandria--the celebrated city of Egypt on the southeastern
shore of the Mediterranean, called after its founder, Alexander the
Great. Nowhere was there such a fusion of Greek, Jewish, and Oriental
peculiarities, and an intelligent Jew educated in that city could hardly
fail to manifest all these elements in his mental character.

eloquent--turning his Alexandrian culture to high account.

and mighty in the scriptures--his eloquence enabling him to express
clearly and enforce skilfully what, as a Jew, he had gathered from a
diligent study of the Old Testament Scriptures.

came to Ephesus--on what errand is not known.

[Acts 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 18:25</span></span>

This man was instructed in the way of the Lord . . . knowing only the
baptism of John--He was instructed, probably, by some disciple of the
Baptist, in the whole circle of John's teaching concerning Jesus, but no
more: he had yet to learn the new light which the outpouring of the
Spirit at Pentecost had thrown upon the Redeemer's death and
resurrection; as appears from [Act
19:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002.md).

being fervent in the spirit--His heart warm, and conscious, probably, of
his gifts and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he
had himself received.

he spake and taught diligently--rather, "accurately" (it is the same
word as is rendered "perfectly" in [Act
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026).md).

[Acts 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 18:26</span></span>

speak boldly in the synagogue, whom when Aquila and Priscilla
heard--joying to observe the extent of Scripture knowledge and
evangelical truth which he displayed, and the fervency, courage, and
eloquence with which he preached the truth.

they took him unto them--privately.

and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly--opening up those
truths, to him as yet unknown, on which the Spirit had shed such
glorious light. (In what appears to be the true reading of this verse,
Priscilla is put before Aquila, as in [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md) \[see on [Act
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md)\]; she being probably the more
intelligent and devoted of the two). One cannot but observe how
providential it was that this couple should have been left at Ephesus
when Paul sailed thence for Syria; and no doubt it was chiefly to pave
the way for the better understanding of this episode that the fact is
expressly mentioned by the historian in [Act
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019.md). We see here also an example of
not only lay agency (as it is called), but female agency of the highest
kind and with the most admirable fruit. Nor can one help admiring the
humility and teachableness of so gifted a teacher in sitting at the feet
of a Christian woman and her husband.

[Acts 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 18:27</span></span>

And when he was disposed--"minded," "resolved."

to pass into Achaia--of which Corinth, on the opposite coast (see on
[Act 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001).md), was the capital; there to
proclaim that Gospel which he now more fully comprehended.

the brethren--We had not before heard of such gathered at Ephesus. But
the desire of the Jews to whom Paul preached to retain him among them
for some time ([Act 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#020).md), and his
promise to return to them ([Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021).md), seem to indicate some drawing
towards the Gospel, which, no doubt, the zealous private labors of
Priscilla and Aquila would ripen into discipleship.

wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him--a beautiful specimen of
"letters of recommendation" (as [Act
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md), [Act
15:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025.md), and see [Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001).md); by which, as well as by
interchange of deputations, &c., the early churches maintained active
Christian fellowship with each other.

when he was come, helped them much--was a great acquisition to the
Achaian brethren.

which believed through grace--one of those incidental expressions which
show that faith's being a production of God's grace in the heart was so
current and recognized a truth that it was taken for granted, as a
necessary consequence of the general system of grace, rather than
expressly insisted on. (It is against the natural order of the words to
read them, as BENGEL, MEYER, and others, do, "helped through grace those
who believed").

[Acts 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 18:28</span></span>

For he mightily convinced the Jews--The word is very strong: "stoutly
bore them down in argument," "vigorously argued them down," and the
tense in that he continued to do it, or that this was the characteristic
of his ministry.

showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ--Rather, "that the
Christ (or Messiah) was Jesus." This expression, when compared with [Act
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025.md), seems to imply a richer
testimony than with his partial knowledge he was at first able to bear;
and the power with which he bore down all opposition in argument is that
which made him such an acquisition to the brethren. Thus his ministry
would be as good as another visitation to the Achaian churches by the
apostle himself (see [Co1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006).md) and the
more as, in so far as he was indebted for it to Priscilla and Aquila, it
would have a decidedly Pauline cast.
