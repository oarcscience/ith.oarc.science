### [Genesis Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 11:1</span></span>

CONFUSION OF TONGUES. (Gen. 11:1-32)

the whole earth was of one language. The descendants of Noah, united by
the strong bond of a common language, had not separated, and
notwithstanding the divine command to replenish the earth, were
unwilling to separate. The more pious and well-disposed would of course
obey the divine will; but a numerous body, seemingly the aggressive
horde mentioned ([Gen 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#010).md),
determined to please themselves by occupying the fairest region they
came to.

[Genesis 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 11:2</span></span>

land of Shinar--The fertile valley watered by the Euphrates and Tigris
was chosen as the center of their union and the seat of their power.

[Genesis 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 11:3</span></span>

brick--There being no stone in that quarter, brick is, and was, the only
material used for building, as appears in the mass of ruins which at the
Birs Nimroud may have been the very town formed by those ancient rebels.
Some of these are sun-dried--others burnt in the kiln and of different
colors.

slime--bitumen, a mineral pitch, which, when hardened, forms a strong
cement, commonly used in Assyria to this day, and forming the mortar
found on the burnt brick remains of antiquity.

[Genesis 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 11:4</span></span>

a tower whose top may reach unto heaven--a common figurative expression
for great height ([Deu 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#028); 9:1-6.md).

lest we be scattered--To build a city and a town was no crime; but to do
this to defeat the counsels of heaven by attempting to prevent
emigration was foolish, wicked, and justly offensive to God.

[Genesis 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 11:6</span></span>

and now nothing will be restrained from them--an apparent admission that
the design was practicable, and would have been executed but for the
divine interposition.

[Genesis 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 11:7</span></span>

confound their language--literally, "their lip"; it was a failure in
utterance, occasioning a difference in dialect which was intelligible
only to those of the same tribe. Thus easily by God their purpose was
defeated, and they were compelled to the dispersion they had combined to
prevent. It is only from the Scriptures we learn the true origin of the
different nations and languages of the world. By one miracle of tongues
men were dispersed and gradually fell from true religion. By another,
national barriers were broken down--that all men might be brought back
to the family of God.

[Genesis 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">gen 11:28</span></span>

Ur--now Orfa; that is, "light," or "fire." Its name probably derived
from its being devoted to the rites of fire-worship. Terah and his
family were equally infected with that idolatry as the rest of the
inhabitants ([Jos 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015).md).

[Genesis 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">gen 11:31</span></span>

Sarai his daughter-in-law--the same as Iscah \[[Gen
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#029.md)\], granddaughter of Terah,
probably by a second wife, and by early usages considered marriageable
to her uncle, Abraham.

they came unto Haran--two days' journey south-southeast from Ur, on the
direct road to the ford of the Euphrates at Rakka, the nearest and most
convenient route to Palestine.
