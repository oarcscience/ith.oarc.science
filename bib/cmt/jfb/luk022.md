### [Luke Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

[Luke 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 22:1</span></span>

CONSPIRACY OF THE JEWISH AUTHORITIES TO PUT JESUS TO DEATH--COMPACT WITH
JUDAS. ([Luk 22:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#001))

(See on [Mat 26:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#001).)

[Luke 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 22:3</span></span>

Then entered Satan, &c.--but not yet in the full sense. The awful stages
of it were these: (1) Covetousness being his master--passion, the Lord
let it reveal itself and gather strength by entrusting him with "the
bag" ([Joh 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#006)), as treasurer to
Himself and the Twelve. (2) In the discharge of that most sacred trust
he became "a thief," appropriating its contents from time to time to his
own use. Satan, seeing this door into his heart standing wide open,
determines to enter by it, but cautiously ([Co2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#011)); first merely "putting it into
his heart to betray Him" ([Joh 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#002)),
suggesting the thought to him that by this means he might enrich
himself. (3) This thought was probably converted into a settled purpose
by what took place in Simon's house at Bethany. (See [Mat
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#006), and see on [Joh
12:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#004).) (4) Starting back, perhaps,
or mercifully held back, for some time, the determination to carry it
into immediate effect was not consummated till, sitting at the paschal
supper, "Satan entered into him" (see on [Joh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027)), and conscience, effectually
stifled, only rose again to be his tormentor. What lessons in all this
for every one ([Eph 4:27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#027); [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007); [Pe1
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008))!

[Luke 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#005)

money--"thirty pieces of silver" ([Mat
26:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#015)); thirty shekels, the fine
payable for man- or maid-servant accidentally killed ([Exo
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032)), and equal to between four and
five pounds of our money--"a goodly price that I was priced at of them"
([Zac 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013)). (See on [Joh
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#016).)

[Luke 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 22:6</span></span>

in the absence, &c.--(See [Mat 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#005)).

[Luke 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 22:7</span></span>

LAST PASSOVER--INSTITUTION OF THE SUPPER--DISCOURSE AT THE TABLE. (Luke
22:7-38)

the day of unleavened bread--strictly the fifteenth Nisan (part of our
March and April) after the paschal lamb was killed; but here, the
fourteenth (Thursday). Into the difficult questions raised on this we
cannot here enter.

[Luke 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 22:10</span></span>

during the day.

19:29-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#029)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 22:14</span></span>

the hour--about six P.M. Between three and this hour the lamb was killed
([Exo 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#006), Margin)

[Luke 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 22:15</span></span>

With desire . . . desired--"earnestly have I longed" (as [Gen
31:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#030), "sore longedst"). Why? It was
to be His last "before He suffered"--and so became "Christ our Passover
sacrificed for us" ([Co1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007)), when it
was "fulfilled in the Kingdom of God," the typical ordinance thenceforth
disappearing.

divide it among, &c.--that is, It is to be your last as well as Mine,
"until the Kingdom of God come," or as it is beautifully given in [Mat
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#029), "until that day when I shall
drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom." It was the point of
transition between two economies and their two great festivals, the one
about to close for ever, the other immediately to open and run its
majestic career until from earth it be transferred to heaven.

[Luke 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 22:21</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 22:24</span></span>

there was--or "had been," referring probably to some symptoms of the
former strife which had reappeared, perhaps on seeing the whole paschal
arrangements committed to two of the Twelve. (See on [Mar
10:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042).)

[Luke 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#025)

[Luke 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 22:26</span></span>

But ye . . . not--Of how little avail has this condemnation of
"lordship" and vain titles been against the vanity of Christian
ecclesiastics?

human sympathy and support! (See on [Joh

16:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032).)

[Luke 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 22:29</span></span>

I appoint, &c.--Who is this that dispenses kingdoms, nay, the Kingdom of
kingdoms, within an hour or two of His apprehension, and less than a day
of His shameful death? These sublime contrasts, however, perpetually
meet and entrance us in this matchless history.

[Luke 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#030)

obtained"; alluding to Job ([Job
1:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006); [Job
2:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#001)), whom he solicited and obtained
that he might sift him as wheat, insinuating as "the accuser of the
brethren" ([Rev 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)), that he would
find chaff enough in his religion, if indeed there was any wheat at all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 22:33</span></span>

I am ready, &c.--honest-hearted, warmly-attached disciple, thinking thy
present feelings immovable as a rock, thou shalt find them in the hour
of temptation unstable as water: "I have been praying for thee,"
therefore thy faith shall not perish; but thinking this superfluous,
thou shalt find that "he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool" ([Pro
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#026)).

But now--that you are going forth not as before on a temporary mission,
provided for without purse or scrip, but into scenes of continued and
severe trial, your methods must be different; for purse and scrip will
now be needed for support, and the usual means of defense.

while His answer showed He meant something else.

as . . . wont--(See [Joh 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#002)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 22:40</span></span>

the place--the Garden of Gethsemane, on the west or city side of the
mount. Comparing all the accounts of this mysterious scene, the facts
appear to be these: (1) He bade nine of the Twelve remain "here" while
He went and prayed "yonder." (2) He "took the other three, Peter, James,
and John, and began to be sore amazed \[appalled\], sorrowful, and very
heavy \[oppressed\], and said, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
death"--"I feel as if nature would sink under this load, as if life were
ebbing out, and death coming before its time"--"tarry ye here, and watch
with Me"; not, "Witness for Me," but, "Bear Me company." It did Him
good, it seems, to have them beside Him. (3) But soon even they were too
much for Him: He must be alone. "He was withdrawn from them about a
stone's-cast"--though near enough for them to be competent witnesses and
kneeled down, uttering that most affecting prayer ([Mar
14:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#036)), that if possible "the cup," of
His approaching death, "might pass from Him, but if not, His Father's
will be done": implying that in itself it was so purely revolting that
only its being the Father's will would induce Him to taste it, but that
in that view of it He was perfectly prepared to drink it. It is no
struggle between a reluctant and a compliant will, but between two views
of one event--an abstract and a relative view of it, in the one of which
it was revolting, in the other welcome. By signifying how it felt in the
one view, He shows His beautiful oneness with ourselves in nature and
feeling; by expressing how He regarded it in the other light, He reveals
His absolute obediential subjection to His Father. (4) On this, having a
momentary relief, for it came upon Him, we imagine, by surges, He
returns to the three, and finding them sleeping, He addresses them
affectingly, particularly Peter, as in [Mar
14:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#037). He then (5) goes back, not
now to kneel, but fell on His face on the ground, saying the same words,
but with this turn, "If this cup may not pass," &c. ([Mat
26:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#042)) --that is, 'Yes, I understand
this mysterious silence ([Psa 22:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001));
it may not pass; I am to drink it, and I will'--"Thy will be done!" (6)
Again, for a moment relieved, He returns and finds them "sleeping for
sorrow," warns them as before, but puts a loving construction upon it,
separating between the "willing spirit" and the "weak flesh." (7) Once
more, returning to His solitary spot, the surges rise higher, beat more
tempestuously, and seem ready to overwhelm Him. To fortify Him for this,
"there appeared an angel unto Him from heaven strengthening Him"--not to
minister light or comfort (He was to have none of that, and they were
not needed nor fitted to convey it), but purely to sustain and brace up
sinking nature for a yet hotter and fiercer struggle. And now, He is "in
an agony, and prays more earnestly"--even Christ's prayer, it seems,
admitted of and now demanded such increase--"and His sweat was as it
were great drops \[literally, 'clots'\] of blood falling down to the
ground." What was this? Not His proper sacrificial offering, though
essential to it. It was just the internal struggle, apparently hushing
itself before, but now swelling up again, convulsing His whole inner
man, and this so affecting His animal nature that the sweat oozed out
from every pore in thick drops of blood, falling to the ground. It was
just shuddering nature and indomitable will struggling together. But
again the cry, If it must be, Thy will be done, issues from His lips,
and all is over. "The bitterness of death is past." He has anticipated
and rehearsed His final conflict, and won the victory--now on the
theater of an invincible will, as then on the arena of the Cross. "I
will suffer," is the grand result of Gethsemane: "It is finished" is the
shout that bursts from the Cross. The Will without the Deed had been all
in vain; but His work was consummated when He carried the now manifested
Will into the palpable Deed, "by the which WILL we are sanctified
THROUGH THE OFFERING OF THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST ONCE FOR ALL" ([Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)). (8) At the close of the whole
scene, finding them still sleeping (worn out with continued sorrow and
racking anxiety), He bids them, with an irony of deep emotion, "sleep on
now and take their rest, the hour is come, the Son of man is betrayed
into the hands of sinners, rise, let us be going, the traitor is at
hand." And while He spoke, Judas approached with his armed band. Thus
they proved "miserable comforters," broken reeds; and thus in His whole
work He was alone, and "of the people there was none with Him."
