### [Exodus Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 27:1</span></span>

ALTAR FOR BURNT OFFERING. (Exo. 27:1-21)

altar of shittim wood--The dimensions of this altar which was placed at
the entrance of the sanctuary were nearly three yards square, and a yard
and a half in height. Under the wooden frame of this chest-like altar
the inside was hollow, and each corner was to be terminated by
"horns"--angular projections, perpendicular or oblique, in the form of
horns. The animals to be sacrificed were bound to these ([Psa
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027).md), and part of the blood was
applied to them.

[Exodus 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 27:3</span></span>

shovels--fire shovels for scraping together any of the scattered ashes.

basons--for receiving the blood of the sacrifice to be sprinkled on the
people.

fleshhooks--curved, three-pronged forks ([Sa1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#013).md).

fire-pans--A large sort of vessel, wherein the sacred fire which came
down from heaven ([Lev 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md) was kept
burning, while they cleaned the altar and the grate from the coals and
ashes, and while the altar was carried from one place to another in the
wilderness \[PATRICK, SPENCER, LE CLERC\].

[Exodus 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">exo 27:4</span></span>

a grate of network of brass--sunk latticework to support the fire.

four brazen rings--by which the grating might be lifted and taken away
as occasion required from the body of the altar.

[Exodus 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 27:5</span></span>

put it under the compass of the altar beneath--that is, the grating in
which they were carried to a clean place ([Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012).md).

[Exodus 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 27:6</span></span>

staves . . . rings--Those rings were placed at the side through which
the poles were inserted on occasions of removal.

[Exodus 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">exo 27:9</span></span>

the court of the tabernacle--The enclosure in which the edifice stood
was a rectangular court, extending rather more than fifty yards in
length and half that space in breadth, and the enclosing parapet was
about three yards or half the height of the tabernacle. That parapet
consisted of a connected series of curtains, made of fine twined linen
yarn, woven into a kind of network, so that the people could see
through; but that large curtain which overhung the entrance was of a
different texture, being embroidered and dyed with variegated colors,
and it was furnished with cords for pulling it up or drawing it aside
when the priests had occasion to enter. The curtains of this enclosure
were supported on sixty brazen pillars which stood on pedestals of the
same metal, but their capitals and fillets were of silver, and the hooks
on which they were suspended were of silver also.

[Exodus 27:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">exo 27:19</span></span>

pins--were designed to hold down the curtains at the bottom, lest the
wind should waft them aside.

[Exodus 27:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">exo 27:20</span></span>

pure oil olive beaten--that is, such as runs from the olives when
bruised and without the application of fire.

for the light . . . Aaron and his sons--were to take charge of lighting
it in all time coming.

[Exodus 27:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">exo 27:21</span></span>

shall order it from evening to morning--The tabernacle having no
windows, the lamps required to be lighted during the day. JOSEPHUS says
that in his time only three were lighted; but his were degenerate times,
and there is no Scripture authority for this limitation. But although
the priests were obliged from necessity to light them by day, they might
have let them go out at night had it not been for this express
ordinance.
