### [Isaiah Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 2:1</span></span>

(Isa. 2:1-22)

The inscription.

The word--the revelation.

[Isaiah 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 2:2</span></span>

Same as [Mic 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md). As Micah prophesied
in Jotham's reign, and Isaiah in Uzziah's, Micah rests on Isaiah, whom
he confirms: not vice versa. HENGSTENBERG on slight grounds makes [Mic
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#001.md) the original.

last days--that is, Messiah's: especially the days yet to come, to which
all prophecy hastens, when "the house of the God of Jacob," namely, at
Jerusalem, shall be the center to which the converted nations shall
flock together ([Mat 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032.md); [Luk
2:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#031.md); [Act
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006).md); where "the kingdom" of Israel
is regarded as certain and the time alone uncertain ([Psa
68:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#015.md); [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008.md), [Psa
72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011).md).

mountain of the Lord's house . . . in the top, &c.--the temple on Mount
Moriah: type of the Gospel, beginning at Jerusalem, and, like an object
set on the highest hill, made so conspicuous that all nations are
attracted to it.

flow--as a broad stream ([Isa 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 2:3</span></span>

If the curse foretold against Israel has been literally fulfilled, so
shall the promised blessing be literal. We Gentiles must not, while
giving them the curse, deny them their peculiar blessing by
spiritualizing it. The Holy Ghost shall be poured out for a general
conversion then ([Jer 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md); [Zac
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#021.md), [Zac
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md); [Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028).md).

from Jerusalem-- ([Luk 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047).md) an
earnest of the future relations of Jerusalem to Christendom ([Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 2:4</span></span>

judge--as a sovereign umpire, settling all controversies (compare [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004).md). LOWTH translates "work,"
"conviction."

plowshares--in the East resembling a short sword ([Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md); [Zac
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 2:5</span></span>

The connection is: As Israel's high destiny is to be a blessing to all
nations ([Gen 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003).md), let Israel's
children walk worthy of it ([Eph 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 2:6</span></span>

Therefore--rather, "For": reasons why there is the more need of the
exhortation in [Isa 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#005.md).

thou--transition to Jehovah: such rapid transitions are natural, when
the mind is full of a subject.

replenished--rather, filled, namely, with the superstitions of the East,
Syria, and Chaldea.

soothsayers--forbidden ([Deu
18:10-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010).md).

Philistines--southwest of Palestine: antithesis to "the east."

please themselves--rather, join hands with, that is, enter into
alliances, matrimonial and national: forbidden ([Exo
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#032.md); [Neh
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#023), &c..md).

[Isaiah 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 2:7</span></span>

gold--forbidden to be heaped together ([Deu
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#017).md). Solomon disobeyed ([Kg1
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#021.md), [Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027).md).

horses . . . chariots--forbidden ([Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016).md). But Solomon disobeyed ([Kg1
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#026).md). Horses could be used
effectively for war in the plains of Egypt; not so in the hilly Judea.
God designed there should be as wide as possible a distinction between
Israel and the Egyptians. He would have His people wholly dependent on
Him, rather than on the ordinary means of warfare ([Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md). Also horses were connected with
idolatry ([Kg2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md); hence His
objection: so the transition to "idols" ([Isa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008).md) is natural.

[Isaiah 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 2:8</span></span>

([Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md). Not so much public
idolatry, which was not sanctioned in Uzziah's and Jotham's reign, but
(see [Kg2 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004.md), [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035).md) as private.

[Isaiah 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 2:9</span></span>

mean--in rank: not morally base: opposed to "the great man." The former
is in Hebrew, Adam, the latter, ish.

boweth--namely, to idols. All ranks were idolaters.

forgive . . . not--a threat expressed by an imperative. Isaiah so
identifies himself with God's will, that he prays for that which he
knows God purposes. So [Rev 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#006.md).

[Isaiah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 2:10</span></span>

Poetical form of expressing that, such were their sins, they would be
obliged by God's judgments to seek a hiding-place from His wrath ([Rev
6:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#015).md).

dust--equivalent to "caves of the earth," or dust ([Isa
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019).md).

for fear, &c.--literally, "from the face of the terror of the Lord."

[Isaiah 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 2:11</span></span>

lofty looks--literally, "eyes of pride" ([Psa
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027).md).

humbled--by calamities. God will so vindicate His honor "in that day" of
judgments, that none else "shall be exalted" ([Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 2:12</span></span>

Man has had many days: "the day of the Lord" shall come at last,
beginning with judgment, a never-ending day in which God shall be "all
in all" ([Co1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md); [Pe2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md).

every--not merely person, as English Version explains it, but every
thing on which the nation prided itself.

[Isaiah 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 2:13</span></span>

cedars . . . oaks--image for haughty nobles and princes ([Amo
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#009.md); [Zac
11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#001.md); compare [Rev
19:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#018).md).

Bashan--east of Jordan, north of the river Jabbok, famous for fine oaks,
pasture, and cattle. Perhaps in "oaks" there is reference to their
idolatry ([Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029).md).

[Isaiah 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 2:14</span></span>

high . . . hills--referring to the "high places" on which sacrifices
were unlawfully offered, even in Uzziah's (equivalent to Azariah) reign
([Kg2 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#004).md). Also, places of strength,
fastnesses in which they trusted, rather than in God; so

[Isaiah 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 2:15</span></span>

tower . . . wall--Towers were often made on the walls of cities.

fenced--strongly fortified.

[Isaiah 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 2:16</span></span>

Tarshish--Tartessus in southwest Spain, at the mouth of the
Guadalquivir, near Gibraltar. It includes the adjoining region: a
PhÅ“nician colony; hence its connection with Palestine and the Bible
([Ch2 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#021).md). The name was also used in
a wide sense for the farthest west, as our West Indies ([Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md); [Psa
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#007.md); [Psa
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010).md). "Ships of Tarshish" became a
phrase for richly laden and far-voyaging vessels. The judgment shall be
on all that minister to man's luxury (compare [Rev
18:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#017).md).

pictures--ordered to be destroyed ([Num
33:52](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#052).md). Still to be seen on the walls
of Nineveh's palaces. It is remarkable that whereas all other ancient
civilized nations, Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome, have left monuments in
the fine arts, Judea, while rising immeasurably above them in the
possession of "the living oracles," has left none of the former. The
fine arts, as in modern Rome, were so often associated with polytheism,
that God required His people in this, as in other respects, to be
separate from the nations ([Deu
4:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015).md). But Vulgate translation is
perhaps better, "All that is beautiful to the sight"; not only
paintings, but all luxurious ornaments. One comprehensive word for all
that goes before (compare [Rev 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md),
[Rev 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#014.md), [Rev
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 2:17</span></span>

Repeated from [Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), for emphatic
confirmation.

[Isaiah 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 2:18</span></span>

idols--literally, "vain things," "nothings" ([Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md). Fulfilled to the letter. Before
the Babylonian captivity the Jews were most prone to idolatry; in no
instance, ever since. For the future fulfilment, see [Zac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002.md); [Rev
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#015.md); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020.md).

[Isaiah 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 2:19</span></span>

The fulfilment answers exactly to the threat ([Isa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#010).md).

they--the idol-worshippers.

caves--abounding in Judea, a hilly country; hiding-places in times of
alarm ([Sa1 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md).

shake . . . earth--and the heavens also ([Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026).md). Figure for severe and
universal judgments.

[Isaiah 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 2:20</span></span>

moles--Others translate "mice." The sense is, under ground, in darkness.

bats--unclean birds ([Lev 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#019).md),
living amidst tenantless ruins ([Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 2:22</span></span>

The high ones ([Isa 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), [Isa
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013).md) on whom the people trust, shall
be "brought low" ([Isa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002).md); therefore
"cease from" depending on them, instead of on the Lord ([Psa
146:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003).md).
