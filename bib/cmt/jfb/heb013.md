Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Hebrews Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001)

[Hebrews 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 13:1</span></span>

EXHORTATION TO VARIOUS GRACES, ESPECIALLY CONSTANCY IN FAITH, FOLLOWING
JESUS AMIDST REPROACHES. CONCLUSION, WITH PIECES OF INTELLIGENCE AND
SALUTATIONS. (Heb. 13:1-25)

brotherly love--a distinct special manifestation of "charity" or "love"
([Pe2 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#007)). The Church of Jerusalem,
to which in part this Epistle was addressed, was distinguished by this
grace, we know from Acts (compare [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010); [Heb
10:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032); [Heb
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012)).

continue--Charity will itself continue. See that it continue with you.

[Hebrews 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 13:7</span></span>

Two manifestations of "brotherly love," hospitality and care for those
in bonds.

Be not forgetful--implying it was a duty which they all recognized, but
which they might forget to act on ([Heb
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003), [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007), [Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016)). The enemies of Christianity
themselves have noticed the practice of this virtue among Christians
\[JULIAN, Epistles, 49\].

entertained angels unawares--Abraham and Lot did so ([Gen
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002); [Gen
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#001)). To obviate the natural distrust
felt of strangers, Paul says, an unknown guest may be better than he
looks: he may be unexpectedly found to be as much a messenger of God for
good, as the angels (whose name means messenger) are; nay more, if a
Christian, he represents Christ Himself. There is a play on the same
Greek word, Be not forgetful and unaware; let not the duty of
hospitality to strangers escape you; for, by entertaining strangers, it
has escaped the entertainers that they were entertaining angels. Not
unconscious and forgetful of the duty, they have unconsciously brought
on themselves the blessing.

[Hebrews 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 13:3</span></span>

Remember--in prayers and acts of kindness.

bound with them--by virtue of the unity of the members in the body under
one Head, Christ ([Co1 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026)).

suffer adversity--Greek, "are in evil state."

being yourselves also in the body--and so liable to the adversities
incident to the natural body, which ought to dispose you the more to
sympathize with them, not knowing how soon your own turn of suffering
may come. "One experiences adversity almost his whole life, as Jacob;
another in youth, as Joseph; another in manhood, as Job; another in old
age" \[BENGEL\].

[Hebrews 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 13:4</span></span>

is, &c.--Translate, "Let marriage be treated as honorable": as [Heb
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005) also is an exhortation.

in all--"in the case of all men": "among all." "To avoid fornication let
EVERY MAN have his own wife" ([Co1
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002)). Judaism and Gnosticism combined
were soon about to throw discredit on marriage. The venerable
Paphnutius, in the Council of Nice, quoted this verse for the
justification of the married state. If one does not himself marry, he
should not prevent others from doing so. Others, especially Romanists,
translate, "in all things," as in [Heb
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018). But the warning being against
lasciviousness, the contrast to "whoremongers and adulterers" in the
parallel clause, requires the "in all" in this clause to refer to
persons.

the bed undefiled--Translate, as Greek requires "undefiled" to be a
predicate, not an epithet, "And let the bed be undefiled."

God will judge--Most whoremongers escape the notice of human tribunals;
but God takes particular cognizance of those whom man does not punish.
Gay immoralities will then be regarded in a very different light from
what they are now.

[Hebrews 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 13:5</span></span>

conversation--"manner of life." The love of filthy lust and the love of
filthy lucre follow one another as closely akin, both alienating the
heart from the Creator to the creature.

such things as ye have--literally, "present things" ([Phi
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#011)).

I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee--A promise tantamount to this
was given to Jacob ([Gen 28:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015)), to
Israel ([Deu 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#006), [Deu
31:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#008)), to Joshua ([Jos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#005)), to Solomon ([Ch1
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#020)). It is therefore like a divine
adage. What was said to them, extends also to us. He will neither
withdraw His presence ("never leave thee") nor His help ("nor forsake
thee") \[BENGEL\].

[Hebrews 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 13:6</span></span>

may--rather as Greek, expressing confidence actually realized, "So that
we boldly (confidently) say" ([Psa
56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004), [Psa
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#011); [Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006)). Punctuate as both the Hebrew
and the Greek require, "And (so) I will not fear: what (then) shall man
do unto me?"

[Hebrews 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 13:7</span></span>

Remember--so as to imitate: not to invoke in prayer, as Rome teaches.

have the rule--rather, "who have had the rule over you": your spiritual
leaders.

who--Greek, "the which": such persons as.

have spoken unto you--"spake" (so the Greek aorist means) during their
lifetime. This Epistle was among those written later, when many of the
heads of the Jerusalem Church had passed away.

whose faith--even unto death: probably death by martyrdom, as in the
case of the instances of faith in [Heb
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035). Stephen, James the brother of
our Lord and bishop of Jerusalem, as well as James the brother of John
([Act 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002)), in the Palestinian
Church, which Paul addresses, suffered martyrdom.

considering--Greek, "looking up to," "diligently contemplating all
over," as an artist would a model.

the end--the termination, at death. The Greek, is used of decease ([Luk
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031); [Pe2
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015)).

of their conversation--"manner of life": "religious walk" ([Gal
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013); [Eph
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022); [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012); [Jam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013)). Considering how they manifested
the soundness of their faith by their holy walk, which they maintained
even to the end of that walk (their death by martyrdom).

[Hebrews 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 13:8</span></span>

This verse is not, as some read it, in apposition with "the end of their
conversation" ([Heb 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)), but forms
the transition. "Jesus Christ, yesterday and to-day (is) the same, and
(shall be the same) unto the ages (that is, unto all ages)." The Jesus
Christ (the full name being given, to mark with affectionate solemnity
both His person and His office) who supported your spiritual rulers
through life even unto their end "yesterday" (in times past), being at
once "the Author and the Finisher of their faith" ([Heb
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)), remains still the same Jesus
Christ "to-day," ready to help you also, if like them you walk by
"faith" in Him. Compare "this same Jesus," [Act
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011). He who yesterday (proverbial for
the past time) suffered and died, is to-day in glory ([Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018)). "As night comes between
yesterday and to-day, and yet night itself is swallowed up by yesterday
and to-day, so the "suffering" did not so interrupt the glory of Jesus
Christ which was of yesterday, and that which is to-day, as not to
continue to be the same. He is the same yesterday, before He came into
the world, and to-day, in heaven. Yesterday in the time of our
predecessors, and to-day in our age" \[BENGEL\]. So the doctrine is the
same, not variable: this verse thus forms the transition between [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007) and [Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009). He is always "the same" ([Heb
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012)). The same in the Old and in the
New Testament.

[Hebrews 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 13:9</span></span>

about--rather, as oldest manuscripts read, "carried aside"; namely,
compare [Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).

divers--differing from the one faith in the one and the same Jesus
Christ, as taught by them who had the rule over you ([Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)).

strange--foreign to the truth.

doctrines--"teachings."

established with grace; not with meats--not with observances of Jewish
distinctions between clean and unclean meats, to which ascetic Judaizers
added in Christian times the rejection of some meats, and the use of
others: noticed also by Paul in [Co1
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008), [Co1
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013); [Co1
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013); [Rom
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017), an exact parallel to this
verse: these are some of the "divers and strange doctrines" of the
previous sentence. Christ's body offered once for all for us, is our
true spiritual "meat" to "eat" ([Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010)), "the stay and the staff of
bread" ([Isa 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001)), the mean of all
"grace."

which have not profited--Greek, "in which they who walked were not
profited"; namely, in respect to justification, perfect cleansing of the
conscience, and sanctification. Compare on "walked," [Act
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021); namely, with superstitious
scrupulosity, as though the worship of God in itself consisted in such
legal observances.

[Hebrews 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 13:10</span></span>

Christianity and Judaism are so totally distinct, that "they who serve
the (Jewish) tabernacle," have no right to eat our spiritual Gospel
meat, namely, the Jewish priests, and those who follow their guidance in
serving the ceremonial ordinance. He says, "serve the tabernacle," not
"serve IN the tabernacle." Contrast with this servile worship ours.

an altar--the cross of Christ, whereon His body was offered. The Lord's
table represents this altar, the cross; as the bread and wine represent
the sacrifice offered on it. Our meat, which we by faith spiritually
eat, is the flesh of Christ, in contrast to the typical ceremonial
meats. The two cannot be combined ([Gal
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#002)). That not a literal eating of the
sacrifice of Christ is meant in the Lord's Supper, but a spiritual is
meant, appears from comparing [Heb
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009) with [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010), "with GRACE, NOT with MEATS."

[Hebrews 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 13:11</span></span>

For just as "the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by . . . are burned without the camp," so "Jesus also that . .
. suffered without the gate" of ceremonial Judaism, of which His
crucifixion outside the gate of Jerusalem is a type.

for--reason why they who serve the tabernacle, are excluded from share
in Christ; because His sacrifice is not like one of those sacrifices in
which they had a share but answers to one which was "wholly burned"
outside (the Greek is "burnt completely," "consumed by burning"), and
which consequently they could not eat of. [Lev
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030), gives the general rule, "No sin
offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the
congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten; it
shall be burnt in the fire." The sin offerings are twofold: the outward,
whose blood was sprinkled on the outward altar, and of whose bodies the
priests might eat; and the inward, the reverse.

the sanctuary--here the Holy of Holies, into which the blood of the sin
offering was brought on the day of atonement.

without the camp--in which were the tabernacle and Levitical priests and
legal worshippers, during Israel's journey through the wilderness;
replaced afterwards by Jerusalem (containing the temple), outside of
whose walls Jesus was crucified.

[Hebrews 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 13:12</span></span>

Wherefore Jesus--In order that the Antitype might fulfil the type.

sanctify--Though not brought into the temple "sanctuary" ([Heb
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011)) His blood has been brought into
the heavenly sanctuary, and "sanctifies the people" ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011), [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)), by cleansing them from sin, and
consecrating them to God.

his own--not blood of animals.

without the gate--of Jerusalem; as if unworthy of the society of the
covenant-people. The fiery ordeal of His suffering on the cross, answers
to the burning of the victims; thereby His mere fleshly life was
completely destroyed, as their bodies were; the second part of His
offering was His carrying His blood into the heavenly holiest before God
at His ascension, that it should be a perpetual atonement for the
world's sin.

[Hebrews 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 13:13</span></span>

therefore--This "therefore" breathes the deliberate fortitude of
believers \[BENGEL\].

without the camp--"outside the legal polity" \[THEODORET\] of Judaism
(compare [Heb 13:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#011)) "Faith considers
Jerusalem itself as a camp, not a city" \[BENGEL\]. He contrasts with
the Jews, who serve an earthly sanctuary, the Christians to whom the
altar in heaven stands open, while it is closed against the Jews. As
Jesus suffered without the gate, so spiritually must those who desire to
belong to Him, withdraw from the earthly Jerusalem and its sanctuary, as
from this world in general. There is a reference to [Exo
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#007), when the tabernacle was moved
without the camp, which had become polluted by the people's idolatry of
the golden calves; so that "every one who sought the Lord went out unto
the tabernacle of the congregation (as Moses called the tabernacle
outside the camp), which was without the camp"; a lively type of what
the Hebrews should do, namely, come out of the carnal worship of the
earthly Jerusalem to worship God in Christ in spirit, and of what we all
ought to do, namely, come out from all carnalism, worldly formalism, and
mere sensuous worship, and know Jesus in His spiritual power apart from
worldliness, seeing that "we have no continuing city" ([Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)).

bearing--as Simon of Cyrene did.

his reproach--the reproach which He bare, and which all His people bear
with Him.

[Hebrews 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 13:14</span></span>

here--on earth. Those Hebrews who clung to the earthly sanctuary are
representatives of all who cling to this earth. The earthly Jerusalem
proved to be no "abiding city," having been destroyed shortly after this
Epistle was written, and with it fell the Jewish civil and religious
polity; a type of the whole of our present earthly order of things soon
to perish.

one to come-- ([Heb 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005); [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010), [Heb
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#014), [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022); [Phi
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)).

[Hebrews 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 13:15</span></span>

As the "altar" was mentioned in [Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010), so the "sacrifices" here
(compare [Pe1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005), namely, praise and
doing good, [Heb 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016)). Compare [Psa
119:108](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108); [Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).

By him--as the Mediator of our prayers and praises ([Joh
14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#013)); not by Jewish observances
([Psa 50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014), [Psa
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#023); [Psa
69:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#030); [Psa
107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022); [Psa
116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017)). It was an old saying of the
rabbis, "At a future time all sacrifices shall cease, but praises shall
not cease."

of praise--for salvation.

continually--not merely at fixed seasons, as those on which the legal
sacrifices were offered, but throughout all our lives.

fruit of our lips-- ([Isa 57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019); [Hos
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002)).

giving thanks--Greek, "confessing." BENGEL remarks that the Hebrew,
"todah," is beautifully emphatic. It literally means "acknowledgment" or
"confession." In praising a creature, we may easily exceed the truth;
but in praising God we have only to go on confessing what He really is
to us. Hence it is impossible to exceed the truth, and here is genuine
praise.

[Hebrews 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 13:16</span></span>

But--But the sacrifice of praise with the lips ([Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015)) is not enough; there must be
also doing good (beneficence) and communicating (that is, imparting a
share of your means, [Gal 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)) to the
needy.

with such--and not mere ritualistic sacrifices.

[Hebrews 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 13:17</span></span>

Obey them that have the rule over you--(Compare [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007), [Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024)). This threefold mention of the
rulers is peculiar to this Epistle. In other Epistles Paul includes the
rulers in his exhortations. But here the address is limited to the
general body of the Church, in contrast to the rulers to whom they are
charged to yield reverent submission. Now this is just what might be
expected when the apostle of the Gentiles was writing to the Palestine
Christians, among whom James and the eleven apostles had exercised a
more immediate authority. It was important he should not seem to set
himself in opposition to their guides, but rather strengthen their
hands; he claims no authority directly or indirectly over these rulers
themselves \[BIRKS\]. "Remember" your deceased rulers ([Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)). "Obey" your living rulers; nay,
more, not only obey in cases where no sacrifice of self is required, and
where you are persuaded they are right (so the Greek, for "obey"), but
"submit yourselves" as a matter of dutiful yielding, when your judgment
and natural will incline you in an opposite direction.

they--on their part; so the Greek. As they do their part, so do you
yours. So Paul exhorts, [Th1 5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012).

watch--"are vigilant" (Greek).

for--Greek, "in behalf of."

must give account--The strongest stimulus to watchfulness ([Mar
13:34-37](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#034)). CHRYSOSTOM was deeply
struck with these words, as he tells us \[On the Priesthood, 6\], "The
fear of this threat continually agitates my soul."

do it--"watch for your soul's eternal salvation." It is a perilous
responsibility for a man to have to give account for others' deeds, who
is not sufficient for his own \[ESTIUS, from AQUINAS\]. I wonder whether
it be possible that any of the rulers should be saved \[CHRYSOSTOM\].
Compare Paul's address to the elders, [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028); [Co1
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001), where also he connects
ministers' responsibility with the account to be hereafter given
(compare [Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004)).

with joy--at your obedience; anticipating, too, that you shall be their
"joy" in the day of giving account ([Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001)).

not with grief--at your disobedience; apprehending also that in the day
of account you may be among the lost, instead of being their crown of
rejoicing. In giving account, the stewards are liable to blame if aught
be lost to the Master. "Mitigate their toil by every office of attention
and respect, that with alacrity, rather than with grief, they may fulfil
their duty, arduous enough in itself, even though no unpleasantness be
added on your part" \[GROTIUS\].

that--Grief in your pastors is unprofitable for you, for it weakens
their spiritual power; nay, more, "the groans (so the Greek for 'grief')
of other creatures are heard; how much more of pastors!" \[BENGEL\]. So
God will be provoked to avenge on you their "groaning" (Greek). If they
must render God an account of their negligence, so must you for your
ingratitude to them \[GROTIUS\].

[Hebrews 13:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 13:18</span></span>

Pray for us--Paul usually requests the Church's intercessions for him in
closing his Epistles, just as he begins with assuring them of his having
them at heart in his prayers (but in this Epistle not till [Heb
13:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020)), [Rom
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030). "Us," includes both himself and
his companions; he passes to himself alone, [Heb
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019).

we trust we have a good conscience--in spite of your former jealousies,
and the charges of my Jewish enemies at Jerusalem, which have been the
occasion of my imprisonment at Rome. In refutation of the Jews'
aspersions, he asserts in the same language as here his own
conscientiousness before God and man, [Act
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001); [Act
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016), [Act
24:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020) (wherein he virtually implies
that his reply to Ananias was not sinful impatience; for, indeed, it was
a prophecy which he was inspired at the moment to utter, and which was
fulfilled soon after).

we trust--Greek, "we are persuaded," in the oldest manuscripts. Good
conscience produces confidence, where the Holy Spirit rules the
conscience ([Rom 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001)).

honestly--"in a good way." The same Greek word as "good conscience."
Literally, "rightly," "becomingly."

[Hebrews 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 13:19</span></span>

the rather--Greek, "I the more abundantly beseech you."

to do this--to pray for me.

that I may be restored to you-- ([Plm
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#022)). It is here first in the letter
he mentions himself, in a way so unobtrusive, as not to prejudice his
Hebrew readers against him, which would have been the result had he
commenced this as his other Epistles, with authoritatively announcing
his name and apostolic commission.

[Hebrews 13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 13:20</span></span>

Concluding prayer.

God of peace--So Paul, [Rom 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033);
[Rom 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011); [Phi
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009); [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Th2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016). The Judaizing of the Hebrews was
calculated to sow seeds of discord among them, of disobedience to their
pastors ([Heb 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)), and of
alienation towards Paul. The God of peace by giving unity of true
doctrine, will unite them in mutual love.

brought again from the dead--Greek, "brought up," &c.: God brought the
Shepherd; the Shepherd shall bring the flock. Here only in the Epistle
he mentions the resurrection. He would not conclude without mentioning
'the connecting link between the two truths mainly discussed; the one
perfect sacrifice and the continual priestly intercession--the depth of
His humiliation and the height of His glory--the "altar" of the cross
and the ascension to the heavenly Holy of Holies.

Lord Jesus--the title marking His person and His Lordship over us. But
[Heb 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021), "through Jesus Christ."
His office, as the Anointed of the Spirit, making Him the medium of
communicating the Spirit to us, the holy unction flowing down from the
Head on the members (compare [Act
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)).

great-- ([Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)).

shepherd of the sheep--A title familiar to his Hebrew readers, from
their Old Testament ([Isa 63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011);
Septuagint): primarily Moses, antitypically Christ: already compared
together, [Heb 3:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#002). The transition
is natural from their earthly pastors ([Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)), to the Chief Pastor, as in
[Pe1 5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001). Compare [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023) and Jesus' own words, [Joh
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#002), [Joh
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011), [Joh
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#014).

through the blood--Greek, "in," in virtue of the blood ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)); it was because of His bloody
death for us, that the Father raised and crowned Him with glory. The
"blood" was the seal of the everlasting covenant entered into between
the Father and Son; in virtue of the Son's blood, first Christ was
raised, then Christ's people shall be so ([Zac
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#011), seemingly referred to here; [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028)).

everlasting--The everlastingness of the covenant necessitated the
resurrection. This clause, "the blood of the everlasting covenant," is a
summary retrospect of the Epistle (compare [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012)).

[Hebrews 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 13:21</span></span>

Make you perfect--properly said of healing a rent; join you together in
perfect harmony \[BENGEL\].

to do his will, working in you-- ([Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036)); rather as Greek, "doing in
you." Whatever good we do, God does in us.

well-pleasing in his sight-- ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010); [Eph
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#010)).

through Jesus Christ--"God doing (working) in you that . . . through
Jesus Christ" ([Phi 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#011)).

to whom--to Christ. He closes as he began ([Heb
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)), with giving glory to Christ.

[Hebrews 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 13:22</span></span>

suffer the word--The Hebrews not being the section of the Church
assigned to Paul (but the Gentiles), he uses gentle entreaty, rather
than authoritative command.

few words--compared with what might be said on so important a subject.
Few, in an Epistle which is more of a treatise than an Epistle (compare
[Pe1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012)). On the seeming
inconsistency with [Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011), compare
Note, see on [Gal 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011).

[Hebrews 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 13:23</span></span>

our brother Timothy--So Paul, [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017); [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001); [Col
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#001); [Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002).

is set at liberty--from prison. So Aristarchus was imprisoned with Paul.
BIRKS translates, "dismissed," "sent away," namely, on a mission to
Greece, as Paul promised ([Phi 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#019)).
However, some kind of previous detention is implied before his being let
go to Philippi. Paul, though now at large, was still in Italy, whence he
sends the salutations of Italian Christians ([Heb
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024)), waiting for Timothy to join
him, so as to start for Jerusalem: we know from [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003), he and Timothy were together at
Ephesus after his departing from Italy eastward. He probably left
Timothy there and went to Philippi as he had promised. Paul implies that
if Timothy shall not come shortly, he will start on his journey to the
Hebrews at once.

[Hebrews 13:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 13:24</span></span>

all--The Scriptures are intended for all, young and old, not merely for
ministers. Compare the different classes addressed, "wives," [Eph
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022); little children, [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018); "all," [Pe1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#008); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005). He says here "all," for the
Hebrews whom he addresses were not all in one place, though the
Jerusalem Hebrews are chiefly addressed.

They of Italy--not merely the brethren at Rome, but of other places in
Italy.

[Hebrews 13:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 13:25</span></span>

Paul's characteristic salutation in every one of his other thirteen
Epistles, as he says himself, [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021), [Co1
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023); [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018); [Th2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017). It is found in no Epistle
written by any other apostle in Paul's lifetime. It is used in [Rev
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#021), written subsequently, and in
CLEMENT OF ROME. Being known to be his badge, it is not used by others
in his lifetime. The Greek here is, "The grace (namely, of our Lord
Jesus Christ) be with you all."
