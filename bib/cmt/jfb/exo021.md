### [Exodus Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

[Exodus 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 21:1</span></span>

LAWS FOR MENSERVANTS. ([Exo 21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#001))

judgments--rules for regulating the procedure of judges and magistrates
in the decision of cases and the trial of criminals. The government of
the Israelites being a theocracy, those public authorities were the
servants of the Divine Sovereign, and subject to His direction. Most of
these laws here noticed were primitive usages, founded on principles of
natural equity, and incorporated, with modifications and improvements,
in the Mosaic code.

[Exodus 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 21:2</span></span>

If thou buy an Hebrew servant--Every Israelite was free-born; but
slavery was permitted under certain restrictions. An Hebrew might be
made a slave through poverty, debt, or crime; but at the end of six
years he was entitled to freedom, and his wife, if she had voluntarily
shared his state of bondage, also obtained release. Should he, however,
have married a female slave, she and the children, after the husband's
liberation, remained the master's property; and if, through attachment
to his family, the Hebrew chose to forfeit his privilege and abide as he
was, a formal process was gone through in a public court, and a brand of
servitude stamped on his ear ([Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)) for life, or at least till the
Jubilee ([Deu 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017)).

[Exodus 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 21:7</span></span>

LAWS FOR MAIDSERVANTS. (Exo. 21:7-36)

if a man sell his daughter--Hebrew girls might be redeemed for a
reasonable sum. But in the event of her parents or friends being unable
to pay the redemption money, her owner was not at liberty to sell her
elsewhere. Should she have been betrothed to him or his son, and either
change their minds, a maintenance must be provided for her suitable to
her condition as his intended wife, or her freedom instantly granted.

[Exodus 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">exo 21:23</span></span>

eye for eye--The law which authorized retaliation (a principle acted
upon by all primitive people) was a civil one. It was given to regulate
the procedure of the public magistrate in determining the amount of
compensation in every case of injury, but did not encourage feelings of
private revenge. The later Jews, however, mistook it for a moral
precept, and were corrected by our Lord ([Mat
5:38-42](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038)).

[Exodus 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">exo 21:28</span></span>

If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die--For the purpose of
sanctifying human blood, and representing all injuries affecting life in
a serious light, an animal that occasioned death was to be killed or
suffer punishment proportioned to the degree of damage it had caused.
Punishments are still inflicted on this principle in Persia and other
countries of the East; and among a rude people greater effect is thus
produced in inspiring caution, and making them keep noxious animals
under restraint, than a penalty imposed on the owners.

[Exodus 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">exo 21:30</span></span>

If there be laid on him a sum of money, &c.--Blood fines are common
among the Arabs as they were once general throughout the East. This is
the only case where a money compensation, instead of capital punishment,
was expressly allowed in the Mosaic law.
