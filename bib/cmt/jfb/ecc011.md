### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 11:1</span></span>

([Ecc 11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001))

[Ecc 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002) shows that charity is here
inculcated.

bread--bread corn. As in the Lord's prayer, all things needful for the
body and soul. Solomon reverts to the sentiment ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)).

waters--image from the custom of sowing seed by casting it from boats
into the overflowing waters of the Nile, or in any marshy ground. When
the waters receded, the grain in the alluvial soil sprang up ([Isa
32:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#020)). "Waters" express multitudes,
so [Ecc 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002); [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015); also the seemingly hopeless
character of the recipients of the charity; but it shall prove at last
to have been not thrown away ([Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004)).

[Ecclesiastes 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 11:2</span></span>

portion--of thy bread.

seven--the perfect number.

eight--even to more than seven; that is, "to many" (so "waters," [Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001)), nay, even to very many in need
([Job 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019); [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005)).

evil--The day may be near, when you will need the help of those whom you
have bound to you by kindnesses ([Luk
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009)). The very argument which
covetous men use against liberality (namely, that bad times may come),
the wise man uses for it.

[Ecclesiastes 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 11:3</span></span>

clouds--answering to "evil" ([Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)), meaning, When the times of evil
are fully ripe, evil must come; and speculations about it beforehand, so
as to prevent one sowing seed of liberality, are vain ([Ecc
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004)).

tree--Once the storm uproots it, it lies either northward or southward,
according as it fell. So man's character is unchangeable, whether for
hell or heaven, once that death overtakes him ([Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011), [Rev
22:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#014)). Now is his time for
liberality, before the evil days come ([Ecc
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001)).

[Ecclesiastes 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 11:4</span></span>

Therefore sow thy charity in faith, without hesitancy or speculation as
to results, because they may not seem promising ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)). So in [Ecc
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#001), man is told to "cast his bread
corn" on the seemingly unpromising "waters" ([Psa
126:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#005)). The farmer would get on
badly, who, instead of sowing and reaping, spent his time in watching
the wind and clouds.

[Ecclesiastes 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 11:5</span></span>

spirit--How the soul animates the body! Thus the transition to the
formation of the body "in the womb" is more natural, than if with MAURER
we translate it "wind" ([Ecc 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#006); [Joh
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#008)).

bones . . . grow-- ([Job 10:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#008); [Psa
139:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#015)).

knowest not the works of God-- ([Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011); [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017); [Ecc
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012)).

[Ecclesiastes 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 11:6</span></span>

morning . . . evening--early and late; when young and when old; in
sunshine and under clouds.

seed--of godly works ([Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012); [Co2
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010); [Gal
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)).

prosper-- ([Isa 55:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#010)).

both . . . alike--Both the unpromising and the promising sowing may bear
good fruit in others; certainly they shall to the faithful sower.

[Ecclesiastes 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 11:7</span></span>

light--of life ([Ecc 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#011); [Psa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019)). Life is enjoyable, especially
to the godly.

[Ecclesiastes 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 11:8</span></span>

But while man thankfully enjoys life, "let him remember" it will not
last for ever. The "many days of darkness," that is, the unseen world
([Job 10:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021); [Psa
88:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#012)), also days of "evil" in this
world ([Ecc 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002)), are coming;
therefore sow the good seed while life and good days last, which are not
too long for accomplishing life's duties.

All that cometh--that is, All that followeth in the evil and dark days
is vain, as far as work for God is concerned ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)).

[Ecclesiastes 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 11:9</span></span>

Rejoice--not advice, but warning. So [Kg1
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#015), is irony; if thou dost rejoice
(carnally, [Ecc 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#002); [Ecc
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#002), not moderately, as in [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)), &c., then "know that . . . God
will bring thee into judgment" ([Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017); [Ecc
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014)).

youth . . . youth--distinct Hebrew words, adolescence or boyhood (before
[Ecc 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010)), and full-grown youth. It
marks the gradual progress in self-indulgence, to which the young
especially are prone; they see the roses, but do not discover the
thorns, until pierced by them. Religion will cost self-denial, but the
want of it infinitely more ([Luk
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#028)).

[Ecclesiastes 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 11:10</span></span>

sorrow--that is, the lusts that end in "sorrow," opposed to "rejoice,"
and "heart cheer thee" ([Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)),
Margin, "anger," that is, all "ways of thine heart"; "remove," &c., is
thus opposed to "walk in," &c. ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)).

flesh--the bodily organ by which the sensual thoughts of the "heart" are
embodied in acts.

childhood--rather, "boyhood"; the same Hebrew word as the first, "youth"
in [Ecc 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009). A motive for
self-restraint; the time is coming when the vigor of youth on which thou
reliest, will seem vain, except in so far as it has been given to God
([Ecc 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001)).

youth--literally, the dawn of thy days.
