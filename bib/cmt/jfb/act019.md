### [Acts Chapter 19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

[Acts 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">act 19:1</span></span>

SIGNAL SUCCESS OF PAUL AT EPHESUS. (Acts 19:1-41)

while Apollos was at Corinth--where his ministry was so powerful that a
formidable party in the Church of that city gloried in his type of
preaching in preference to Paul's ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012.md); [Co1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004).md), no doubt from the marked
infusion of Greek philosophic culture which distinguished it, and which
the apostle studiously avoided ([Co1
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001).md).

Paul having passed through the upper coasts--"parts," the interior of
Asia Minor, which, with reference to the seacoast, was elevated.

came to Ephesus--thus fulfilling his promise ([Act
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021).md).

finding certain disciples--in the same stage of Christian knowledge as
Apollos at first, newly arrived, probably, and having had no
communication as yet with the church at Ephesus.

[Acts 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 19:2</span></span>

Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?--rather, "Received ye
the Holy Ghost when ye believed?" implying, certainly, that the one did
not of necessity carry the other along with it (see on [Act
8:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014).md). Why this question was asked,
we cannot tell; but it was probably in consequence of something that
passed between them from which the apostle was led to suspect the
imperfection of their light.

We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost--This
cannot be the meaning, since the personality and office of the Holy
Ghost, in connection with Christ, formed an especial subject of the
Baptist's teaching. Literally, the words are, "We did not even hear
whether the Holy Ghost was (given)"; meaning, at the time of their
baptism. That the word "given" is the right supplement, as in [Joh
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#039.md), seems plain from the nature of
the case.

[Acts 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 19:4</span></span>

Then said Paul, John . . . baptized with the baptism of
repentance--water unto repentance.

saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should
come after him--that is, who should baptize with the Holy Ghost. The
point of contrast is not between John and Christ personally, but between
the water baptism of John unto repentance, and the promised baptism of
the Spirit from the hands of his coming Master unto new life. As to all
the facts, or at least the significancy, of this baptism, which made the
whole life and work of Christ another thing from what it was conceived
to be before it was vouchsafed, these simple disciples were
unenlightened.

[Acts 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">act 19:5</span></span>

When they heard this--not the mere words reported in [Act
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004.md), but the subject expounded
according to the tenor of those words.

they were baptized--not however by Paul himself ([Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014).md).

in the name of the Lord Jesus--into the whole fulness of the new
economy, as now opened up to their believing minds.

[Acts 19:6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 19:6</span></span>

And when Paul had laid his hands upon them . . . they spake with
tongues, &c.--See on [Act 10:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md).

[Acts 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 19:8</span></span>

he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for . . . three months,
&c.--See on [Act 17:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md).

[Acts 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 19:9</span></span>

when divers--"some."

were hardened, &c.--implying that others, probably a large number,
believed.

spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed--from the
synagogue, as at Corinth ([Act 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007).md).

and separated the disciples--withdrawing to a separate place of meeting,
for the sake both of the converts already made, and the unsophisticated
multitude.

disputing--"discoursing" or "discussing."

daily in the school--or lecture hall.

of one Tyrannus--probably a converted teacher of rhetoric or philosophy.

[Acts 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">act 19:10</span></span>

this continued . . . two years--in addition to the former three months.
See on [Act 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md). But during some
part of this period he must have paid a second unrecorded visit to
Corinth, since the one next recorded (see on [Act
20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#002).md) is twice called his third
visit ([Co2 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014.md); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001).md). See on [Co2
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015.md), which might seem inconsistent
with this. The passage across was quite a short one (see on [Act
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019).md) --Towards the close of this
long stay at Ephesus, as we learn from [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md), he wrote his FIRST EPISTLE TO
THE CORINTHIANS; also (though on this opinions are divided) the EPISTLE
TO THE GALATIANS. (See Introduction to First Corinthians, and
Introduction to Galatians). And just as at Corinth his greatest success
was after his withdrawal to a separate place of meeting ([Act
18:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007).md), so at Ephesus.

so that all they which dwelt in--the Roman province of

Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks--This is the
"great door and effectual opened unto him" while resident at Ephesus
([Co1 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).md), which induced him to make
it his headquarters for so long a period. The unwearied and varied
character of his labors here are best seen in his own subsequent address
to the elders of Ephesus ([Act 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#017.md),
&c.). And thus Ephesus became the "ecclesiastical center for the entire
region, as indeed it remained for a very long period" \[BAUMGARTEN\].
Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either
through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent out
in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon ([Col
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md); [Col
4:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md); [Plm
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#023).md).

[Acts 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">act 19:11</span></span>

God wrought special--no ordinary

miracles by the hands of Paul--implying that he had not been accustomed
to work such.

[Acts 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">act 19:12</span></span>

So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or
aprons, &c.--Compare [Act 5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md),
very different from the magical acts practiced at Ephesus. "God wrought
these miracles" merely "by the hands of Paul"; and the very exorcists
([Act 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013).md), observing that the name
of Jesus was the secret of all his miracles, hoped, by aping him in
this, to be equally successful; while the result of all in the
"magnifying of the Lord Jesus" ([Act
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017).md) showed that in working them the
apostle took care to hold up Him whom he preached as the source of all
the miracles which he wrought.

[Acts 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">act 19:13</span></span>

vagabond Jews--simply, "wandering Jews," who went from place to place
practicing exorcism, or the art of conjuring evil spirits to depart out
of the possessed. That such a power did exist, for some time at least,
seems implied in [Mat 12:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027.md). But no
doubt this would breed imposture; and the present case is very different
from that referred to in [Luk 9:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049.md).

We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth--a striking testimony to the
power of Christ's name in Paul's mouth.

[Acts 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 19:14</span></span>

seven sons of . . . Sceva . . . chief of the priests--head, possibly, of
one of the twenty-four courts.

[Acts 19:15](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">act 19:15</span></span>

the evil spirit answered, Jesus I know--"recognize."

and Paul I know--"know intimately," in contrast to them, whom he
altogether disowns.

but who are ye?

[Acts 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">act 19:16</span></span>

And the man in whom the evil spirit was--Mark the clear line of
demarcation here between "the evil spirit which answered and said" and
"the man in whom the evil spirit was." The reality of such possessions
could not be more clearly expressed.

leaped on them . . . so that they fled . . . naked and wounded--This was
so appalling a testimony at once against those profane impostors and in
favor of Paul and the Master whom he preached, that we wonder not that
it spread to "all the Jews and Greeks at Ephesus, that fear fell on
them," and that "the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."

[Acts 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">act 19:18</span></span>

many that believed came and confessed . . . their deeds--the dupes of
magicians, &c., acknowledging how shamefully they had been deluded, and
how deeply they had allowed themselves to be implicated in such
practices.

[Acts 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">act 19:19</span></span>

Many of them . . . which used curious arts--The word signifies things
"overdone"; significantly applied to arts in which laborious but
senseless incantations are practiced.

brought their books--containing the mystic formularies.

and burned them before all--The tense, here used graphically, expresses
progress and continuance of the conflagration.

counted the price . . . and found it fifty thousand pieces of
silver--about Â£2000 (presuming it to be the drachma, the current coin
of the Levant, of about 10d. value). From their nature they would be
costly, and books then bore a value above any standard we are familiar
with. The scene must have been long remembered at Ephesus, as a strong
proof of honest conviction on the part of the sorcerers and a striking
triumph of Jesus Christ over the powers of darkness. The workers of evil
were put to scorn, like Baal's priests on Carmel, and the word of God
mightily grew and prevailed \[HOWSON\].

[Acts 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">act 19:21</span></span>

After these things were ended--completed, implying something like a
natural finish to his long period of labor at Ephesus.

Paul purposed . . . when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to
go to Jerusalem . . . After I have been there, I must also see
Rome--Mark here the vastness of the apostle's missionary plans. They
were all fulfilled, though he "saw Rome" only as a prisoner.

[Acts 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 19:22</span></span>

So he sent into Macedonia . . . Timotheus and Erastus--as his pioneers,
in part to bring "them into remembrance of his ways which were in
Christ" ([Co1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017.md); [Co1
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010).md), partly to convey his mind on
various matters. After a brief stay he was to return ([Co1
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011).md). It is very unlikely that this
Erastus was "the chamberlain of the city" of Corinth, of that name ([Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023).md).

he himself stayed in--the province of

Asia for a season--that is, at Ephesus, its chief city. (Asia is
mentioned in contrast with Macedonia in the previous clause).

[Acts 19:23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 19:23</span></span>

the same time--of Paul's proposed departure.

about that--"the"

way--So the new religion seemed then to be designated ([Act
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002.md); [Act
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#004.md); [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014).md).

[Acts 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 19:24</span></span>

silver shrines for--"of"

Diana--small models of the Ephesian temple and of the shrine or chapel
of the goddess, or of the shrine and statue alone, which were purchased
by visitors as memorials of what they had seen, and were carried about
and deposited in houses as a charm. (The models of the chapel of our
Lady of Loretto, and such like, which the Church of Rome systematically
encourages, are such a palpable imitation of this heathen practice that
it is no wonder it should be regarded by impartial judges as
Christianity paganized).

gain to the craftsmen--the master-artificers.

[Acts 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 19:25</span></span>

Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation--rather,
"with the workmen (or fabricators) of such articles," meaning the
artisans employed by the master-artificers, all who manufactured any
kind of memorial of the temple and its worship for sale.

[Acts 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 19:26</span></span>

ye see and hear--The evidences of it were to be seen, and the report of
it was in everybody's mouth.

that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul
hath . . . turned away much people--Noble testimony this to the extent
of Paul's influence!

saying that they be no gods which are made with hands--The universal
belief of the people was that they were gods, though the more
intelligent regarded them only as habitations of Deity, and some,
probably, as mere aids to devotion. It is exactly so in the Church of
Rome.

[Acts 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">act 19:27</span></span>

So that not only this our craft is in danger . . . but, &c.--that is,
"that indeed is a small matter; but there is something far worse." So
the masters of the poor Pythoness put forward the religious revolution
which Paul was attempting to effect at Philippi, as the sole cause of
their zealous alarm, to cloak the self-interest which they felt to be
touched by his success ([Act
16:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#019).md). In both cases religious
zeal was the hypocritical pretext; self-interest, the real moving cause
of the opposition made.

also the temple of the great goddess Diana . . . despised, and her
magnificence . . . destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worshippeth--It was reckoned one of the wonders of the world. It was
built about 550 B.C., of pure white marble, and though burned by a
fanatic on the night of the birth of Alexander the Great, 356 B.C., was
rebuilt with more splendor than before. It was four hundred twenty-five
feet long by two hundred twenty broad, and the columns, one hundred
twenty-seven in number, were sixty feet in height, each of them the gift
of a king, and thirty-six of them enriched with ornament and color. It
was constantly receiving new decorations and additional buildings,
statues, and pictures by the most celebrated artists, and kindled
unparalleled admiration, enthusiasm, and superstition. Its very site is
now a matter of uncertainty. The little wooden image of Diana was as
primitive and rude as its shrine was sumptuous; not like the Greek
Diana, in the form of an imposing huntress, but quite Asiatic, in the
form of a many-breasted female (emblematic of the manifold ministrations
of Nature to man), terminating in a shapeless block. Like some other
far-famed idols, it was believed to have fallen from heaven ([Act
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035).md), and models of it were not only
sold in immense numbers to private persons, but set up for worship in
other cities \[HOWSON\]. What power must have attended the preaching of
that one man by whom the death blow was felt to be given to their
gigantic and witching superstition!

[Acts 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 19:28</span></span>

Great is Diana of the Ephesians--the civic cry of a populace so proud of
their temple that they refused to inscribe on it the name of Alexander
the Great, though he offered them the whole spoil of his Eastern
campaign if they would do it \[STRABO in HOWSON\].

[Acts 19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 19:29</span></span>

having caught Gaius and Aristarchus--disappointed of Paul, as at
Thessalonica ([Act 17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005).md). They are
mentioned in [Act 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004.md); [Act
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#002.md); [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023.md); [Co1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014.md); and probably [Jo3
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#001.md). If it was in the house of Aquila
and Priscilla that he found an asylum (see [Co1
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009).md), that would explain [Rom
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003.md), where he says of them that
"for his life they laid down their own necks" \[HOWSON\].

rushed . . . into the theatre--a vast pile, whose ruins are even now a
wreck of immense grandeur \[SIR C. FELLOWES, Asia Minor, 1839\].

[Acts 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 19:30</span></span>

when Paul would have entered in--with noble forgetfulness of self.

unto the people--the demos, that is, the people met in public assembly.

the disciples suffered him not--The tense used implies only that they
were using their efforts to restrain him; which might have been
unavailing but for what follows.

[Acts 19:31](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">act 19:31</span></span>

And certain of the chief of Asia--literally, "And certain also of the
Asiarchs." These were wealthy and distinguished citizens of the
principal towns of the Asian province, chosen annually, and ten of whom
were selected by the proconsul to preside over the games celebrated in
the month of May (the same month which Romanism dedicates to the
Virgin). It was an office of the highest honor and greatly coveted.
Certain of these, it seems, were favorably inclined to the Gospel, at
least were Paul's "friends," and knowing the passions of a mob, excited
during the festivals, "sent (a message) to him desiring him not to
adventure himself into the theater."

[Acts 19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">act 19:33</span></span>

they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him
forward--rather, "some of the multitude urged forward Alexander, the
Jews thrusting him forward." As the blame of such a tumult would
naturally be thrown upon the Jews, who were regarded by the Romans as
the authors of all religious disturbances, they seem to have put forward
this man to clear them of all responsibility for the riot. (BENGEL'S
conjecture, that this was Alexander the coppersmith, [Ti2
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014), has little to support it.md).

beckoned with the hand--compare [Act
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#016.md); [Act
21:40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#040.md).

would have made his defence--"offered to speak in defense."

[Acts 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">act 19:34</span></span>

But when they knew he was a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of
two hours, cried out, Great is Diana, &c.--The very appearance of a Jew
had the opposite effect to that intended. To prevent him obtaining a
hearing, they drowned his voice in one tumultuous shout in honor of
their goddess, which rose to such frantic enthusiasm as took two hours
to exhaust itself.

[Acts 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 19:35</span></span>

when the town-clerk--keeper of the public archives, and a magistrate of
great authority.

had appeased--"calmed."

the people--"the multitude," which the very presence of such an officer
would go far to do.

he said . . . what man . . . knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians
is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana--literally, the neocoros or
"warden." The word means "temple-sweeper"; then, "temple-guardian."
Thirteen cities of Asia had an interest in the temple, but Ephesus was
honored with the charge of it. (Various cities have claimed this title
with reference to the Virgin or certain saints) \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\].

and of the image which fell down from Jupiter--"from the sky" or "from
heaven." See on [Act 19:27](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027.md). "With this
we may compare various legends concerning images and pictures in the
Romish Church, such as the traditional likenesses of Christ, which were
said to be "not made with hands"" \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

[Acts 19:36](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">act 19:36</span></span>

Seeing that these things cannot be spoken against, &c.--Like a true
legal man, he urges that such was notoriously the constitution and fixed
character of the city, with which its very existence was all but bound
up. Did they suppose that all this was going to be overturned by a set
of itinerant orators? Ridiculous! What did they mean, then, by raising
such a stir?

[Acts 19:37](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 19:37</span></span>

For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of
churches--"temple-plunderers," or sacrilegious persons.

nor yet blasphemers of your goddess--This is a remarkable testimony,
showing that the apostle had, in preaching against idolatry, studiously
avoided (as at Athens) insulting the feelings of those whom he
addressed--a lesson this to missionaries and ministers in general.

[Acts 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 19:38</span></span>

if Demetrius have a matter--of complaint.

against any man, the law is open--rather, "the court days are being
held."

and there are deputies--literally "proconsuls" (see on [Act
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007).md); that is, probably, the
proconsul and his council, as a court of appeal.

[Acts 19:39](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 19:39</span></span>

[Acts 19:40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040.md)
