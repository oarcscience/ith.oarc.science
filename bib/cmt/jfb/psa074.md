### [Psalms Chapter 74](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001)

[Psalms 74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 74:1</span></span>

If the historical allusions of [Psa
74:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006), &c., be referred, as is
probable, to the period of the captivity, the author was probably a
descendant and namesake of Asaph, David's contemporary and singer
(compare [Ch2 35:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#015); [Ezr
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/ezr002.htm#041)). He complains of God's desertion
of His Church, and appeals for aid, encouraging himself by recounting
some of God's mighty deeds, and urges his prayer on the ground of God's
covenant relation to His people, and the wickedness of His and their
common enemy. (Psa. 74:1-23)

cast . . . off--with abhorrence (compare [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002); [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009)). There is no disavowal of guilt
implied. The figure of fire to denote God's anger is often used; and
here, and in [Deu 29:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#020), by the word
"smoke," suggests its continuance.

sheep . . . pasture--(Compare [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001); [Psa
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007)).

[Psalms 74:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 74:2</span></span>

The terms to denote God's relation to His people increase in force:
"congregation"--"purchased"--"redeemed"--"Zion," His dwelling.

[Psalms 74:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 74:3</span></span>

Lift . . . feet-- ([Gen 29:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#001)) --that
is, Come (to behold) the desolations ([Psa
73:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#019)).

[Psalms 74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 74:4</span></span>

roar--with bestial fury.

congregations--literally, "worshipping assemblies."

ensigns--literally, "signs"--substituted their idolatrous objects, or
tokens of authority, for those articles of the temple which denoted
God's presence.

[Psalms 74:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 74:5</span></span>

Though some terms and clauses here are very obscure, the general sense
is that the spoilers destroyed the beauties of the temple with the
violence of woodmen.

was famous--literally, "was known."

[Psalms 74:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 74:6</span></span>

carved work-- ([Kg1 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#029)).

thereof--that is, of the temple, in the writer's mind, though not
expressed till [Psa 74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007), in which its
utter destruction by fire is mentioned ([Kg2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009); [Isa
64:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#011)).

[Psalms 74:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 74:7</span></span>

defiled--or, "profaned," as in [Psa
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039).

[Psalms 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 74:8</span></span>

together--at once, all alike.

synagogues--literally, "assemblies," for places of assembly, whether
such as schools of the prophets ([Kg2
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023)), or "synagogues" in the usual
sense, there is much doubt.

[Psalms 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 74:9</span></span>

signs--of God's presence, as altar, ark, &c. (compare [Psa
74:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#004); [Ch2
36:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018); [Dan
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#002)).

no more any prophet-- ([Isa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#002); [Jer
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001); [Jer
43:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#006)).

how long--this is to last. Jeremiah's prophecy ([Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011)), if published, may not have
been generally known or understood. To the bulk of the people, during
the captivity, the occasional and local prophetical services of
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel would not make an exception to the clause,
"there is no more any prophet."

[Psalms 74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 74:10</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#001)).

how long . . . reproach?--us, as deserted of God.

blaspheme thy name--or, "perfections," as power, goodness, &c. ([Psa
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002)).

[Psalms 74:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 74:11</span></span>

Why cease to help us? (Compare [Psa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007); [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006); [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005)).

[Psalms 74:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 74:12</span></span>

For--literally, "And," in an adversative sense.

[Psalms 74:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 74:13</span></span>

Examples of the "salvation wrought" are cited.

divide the sea--that is, Red Sea.

brakest . . . waters--Pharaoh and his host (compare [Isa
51:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009); [Eze
29:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003)).

[Psalms 74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 74:14</span></span>

heads of leviathan--The word is a collective, and so used for many.

the people . . . wilderness--that is, wild beasts, as conies ([Pro
30:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#025)), are called a people. Others
take the passages literally, that the sea monsters thrown out on dry
land were food for the wandering Arabs.

[Psalms 74:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 74:15</span></span>

cleave the fountain--that is, the rocks of Horeb and Kadesh; for
fountains.

driedst up--Jordan, and, perhaps, Arnon and Jabbok ([Num
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#014)).

[Psalms 74:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 74:16</span></span>

The fixed orders of nature and bounds of earth are of God.

[Psalms 74:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 74:18</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 74:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#010); [Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006)). The contrast is striking--that
such a God should be thus insulted!

[Psalms 74:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 74:19</span></span>

multitude--literally, "beast," their flock or company of men ([Psa
68:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#010)).

turtledove--that is, the meek and lonely Church.

congregation--literally, "the company," as above--thus the Church is
represented as the spoiled and defeated remnant of an army, exposed to
violence.

[Psalms 74:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 74:20</span></span>

And the prevalence of injustice in heathen lands is a reason for
invoking God's regard to His promise (compare [Num
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#021); [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016); [Psa
18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048)).

[Psalms 74:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 74:21</span></span>

oppressed--broken ([Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009)).

return--from seeking God.

ashamed-- ([Psa 35:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004)).

[Psalms 74:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 74:22</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#007); [Psa
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006)). God hears the wicked to their
own ruin ([Gen 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#010); [Gen
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#020)).
