<p>
<p>younger--not the three friends (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#010">Job 15:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#004">Job 32:4</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#006">Job 32:6-7</A>). A general description: <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1-8</A>, the lowness of the persons who derided him; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009">Job 30:9-15</A>, the derision itself. Formerly old men rose to me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#008">Job 29:8</A>). Now not only my juniors, who are bound to reverence me (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#032">Lev 19:32</A>), but even the mean and base-born actually deride me; opposed to, "smiled upon" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#024">Job 29:24</A>). This goes farther than even the "mockery" of Job by relations and friends (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#004">Job 12:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#010">Job 16:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#020">Job 16:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#002">Job 17:2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006">Job 17:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022">Job 19:22</A>). Orientals feel keenly any indignity shown by the young. Job speaks as a rich Arabian emir, proud of his descent. 
<p>
<p>dogs--regarded with disgust in the East as unclean (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#043">Sa1 17:43</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011">Pro 26:11</A>). They are not allowed to enter a house, but run about wild in the open air, living on offal and chance morsels (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#014">Psa 59:14-15</A>). Here again we are reminded of Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016">Psa 22:16</A>). "Their fathers, my coevals, were so mean and famished that I would not have associated them with (not to say, set them over) my dogs in guarding my flock."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#002">Job 30:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">job 30:2</A></FONT></span></p>If their fathers could be of no profit to me, much less the sons, who are feebler than their sires; and in whose case the hope of attaining old age is utterly gone, so puny are they (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026">Job 5:26</A>) [MAURER]. Even if they had "strength of hands," that could be now of no use to me, as all I want in my present affliction is sympathy.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003">Job 30:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">job 30:3</A></FONT></span></p>solitary--literally, "hard as a rock"; so translate, rather, "dried up," emaciated with hunger. Job describes the rudest race of Bedouins of the desert [UMBREIT]. 
<p>
<p>fleeing--So the Septuagint. Better, as Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate, "gnawers of the wilderness." What they gnaw follows in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004">Job 30:4</A>. 
<p>
<p>in former time--literally, the "yesternight of desolation and waste" (the most utter desolation; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014">Eze 6:14</A>); that is, those deserts frightful as night to man, and even there from time immemorial. I think both ideas are in the words darkness [GESENIUS] and antiquity [UMBREIT]. (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</A>, Margin).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004">Job 30:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">job 30:4</A></FONT></span></p>mallows--rather, "salt-wort," which grows in deserts and is eaten as a salad by the poor [MAURER]. 
<p>
<p>by the bushes--among the bushes. 
<p>
<p>juniper--rather, a kind of broom, Spartium junceum [LINN&Atilde;&#134;US], still called in Arabia, as in the Hebrew of Job, retem, of which the bitter roots are eaten by the poor.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#005">Job 30:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">job 30:5</A></FONT></span></p>they cried--that is, "a cry is raised." Expressing the contempt felt for this race by civilized and well-born Arabs. When these wild vagabonds make an incursion on villages, they are driven away, as thieves would be.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#006">Job 30:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">job 30:6</A></FONT></span></p>They are forced "to dwell." 
<p>
<p>cliffs of the valleys--rather, "in the gloomy valleys"; literally, "in the gloom of the valleys," or wadies. To dwell in valleys is, in the East, a mark of wretchedness. The troglodytes, in parts of Arabia, lived in such dwellings as caves.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#007">Job 30:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">job 30:7</A></FONT></span></p>brayed--like the wild ass (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#005">Job 6:5</A> for food). The inarticulate tones of this uncivilized rabble are but little above those of the beast of the field. 
<p>
<p>gathered together--rather, sprinkled here and there. Literally, "poured out," graphically picturing their disorderly mode of encampment, lying up and down behind the thorn bushes. 
<p>
<p>nettles--or brambles [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#008">Job 30:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">job 30:8</A></FONT></span></p>fools--that is, the impious and abandoned (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025">Sa1 25:25</A>). 
<p>
<p>base--nameless, low-born rabble. 
<p>
<p>viler than, &amp;c.--rather, they were driven or beaten out of the land. The Horites in Mount Seir (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006">Gen 14:6</A> with which compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020">Gen 36:20-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#012">Deu 2:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#022">Deu 2:22</A>) were probably the aborigines, driven out by the tribe to which Job's ancestors belonged; their name means troglodyt&Atilde;&brvbr;, or "dwellers in caves." To these Job alludes here (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1-8</A>, and <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#004">Gen 24:4-8</A>, which compare together).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#009">Job 30:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">job 30:9</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006">Job 17:6</A>). Strikingly similar to the derision Jesus Christ underwent (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014">Lam 3:14</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012">Psa 69:12</A>). Here Job returns to the sentiment in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1</A>. It is to such I am become a song of "derision."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010">Job 30:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">job 30:10</A></FONT></span></p>in my face--rather, refrain not to spit in deliberate contempt before my face. To spit at all in presence of another is thought in the East insulting, much more so when done to mark "abhorrence." Compare the further insult to Jesus Christ (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006">Isa 50:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#067">Mat 26:67</A>).

<p>
<p>my cord--image from a bow unstrung; opposed to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#020">Job 29:20</A>. The text (Chetib), "His cord" or "reins" is better; "yea, each lets loose his reins" [UMBREIT].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012">Job 30:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">job 30:12</A></FONT></span></p>youth--rather, a (low) brood. To rise on the right hand is to accuse, as that was the position of the accuser in court (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001">Zac 3:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#006">Psa 109:6</A>).

<p>push . . . feet--jostle me out of the way (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#004">Job 24:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>ways of--that is, their ways of (that is, with a view to my) destruction. Image, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#012">Job 19:12</A>, from a besieging army throwing up a way of approach for itself to a city.

But it is better to retain the image of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#012">Job 30:12-13</A>. "They came [upon me] as through a wide breach," namely, made by the besiegers in the wall of a fortress (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#013">Isa 30:13</A>) [MAURER].

<p>
<p>sinews--so the Arabic, "veins," akin to the Hebrew; rather, "gnawers" (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#003">Job 30:3</A>), namely, my gnawing pains never cease. Effects of elephantiasis.
<p>

<p>garment changed--from a robe of honor to one of mourning, literally (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#008">Job 2:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006">Joh 3:6</A>) and metaphorically [UMBREIT]. Or rather, as SCHUTTENS, following up <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#017">Job 30:17</A>, My outer garment is changed into affliction; that is, affliction has become my outer garment; it also bindeth me fast round (my throat) as the collar of the inner coat; that is, it is both my inner and outer garment. Observe the distinction between the inner and outer garments. The latter refers to his afflictions from without (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#001">Job 30:1-13</A>); the former his personal afflictions (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014">Job 30:14-23</A>). UMBREIT makes "God" subject to "bindeth," as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#019">Job 30:19</A>.

<p>
<p>not--supplied from the first clause. But the intervening affirmative "stand" makes this ellipsis unlikely. Rather, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#009">Job 16:9</A> (not only dost thou refuse aid to me "standing" as a suppliant, but), thou dost regard me with a frown: eye me sternly.
<p>

The moving pillars of sand, raised by the wind to the clouds, as described by travellers, would happily depict Job's agitated spirit, if it be to them that he alludes. 
<p>
<p>dissolvest . . . substance--The marginal Hebrew reading (Keri), "my wealth," or else "wisdom," that is, sense and spirit, or "my hope of deliverance." But the text (Chetib) is better: Thou dissolvest me (with fear, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#015">Exo 15:15</A>) in the crash (of the whirlwind; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014">Job 30:14</A>) [MAURER]. UMBREIT translates as a verb, "Thou terrifiest me."

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_024">job 30:24</A></FONT></span></p>Expressing Job's faith as to the state after death. Though one must go to the grave, yet He will no more afflict in the ruin of the body (so Hebrew for "grave") there, if one has cried to Him when being destroyed. The "stretching of His hand" to punish after death answers antithetically to the raising "the cry" of prayer in the second clause. MAURER gives another translation which accords with the scope of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#024">Job 30:24-31</A>; if it be natural for one in affliction to ask aid, why should it be considered (by the friends) wrong in my case? "Nevertheless does not a man in ruin stretch out his hand" (imploring help, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#020">Job 30:20</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017">Lam 1:17</A>)? If one be in his calamity (destruction) is there not therefore a "cry" (for aid)? Thus in the parallelism "cry" answers to "stretch--hand"; "in his calamity," to "in ruin." The negative of the first clause is to be supplied in the second, as in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#025">Job 30:25</A> (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#017">Job 28:17</A>).
