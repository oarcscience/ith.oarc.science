### [Genesis Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 16:1</span></span>

BESTOWMENT OF HAGAR. (Gen. 16:1-16)

Now, Sarai . . . had a handmaid--a female slave--one of those obtained
in Egypt.

[Genesis 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 16:3</span></span>

Sarai . . . gave her to . . . Abram to be his wife--"Wife" is here used
to describe an inferior, though not degrading, relation, in countries
where polygamy prevails. In the case of these female slaves, who are the
personal property of his lady, being purchased before her marriage or
given as a special present to her, no one can become the husband's
secondary wife without her mistress consent or permission. This usage
seems to have prevailed in patriarchal times; and Hagar, Sarai's slave,
of whom she had the entire right of disposing, was given by her
mistress' spontaneous offer, to be the secondary wife of Abram, in the
hope of obtaining the long-looked-for heir. It was a wrong
step--indicating a want of simple reliance on God--and Sarai was the
first to reap the bitter fruits of her device.

[Genesis 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 16:5</span></span>

And Sarai said . . . My wrong be upon thee--Bursts of temper, or blows,
as the original may bear, took place till at length Hagar, perceiving
the hopelessness of maintaining the unequal strife, resolved to escape
from what had become to her in reality, as well as in name, a house of
bondage.

[Genesis 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 16:7</span></span>

And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain--This well, pointed
out by tradition, lay on the side of the caravan road, in the midst of
Shur, a sandy desert on the west of Arabia-PetrÃ&brvbr;a, to the extent
of a hundred fifty miles, between Palestine and Egypt. By taking that
direction, she seems to have intended to return to her relatives in that
country. Nothing but pride, passion, and sullen obstinacy, could have
driven any solitary person to brave the dangers of such an inhospitable
wild; and she would have died, had not the timely appearance and words
of the angel recalled her to reflection and duty.

[Genesis 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gen 16:11</span></span>

Ishmael--Like other Hebrew names, this had a signification, and it is
made up of two words--"God hears." The reason is explained.

[Genesis 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 16:12</span></span>

he will be a wild man--literally, "a wild ass man," expressing how the
wildness of Ishmael and his descendants resembles that of the wild ass.

his hand will be against every man--descriptive of the rude, turbulent,
and plundering character of the Arabs.

dwell in the presence of all his brethren--dwell, that is, pitch tents;
and the meaning is that they maintain their independence in spite of all
attempts to extirpate or subdue them.

[Genesis 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gen 16:13</span></span>

called the name--common in ancient times to name places from
circumstances; and the name given to this well was a grateful
recognition of God's gracious appearance in the hour of Hagar's
distress.
