### [1 Chronicles Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 15:1</span></span>

DAVID BRINGS THE ARK FROM OBEDEDOM. (1Ch. 15:1-24)

David made him houses in the city of David--Through the liberality of
his Tyrian ally ([Ch1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001).md), David was
enabled to erect not only a palace for himself, but to furnish suitable
accommodation for his numerous family. Where polygamy prevails, each
wife has a separate house or suite of apartments for herself and
children.

prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent--that is,
made an entirely new one upon the model of the former. The old
tabernacle, which Moses had constructed in the wilderness and which had
hitherto served the purpose of a sacred covering, was to be left at
Gibeon, either because of the unwillingness of the inhabitants to part
with such a venerable relic, or because there was no use for it in
Jerusalem, where a more solid and sumptuous edifice was contemplated. If
it appear surprising that David "made him houses" before he prepared
this new tabernacle, it should be remembered that he had received no
divine intimation respecting such a work.

[1 Chronicles 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 15:2</span></span>

Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
Levites--After the lapse of three months ([Ch1
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#014).md) the purpose of transporting the
ark to Jerusalem was resumed. Time and reflection had led to a discovery
of the cause of the painful catastrophe that marred the first attempt.
In preparing for the solemn procession that was now to usher the sacred
symbol into its resting-place, David took special care that the carriage
should be regulated in strict conformity to the law ([Num
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#005.md), [Num
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#015.md); [Num
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/num007.htm#009.md); [Num
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#017).md).

[1 Chronicles 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 15:3</span></span>

David gathered all Israel together--Some are of opinion that this was
done on one of the three great festivals, but at whatever time the
ceremonial took place, it was of great importance to summon a general
convocation of the people, many of whom, from the long-continued
disorders of the kingdom, might have had little or no opportunity of
knowing anything of the ark, which had been allowed to remain so long in
obscurity and neglect.

[1 Chronicles 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch1 15:4</span></span>

David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites--The children of
Aaron were the two priests ([Ch1
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#011).md), Zadok and Abiathar, heads of
the two priestly houses of Eleazar and Ithamar, and colleagues in the
high priesthood ([Sa2 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#025).md). The
Levites were the chiefs of their father's house ([Ch1
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012).md); four belonging to the
Kohathite branch, on whose shoulders the ark was to be borne; namely,
Uriel, Shemaiah--descended from Elizaphan or Elzaphan-- ([Exo
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022).md), Hebron ([Exo
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#018.md); [Ch1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#002).md), and Amminadab from Uzziel ([Exo
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#022).md).

[1 Chronicles 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 15:12</span></span>

sanctify yourselves--This special sanctification, which was required on
all grave and important occasions, consisted in observing the strictest
abstinence, as well as cleanliness, both in person and dress (see on
[Gen 35:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002.md); [Exo
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#010.md), [Exo
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#015).md); and in the neglect of these
rules no step could have been taken ([Ch2
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#003).md).

[1 Chronicles 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch1 15:16</span></span>

David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint . . . the singers
with instruments--These eminent Levites were instructed to train the
musicians and singers who were under them, for the solemn procession.
The performers were ranged in three choirs or bands, and the names of
the principal leaders are given ([Ch1
15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017.md), [Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021).md), with the instruments
respectively used by each. "Ben" ([Ch1
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#018).md) is omitted ([Ch1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#020).md). Either it was used merely as a
common noun, to intimate that Zechariah was the son of Jaaziel or Aziel,
or Ben is the same as Azaziah \[[Ch1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021.md)\].

[1 Chronicles 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch1 15:22</span></span>

Chenaniah, chief of the Levites--He was not of the six heads of the
Levitical families, but a chief in consequence of his office, which
required learning, without regard to birth or family.

instructed about the song--He directed all these bands as to the proper
time when each was to strike in or change their notes; or, as some
render the passage, "He led the burdens, for he was skilled," that is,
in the custom which it was necessary to observe in the carriage of the
holy things \[BERTHEAU\].

[1 Chronicles 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">ch1 15:23</span></span>

Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers--who marched immediately in
front, while Obed-edom and Jeiel went in the rear, of the ark.

[1 Chronicles 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">ch1 15:25</span></span>

So David, and the elders . . . and captains . . . went--The pious design
of David in ordering all his principal ministers and officers to take
part in this solemn work and imparting so much pomp and imposing
ceremony to the procession, was evidently to inspire the popular mind
with a profound veneration for the ark and to give the young especially
salutary impressions of religion, which would be renewed by the
remembrance that they had been witnesses of the august solemnity in
which the king and the highest aristocracy of the land participated,
vying with all other classes to do honor to the God of Israel.

[1 Chronicles 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">ch1 15:26</span></span>

it came to pass, &c.--(See on [Sa2
6:13-23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013).md).

they offered seven bullocks and seven rams--The Levites seem to have
entered on this duty with fear and trembling; and finding that they
might advance without any such indications of divine wrath as Uzza had
experienced ([Ch1 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#010).md), they offered
an ox and a fatted sheep immediately after starting ([Sa2
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#013).md), and seven bullocks and seven
rams--a perfect sacrifice, at the close of the procession ([Ch1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#001).md). It is probable that
preparations had been made for the offering of similar sacrifices at
regular intervals along the way.

[1 Chronicles 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">ch1 15:27</span></span>

a robe of fine linen--Hebrew, Butz--is rather supposed in the later
books to denote cotton.

an ephod--a shoulder-garment, a cincture or cape over his dress. It was
worn by the priests, but was not so peculiar to them as to be forbidden
others ([Sa1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#018.md); [Sa1
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#018).md).

[1 Chronicles 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">ch1 15:29</span></span>

Michal . . . saw . . . David dancing and playing--His movements would be
slow and solemn, suitable to the grave and solemn character of the
music. Though his royal robes were laid aside, he was attired like the
other officials, showing a becoming humility in the immediate presence
of God. The feelings manifested by Michal were only an ebullition of
spleen from a proud and passionate woman.
