AUTHENTICITY.--The author calls himself John ([Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md), [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md); [Rev
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008).md). JUSTIN MARTYR \[Dialogue with
Trypho, p. 308\] (A.D. 139-161) quotes from the Apocalypse, as John the
apostle's work, the prophecy of the millennium of the saints, to be
followed by the general resurrection and judgment. This testimony of
JUSTIN is referred to also by EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History, 4.18\].
JUSTIN MARTYR, in the early part of the second century, held his
controversy with TRYPHO, a learned Jew, at Ephesus, where John had been
living thirty or thirty-five years before: he says that "the Revelation
had been given to John, one of the twelve apostles of Christ." MELITO,
bishop of Sardis (about A.D. 171), one of the seven churches addressed,
a successor, therefore, of one of the seven angels, is said by EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 4.26\] to have written treatises on the
Apocalypse of John. The testimony of the bishop of Sardis is the more
impartial, as Sardis is one of the churches severely reproved ([Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001).md). So also THEOPHILUS OF ANTIOCH
(about A.D. 180), according to EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History,
4.26\], quoted testimonies from the Apocalypse of John. EUSEBIUS says
the same of Apollonius, who lived in Asia Minor in the end of the second
century. IRENÃ†US (about A.D. 180), a hearer of POLYCARP, the disciple
of John, and supposed by ARCHBISHOP USHER to be the angel of the Church
of Smyrna, is most decided again and again in quoting the Apocalypse as
the work of the apostle John \[Against Heresies, 4.20.11; 4.21.3;
4.30.4; 5.36.1; 5.30.3; 5.35.2\]. In \[5.30.1\], alluding to the
mystical number of the beast, six hundred sixty-six ([Rev
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018).md), found in all old copies, he
says, "We do not hazard a confident theory as to the name of Antichrist;
for if it had been necessary that his name should be proclaimed openly
at the present time, it would have been declared by him who saw the
apocalyptic vision; for it was seen at no long time back, but almost in
our generation, towards the end of Domitian's reign." In his work
Against Heresies, published ten years after Polycarp's martyrdom, he
quotes the Apocalypse twenty times, and makes long extracts from it, as
inspired Scripture. These testimonies of persons contemporary with
John's immediate successors, and more or less connected with the region
of the seven churches to which Revelation is addressed, are most
convincing. TERTULLIAN, of North Africa (about A.D. 220), \[Against
Marcion, 3.14\], quotes the apostle John's descriptions in the
Apocalypse of the sword proceeding out of the Lord's mouth ([Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md), and of the heavenly city (Rev.
21:1-27). Compare On the Resurrection of the Flesh \[27\]; A Treatise on
the Soul, \[8, 9, &c.\]; The Prescription Against Heretics, \[33\]. The
MURATORI fragment of the canon (about A.D. 200) refers to John the
apostle writing to the seven churches. HIPPOLYTUS, bishop of Ostia, near
Rome (about A.D. 240) \[On Antichrist, p. 67\], quotes Rev. 17:1-18, as
the writing of John the apostle. Among HIPPOLYTUS' works, there is
specified in the catalogue on his statue, a treatise "on the Apocalypse
and Gospel according to John." CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA (about A.D. 200)
\[Miscellanies, 6.13\], alludes to the twenty-four seats on which the
elders sit as mentioned by John in the Apocalypse ([Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005).md); also, \[Who Is the Rich Man Who
Shall Be Saved? 42\], he mentions John's return from Patmos to Ephesus
on the death of the Roman tyrant. ORIGEN (about A.D. 233), \[Commentary
on Matthew, in EUSEBIUS Ecclesiastical History, 6.25\], mentions John as
the author of the Apocalypse, without expressing any doubts as to its
authenticity; also, in Commentary on Matthew, \[16.6\], he quotes [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md), and says, "John seems to have
beheld the Apocalypse in the island of Patmos." VICTORINUS, bishop of
Pettau in Pannonia, who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian in A.D. 303,
wrote the earliest extant commentary on the Apocalypse. Though the Old
Syriac Peschito version does not contain the Apocalypse, yet EPHREM THE
SYRIAN (about A.D. 378) frequently quotes the Apocalypse as canonical,
and ascribes it to John.

Its canonicity and inspiration (according to a scholium of ANDREAS OF
CAPPADOCIA) are attested by PAPIAS, a hearer of John, and associate of
POLYCARP. PAPIAS was bishop of Hierapolis, near Laodicea, one of the
seven churches. WORDSWORTH conjectures that a feeling of shame, on
account of the rebukes of Laodicea in Revelation, may have operated on
the Council of Laodicea, so as to omit Revelation from its list of books
to be read publicly (?). The Epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne
to the churches of Asia and Phrygia (in EUSEBIUS, \[Ecclesiastical
History, 5.1-3\]), in the persecution under Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 77)
quotes [Rev 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004.md); [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011.md), as Scripture. CYPRIAN (about
A.D. 250) also, in Epistle 13, quotes [Rev
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005.md) as Scripture; and in Epistle 25 he
quotes [Rev 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md), as of the same
authority as the Gospel. (For other instances, see ALFORD'S Prolegomena,
from whom mainly this summary of evidence has been derived). ATHANASIUS,
in his Festival Epistle, enumerates the Apocalypse among the canonical
Scriptures, to which none must add, and from which none must take away.
JEROME \[Epistle to Paulinus\] includes in the canon the Apocalypse,
adding, "It has as many mysteries as words. All praise falls short of
its merits. In each of its words lie hid manifold senses." Thus an
unbroken chain of testimony down from the apostolic period confirms its
canonicity and authenticity.

The ALOGI \[EPIPHANIUS, Heresies, 51\] and CAIUS the Roman presbyter
\[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 3.28\], towards the end of the
second and beginning of the third century, rejected John's Apocalypse on
mere captious grounds. CAIUS, according to JEROME \[On Illustrious
Men\], about A.D. 210, attributed it to Cerinthus, on the ground of its
supporting the millennial reign on earth. DIONYSIUS OF ALEXANDRIA
mentions many before his time who rejected it because of its obscurity
and because it seemed to support Cerinthus' dogma of an earthly and
carnal kingdom; whence they attributed it to Cerinthus. This DIONYSIUS,
scholar of ORIGEN, and bishop of Alexandria (A.D. 247), admits its
inspiration (in EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History, 7.10\]), but
attributes it to some John distinct from John the apostle, on the ground
of its difference of style and character, as compared with John's Gospel
and Epistle, as also because the name John is several times mentioned in
the Apocalypse, which is always kept back in both the Gospel and
Epistle; moreover, neither does the Epistle make any allusion to the
Apocalypse, nor the Apocalypse to the Epistle; and the style is not pure
Greek, but abounds in barbarisms and solecisms. EUSEBIUS wavers in
opinion \[Ecclesiastical History, 24.39\] as to whether it is, or is
not, to be ranked among the undoubtedly canonical Scriptures. His
antipathy to the millennial doctrine would give an unconscious bias to
his judgment on the Apocalypse. CYRIL OF JERUSALEM (A.D. 386),
\[Catechetical Lectures, 4.35,36\], omits the Apocalypse in enumerating
the New Testament Scriptures to be read privately as well as publicly.
"Whatever is not read in the churches, that do not even read by thyself;
the apostles and ancient bishops of the Church who transmitted them to
us were far wiser than thou art." Hence, we see that, in his day, the
Apocalypse was not read in the churches. Yet in Catechetical Lectures,
1.4 he quotes [Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md), [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md); and in Catechetical Lectures, 1;
15.13 he draws the prophetical statement from [Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011.md), that the king who is to humble
the three kings ([Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md), [Dan
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#020).md) is the eighth king. In
Catechetical Lectures, 15 and 27, he similarly quotes from [Rev
12:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003.md). ALFORD conjectures that CYRIL
had at some time changed his opinion, and that these references to the
Apocalypse were slips of memory whereby he retained phraseology which
belonged to his former, not his subsequent views. The sixtieth canon (if
genuine) of the Laodicean Council in the middle of the fourth century
omits the Apocalypse from the canonical books. The Eastern Church in
part doubted, the Western Church, after the fifth century, universally
recognized, the Apocalypse. CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA \[On Worship, 146\],
though implying the fact of some doubting its genuineness, himself
undoubtedly accepts it as the work of St. John. ANDREAS OF CÃ†SAREA, in
Cappadocia, recognized as genuine and canonical, and wrote the first
entire and connected commentary on, the Apocalypse. The sources of doubt
seem to have been, (1) the antagonism of many to the millennium, which
is set forth in it; (2) its obscurity and symbolism having caused it not
to be read in the churches, or to be taught to the young. But the most
primitive tradition is unequivocal in its favor. In a word, the
objective evidence is decidedly for it; the only arguments against it
seem to have been subjective.

The personal notices of John in the Apocalypse occur [Rev
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#001.md), [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md); [Rev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md). Moreover, the writer's addresses
to the churches of Proconsular Asia ([Rev
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#001).md) accord with the concurrent
tradition, that after John's return from his exile in Patmos, at the
death of Domitian, under Nerva, he resided for long, and died at last in
Ephesus, in the time of Trajan \[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History,
3.20,23\]. If the Apocalypse were not the inspired work of John,
purporting as it does to be an address from their superior to the seven
churches of Proconsular Asia, it would have assuredly been rejected in
that region; whereas the earliest testimonies in those churches are all
in its favor. One person alone was entitled to use language of authority
such as is addressed to the seven angels of the churches--namely, John,
as the last surviving apostle and superintendent of all the churches.
Also, it accords with John's manner to assert the accuracy of his
testimony both at the beginning and end of his book (compare [Rev
1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002.md), and [Rev
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008.md), with [Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md); [Joh
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#024.md); [Jo1
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md). Again, it accords with the
view of the writer being an inspired apostle that he addresses the
angels or presidents of the several churches in the tone of a superior
addressing inferiors. Also, he commends the Church of Ephesus for trying
and convicting "them which say they are apostles, and are not," by which
he implies his own undoubted claim to apostolic inspiration ([Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002).md), as declaring in the seven
epistles Christ's will revealed through him.

As to the difference of style, as compared with the Gospel and Epistle,
the difference of subject in part accounts for it, the visions of the
seer, transported as he was above the region of sense, appropriately
taking a form of expression abrupt, and unbound by the grammatical laws
which governed his writings of a calmer and more deliberate character.
Moreover, as being a Galilean Hebrew, John, in writing a Revelation akin
to the Old Testament prophecies, naturally reverted to their Hebraistic
style. ALFORD notices, among the features of resemblance between the
styles of the Apocalypse and John's Gospel and Epistle: (1) the
characteristic appellation of our Lord, peculiar to John exclusively,
"the Word of God" ([Rev 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#013.md); compare
[Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001.md); [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)). (2.md) the phrase, "he that
overcometh" ([Rev 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007.md), [Rev
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#011.md), [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md), [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md), [Rev
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021.md); [Rev
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#011.md); [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md); [Rev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#014.md); [Rev
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007.md); compare [Joh
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md) [Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Jo1
5:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)). (3) The Greek term (alethinos.md)
for "true," as opposed to that which is shadowy and unreal ([Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md); [Rev
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007.md); [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md), [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md), [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005.md); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006).md). This term, found only once in
Luke ([Luk 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011).md), four times in Paul
([Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md); [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md), is found nine times in John's
Gospel ([Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md); [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md), [Joh
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#037.md); [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032.md); [Joh
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028.md); [Joh
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#016.md); [Joh
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md) [Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md); [Joh
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#003.md), [Joh
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005).md), twice in John's First Epistle
([Jo1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md); [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020).md), and ten times in Revelation
([Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014.md); [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md); [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md); [Rev
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#007.md); [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002.md), [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009.md), [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011.md); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005.md) [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006)). (4.md) The Greek diminutive for
"Lamb" (arnion, literally, "lambkin") occurs twenty-nine times in the
Apocalypse, and the only other place where it occurs is [Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md). In John's writings alone is
Christ called directly "the Lamb" ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md), [Joh
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#036).md). In [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md), He is called "as a lamb without
blemish," in allusion to [Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md). So
the use of "witness," or "testimony" ([Rev
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002.md), [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009.md); [Rev
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#009.md); [Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007.md), &c.; compare [Joh
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#007.md), [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md), [Joh
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#019.md), [Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032.md); [Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md); [Jo1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#014.md); [Jo1
5:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006).md). "Keep the word," or
"commandments" ([Rev 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md), [Rev
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010.md); [Rev
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#017.md); compare [Joh
8:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#051.md), [Joh
8:55](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#055.md); [Joh
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#015).md). The assertion of the same
thing positively and negatively ([Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md), [Rev
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#006.md), [Rev
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#008.md), [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md); [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008.md), [Rev
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#017.md); compare [Joh
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003.md), [Joh
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#006.md), [Joh
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#020.md); [Jo1
2:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).md). Compare also [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027.md) with [Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018.md), as to the spiritual anointing.
The seeming solecisms of style are attributable to that,inspired
elevation which is above mere grammatical rules, and are designed to
arrest the reader's attention by the peculiarity of the phrase, so as to
pause and search into some deep truth lying beneath. The vivid
earnestness of the inspired writer, handling a subject so transcending
all others, raises him above all servile adherence to ordinary rules, so
that at times he abruptly passes from one grammatical construction to
another, as he graphically sets the thing described before the eye of
the reader. This is not due to ignorance of grammar, for he "has
displayed a knowledge of grammatical rules in other much more difficult
constructions" \[WINER\]. The connection of thought is more attended to
than mere grammatical connection. Another consideration to be taken into
account is that two-fifths of the whole being the recorded language of
others, he moulds his style accordingly. Compare TREGELLES' Introduction
to Revelation from Heathen Authorities.

TREGELLES well says \[New Testament Historic Evidence\], "There is no
book of the New Testament for which we have such clear, ample, and
numerous testimonies in the second century as we have in favor of the
Apocalypse. The more closely the witnesses were connected with the
apostle John (as was the case with IRENÃ†US), the more explicit is their
testimony. That doubts should prevail in after ages must have originated
either in ignorance of the earlier testimony, or else from some supposed
intuition of what an apostle ought to have written. The objections on
the ground of internal style can weigh nothing against the actual
evidence. It is in vain to argue, a priori, that John could not have
written this book when we have the evidence of several competent
witnesses that he did write it."

RELATION OF THE APOCALYPSE TO THE REST OF THE CANON.--GREGORY OF NYSSA
\[tom. 3, p. 601\], calls Revelation "the last book of grace." It
completes the volume of inspiration, so that we are to look for no
further revelation till Christ Himself shall come. Appropriately the
last book completing the canon was written by John, the last survivor of
the apostles. The New Testament is composed of the historical books, the
Gospels and Acts, the doctrinal Epistles, and the one prophetical book,
Revelation. The same apostle wrote the last of the Gospels, and probably
the last of the Epistles, and the only prophetical book of the New
Testament. All the books of the New Testament had been written, and were
read in the Church assemblies, some years before John's death. His life
was providentially prolonged that he might give the final attestation to
Scripture. About the year A.D. 100, the bishops of Asia (the angels of
the seven churches) came to John at EPHESUS, bringing him copies of the
three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and desired of him a statement
of his apostolical judgment concerning them; whereupon he pronounced
them authentic, genuine, and inspired, and at their request added his
own Gospel to complete the fourfold aspect of the Gospel of Christ
(compare MURATORI \[Fragment on the Canon of Scripture\]; EUSEBIUS
\[Ecclesiastical History, 3.24\]; JEROME \[Commentary on Matthew\];
VICTORINUS on the Apocalypse; THEODORET \[Ecclesiastical History, 39\]).
A Greek divine, quoted in ALLATIUS, calls Revelation "the seal of the
whole Bible." The canon would be incomplete without Revelation.
Scripture is a complete whole, its component books, written in a period
ranging over one thousand five hundred years, being mutually connected.
Unity of aim and spirit pervades the entire, so that the end is the
necessary sequence of the middle, and the middle of the beginning.
Genesis presents before us man and his bride in innocence and
blessedness, followed by man's fall through Satan's subtlety, and man's
consequent misery, his exclusion from Paradise and its tree of life and
delightful rivers. Revelation presents, in reverse order, man first
liable to sin and death, but afterwards made conqueror through the blood
of the Lamb; the first Adam and Eve, represented by the second Adam,
Christ, and the Church. His spotless bride, in Paradise, with free
access to the tree of life and the crystal water of life that flows from
the throne of God. As Genesis foretold the bruising of the serpent's
head by the woman's seed ([Gen 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015).md),
so Revelation declares the final accomplishment of that prediction (Rev.
19:1-20:15).

PLACE AND TIME OF WRITING.--The best authorities among the Fathers state
that John was exiled under Domitian (IRENÃ†US \[Against Heresies, 5;
30\]; CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA; EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical History, 3.20\]).
VICTORINUS says that he had to labor in the mines of Patmos. At
Domitian's death, A.D. 95, he returned to Ephesus under the Emperor
Nerva. Probably it was immediately after his return that he wrote, under
divine inspiration, the account of the visions vouchsafed to him in
Patmos ([Rev 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#002.md), [Rev
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009).md). However, [Rev
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#004.md) seems to imply that he wrote the
visions immediately after seeing them. Patmos is one of the Sporades.
Its circumference is about thirty miles. "It was fitting that when
forbidden to go beyond certain bounds of the earth's lands, he was
permitted to penetrate the secrets of heaven" \[BEDE, Explanation of the
Apocalypse on chap. 1\]. The following arguments favor an earlier date,
namely, under Nero: (1) EUSEBIUS \[Demonstration of the Gospel\] unites
in the same sentence John's banishment with the stoning of James and the
beheading of Paul, which were under Nero. (2) CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA'S'S
story of the robber reclaimed by John, after he had pursued, and with
difficulty overtaken him, accords better with John then being a younger
man than under Domitian, when he was one hundred years old. Arethas, in
the sixth century, applies the sixth seal to the destruction of
Jerusalem (A.D. 70), adding that the Apocalypse was written before that
event. So the Syriac version states he was banished by Nero the
CÃ&brvbr;sar. Laodicea was overthrown by an earthquake (A.D. 60) but was
immediately rebuilt, so that its being called "rich and increased with
goods" is not incompatible with this book having been written under the
Neronian persecution (A.D. 64). But the possible allusions to it in [Heb

11:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015.md), make a date before the
destruction of Laodicea possible. Cerinthus is stated to have died
before John; as then he borrowed much in his Pseudo-Apocalypse from
John's, it is likely the latter was at an earlier date than Domitian's
reign. See TILLOCH'S Introduction to Apocalypse. But the Pauline
benediction ([Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004).md) implies it was
written after Paul's death under Nero.

TO WHAT READERS ADDRESSED.--The inscription states that it is addressed
to the seven churches of Asia, that is, Proconsular Asia. John's reason
for fixing on the number seven (for there were more than seven churches
in the region meant by "Asia," for instance, Magnesia and Tralles) was
doubtless because seven is the sacred number implying totality and
universality: so it is implied that John, through the medium of the
seven churches, addresses in the Spirit the Church of all places and
ages. The Church in its various states of spiritual life or deadness, in
all ages and places, is represented by the seven churches, and is
addressed with words of consolation or warning accordingly. Smyrna and
Philadelphia alone of the seven are honored with unmixed praise, as
faithful in tribulation and rich in good works. Heresies of a decided
kind had by this time arisen in the churches of Asia, and the love of
many had waxed cold, while others had advanced to greater zeal, and one
had sealed his testimony with his blood.

OBJECT.--It begins with admonitory addresses to the seven churches from
the divine Son of man, whom John saw in vision, after a brief
introduction which sets forth the main subject of the book, namely, to
"show unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass" (the
first through third chapters). From the fourth chapter to the end is
mainly prophecy, with practical exhortations and consolations, however,
interspersed, similar to those addressed to the seven churches (the
representatives of the universal Church of every age), and so connecting
the body of the book with its beginning, which therefore forms its
appropriate introduction. Three schools of interpreters exist: (1) The
Preterists, who hold that almost the whole has been fulfilled. (2) The
Historical Interpreters, who hold that it comprises the history of the
Church from John's time to the end of the world, the seals being
chronologically succeeded, by the trumpets and the trumpets by the
vials. (3) The Futurists, who consider almost the whole as yet future,
and to be fulfilled immediately before Christ's second coming. The first
theory was not held by any of the earliest Fathers, and is only held now
by Rationalists, who limit John's vision to things within his own
horizon, pagan Rome's persecutions of Christians, and its consequently
anticipated destruction. The Futurist school is open to this great
objection: it would leave the Church of Christ unprovided with
prophetical guidance or support under her fiery trials for 1700 or 1800
years. Now God has said, "Surely He will do nothing, but He revealeth
His secrets unto His servants the prophets" ([Amo
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007).md). The Jews had a succession of
prophets who guided them with the light of prophecy: what their prophets
were to them, that the apocalyptic Scriptures have been, and are, to us.

ALFORD, following ISAAC WILLIAMS, draws attention to the parallel
connection between the Apocalypse and Christ's discourse on the Mount of
Olives, recorded in Mat. 24:4-28. The seals plainly bring us down to the
second coming of Christ, just as the trumpets also do (compare [Rev
6:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012.md); [Rev
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#001.md), &c.; [Rev
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015).md), and as the vials also do ([Rev
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017).md): all three run parallel, and
end in the same point. Certain "catchwords" (as WORDSWORTH calls them)
connect the three series of symbols together. They do not succeed one to
the other in historical and chronological sequence, but move side by
side, the subsequent series filling up in detail the same picture which
the preceding series had drawn in outline. So VICTORINUS (on [Rev
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#002).md), the earliest commentator on the
Apocalypse, says, "The order of the things said is not to be regarded,
since often the Holy Spirit, when He has run to the end of the last
time, again returns to the same times, and supplies what He has less
fully expressed." And PRIMASIUS \[Commentary on the Apocalypse\], "In
the trumpets he gives a description by a pleasing repetition, as is his
custom."

At the very beginning, John hastens, by anticipation (as was the
tendency of all the prophets), to the grand consummation. [Rev
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007.md), "Behold, He cometh with clouds,"
&c. [Rev 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#008.md), [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017.md), "I am the beginning and the
ending . . . the first and the last." So the seven epistles exhibit the
same anticipation of the end. [Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md), "Him that overcometh, I will
write upon Him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,
which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven"; compare at the
close, [Rev 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md). So also [Rev
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#028.md), "I will give him the morning
star"; compare at the close, [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016.md), "I am the bright and morning
star."

Again, the earthquake that ensues on the opening of the sixth seal is
one of the catchwords, that is, a link connecting chronologically this
sixth seal with the sixth trumpet ([Rev
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#013.md); [Rev
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#013).md): compare also the seventh vial,
[Rev 16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md). The concomitants of the
opening of the sixth seal, it is plain, in no full and exhaustive sense
apply to any event, save the terrors which shall overwhelm the ungodly
just before the coming of the Judge.

Again, the beast out of the bottomless pit ([Rev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#007).md), between the sixth and seventh
trumpets, connects this series with the section, twelfth through
fourteenth chapters, concerning the Church and her adversaries.

Again, the sealing of the 144,000 under the sixth seal connects this
seal with the section, the twelfth through fourteenth chapters.

Again, the loosing of the four winds by the four angels standing on the
four corners of the earth, under the sixth seal, answers to the loosing
of the four angels at the Euphrates, under the sixth trumpet.

Moreover, links occur in the Apocalypse connecting it with the Old
Testament. For instance, the "mouth speaking great things" ([Dan
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md) [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md), connects the beast that
blasphemes against God, and makes war against the saints, with the
little horn ([Dan 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#021.md); [Rev
13:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006).md), or at last king, who, arising
after the ten kings, shall speak against the Most High, and wear out the
saints ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025).md); also, compare the
"forty-two months" ([Rev 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005).md), or "a
thousand two hundred and threescore days" ([Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006).md), with the "time, times, and the
dividing of time," of [Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md).
Moreover, the "forty-two months," [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md), answering to [Rev
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#006.md); [Rev
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005.md), link together the period under
the sixth trumpet to the section, Rev. 12:1-14:20.

AUBERLEN observes, "The history of salvation is mysteriously governed by
holy numbers. They are the scaffolding of the organic edifice. They are
not merely outward indications of time, but indications of nature and
essence. Not only nature, but history, is based in numbers. Scripture
and antiquity put numbers as the fundamental forms of things, where we
put ideas." As number is the regulator of the relations and proportions
of the natural world, so does it enter most frequently into the
revelations of the Apocalypse, which sets forth the harmonies of the
supernatural, the immediately Divine. Thus the most supernatural
revelation leads us the farthest into the natural, as was to be
expected, seeing the God of nature and of revelation is one. Seven is
the number for perfection (compare [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md); [Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md), the seven Spirits before the
throne; also, [Rev 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md), the Lamb's
seven horns and seven eyes). Thus the seven churches represent the
Church catholic in its totality. The seven seals ([Rev
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001).md), the seven trumpets ([Rev
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#002).md), and the seven vials ([Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md), are severally a complete series
each in itself, fulfilling perfectly the divine course of judgments.
Three and a half implies a number opposed to the divine (seven), but
broken in itself, and which, in the moment of its highest triumph, is
overwhelmed by judgment and utter ruin. Four is the number of the
world's extension; seven is the number of God's revelation in the world.
In the four beasts of Daniel ([Dan
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003).md) there is a recognition of some
power above them, at the same time that there is a mimicry of the four
cherubs of Ezekiel ([Eze 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#009).md), the
heavenly symbols of all creation in its due subjection to God ([Rev
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md). So the four corners of the
earth, the four winds, the four angels loosed from the Euphrates, and
Jerusalem lying "foursquare" ([Rev
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016).md), represent world-wide
extension. The sevenfoldness of the Spirits on the part of God
corresponds with the fourfold cherubim on the part of the created. John,
seeing more deeply into the essentially God-opposed character of the
world, presents to us, not the four beasts of Daniel, but the seven
heads of the beast, whereby it arrogates to itself the sevenfold
perfection of the Spirits of God; at the same time that, with
characteristic self-contradiction, it has ten horns, the number peculiar
to the world power. Its unjust usurpation of the sacred number seven is
marked by the addition of an eighth to the seven heads, and also by the
beast's own number, six hundred sixty-six, which in units, tens, and
hundreds, verges upon, but falls short of, seven. The judgments on the
world are complete in six: after the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet,
there is a pause. When seven comes, there comes "the kingdom of our Lord
and His Christ." Six is the number of the world given to judgment.
Moreover, six is half of twelve, as three and a half is the half of
seven. Twelve is the number of the Church: compare the twelve tribes of
Israel, the twelve stars on the woman's head ([Rev
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#001).md), the twelve gates of new
Jerusalem ([Rev 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md), [Rev
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#021).md). Six thus symbolizes the world
broken, and without solid foundation. Twice twelve is the number of the
heavenly elders; twelve times twelve thousand the number of the sealed
elect ([Rev 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#004).md): the tree of life
yields twelve manner of fruits. Doubtless, besides this symbolic force,
there is a special chronological meaning in the numbers; but as yet,
though a commanded subject of investigation, they have received no
solution which we can be sure is the true one. They are intended to
stimulate reverent inquiry, not to gratify idle speculative curiosity;
and when the event shall have been fulfilled, they will show the divine
wisdom of God, who ordered all things in minutely harmonious relations,
and left neither the times nor the ways haphazard.

The arguments for the year-day theory are as follows: [Dan
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md), "Seventy weeks are determined
upon," where the Hebrew may be seventy sevens; but MEDE observes, the
Hebrew word means always seven of days, and never seven of years ([Lev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#005.md); [Deu
16:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009.md), [Deu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#016).md). Again, the number of years'
wandering of the Israelites was made to correspond to the number of days
in which the spies searched the land, namely, forty: compare "each day
for a year," [Num 14:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#033.md). So in [Eze
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#005.md), "I have laid up on thee the
years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three
hundred and ninety days . . . forty days: I have appointed thee each day
for a year." John, in Revelation itself, uses days in a sense which can
hardly be literal. [Rev 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#010.md), "Ye
shall have tribulation ten days": the persecution of ten years recorded
by EUSEBIUS seems to correspond to it. In the year-day theory there is
still quite enough of obscurity to exercise the patience and probation
of faith, for we cannot say precisely when the 1260 years begin: so that
this theory is quite compatible with Christ's words, "Of that day and
hour knoweth no man" \[[Mat 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036.md);
[Mar 13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)\]. However, it is a
difficulty in this theory that "a thousand years," in [Rev
20:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#006.md), can hardly mean one thousand
by three hundred sixty days, that is, three hundred sixty thousand
years. The first resurrection there must be literal, even as [Rev
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005.md) must be taken literally, "the
rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished"
([Rev 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#005).md). To interpret the former
spiritually would entail the need of interpreting the latter so, which
would be most improbable; for it would imply that "the rest of the
(spiritually) dead lived not (spiritually)" until the end of the
thousand years, and then that they did come spiritually to life. [Co1
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md), "they that are Christ's at His
coming," confirms the literal view.
