### [Exodus Chapter 31](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 31:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 31:2</span></span>

BEZALEEL AND AHOLIAB. (Exo. 31:1-18)

See, I have called--Though the instructions about the tabernacle were
privately communicated to Moses, it was plainly impossible that he could
superintend the work in person, amid the multiplicity of his other
duties. A head director or builder was selected by God Himself; and the
nomination by such high authority removed all ground of jealousy or
discontent on the part of any who might have thought their merits
overlooked (compare [Mat 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001).md).

by name Bezaleel--signifying "in the shadow or protection of God"; and,
as called to discharge a duty of great magnitude--to execute a
confidential trust in the ancient Church of God, he has his family and
lineage recorded with marked distinction. He belonged to the tribe of
Judah, which, doubtless for wise and weighty reasons, God all along
delighted to honor; and he was the grandson of Hur, a pious patriot
([Exo 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#012).md), who was associated, by a
special commission, with Aaron in the government of the people during
the absence of Moses. Moreover, it may be noticed that a Jewish
tradition affirms Hur to be the husband of Miriam; and if this tradition
may be relied on, it affords an additional reason for the appointment of
Bezaleel emanating from the direct authority of God.

[Exodus 31:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 31:3</span></span>

I have filled him with the spirit of God--It is probable that he was
naturally endowed with a mechanical genius, and had acquired in Egypt
great knowledge and skill in the useful, as well as liberal, arts so as
to be a first-class artisan, competent to take charge of both the plain
and ornamental work, which the building of the sacred edifice required.
When God has any special work to be accomplished, He always raises up
instruments capable of doing it; and it is likely that He had given to
the son of Uri that strong natural aptitude and those opportunities of
gaining mechanical skill, with an ultimate view to this responsible
office. Notwithstanding that his grand duty was to conform with
scrupulous fidelity to the pattern furnished, there was still plenty of
room for inventive talent and tasteful exactness in the execution; and
his natural and acquired gifts were enlarged and invigorated for the
important work.

[Exodus 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 31:6</span></span>

I have given with him Aholiab--He belonged to the tribe of Dan, one of
the least influential and honorable in Israel; and here, too, we can
trace the evidence of wise and paternal design, in choosing the
colleague or assistant of Bezaleel from an inferior tribe (compare [Co1
12:14-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#014.md); also [Mar
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#007).md).

all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom--At that period, when one
spirit pervaded all Israel, it was not the man full of heavenly genius
who presided over the work; but all who contributed their skill,
experience, and labor, in rendering the smallest assistance, showed
their piety and devotedness to the divine service. In like manner, it
was at the commencement of the Christian Church ([Act
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md); [Act
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002).md).

[Exodus 31:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">exo 31:12</span></span>

Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep--The reason for the fresh inculcation
of the fourth commandment at this particular period was, that the great
ardor and eagerness, with which all classes betook themselves to the
construction of the tabernacle, exposed them to the temptation of
encroaching on the sanctity of the appointed day of rest. They might
suppose that the erection of the tabernacle was a sacred work, and that
it would be a high merit, an acceptable tribute, to prosecute the
undertaking without the interruption of a day's repose; and therefore
the caution here given, at the commencement of the undertaking, was a
seasonable admonition.

[Exodus 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">exo 31:18</span></span>

tables of stone, written with the finger of God--containing the ten
commandments ([Exo 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#012).md), called
"tables of testimony," because God testified His will in them.
