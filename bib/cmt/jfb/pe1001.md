[1 Peter 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pe1 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS TO THE ELECTED OF THE GODHEAD: THANKSGIVING FOR THE LIVING HOPE
TO WHICH WE ARE BEGOTTEN, PRODUCING JOY AMIDST SUFFERINGS: THIS
SALVATION AN OBJECT OF DEEPEST INTEREST TO PROPHETS AND TO ANGELS: ITS
COSTLY PRICE A MOTIVE TO HOLINESS AND LOVE, AS WE ARE BORN AGAIN OF THE
EVER-ABIDING WORD OF GOD. (1Pe. 1:1-25)

Peter--Greek form of Cephas, man of rock.

an apostle of Jesus Christ--"He who preaches otherwise than as a
messenger of Christ, is not to be heard; if he preach as such, then it
is all one as if thou didst hear Christ speaking in thy presence"
\[LUTHER\].

to the strangers scattered--literally, "sojourners of the dispersion";
only in [Joh 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#035.md) and [Jam
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md), in New Testament, and the
Septuagint, [Psa 147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md), "the outcasts
of Israel"; the designation peculiarly given to the Jews in their
dispersed state throughout the world ever since the Babylonian
captivity. These he, as the apostle of the circumcision, primarily
addresses, but not in the limited temporal sense only; he regards their
temporal condition as a shadow of their spiritual calling to be
strangers and pilgrims on earth, looking for the heavenly Jerusalem as
their home. So the Gentile Christians, as the spiritual Israel, are
included secondarily, as having the same high calling. He ([Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md); [Pe1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#003).md) plainly refers to Christian
Gentiles (compare [Pe1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011).md). Christians, if they rightly
consider their calling, must never settle themselves here, but feel
themselves travellers. As the Jews in their dispersion diffused through
the nations the knowledge of the one God, preparatory to Christ's first
advent, so Christians, by their dispersion among the unconverted,
diffuse the knowledge of Christ, preparatory to His second advent. "The
children of God scattered abroad" constitute one whole in Christ, who
"gathers them together in one," now partially and in Spirit, hereafter
perfectly and visibly. "Elect," in the Greek order, comes before
"strangers"; elect, in relation to heaven, strangers, in relation to the
earth. The election here is that of individuals to eternal life by the
sovereign grace of God, as the sequel shows. "While each is certified of
his own election by the Spirit, he receives no assurance concerning
others, nor are we to be too inquisitive \[[Joh
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#021.md)\]; Peter numbers them among
the elect, as they carried the appearance of having been regenerated"
\[CALVIN\]. He calls the whole Church by the designation strictly
belonging only to the better portion of them \[CALVIN\]. The election to
hearing, and that to eternal life, are distinct. Realization of our
election is a strong motive to holiness. The minister invites all, yet
he does not hide the truth that in none but the elect will the preaching
effect eternal blessing. As the chief fruit of exhortations, and even of
threatenings, redounds to "the elect"; therefore, at the outset, Peter
addresses them. STEIGER translates, to "the elect pilgrims who form the
dispersion in Pontus.", &c. The order of the provinces is that in which
they would be viewed by one writing from the east from Babylon ([Pe1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#013).md); from northeast southwards to
Galatia, southeast to Cappadocia, then Asia, and back to Bithynia, west
of Pontus. Contrast the order, [Act
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009.md). He now was ministering to those
same peoples as he preached to on Pentecost: "Parthians, Medes,
Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia and Judea," that is, the Jews now
subject to the Parthians, whose capital was Babylon, where he labored in
person; "dwellers in Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Bithynia," the
Asiatic dispersion derived from Babylon, whom he ministers to by letter.

[1 Peter 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">pe1 1:2</span></span>

foreknowledge--foreordaining love ([Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).md), inseparable from God's
foreknowledge, the origin from which, and pattern according to which,
election takes place. [Act 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#023.md), and
[Rom 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md), prove "foreknowledge" to be
foreordination. God's foreknowledge is not the perception of any ground
of action out of Himself; still in it liberty is comprehended, and all
absolute constraint debarred \[ANSELM in STEIGER\]. For so the Son of
God was "foreknown" (so the Greek for "foreordained," [Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).md) to be the sacrificial Lamb, not
against, or without His will, but His will rested in the will of the
Father; this includes self-conscious action; nay, even cheerful
acquiescense. The Hebrew and Greek "know" include approval and
acknowledging as one's own. The Hebrew marks the oneness of loving and
choosing, by having one word for both, bachar (Greek, "hairetizo,"
Septuagint). Peter descends from the eternal "election" of God through
the new birth, to the believer's "sanctification," that from this he
might again raise them through the consideration of their new birth to a
"living hope" of the heavenly "inheritance" \[HEIDEGGER\]. The divine
three are introduced in their respective functions in redemption.

through--Greek, "in"; the element in which we are elected. The
"election" of God realized and manifested itself "IN" their
sanctification. Believers are "sanctified through the offering of Christ
once for all" ([Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010).md). "Thou must
believe and know that thou art holy; not, however, through thine own
piety, but through the blood of Christ" \[LUTHER\]. This is the true
sanctification of the Spirit, to obey the Gospel, to trust in Christ
\[BULLINGER\].

sanctification--the Spirit's setting apart of the saint as consecrated
to God. The execution of God's choice ([Gal
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004).md). God the Father gives us
salvation by gratuitous election; the Son earns it by His
blood-shedding; the Holy Spirit applies the merit of the Son to the soul
by the Gospel word \[CALVIN\]. Compare [Num
6:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md), the Old Testament triple
blessing.

unto obedience--the result or end aimed at by God as respects us, the
obedience which consists in faith, and that which flows from faith;
"obeying the truth through the Spirit" ([Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md). [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md), "obedience to the faith," and
obedience the fruit of faith.

sprinkling, &c.--not in justification through the atonement once for
all, which is expressed in the previous clauses, but (as the order
proves) the daily being sprinkled by Christ's blood, and so cleansed
from all sin, which is the privilege of one already justified and
"walking in the light."

Grace--the source of "peace."

be multiplied--still further than already. [Dan
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#001.md), "Ye have now peace and grace, but
still not in perfection; therefore, ye must go on increasing until the
old Adam be dead" \[LUTHER\].

[1 Peter 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pe1 1:3</span></span>

He begins, like Paul, in opening his Epistles with giving thanks to God
for the greatness of the salvation; herein he looks forward (1) into the
future ([Pe1 1:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003)); (2.md) backward into
the past ([Pe1 1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010).md) \[ALFORD\].

Blessed--A distinct Greek word (eulogetos, "Blessed BE") is used of God,
from that used of man (eulogemenos, "Blessed IS").

Father--This whole Epistle accords with the Lord's prayer; "Father,"
[Pe1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), [Pe1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md), [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md), [Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002.md); "Our," [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md), end; "In heaven," [Pe1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md); "Hallowed be Thy name," [Pe1
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md); [Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015.md); "Thy kingdom come," [Pe1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); "Thy will be done," [Pe1
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015.md); [Pe1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#017.md); [Pe1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#002.md), [Pe1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019.md); "daily bread," [Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md); "forgiveness of sins," [Pe1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008.md), [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001.md); "temptation," [Pe1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md); "deliverance," [Pe1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#018.md) \[BENGEL\]; Compare [Pe1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md); [Pe1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#007.md), for allusions to prayer. "Barak,"
Hebrew "bless," is literally "kneel." God, as the original source of
blessing, must be blessed through all His works.

abundant--Greek, "much," "full." That God's "mercy" should reach us,
guilty and enemies, proves its fulness. "Mercy" met our misery; "grace,"
our guilt.

begotten us again--of the Spirit by the word ([Pe1
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023).md); whereas we were children of
wrath naturally, and dead in sins.

unto--so that we have.

lively--Greek, "living." It has life in itself, gives life, and looks
for life as its object \[DE WETTE\]. Living is a favorite expression of
Peter ([Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md); [Pe1
2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004).md). He delights in contemplating
life overcoming death in the believer. Faith and love follow hope ([Pe1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md), [Pe1
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#021)). "(Unto.md) a lively hope" is
further explained by "(To) an inheritance incorruptible . . . fadeth not
away," and "(unto) salvation . . . ready to be revealed in the last
time." I prefer with BENGEL and STEIGER to join as in Greek, "Unto a
hope living (possessing life and vitality) through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ." Faith, the subjective means of the spiritual resurrection
of the soul, is wrought by the same power whereby Christ was raised from
the dead. Baptism is an objective means ([Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021).md). Its moral fruit is a new life.
The connection of our sonship with the resurrection appears also in [Luk
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md); [Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md). Christ's resurrection is the
cause of ours, (1) as an efficient cause ([Co1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#022)); (2.md) as an exemplary cause, all
the saints being about to rise after the similitude of His resurrection.
Our "hope" is, Christ rising from the dead hath ordained the power, and
is become the pattern of the believer's resurrection. The soul, born
again from its natural state into the life of grace, is after that born
again unto the life of glory. [Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md), "regeneration, when the Son of
man shall sit in the throne of His glory"; the resurrection of our
bodies is a kind of coming out of the womb of the earth and entering
upon immortality, a nativity into another life \[BISHOP PEARSON\]. The
four causes of our salvation are; (1) the primary cause, God's mercy;
(2) the proximate cause, Christ's death and resurrection; (3) the formal
cause, our regeneration; (4) the final cause, our eternal bliss. As John
is the disciple of love, so Paul of faith, and Peter of hope. Hence,
Peter, most of all the apostles, urges the resurrection of Christ; an
undesigned coincidence between the history and the Epistle, and so a
proof of genuineness. Christ's resurrection was the occasion of his own
restoration by Christ after his fall.

[1 Peter 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pe1 1:4</span></span>

To an inheritance--the object of our "hope" ([Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md), which is therefore not a dead,
but a "living" hope. The inheritance is the believer's already by title,
being actually assigned to him; the entrance on its possession is
future, and hoped for as a certainty. Being "begotten again" as a "son,"
he is an "heir," as earthly fathers beget children who shall inherit
their goods. The inheritance is "salvation" ([Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md), [Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009).md); "the grace to be brought at the
revelation of Christ" ([Pe1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013).md); "a
crown of glory that fadeth not away."

incorruptible--not having within the germs of death. Negations of the
imperfections which meet us on every side here are the chief means of
conveying to our minds a conception of the heavenly things which "have
not entered into the heart of man," and which we have not faculties now
capable of fully knowing. Peter, sanguine, impulsive, and highly
susceptible of outward impressions, was the more likely to feel
painfully the deep-seated corruption which, lurking under the outward
splendor of the loveliest of earthly things, dooms them soon to
rottenness and decay.

undefiled--not stained as earthly goods by sin, either in the acquiring,
or in the using of them; unsusceptible of any stain. "The rich man is
either a dishonest man himself, or the heir of a dishonest man"
\[JEROME\]. Even Israel's inheritance was defiled by the people's sins.
Defilement intrudes even on our holy things now, whereas God's service
ought to be undefiled.

that fadeth not away--Contrast [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md). Even the most delicate part of
the heavenly inheritance, its bloom, continues unfading. "In substance
incorruptible; in purity undefiled; in beauty unfading" \[ALFORD\].

reserved--kept up ([Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md), "laid up
for you in heaven," [Ti2 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008).md); Greek
perfect, expressing a fixed and abiding state, "which has been and is
reserved." The inheritance is in security, beyond risk, out of the reach
of Satan, though we for whom it is reserved are still in the midst of
dangers. Still, if we be believers, we too, as well as the inheritance,
are "kept" (the same Greek, [Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012).md) by Jesus safely ([Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005).md).

in heaven--Greek, "in the heavens," where it can neither be destroyed
nor plundered. It does not follow that, because it is now laid up in
heaven, it shall not hereafter be on earth also.

for you--It is secure not only in itself from all misfortune, but also
from all alienation, so that no other can receive it in your stead. He
had said us ([Pe1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003).md); he now turns
his address to the elect in order to encourage and exhort them.

[1 Peter 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">pe1 1:5</span></span>

kept--Greek, "who are being guarded." He answers the objection, Of what
use is it that salvation is "reserved" for us in heaven, as in a calm
secure haven, when we are tossed in the world as on a troubled sea in
the midst of a thousand wrecks? \[CALVIN\]. As the inheritance is "kept"
([Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).md) safely for the far distant
"heirs," so must they be "guarded" in their persons so as to be sure of
reaching it. Neither shall it be wanting to them, nor they to it. "We
are guarded in the world as our inheritance is kept in heaven." This
defines the "you" of [Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004.md). The
inheritance, remember, belongs only to those who "endure unto the end,"
being "guarded" by, or IN "the power of God, through faith." Contrast
[Luk 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md). God Himself is our sole
guarding power. "It is His power which saves us from our enemies. It is
His long-suffering which saves us from ourselves" \[BENGEL\]. [Jde
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001.md), "preserved in Christ Jesus"; [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md); [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md), "keep"; Greek, "guard," as here.
This guarding is effected, on the part of God, by His "power," the
efficient cause; on the part of man, "through faith," the effective
means.

by--Greek, "in." The believer lives spiritually in God, and in virtue of
His power, and God lives in him. "In" marks that the cause is inherent
in the means, working organically through them with living influence, so
that the means, in so far as the cause works organically through them,
exist also in the cause. The power of God which guards the believer is
no external force working upon him from without with mechanical
necessity, but the spiritual power of God in which he lives, and with
whose Spirit he is clothed. It comes down on, and then dwells in him,
even as he is in it \[STEIGER\]. Let none flatter himself he is being
guarded by the power of God unto salvation, if he be not walking by
faith. Neither speculative knowledge and reason, nor works of seeming
charity, will avail, severed from faith. It is through faith that
salvation is both received and kept.

unto salvation--the final end of the new birth. "Salvation," not merely
accomplished for us in title by Christ, and made over to us on our
believing, but actually manifested, and finally completed.

ready to be revealed--When Christ shall be revealed, it shall be
revealed. The preparations for it are being made now, and began when
Christ came: "All things are now ready"; the salvation is already
accomplished, and only waits the Lord's time to be manifested: He "is
ready to judge."

last time--the last day, closing the day of grace; the day of judgment,
of redemption, of the restitution of all things, and of perdition of the
ungodly.

[1 Peter 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pe1 1:6</span></span>

Wherein--in which prospect of final salvation.

greatly rejoice--"exult with joy": "are exuberantly glad." Salvation is
realized by faith ([Pe1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009).md) as a
thing so actually present as to cause exulting joy in spite of existing
afflictions.

for a season--Greek, "for a little time."

if need be--"if it be God's will that it should be so" \[ALFORD\], for
not all believers are afflicted. One need not invite or lay a cross on
himself, but only "take up" the cross which God imposes ("his cross");
[Ti2 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012.md) is not to be pressed too
far. Not every believer, nor every sinner, is tried with afflictions
\[THEOPHYLACT\]. Some falsely think that notwithstanding our forgiveness
in Christ, a kind of atonement, or expiation by suffering, is needed.

ye are in heaviness--Greek, "ye were grieved." The "grieved" is regarded
as past, the "exulting joy" present. Because the realized joy of the
coming salvation makes the present grief seem as a thing of the past. At
the first shock of affliction ye were grieved, but now by anticipation
ye rejoice, regarding the present grief as past.

through--Greek, "IN": the element in which the grief has place.

manifold--many and of various kinds ([Pe1
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012).md).

temptations--"trials" testing your faith.

[1 Peter 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">pe1 1:7</span></span>

Aim of the "temptations."

trial--testing, proving. That your faith so proved "may be found
(aorist; once for all, as the result of its being proved on the
judgment-day) unto (eventuating in) praise," &c., namely, the praise to
be bestowed by the Judge.

than that of gold--rather, "than gold."

though--"which perisheth, YET is tried with fire." If gold, though
perishing ([Pe1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md), is yet tried
with fire in order to remove dross and test its genuineness, how much
more does your faith, which shall never perish, need to pass through a
fiery trial to remove whatever is defective, and to test its genuineness
and full value?

glory--"Honor" is not so strong as "glory." As "praise" is in words, so
"honor" is in deeds: honorary reward.

appearing--Translate as in [Pe1 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md),
"revelation." At Christ's revelation shall take place also the
revelation of the sons of God ([Rom
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md), "manifestation," Greek,
"revelation"; [Jo1 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md), Greek,
"manifested . . . manifested," for "appear . . . appear").

[1 Peter 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">pe1 1:8</span></span>

not having seen, ye love--though in other cases it is knowledge of the
person that produces love to him. They are more "blessed that have not
seen and yet have believed," than they who believed because they have
seen. On Peter's own love to Jesus, compare [Joh
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md). Though the apostles had seen
Him, they now ceased to know Him merely after the flesh.

in whom--connected with "believing": the result of which is "ye rejoice"
(Greek, "exult").

now--in the present state, as contrasted with the future state when
believers "shall see His face."

unspeakable-- ([Co1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md).

full of glory--Greek, "glorified." A joy now already encompassed with
glory. The "glory" is partly in present possession, through the presence
of Christ, "the Lord of glory," in the soul; partly in assured
anticipation. "The Christian's joy is bound up with love to Jesus: its
ground is faith; it is not therefore either self-seeking or
self-sufficient" \[STEIGER\].

[1 Peter 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pe1 1:9</span></span>

Receiving--in sure anticipation; "the end of your faith," that is, its
crowning consummation, finally completed "salvation" (Peter here
confirms Paul's teaching as to justification by faith): also receiving
now the title to it and the first-fruits of it. In [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md) the "salvation" is represented as
already present, whereas "the prophets" had it not as yet present. It
must, therefore, in this verse, refer to the present: Deliverance now
from a state of wrath: believers even now "receive salvation," though
its full "revelation" is future.

of . . . souls--The immortal soul was what was lost, so "salvation"
primarily concerns the soul; the body shall share in redemption
hereafter; the soul of the believer is saved already: an additional
proof that "receiving . . . salvation" is here a thing present.

[1 Peter 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">pe1 1:10</span></span>

The magnitude of this "salvation" is proved by the earnestness with
which "prophets" and even "angels" searched into it. Even from the
beginning of the world this salvation has been testified to by the Holy
Spirit.

prophets--Though there is no Greek article, yet English Version is
right, "the prophets" generally (including all the Old Testament
inspired authors), as "the angels" similarly refer to them in general.

inquired--perseveringly: so the Greek. Much more is manifested to us
than by diligent inquiry and search the prophets attained. Still it is
not said, they searched after it, but concerning (so the Greek for "of")
it. They were already certain of the redemption being about to come.
They did not like us fully see, but they desired to see the one and the
same Christ whom we fully see in spirit. "As Simeon was anxiously
desiring previously, and tranquil in peace only when he had seen Christ,
so all the Old Testament saints saw Christ only hidden, and as it were
absent--absent not in power and grace, but inasmuch as He was not yet
manifested in the flesh" \[CALVIN\]. The prophets, as private
individuals, had to reflect on the hidden and far-reaching sense of
their own prophecies; because their words, as prophets, in their public
function, were not so much their own as the Spirit's, speaking by and in
them: thus Caiaphas. A striking testimony to verbal inspiration; the
words which the inspired authors wrote are God's words expressing the
mind of the Spirit, which the writers themselves searched into, to
fathom the deep and precious meaning, even as the believing readers did.
"Searched" implies that they had determinate marks to go by in their
search.

the grace that should come unto you--namely, the grace of the New
Testament: an earnest of "the grace" of perfected "salvation . . . to be
brought at the (second) revelation of Christ." Old Testament believers
also possessed the grace of God; they were children of God, but it was
as children in their nonage, so as to be like servants; whereas we enjoy
the full privileges of adult sons.

[1 Peter 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pe1 1:11</span></span>

what--Greek, "In reference to what, or what manner of time." What
expresses the time absolutely: what was to be the era of Messiah's
coming; what manner of time; what events and features should
characterize the time of His coming. The "or" implies that some of the
prophets, if they could not as individuals discover the exact time,
searched into its characteristic features and events. The Greek for
"time" is the season, the epoch, the fit time in God's purposes.

Spirit of Christ . . . in them-- ([Act
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007.md), in oldest manuscripts, "the
Spirit of Jesus"; [Rev 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010).md). So
JUSTIN MARTYR says, "Jesus was He who appeared and communed with Moses,
Abraham, and the other patriarchs." CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA calls Him "the
Prophet of prophets, and Lord of all the prophetical spirit."

did signify--"did give intimation."

of--Greek, "the sufferers (appointed) unto Christ," or foretold in
regard to Christ. "Christ," the anointed Mediator, whose sufferings are
the price of our "salvation" ([Pe1
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009).md), and who is the channel of
"the grace that should come unto you."

the glory--Greek, "glories," namely, of His resurrection, of His
ascension, of His judgment and coming kingdom, the necessary consequence
of the sufferings.

that should follow--Greek, "after these (sufferings)," [Pe1
3:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md); [Pe1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001.md). Since "the Spirit of Christ" is
the Spirit of God, Christ is God. It is only because the Son of God was
to become our Christ that He manifested Himself and the Father through
Him in the Old Testament, and by the Holy Spirit, eternally proceeding
from the Father and Himself, spake in the prophets.

[1 Peter 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pe1 1:12</span></span>

Not only was the future revealed to them, but this also, that these
revelations of the future were given them not for themselves, but for
our good in Gospel times. This, so far from disheartening, only
quickened them in unselfishly testifying in the Spirit for the partial
good of their own generation (only of believers), and for the full
benefit of posterity. Contrast in Gospel times, [Rev
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#010.md). Not that their prophecies were
unattended with spiritual instruction as to the Redeemer to their own
generation, but the full light was not to be given till Messiah should
come; it was well that they should have this "revealed" to them, lest
they should be disheartened in not clearly discovering with all their
inquiry and search the full particulars of the coming "salvation." To
Daniel ([Dan 9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#025).md) the "time" was
revealed. Our immense privileges are thus brought forth by contrast with
theirs, notwithstanding that they had the great honor of Christ's Spirit
speaking in them; and this, as an incentive to still greater earnestness
on our part than even they manifested ([Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013), &c..md).

us--The oldest manuscripts read "you," as in [Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md). This verse implies that we,
Christians, may understand the prophecies by the Spirit's aid in their
most important part, namely, so far as they have been already fulfilled.

with the Holy Ghost sent down--on Pentecost. The oldest manuscripts omit
Greek preposition en, that is, "in"; then translate, "by." The
Evangelists speaking by the Holy Spirit were infallible witnesses. "The
Spirit of Christ" was in the prophets also ([Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md), but not manifestly, as in the
case of the Christian Church and its first preachers, "SENT down from
heaven." How favored are we in being ministered to, as to "salvation,"
by prophets and apostles alike, the latter now announcing the same
things as actually fulfilled which the former foretold.

which things--"the things now reported unto you" by the evangelistic
preachers "Christ's sufferings and the glory that should follow" ([Pe1
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md).

angels--still higher than "the prophets" ([Pe1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010).md). Angels do not any more than
ourselves possess an INTUITIVE knowledge of redemption. "To look into"
in Greek is literally, "to bend over so as to look deeply into and see
to the bottom of a thing." See on [Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025.md), on same word. As the cherubim
stood bending over the mercy seat, the emblem of redemption, in the
holiest place, so the angels intently gaze upon and desire to fathom the
depths of "the great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh,
justified in the Spirit, seen of angels" ([Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md). Their "ministry to the heirs of
salvation" naturally disposes them to wish to penetrate this mystery as
reflecting such glory on the love, justice, wisdom, and power of their
and our God and Lord. They can know it only through its manifestation in
the Church, as they personally have not the direct share in it that we
have. "Angels have only the contrast between good and evil, without the
power of conversion from sin to righteousness: witnessing such
conversion in the Church, they long to penetrate the knowledge of the
means whereby it is brought about" \[HOFMAN in ALFORD\].

[1 Peter 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pe1 1:13</span></span>

Wherefore--Seeing that the prophets ministered unto you in these high
Gospel privileges which they did not themselves fully share in, though
"searching" into them, and seeing that even angels "desire to look into"
them, how earnest you ought to be and watchful in respect to them!

gird up . . . loins--referring to Christ's own words, [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035.md); an image taken from the way in
which the Israelites ate the passover with the loose outer robe girded
up about the waist with a girdle, as ready for a journey. Workmen,
pilgrims, runners, wrestlers, and warriors (all of whom are types of the
Christians), so gird themselves up, both to shorten the garment so as
not to impede motion, and to gird up the body itself so as to be braced
for action. The believer is to have his mind (mental powers) collected
and always ready for Christ's coming. "Gather in the strength of your
spirit" \[HENSLER\]. Sobriety, that is, spiritual self-restraint, lest
one be overcome by the allurements of the world and of sense, and
patient hopeful waiting for Christ's revelation, are the true ways of
"girding up the loins of the mind."

to the end--rather, "perfectly," so that there may be nothing deficient
in your hope, no casting away of your confidence. Still, there may be an
allusion to the "end" mentioned in [Pe1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md). Hope so perfectly (Greek,
"teleios") as to reach unto the end (telos) of your faith and hope,
namely, "the grace that is being brought unto you in (so the Greek) the
revelation of Christ." As grace shall then be perfected, so you ought to
hope perfectly. "Hope" is repeated from [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md). The two appearances are but
different stages of the ONE great revelation of Christ, comprising the
New Testament from the beginning to the end.

[1 Peter 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pe1 1:14</span></span>

From sobriety of spirit and endurance of hope Peter passes to obedience,
holiness, and reverential fear.

As--marking their present actual character as "born again" ([Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md).

obedient children--Greek, "children of obedience": children to whom
obedience is their characteristic and ruling nature, as a child is of
the same nature as the mother and father. Contrast [Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md), "the children of disobedience."
Compare [Pe1 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md), "obeying the
Father" whose "children" ye are. Having the obedience of faith (compare
[Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md) and so of practice (compare
[Pe1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016.md), [Pe1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md). "Faith is the highest
obedience, because discharged to the highest command" \[LUTHER\].

fashioning--The outward fashion (Greek, "schema") is fleeting, and
merely on the surface. The "form," or conformation in the New Testament,
is something deeper and more perfect and essential.

the former lusts in--which were characteristic of your state of
ignorance of God: true of both Jews and Gentiles. The sanctification is
first described negatively ([Pe1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#014.md),
"not fashioning yourselves," &c.; the putting off the old man, even in
the outward fashion, as well as in the inward conformation), then
positively ([Pe1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md), putting on the
new man, compare [Eph 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022.md), [Eph
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#024).md). "Lusts" flow from the original
birth-sin (inherited from our first parents, who by self-willed desire
brought sin into the world), the lust which, ever since man has been
alienated from God, seeks to fill up with earthly things the emptiness
of his being; the manifold forms which the mother-lust assumes are
called in the plural lusts. In the regenerate, as far as the new man is
concerned, which constitutes his truest self, "sin" no longer exists;
but in the flesh or old man it does. Hence arises the conflict,
uninterruptedly maintained through life, wherein the new man in the main
prevails, and at last completely. But the natural man knows only the
combat of his lusts with one another, or with the law, without power to
conquer them.

[1 Peter 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pe1 1:15</span></span>

Literally, "But (rather) after the pattern of Him who hath called you
(whose characteristic is that He is) holy, be (Greek, 'become') ye
yourselves also holy." God is our grand model. God's calling is a
frequently urged motive in Peter's Epistles. Every one that begets,
begets an offspring resembling himself \[EPIPHANIUS\]. "Let the acts of
the offspring indicate similarity to the Father" \[AUGUSTINE\].

conversation--deportment, course of life: one's way of going about, as
distinguished from one's internal nature, to which it must outwardly
correspond. Christians are already holy unto God by consecration; they
must be so also in their outward walk and behavior in all respects. The
outward must correspond to the inward man.

[1 Peter 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pe1 1:16</span></span>

Scripture is the true source of all authority in questions of doctrine
and practice.

Be ye . . . for I am--It is I with whom ye have to do. Ye are mine.
Therefore abstain from Gentile pollutions. We are too prone to have
respect unto men \[CALVIN\]. As I am the fountain of holiness, being
holy in My essence, be ye therefore zealous to be partakers of holiness,
that ye may be as I also am \[DIDYMUS\]. God is essentially holy: the
creature is holy in so far as it is sanctified by God. God, in giving
the command, is willing to give also the power to obey it, namely,
through the sanctifying of the Spirit ([Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md).

[1 Peter 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pe1 1:17</span></span>

if ye call on--that is, "seeing that ye call on," for all the regenerate
pray as children of God, "Our Father who art in heaven" ([Mat
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009.md); [Luk
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#002).md).

the Father--rather, "Call upon as Father Him who without acceptance of
persons ([Act 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md); [Rom
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md); [Jam
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md), not accepting the Jew above the
Gentile, [Ch2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007.md); [Luk
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#021.md); properly said of a judge not
biassed in judgment by respect of persons) judgeth," &c. The Father
judgeth by His Son, His Representative, exercising His delegated
authority ([Joh 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022).md). This marks the
harmonious and complete unity of the Trinity.

work--Each man's work is one complete whole, whether good or bad. The
particular works of each are manifestations of the general character of
his lifework, whether it was of faith and love whereby alone we can
please God and escape condemnation.

pass--Greek, "conduct yourselves during."

sojourning--The outward state of the Jews in their dispersion is an
emblem of the sojourner-like state of all believers in this world, away
from our true Fatherland.

fear--reverential, not slavish. He who is your Father, is also your
Judge--a thought which may well inspire reverential fear. THEOPHYLACT
observes, A double fear is mentioned in Scripture: (1) elementary,
causing one to become serious; (2) perfective: the latter is here the
motive by which Peter urges them as sons of God to be obedient. Fear is
not here opposed to assurance, but to carnal security: fear producing
vigilant caution lest we offend God and backslide. "Fear and hope flow
from the same fountain: fear prevents us from falling away from hope"
\[BENGEL\]. Though love has no fear IN it, yet in our present state of
imperfect love, it needs to have fear going ALONG WITH It as a
subordinate principle. This fear drowns all other fears. The believer
fears God, and so has none else to fear. Not to fear God is the greatest
baseness and folly. The martyrs' more than mere human courage flowed
from this.

[1 Peter 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">pe1 1:18</span></span>

Another motive to reverential, vigilant fear ([Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017).md) of displeasing God, the
consideration of the costly price of our redemption from sin. Observe,
it is we who are bought by the blood of Christ, not heaven. The blood of
Christ is not in Scripture said to buy heaven for us: heaven is the
"inheritance" ([Pe1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#004).md) given to us
as sons, by the promise of God.

corruptible--Compare [Pe1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md), "gold
that perisheth," [Pe1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md).

silver and gold--Greek, "or." Compare Peter's own words, [Act
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md) : an undesigned coincidence.

redeemed--Gold and silver being liable to corruption themselves, can
free no one from spiritual and bodily death; they are therefore of too
little value. Contrast [Pe1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md),
Christ's "precious blood." The Israelites were ransomed with half a
shekel each, which went towards purchasing the lamb for the daily
sacrifice ([Exo 30:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#012.md); compare [Num
3:44-51](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044).md). But the Lamb who redeems the
spiritual Israelites does so "without money or price." Devoted by sin to
the justice of God, the Church of the first-born is redeemed from sin
and the curse with Christ's precious blood ([Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); [Ti1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md); [Tit
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md); [Rev
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009).md). In all these passages there is
the idea of substitution, the giving of one for another by way of a
ransom or equivalent. Man is "sold under sin" as a slave; shut up under
condemnation and the curse. The ransom was, therefore, paid to the
righteously incensed Judge, and was accepted as a vicarious satisfaction
for our sin by God, inasmuch as it was His own love as well as
righteousness which appointed it. An Israelite sold as a bond-servant
for debt might be redeemed by one of his brethren. As, therefore, we
could not redeem ourselves, Christ assumed our nature in order to become
our nearest of kin and brother, and so our God or Redeemer. Holiness is
the natural fruit of redemption "from our vain conversation"; for He by
whom we are redeemed is also He for whom we are redeemed. "Without the
righteous abolition of the curse, either there could be found no
deliverance, or, what is impossible, the grace and righteousness of God
must have come in collision" \[STEIGER\]; but now, Christ having borne
the curse of our sin, frees from it those who are made God's children by
His Spirit.

vain--self-deceiving, unreal, and unprofitable: promising good which it
does not perform. Compare as to the Gentiles, [Act
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md); [Rom
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021.md); [Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md); as to human philosophers, [Co1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#020.md); as to the disobedient Jews, [Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md).

conversation--course of life. To know what our sin is we must know what
it cost.

received by tradition from your fathers--The Jews' traditions. "Human
piety is a vain blasphemy, and the greatest sin that a man can commit"
\[LUTHER\]. There is only one Father to be imitated, [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017.md); compare [Mat
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md), the same antithesis \[BENGEL\].

[1 Peter 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pe1 1:19</span></span>

precious--of inestimable value. The Greek order is, "With precious
blood, as of a lamb without blemish (in itself) and without spot
(contracted by contact with others), (even the blood) of Christ." Though
very man, He remained pure in Himself ("without blemish"), and
uninfected by any impression of sin from without ("without spot"), which
would have unfitted Him for being our atoning Redeemer: so the passover
lamb, and every sacrificial victim; so too, the Church, the Bride, by
her union with Him. As Israel's redemption from Egypt required the blood
of the paschal lamb, so our redemption from sin and the curse required
the blood of Christ; "foreordained" ([Pe1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020).md) from eternity, as the passover
lamb was taken up on the tenth day of the month.

[1 Peter 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pe1 1:20</span></span>

God's eternal foreordination of Christ's redeeming sacrifice, and
completion of it in these last times for us, are an additional
obligation on us to our maintaining a holy walk, considering how great
things have been thus done for us. Peter's language in the history
corresponds with this here: an undesigned coincidence and mark of
genuineness. Redemption was no afterthought, or remedy of an unforeseen
evil, devised at the time of its arising. God's foreordaining of the
Redeemer refutes the slander that, on the Christian theory, there is a
period of four thousand years of nothing but an incensed God. God chose
us in Christ before the foundation of the world ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004).md).

manifest--in His incarnation in the fulness of the time. He existed from
eternity before He was manifested.

in these last times-- [Co1 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md), "the
ends of the world." This last dispensation, made up of "times" marked by
great changes, but still retaining a general unity, stretches from
Christ's ascension to His coming to judgment.

[1 Peter 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">pe1 1:21</span></span>

by him--Compare "the faith which is by Him," [Act
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#016.md). Through Christ: His Spirit,
obtained for us in His resurrection and ascension, enabling us to
believe. This verse excludes all who do not "by Him believe in God," and
includes all of every age and clime that do. Literally, "are believers
in God." "To believe IN (Greek, 'eis') God" expresses an internal trust:
"by believing to love God, going INTO Him, and cleaving to Him,
incorporated into His members. By this faith the ungodly is justified,
so that thenceforth faith itself begins to work by love" \[P. LOMBARD\].
To believe ON (Greek, "epi," or dative case) God expresses the
confidence, which grounds itself on God, reposing on Him. "Faith IN
(Greek, 'en') His blood" ([Rom 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025).md)
implies that His blood is the element IN which faith has its proper and
abiding place. Compare with this verse, [Act
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#021.md), "Repentance toward (Greek,
'eis,' 'into,' turning towards and going into) God and faith toward
(Greek, 'eis,' 'into') Christ": where, as there is but one article to
both repentance and faith, the two are inseparably joined as together
forming one truth; where "repentance" is, there "faith" is; when one
knows God the Father spiritually, then he must know the Son by whom
alone we can come to the Father. In Christ we have life: if we have not
the doctrine of Christ, we have not God. The only living way to God is
through Christ and His sacrifice.

that raised him--The raising of Jesus by God is the special ground of
our "believing": (1) because by it God declared openly His acceptance of
Him as our righteous substitute; (2) because by it and His glorification
He received power, namely, the Holy Spirit, to impart to His elect
"faith": the same power enabling us to believe as raised Him from the
dead. Our faith must not only be IN Christ, but BY and THROUGH Christ.
"Since in Christ's resurrection and consequent dominion our safety is
grounded, there 'faith' and 'hope' find their stay" \[CALVIN\].

that your faith and hope might be in God--the object and effect of God's
raising Christ. He states what was the actual result and fact, not an
exhortation, except indirectly. Your faith flows from His resurrection;
your hope from God's having "given Him glory" (compare [Pe1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011), "glories".md). Remember God's
having raised and glorified Jesus as the anchor of your faith and hope
in God, and so keep alive these graces. Apart from Christ we could have
only feared, not believed and hoped in God. Compare [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md), [Pe1
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md), [Pe1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013.md), on hope in connection with
faith; love is introduced in [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md).

[1 Peter 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pe1 1:22</span></span>

purified . . . in obeying the truth--Greek, "in your (or 'the')
obedience of (that is, 'to') the truth (the Gospel way of salvation),"
that is, in the fact of your believing. Faith purifies the heart as
giving it the only pure motive, love to God ([Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md); [Rom
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005), "obedience to the faith".md).

through the Spirit--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. The Holy Spirit
is the purifier by bestowing the obedience of faith ([Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003).md).

unto--with a view to: the proper result of the purifying of your hearts
by faith. "For what end must we lead a chaste life? That we may thereby
be saved? No: but for this, that we may serve our neighbor" \[LUTHER\].

unfeigned-- [Pe1 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md), "laying aside
. . . hypocrisies . . . sincere."

love of the brethren--that is, of Christians. Brotherly love is distinct
from common love. "The Christian loves primarily those in Christ;
secondarily, all who might be in Christ, namely, all men, as Christ as
man died for all, and as he hopes that they, too, may become his
Christian brethren" \[STEIGER\]. BENGEL remarks that as here, so in [Pe2
1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#005.md), "brotherly love" is preceded by
the purifying graces, "faith, knowledge, and godliness," &c. Love to the
brethren is the evidence of our regeneration and justification by faith.

love one another--When the purifying by faith into love of the brethren
has formed the habit, then the act follows, so that the "love" is at
once habit and act.

with a pure heart--The oldest manuscripts read, "(love) from the heart."

fervently--Greek, "intensely": with all the powers on the stretch ([Pe1

Christian brotherhood flows from our new birth of an imperishable seed,
the abiding word of God. This is the consideration urged here to lead us
to exercise brotherly love. As natural relationship gives rise to
natural affection, so spiritual relationship gives rise to spiritual,
and therefore abiding love, even as the seed from which it springs is
abiding, not transitory as earthly things.

of . . . of . . . by--"The word of God" is not the material of the
spiritual new birth, but its mean or medium. By means of the word the
man receives the incorruptible seed of the Holy Spirit, and so becomes
one "born again": [Joh 3:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003.md), "born of
water and the Spirit": as there is but one Greek article to the two
nouns, the close connection of the sign and the grace, or new birth
signified is implied. The word is the remote and anterior instrument;
baptism, the proximate and sacramental instrument. The word is the
instrument in relation to the individual; baptism, in relation to the
Church as a society ([Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018).md). We
are born again of the Spirit, yet not without the use of means, but by
the word of God. The word is not the beggeting principle itself, but
only that by which it works: the vehicle of the mysterious germinating
power \[ALFORD\].

which liveth and abideth for ever--It is because the Spirit of God
accompanies it that the word carries in it the germ of life. They who
are so born again live and abide for ever, in contrast to those who sow
to the flesh. "The Gospel bears incorruptible fruits, not dead works,
because it is itself incorruptible" \[BENGEL\]. The word is an eternal
divine power. For though the voice or speech vanishes, there still
remains the kernel, the truth comprehended in the voice. This sinks into
the heart and is living; yea, it is God Himself. So God to Moses, [Exo
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#012.md), "I will be with thy mouth"
\[LUTHER\]. The life is in God, yet it is communicated to us through the
word. "The Gospel shall never cease, though its ministry shall"
\[CALOVIUS\]. The abiding resurrection glory is always connected with
our regeneration by the Spirit. Regeneration beginning with renewing
man's soul at the resurrection, passes on to the body, then to the whole
world of nature.

Scripture proof that the word of God lives for ever, in contrast to
man's natural frailty. If ye were born again of flesh, corruptible seed,
ye must also perish again as the grass; but now that from which you have
derived life remains eternally, and so also will render you eternal.

flesh--man in his mere earthly nature.

as--omitted in some of the oldest manuscripts.

of man--The oldest manuscripts read, "of it" (that is, of the flesh).
"The glory" is the wisdom, strength, riches, learning, honor, beauty,
art, virtue, and righteousness of the NATURAL man (expressed by
"flesh"), which all are transitory ([Joh
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006).md), not OF MAN (as English Version
reads) absolutely, for the glory of man, in his true ideal realized in
the believer, is eternal.

withereth--Greek, aorist: literally, "withered," that is, is withered as
a thing of the past. So also the Greek for "falleth" is "fell away,"
that is, is fallen away: it no sooner is than it is gone.

thereof--omitted in the best manuscripts and versions. "The grass" is
the flesh: "the flower" its glory.

[1 Peter 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025.md)

([Psa 119:89](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#089)..md)

this is the word . . . preached unto you--That is eternal which is born
of incorruptible seed ([Pe1 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024).md): but
ye have received the incorruptible seed, the word ([Pe1
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025).md); therefore ye are born for
eternity, and so are bound now to live for eternity ([Pe1
1:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022).md). Ye have not far to look for
the word; it is among you, even the joyful Gospel message which we
preach. Doubt not that the Gospel preached to you by our brother Paul,
and which ye have embraced, is the eternal truth. Thus the oneness of
Paul's and Peter's creed appears. See my Introduction, showing Peter
addresses some of the same churches as Paul labored among and wrote to.
