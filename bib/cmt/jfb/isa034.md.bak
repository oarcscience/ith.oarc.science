### [Isaiah Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 34:1</span></span>

JUDGMENT ON IDUMEA. (Isa. 34:1-17)

All creation is summoned to hear God's judgments ([Eze
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md); [Deu
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001.md); [Psa
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004.md); [Mic
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001).md), for they set forth His glory,
which is the end of creation ([Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md); [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011).md).

that come forth of it--answering to "all that is therein"; or Hebrew,
"all whatever fills it," Margin.

[Isaiah 34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 34:2</span></span>

utterly destroyed--rather, "doomed them to an utter curse" \[HORSLEY\].

delivered--rather, "appointed."

[Isaiah 34:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 34:3</span></span>

cast out--unburied ([Isa 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#019).md).

melted--washed away as with a descending torrent.

[Isaiah 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 34:4</span></span>

([Psa 102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md); [Joe
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#031.md); [Joe
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#015.md); [Mat
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029).md).

dissolved-- ([Pe2 3:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#010).md). Violent
convulsions of nature are in Scripture made the images of great changes
in the human world ([Isa 24:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#019).md),
and shall literally accompany them at the winding up of the present
dispensation.

scroll--Books were in those days sheets of parchment rolled together
([Rev 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014).md).

fall down--The stars shall fall when the heavens in which they are fixed
pass away.

fig tree-- ([Rev 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 34:5</span></span>

sword-- ([Jer 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010).md). Or else, knife
for sacrifice for God does not here appear as a warrior with His sword,
but as one about to sacrifice victims doomed to slaughter \[VITRINGA\].
([Eze 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md).

bathed--rather "intoxicated," namely, with anger (so [Deu
32:42](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#042).md). "In heaven" implies the place
where God's purpose of wrath is formed in antithesis to its "coming
down" in the next clause.

Idumea--originally extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea;
afterwards they obtained possession of the country east of Moab, of
which Bozrah was capital. Petra or Selah, called Joktheel ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md), was capital of South Edom (see
on [Isa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#001).md). David subjugated Edom
([Sa2 8:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#013).md). Under Jehoram they
regained independence ([Ch2 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#008).md).
Under Amaziah they were again subdued, and Selah taken ([Kg2
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md). When Judah was captive in
Babylon, Edom, in every way, insulted over her fallen mistress, killed
many of those Jews whom the Chaldeans had left, and hence was held
guilty of fratricide by God (Esau, their ancestor, having been brother
to Jacob): this was the cause of the denunciations of the prophets
against Edom [Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md), &c.; [Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md); [Eze
25:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#012.md); [Eze
35:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#003.md); [Joe
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#019.md); [Amo
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#011.md); [Oba
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#008.md), [Oba
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010.md), [Oba
1:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#012.md); [Mal
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003).md). Nebuchadnezzar humbled Idumea
accordingly ([Jer 25:15-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md).

of my curse--that is, doomed to it.

to judgment--that is, to execute it.

[Isaiah 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 34:6</span></span>

filled--glutted. The image of a sacrifice is continued.

blood . . . fat--the parts especially devoted to God in a sacrifice
([Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022).md).

lambs . . . goats--sacrificial animals: the Idumeans, of all classes,
doomed to slaughter, are meant ([Zep
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007).md).

Bozrah--called Bostra by the Romans, &c., assigned in [Jer
48:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#024.md) to Moab, so that it seems to
have been at one time in the dominion of Edom, and at another in that of
Moab ([Isa 63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); [Jer
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#013.md), [Jer
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#020.md), [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022).md); it was strictly not in Edom,
but the capital of Auranitis (the Houran). Edom seems to have extended
its dominion so as to include it (compare [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021).md).

[Isaiah 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 34:7</span></span>

unicorns--Hebrew, reem: conveying the idea of loftiness, power, and
pre-eminence (see on [Job 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#009).md), in
the Bible. At one time the image in the term answers to a reality in
nature; at another it symbolizes an abstraction. The rhinoceros was the
original type. The Arab rim is two-horned: it was the oryx (the
leucoryx, antelope, bold and pugnacious); but when accident or artifice
deprived it of one horn, the notion of the unicorn arose. Here is meant
the portion of the Edomites which was strong and warlike.

come down--rather, "fall down," slain \[LOWTH\].

with them--with the "lambs and goats," the less powerful Edomites ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006).md).

bullocks . . . bulls--the young and old Edomites: all classes.

dust--ground.

[Isaiah 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 34:8</span></span>

recompenses for the controversy of Zion--that is, the year when God will
retaliate on those who have contended with Zion. Her controversy is His.
Edom had thought to extend its borders by laying hold of its neighbor's
lands and has instigated Babylon to cruelty towards fallen Judah ([Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md); [Eze
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#005).md); therefore Edom shall suffer the
same herself ([Lam 4:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021).md). The final
winding up of the controversy between God and all enemies of Him and His
people is also foreshadowed ([Isa
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Isa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004.md); [Isa
66:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), [Mal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#003.md); [Th2
1:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md); [Rev
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#018.md); [Rev
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#020.md); [Rev
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 34:9</span></span>

Images from the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah ([Gen
19:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md); so [Deu
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023.md); [Jer
49:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 34:10</span></span>

It--The burning pitch, &c. ([Isa
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#009).md).

smoke . . . for ever-- ([Rev 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#011.md);
[Rev 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#018.md); [Rev
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#003).md).

generation to generation-- ([Mal 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#004).md).

none . . . pass through--Edom's original offense was: they would not let
Israel pass through their land in peace to Canaan: God recompenses them
in kind, no traveller shall pass through Edom. VOLNEY, the infidel, was
forced to confirm the truth of this prophecy: "From the reports of the
Arabs, southeast of the Dead Sea, within three days' journey are upwards
of thirty ruined towns, absolutely deserted."

[Isaiah 34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 34:11</span></span>

cormorant--The Hebrew is rendered, in [Psa
102:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#006.md), "pelican," which is a seafowl,
and cannot be meant here: some waterfowl (katta, according to
BURCKHARDT) that tenants desert places is intended.

bittern--rather, "the hedgehog," or "porcupine" \[GESENIUS\] ([Isa
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#023).md).

owl--from its being enumerated among water birds in [Lev
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#017.md); [Deu
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#016.md). MAURER thinks rather the heron
or crane is meant; from a Hebrew root, "to blow," as it utters a sound
like the blowing of a horn ([Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002).md).

confusion--devastation.

line . . . stones--metaphor from an architect with line and
plummet-stone (see on [Isa 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#002.md); [Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017).md); God will render to it the
exact measure of justice without mercy ([Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md); [Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013.md); [Lam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#008.md); [Amo
7:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007).md).

emptiness--desolation. Edom is now a waste of "stones."

[Isaiah 34:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 34:12</span></span>

Rather, "As to her nobles, there shall be none there who shall declare a
kingdom," that is, a king \[MAURER\]; or else, "There shall be no one
there whom they shall call to the kingdom" \[ROSENMULLER\] ([Isa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006), &c..md). Idumea was at first
governed by dukes ([Gen 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#015).md); out of
them the king wan chosen when the constitution became a monarchy.

[Isaiah 34:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 34:13</span></span>

dragons--(See on [Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021.md); [Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022).md).

court for owls--rather, "a dwelling for ostriches."

[Isaiah 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 34:14</span></span>

wild beasts of the desert . . . island--rather, "wild cats . . .
jackals" ([Isa 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#021).md).

screech owl--rather, "the night specter"; in Jewish superstition a
female, elegantly dressed, that carried off children by night. The text
does not assert the existence of such objects of superstition, but
describes the place as one which superstition would people with such
beings.

[Isaiah 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 34:15</span></span>

great owl--rather, "the arrow snake," so called from its darting on its
prey \[GESENIUS\].

lay--namely, eggs.

gather under her shadow--rather, "cherishes" her young under, &c. ([Jer
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 34:16</span></span>

book of the Lord--the volume in which the various prophecies and other
parts of Scripture began henceforward to be collected together ([Isa
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#008.md); [Dan
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002).md).

Seek--(so [Isa 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016.md), [Isa
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#020.md); [Joh
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md); [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052).md).

no one . . . fail--of these prophecies ([Mat
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018).md).

none shall want . . . mate--image from pairing of animals mentioned,
[Isa 34:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#015) ("mate".md); no prediction
shall want a fulfilment as its companion. Or rather, "none of these wild
animals (just spoken of) shall be wanting: none shall be without its
mate" to pair and breed with, in desolate Idumea.

my . . . his--Such changes of person are frequent in Hebrew poetry.

them--the wild beasts.

[Isaiah 34:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 34:17</span></span>

cast . . . lot--As conquerors apportion lands by lot, so Jehovah has
appointed and marked out ("divided") Edom for the wild beasts ([Num
26:55-56](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#055.md); [Jos
18:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#004).md).

See on [Isa 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#001.md), introduction there.
