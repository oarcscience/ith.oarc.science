### [Joshua Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001.md)

[Joshua 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 24:1</span></span>

JOSHUA ASSEMBLING THE TRIBES. ([Jos
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001).md)

Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem--Another and final
opportunity of dissuading the people against idolatry is here described
as taken by the aged leader, whose solicitude on this account arose from
his knowledge of the extreme readiness of the people to conform to the
manners of the surrounding nations. This address was made to the
representatives of the people convened at Shechem, and which had already
been the scene of a solemn renewal of the covenant ([Jos
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md), [Jos
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#035).md). The transaction now to be
entered upon being in principle and object the same, it was desirable to
give it all the solemn impressiveness which might be derived from the
memory of the former ceremonial, as well as from other sacred
associations of the place ([Gen
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#006.md); [Gen
33:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#018.md); [Gen
35:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#002).md).

they presented themselves before God--It is generally assumed that the
ark of the covenant had been transferred on this occasion to Shechem; as
on extraordinary emergencies it was for a time removed (Jdg. 20:1-18;
[Sa1 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#003.md); [Sa2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#024).md). But the statement, not
necessarily implying this, may be viewed as expressing only the
religious character of the ceremony \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Joshua 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 24:2</span></span>

RELATES GOD'S BENEFITS. ([Jos 24:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002).md)

Joshua said unto all the people--His address briefly recapitulated the
principal proofs of the divine goodness to Israel from the call of
Abraham to their happy establishment in the land of promise; it showed
them that they were indebted for their national existence as well as
their peculiar privileges, not to any merits of their own, but to the
free grace of God.

Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood--The Euphrates,
namely, at Ur.

Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor--(see [Gen
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#027).md). Though Terah had three sons,
Nahor only is mentioned with Abraham, as the Israelites were descended
from him on the mother's side through Rebekah and her nieces, Leah and
Rachel.

served other gods--conjoining, like Laban, the traditional knowledge of
the true God with the domestic use of material images ([Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md), [Gen
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034).md).

[Joshua 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 24:3</span></span>

I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him
throughout all the land of Canaan--It was an irresistible impulse of
divine grace which led the patriarch to leave his country and relatives,
to migrate to Canaan, and live a "stranger and pilgrim" in that land.

[Joshua 24:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jos 24:4</span></span>

I gave unto Esau mount Seir--(See on [Gen
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#008).md). In order that he might be no
obstacle to Jacob and his posterity being the exclusive heirs of Canaan.

[Joshua 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jos 24:12</span></span>

I sent the hornet before you--a particular species of wasp which swarms
in warm countries and sometimes assumes the scourging character of a
plague; or, as many think, it is a figurative expression for
uncontrollable terror (see on [Exo
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#028).md).

[Joshua 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 24:14</span></span>

Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in
truth--After having enumerated so many grounds for national gratitude,
Joshua calls on them to declare, in a public and solemn manner, whether
they will be faithful and obedient to the God of Israel. He avowed this
to be his own unalterable resolution, and urged them, if they were
sincere in making a similar avowal, "to put away the strange gods that
were among them"--a requirement which seems to imply that some were
suspected of a strong hankering for, or concealed practice of, the
idolatry, whether in the form of Zabaism, the fire-worship of their
Chaldean ancestors, or the grosser superstitions of the Canaanites.

[Joshua 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jos 24:26</span></span>

Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God--registered the
engagements of that solemn covenant in the book of sacred history.

took a great stone--according to the usage of ancient times to erect
stone pillars as monuments of public transactions.

set it up there under an oak--or terebinth, in all likelihood, the same
as that at the root of which Jacob buried the idols and charms found in
his family.

that was by the sanctuary of the Lord--either the spot where the ark had
stood, or else the place around, so called from that religious meeting,
as Jacob named Beth-el the house of God.

[Joshua 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jos 24:29</span></span>

HIS AGE AND DEATH. ([Jos 24:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029).md)

Joshua . . . died--LIGHTFOOT computes that he lived seventeen, others
twenty-seven years, after the entrance into Canaan. He was buried,
according to the Jewish practice, within the limits of his own
inheritance. The eminent public services he had long rendered to Israel
and the great amount of domestic comfort and national prosperity he had
been instrumental in diffusing among the several tribes, were deeply
felt, were universally acknowledged; and a testimonial in the form of a
statue or obelisk would have been immediately raised to his honor, in
all parts of the land, had such been the fashion of the times. The brief
but noble epitaph by the historian is, Joshua, "the servant of the
Lord."

[Joshua 24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jos 24:31</span></span>

Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua--The high and commanding
character of this eminent leader had given so decided a tone to the
sentiments and manners of his contemporaries and the memory of his
fervent piety and many virtues continued so vividly impressed on the
memories of the people, that the sacred historian has recorded it to his
immortal honor. "Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all
the days of the elders that overlived Joshua."

[Joshua 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jos 24:32</span></span>

the bones of Joseph--They had carried these venerable relics with them
in all their migrations through the desert, and deferred the burial,
according to the dying charge of Joseph himself, till they arrived in
the promised land. The sarcophagus, in which his mummied body had been
put, was brought thither by the Israelites, and probably buried when the
tribe of Ephraim had obtained their settlement, or at the solemn
convocation described in this chapter.

in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought . . . for an hundred pieces of
silver--Kestitah translated, "piece of silver," is supposed to mean "a
lamb," the weights being in the form of lambs or kids, which were, in
all probability, the earliest standard of value among pastoral people.
The tomb that now covers the spot is a Mohammedan Welce, but there is no
reason to doubt that the precious deposit of Joseph's remains may be
concealed there at the present time.

[Joshua 24:33](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jos 24:33</span></span>

Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him in . . . mount
Ephraim--The sepulchre is at the modern village Awertah, which,
according to Jewish travellers, contains the graves also of Ithamar, the
brother of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar \[VAN DE VELDE\].
