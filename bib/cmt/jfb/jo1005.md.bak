### [1 John Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

[1 John 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 5:1</span></span>

WHO ARE THE BRETHREN ESPECIALLY TO BE LOVED ([Jo1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021).md); OBEDIENCE, THE TEST OF LOVE,
EASY THROUGH FAITH, WHICH OVERCOMES THE WORLD. LAST PORTION OF THE
EPISTLE. THE SPIRIT'S WITNESS TO THE BELIEVER'S SPIRITUAL LIFE. TRUTHS
REPEATED AT THE CLOSE: FAREWELL WARNING. (1Jo. 5:1-21)

Reason why our "brother" ([Jo1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021).md)
is entitled to such love, namely, because he is "born (begotten) of
God": so that if we want to show our love to God, we must show it to
God's visible representative.

Whosoever--Greek, "Everyone that." He could not be our "Jesus"
(God-Saviour) unless He were "the Christ"; for He could not reveal the
way of salvation, except He were a prophet: He could not work out that
salvation, except He were a priest: He could not confer that salvation
upon us, except He were a king: He could not be prophet, priest, and
king, except He were the Christ \[PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed\].

born--Translate, "begotten," as in the latter part of the verse, the
Greek being the same. Christ is the "only-begotten Son" by generation;
we become begotten sons of God by regeneration and adoption.

every one that loveth him that begat--sincerely, not in mere profession
([Jo1 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020).md).

loveth him also that is begotten of him--namely, "his brethren" ([Jo1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021).md).

[1 John 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 5:2</span></span>

By--Greek, "In." As our love to the brethren is the sign and test of our
love to God, so (John here says) our love to God (tested by our "keeping
his commandments") is, conversely, the ground and only true basis of
love to our brother.

we know--John means here, not the outward criteria of genuine brotherly
love, but the inward spiritual criteria of it, consciousness of love to
God manifested in a hearty keeping of His commandments. When we have
this inwardly and outwardly confirmed love to God, we can know assuredly
that we truly love the children of God. "Love to one's brother is prior,
according to the order of nature (see on [Jo1
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020).md); love to God is so, according to
the order of grace ([Jo1 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#002).md). At one
time the former is more immediately known, at another time the latter,
according as the mind is more engaged in human relations or in what
concerns the divine honor" \[ESTIUS\]. John shows what true love is,
namely, that which is referred to God as its first object. As previously
John urged the effect, so now he urges the cause. For he wishes mutual
love to be so cultivated among us, as that God should always be placed
first \[CALVIN\].

[1 John 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 5:3</span></span>

this is--the love of God consists in this.

not grievous--as so many think them. It is "the way of the transgressor"
that "is hard." What makes them to the regenerate "not grievous," is
faith which "overcometh the world" ([Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004).md): in proportion as faith is
strong, the grievousness of God's commandments to the rebellious flesh
is overcome. The reason why believers feel any degree of irksomeness in
God's commandments is, they do not realize fully by faith the privileges
of their spiritual life.

[1 John 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 5:4</span></span>

For--(See on [Jo1 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003).md). The reason why
"His commandments are not grievous." Though there is a conflict in
keeping them, the sue for the whole body of the regenerate is victory
over every opposing influence; meanwhile there is a present joy to each
believer in keeping them which makes them "not grievous."

whatsoever--Greek, "all that is begotten of God." The neuter expresses
the universal whole, or aggregate of the regenerate, regarded as one
collective body [Joh 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006.md); [Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md), [Joh
6:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#039.md), "where BENGEL remarks, that in
Jesus' discourses, what the Father has given Him is called, in the
singular number and neuter gender, all whatsoever; those who come to the
Son are described in the masculine gender and plural number, they all,
or singular, every one. The Father has given, as it were, the whole mass
to the Son, that all whom He gave may be one whole: that universal whole
the Son singly evolves, in the execution of the divine plan."

overcometh--habitually.

the world--all that is opposed to keeping the commandments of God, or
draws us off from God, in this world, including our corrupt flesh, on
which the world's blandishments or threats act, as also including Satan,
the prince of this world ([Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031.md);
[Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030.md); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011).md).

this is the victory that overcometh--Greek aorist, ". . . that hath
(already) overcome the world": the victory (where faith is) hereby is
implied as having been already obtained ([Jo1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004).md).

[1 John 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 5:5</span></span>

Who--"Who" else "but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God:"
"the Christ" ([Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001).md)? Confirming,
by a triumphant question defying all contradiction, as an undeniable
fact, [Jo1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md), that the victory which
overcomes the world is faith. For it is by believing: that we are made
one with Jesus the Son of God, so that we partake of His victory over
the world, and have dwelling in us One greater than he who is in the
world ([Jo1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004).md). "Survey the whole
world, and show me even one of whom it can be affirmed with truth that
he overcomes the world, who is not a Christian, and endowed with this
faith" \[EPISCOPIUS in ALFORD\].

[1 John 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 5:6</span></span>

This--the Person mentioned in [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md). This Jesus.

he that came by water and blood--"by water," when His ministry was
inaugurated by baptism in the Jordan, and He received the Father's
testimony to His Messiahship and divine Sonship. Compare [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md), "believeth that Jesus is the Son
of God," with [Joh 1:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#033.md), "The
Spirit . . . remaining on Him . . . I saw and bare record that this is
the Son of God"; and [Jo1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md), below,
"there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water,
and the blood." Corresponding to this is the baptism of water and the
Spirit which He has instituted as a standing seal and mean of initiatory
incorporation with Him.

and blood--He came by "the blood of His cross" (so "by" is used, [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md) : "by," that is, with, "His own
blood He entered in once into the holy place"): a fact seen and so
solemnly witnessed to by John. "These two past facts in the Lord's life
are this abiding testimony to us, by virtue of the permanent application
to us of their cleansing and atoning power."

Jesus Christ--not a mere appellation, but a solemn assertion of the
Lord's Person and Messiahship.

not by, &c.--Greek, "not IN the water only, but IN the water and IN (so
oldest manuscripts add) the blood." As "by" implies the mean through, or
with, which He came: so "in," the element in which He came. "The"
implies that the water and the blood were sacred and well-known symbols.
John Baptist came only baptizing with water, and therefore was not the
Messiah. Jesus came first to undergo Himself the double baptism of water
and blood, and then to baptize us with the Spirit-cleansing, of which
water is the sacramental seal, and with His atoning blood, the efficacy
of which, once for all shed, is perpetual in the Church; and therefore
is the Messiah. It was His shed blood which first gave water baptism its
spiritual significancy. We are baptized into His death: the grand point
of union between us and Him, and, through Him, between us and God.

it is the Spirit, &c.--The Holy Spirit is an additional witness (compare
[Jo1 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007).md), besides the water and the
blood, to Jesus' Sonship and Messiahship. The Spirit attested these
truths at Jesus' baptism by descending on Him, and throughout His
ministry by enabling Him to speak and do what man never before or since
has spoken or, done; and "it is the Spirit that beareth witness" of
Christ, now permanently in the Church: both in the inspired New
Testament Scriptures, and in the hearts of believers, and in the
spiritual reception of baptism and the Lord's Supper.

because the Spirit is truth--It is His essential truth which gives His
witness such infallible authority.

[1 John 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 5:7</span></span>

three--Two or three witnesses were required by law to constitute
adequate testimony. The only Greek manuscripts in any form which support
the words, "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and
these three are one; and there are three that bear witness in earth,"
are the Montfortianus of Dublin, copied evidently from the modern Latin
Vulgate; the Ravianus, copied from the Complutensian Polyglot; a
manuscript at Naples, with the words added in the Margin by a recent
hand; Ottobonianus, 298, of the fifteenth century, the Greek of which is
a mere translation of the accompanying Latin. All the old versions omit
the words. The oldest manuscripts of the Vulgate omit them: the earliest
Vulgate manuscript which has them being Wizanburgensis, 99, of the
eighth century. A scholium quoted in MatthÃ&brvbr;i, shows that the
words did not arise from fraud; for in the words, in all Greek
manuscripts "there are three that bear record," as the Scholiast
notices, the word "three" is masculine, because the three things (the
Spirit, the water, and the blood) are SYMBOLS OF THE TRINITY. To this
CYPRIAN, 196, also refers, "Of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, it is
written, 'And these three are one' (a unity)." There must be some
mystical truth implied in using "three" (Greek) in the masculine, though
the antecedents, "Spirit, water, and blood," are neuter. That THE
TRINITY was the truth meant is a natural inference: the triad specified
pointing to a still Higher Trinity; as is plain also from [Jo1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md), "the witness of GOD," referring
to the Trinity alluded to in the Spirit, water, and blood. It was
therefore first written as a marginal comment to complete the sense of
the text, and then, as early at least as the eighth century, was
introduced into the text of the Latin Vulgate. The testimony, however,
could only be borne on earth to men, not in heaven. The marginal
comment, therefore, that inserted "in heaven," was inappropriate. It is
on earth that the context evidently requires the witness of the three,
the Spirit, the water, and the blood, to be borne: mystically setting
forth the divine triune witnesses, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son.
LUECKE notices as internal evidence against the words, John never uses
"the Father" and "the Word" as correlates, but, like other New Testament
writers, associates "the Son" with "the Father," and always refers "the
Word" to "God" as its correlate, not "the Father." Vigilius, at the end
of the fifth century, is the first who quotes the disputed words as in
the text; but no Greek manuscript earlier than the fifteenth is extant
with them. The term "Trinity" occurs first in the third century in
TERTULLIAN \[Against Praxeas, 3\].

[1 John 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 5:8</span></span>

agree in one--"tend unto one result"; their agreeing testimony to Jesus'
Sonship and Messiahship they give by the sacramental grace in the water
of baptism, received by the penitent believer, by the atoning efficacy
of His blood, and by the internal witness of His Spirit ([Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010).md): answering to the testimony
given to Jesus' Sonship and Messiahship by His baptism, His crucifixion,
and the Spirit's manifestations in Him (see on [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006).md). It was by His coming by water
(that is, His baptism in Jordan) that Jesus was solemnly inaugurated in
office, and revealed Himself as Messiah; this must have been peculiarly
important in John's estimation, who was first led to Christ by the
testimony of the Baptist. By the baptism then received by Christ, and by
His redeeming blood-shedding, and by that which the Spirit of God, whose
witness is infallible, has effected, and still effects, by Him, the
Spirit, the water, and the blood, unite, as the threefold witness, to
verify His divine Messiahship \[NEANDER\].

[1 John 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 5:9</span></span>

If, &c.--We do accept (and rightly so) the witness of veracious men,
fallible though they be; much more ought we to accept the infallible
witness of God (the Father). "The testimony of the Father is, as it
were, the basis of the testimony of the Word and of the Holy Spirit;
just as the testimony of the Spirit is, as it were, the basis of the
testimony of the water and the blood" \[BENGEL\].

for--This principle applies in the present case, FOR, &c.

which--in the oldest manuscripts, "because He hath given testimony
concerning His Son." What that testimony is we find above in [Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005.md), "Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God"; and below in [Jo1 5:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md).

[1 John 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 5:10</span></span>

hath the witness--of God, by His Spirit ([Jo1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008).md).

in himself--God's Spirit dwelling in him and witnessing that "Jesus is
the Lord," "the Christ," and "the Son of God" ([Jo1
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005).md). The witness of the Spirit in the
believer himself to his own sonship is not here expressed, but follows
as a consequence of believing the witness of God to Jesus' divine
Sonship.

believeth not God--credits not His witness.

made him a liar--a consequence which many who virtually, or even
avowedly, do not believe, may well startle back from as fearful
blasphemy and presumption ([Jo1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010).md).

believeth not the record--Greek, "believeth not IN the record, or
witness." Refusal to credit God's testimony ("believeth not God") is
involved in refusal to believe IN (to rest one's trust in) Jesus Christ,
the object of God's record or testimony. "Divine "faith" is an assent
unto something as credible upon the testimony of God. This is the
highest kind of faith; because the object hath the highest credibility,
because grounded upon the testimony of God, which is infallible"
\[PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed\]. "The authority on which we believe
is divine; the doctrine which we follow is divine" \[LEO\].

gave--Greek, "hath testified, and now testifies."

of--concerning.

[1 John 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 5:11</span></span>

hath given--Greek, aorist: "gave" once for all. Not only "promised" it.

life is in his Son--essentially ([Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004.md); [Joh
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md); [Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006).md); bodily ([Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md); operatively ([Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010).md) \[LANGE in ALFORD\]. It is in
the second Adam, the Son of God, that this life is secured to us, which,
if left to depend on us, we should lose, like the first Adam.

[1 John 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 5:12</span></span>

the Son . . . life--Greek, "THE life." BENGEL remarks, The verse has two
clauses: in the former the Son is mentioned without the addition "of
God," for believers know the Son: in the second clause the addition "of
God" is made, that unbelievers may know thereby what a serious thing it
is not to have Him. In the former clause "has" bears the emphasis; in
the second, life. To have the Son is to be able to say as the bride, "I
am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine" \[[Sol
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md)\]. Faith is the mean whereby the
regenerate HAVE Christ as a present possession, and in having Him have
life in its germ and reality now, and shall have life in its fully
developed manifestation hereafter. Eternal life here is: (1) initial,
and is an earnest of that which is to follow; in the intermediate state
(2) partial, belonging but to a part of a man, though that is his nobler
part, the soul separated from the body; at and after the resurrection
(3) perfectional. This life is not only natural, consisting of the union
of the soul and the body (as that of the reprobate in eternal pain,
which ought to be termed death eternal, not life), but also spiritual,
the union of the soul to God, and supremely blessed for ever (for life
is another term for happiness) \[PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed\].

[1 John 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 5:13</span></span>

The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "These things have I written
unto you \[omitting 'that believe on the name of the Son of God'\] that
ye may know that ye have eternal life (compare [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011)), THOSE (of you I mean.md) WHO
believe (not as English Version reads, 'and that ye may believe') on the
name of the Son of God." English Version, in the latter clause, will
mean, "that ye may continue to believe," &c. (compare [Jo1
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012).md).

These things--This Epistle. He, towards the close of his Gospel ([Joh
20:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030).md), wrote similarly, stating
his purpose in having written. In [Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004.md) he states the object of his
writing this Epistle to be, "that your joy may be full." To "know that
we have eternal life" is the sure way to "joy in God."

[1 John 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 5:14</span></span>

the confidence--boldness ([Jo1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#017).md)
in prayer, which results from knowing that we have eternal life ([Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md); [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md), [Jo1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022).md).

according to his will--which is the believer's will, and which is
therefore no restraint to his prayers. In so far as God's will is not
our will, we are not abiding in faith, and our prayers are not accepted.
ALFORD well says, If we knew God's will thoroughly, and submitted to it
heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask anything for the spirit
or for the body which He should not perform; it is this ideal state
which the apostle has in view. It is the Spirit who teaches us inwardly,
and Himself in us asks according to the will of God.

[1 John 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 5:15</span></span>

hear--Greek, "that He heareth us."

we have the petitions that we desired of him--We have, as present
possessions, everything whatsoever we desired (asked) from Him. Not one
of our past prayers offered in faith, according to His will, is lost.
Like Hannah, we can rejoice over them as granted even before the event;
and can recognize the event when it comes to pass, as not from chance,
but obtained by our past prayers. Compare also Jehoshaphat's believing
confidence in the issue of his prayers, so much so that he appointed
singers to praise the Lord beforehand.

[1 John 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 5:16</span></span>

If any . . . see--on any particular occasion; Greek aorist.

his brother--a fellow Christian.

sin a sin--in the act of sinning, and continuing in the sin: present.

not unto death--provided that it is not unto death.

he shall give--The asker shall be the means, by his intercessory prayer,
of God giving life to the sinning brother. Kindly reproof ought to
accompany his intercessions. Life was in process of being forfeited by
the sinning brother when the believer's intercession obtained its
restoration.

for them--resuming the proviso put forth in the beginning of the verse.
"Provided that the sin is not unto death." "Shall give life," I say, to,
that is, obtain life "for (in the case of) them that sin not unto
death."

I do not say that he shall pray for it--The Greek for "pray" means a
REQUEST as of one on an equality, or at least on terms of familiarity,
with him from whom the favor is sought. "The Christian intercessor for
his brethren, John declares, shall not assume the authority which would
be implied in making request for a sinner who has sinned the sin unto
death ([Sa1 15:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035.md); [Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001.md); [Mar
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#029).md), that it might be forgiven him"
\[TRENCH, Greek Synonyms of the New Testament\]. Compare [Deu
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026.md). Greek "ask" implies the humble
petition of an inferior; so that our Lord never uses it, but always uses
(Greek) "request." Martha, from ignorance, once uses "ask" in His case
([Joh 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022).md). "Asking" for a brother
sinning not unto death, is a humble petition in consonance with God's
will. To "request" for a sin unto death \[intercede, as it were,
authoritatively for it, as though we were more merciful than God\] would
savor of presumption; prescribing to God in a matter which lies out of
the bounds of our brotherly yearning (because one sinning unto death
would thereby be demonstrated not to be, nor ever to have been, truly a
brother, [Jo1 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019).md), how He shall
inflict and withhold His righteous judgments. Jesus Himself intercedes,
not for the world which hardens itself in unbelief, but for those given
to Him out of the world.

[1 John 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 5:17</span></span>

"Every unrighteousness (even that of believers, compare [Jo1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009.md); [Jo1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004). Every coming short of right.md) is
sin"; (but) not every sin is the sin unto death.

and there is a sin not unto death--in the case of which, therefore,
believers may intercede. Death and life stand in correlative opposition
([Jo1 5:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011).md). The sin unto death
must be one tending "towards" (so the Greek), and so resulting in,
death. ALFORD makes it to be an appreciable ACT of sin, namely, the
denying Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of God (in contrast to confess
this truth, [Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md), [Jo1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#005).md), [Jo1
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md), [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md); [Jo1
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md); [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010.md). Such wilful deniers of Christ
are not to be received into one's house, or wished "God speed." Still, I
think with BENGEL, not merely the act, but also the state of apostasy
accompanying the act, is included--a "state of soul in which faith,
love, and hope, in short, the new life, is extinguished. The chief
commandment is faith and love. Therefore, the chief sin is that by which
faith and love are destroyed. In the former case is life; in the latter,
death. As long as it is not evident (see on [Jo1
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016), on 'see'.md) that it is a sin unto
death, it is lawful to pray. But when it is deliberate rejection of
grace, and the man puts from him life thereby, how can others procure
for him life?" Contrast [Jam 5:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#014.md).
Compare [Mat 12:31-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#031.md) as to the wilful
rejection of Christ, and resistance to the Holy Ghost's plain testimony
to Him as the divine Messiah. Jesus, on the cross, pleaded only for
those who KNEW NOT what they were doing in crucifying Him, not for those
wilfully resisting grace and knowledge. If we pray for the impenitent,
it must be with humble reference of the matter to God's will, not with
the intercessory request which we should offer for a brother when
erring.

[1 John 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md)

([Jo1 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009)..md)

We know--Thrice repeated emphatically, to enforce the three truths which
the words preface, as matters of the brethren's joint experimental
knowledge. This [Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md) warns
against abusing [Jo1 5:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016.md), as
warranting carnal security.

whosoever--Greek, "every one who." Not only advanced believers, but
every one who is born again, "sinneth not."

he that is begotten--Greek aorist, "has been (once for all in past time)
begotten of God"; in the beginning of the verse it is perfect. "Is
begotten," or "born," as a continuing state.

keepeth himself--The Vulgate translates, "The having been begotten of
God keepeth HIM" (so one of the oldest manuscripts reads): so ALFORD.
Literally, "He having been begotten of God (nominative pendent), it (the
divine generation implied in the nominative) keepeth him." So [Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md), "His seed remaineth in him."
Still, in English Version reading, God's working by His Spirit inwardly,
and man's working under the power of that Spirit as a responsible agent,
is what often occurs elsewhere. That God must keep us, if we are to keep
ourselves from evil, is certain. Compare [Joh
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md) especially with this verse.

that wicked one toucheth him not--so as to hurt him. In so far as he
realizes his regeneration-life, the prince of this world hath nothing in
him to fasten his deadly temptations on, as in Christ's own case. His
divine regeneration has severed once for all his connection with the
prince of this world.

[1 John 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 5:19</span></span>

world lieth in wickedness--rather, "lieth in the wicked one," as the
Greek is translated in [Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md); [Jo1
2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013.md); compare [Jo1
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md); [Joh
17:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014.md). The world lieth in the power
of, and abiding in, the wicked one, as the resting-place and lord of his
slaves; compare "abideth in death," [Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md); contrast [Jo1
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md), "we are in Him that is true."
While the believer has been delivered out of his power, the whole world
lieth helpless and motionless still in it, just as it was; including the
wise, great, respectable, and all who are not by vital union in Christ.

Summary of our Christian privileges.

is come--is present, having come. "HE IS HERE--all is full of Him--His
incarnation, work, and abiding presence, is to us a living fact"
\[ALFORD\].

given us an understanding--Christ's, office is to give the inner
spiritual understanding to discern the things of God.

that we may know--Some oldest manuscripts read, "(so) that we know."

him that is true--God, as opposed to every kind of idol or false god
([Jo1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021).md). Jesus, by virtue of His
oneness with God, is also "He that is true" ([Rev
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).md).

even--"we are in the true" God, by virtue of being "in His Son Jesus
Christ."

This is the true God--"This Jesus Christ (the last-named Person) is the
true God" (identifying Him thus with the Father in His attribute, "the
only true God," [Joh 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md), primarily
attributed to the Father).

and eternal life--predicated of the Son of God; ALFORD wrongly says, He
was the life, but not eternal life. The Father is indeed eternal life as
its source, but the Son also is that eternal life manifested, as the
very passage ([Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002).md) which ALFORD
quotes, proves against him. Compare also [Jo1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#011.md), [Jo1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#013.md). Plainly it is as the Mediator of
ETERNAL LIFE to us that Christ is here contemplated. The Greek is, "The
true God and eternal life is this" Jesus Christ, that is, In believing
in Him we believe in the true God, and have eternal life. The Son is
called "He that is TRUE," [Rev 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007.md), as
here. This naturally prepares the way for warning against false gods
([Jo1 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021).md). Jesus Christ is the only
"express image of God's person" which is sanctioned, the only true
visible manifestation of God. All other representations of God are
forbidden as idols. Thus the Epistle closes as it began ([Jo1
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).md).

[1 John 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 5:21</span></span>

Affectionate parting caution.

from idols--Christians were then everywhere surrounded by idolaters,
with whom it was impossible to avoid intercourse. Hence the need of
being on their guard against any even indirect compromise or act of
communion with idolatry. Some at Pergamos, in the region whence John
wrote, fell into the snare of eating things sacrificed to idols. The
moment we cease to abide "in Him that is true (by abiding) in Jesus
Christ," we become part of "the world that lieth in the wicked one,"
given up to spiritual, if not in all places literal, idolatry ([Eph
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#005.md); [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005).md).
