### [2 Chronicles Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

[2 Chronicles 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 27:1</span></span>

JOTHAM, REIGNING WELL, PROSPERS. ([Ch2
27:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#001))

Jotham was twenty and five years old--(See on [Kg2
15:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032)).

His mother's name . . . Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok--or descendant
of the famous priest of that name \[[Sa2
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2008.htm#017)\].

[2 Chronicles 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 27:2</span></span>

he did that which was right--The general rectitude of his government is
described by representing it as conducted on the excellent principles
which had guided the early part of his father's reign.

the people did yet corruptly--(See [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035)); but the description here is
more emphatic, that though Jotham did much to promote the good of his
kingdom and aimed at a thorough reformation in religion, the widespread
and inveterate wickedness of the people frustrated all his laudable
efforts.

[2 Chronicles 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 27:3</span></span>

He built the high gate of the house of the Lord--situated on the
north--that portion of the temple hill which was high compared with the
southern part--hence "the higher," or upper gate (see on [Kg2
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#035)). He built, that is, repaired or
embellished.

and on the wall of Ophel--Hebrew, "the Ophel," that is, the mound, or
eminence on the southeastern slope of the temple mount, a ridge lying
between the valleys Kedron and TyropÅ“on, called "the lower city"
\[JOSEPHUS\]. He

built much--having the same desire as his father to secure the defense
of Jerusalem in every direction.

[2 Chronicles 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ch2 27:4</span></span>

in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and
towers--that is, in the elevated and wooded spots where fortified cities
could not be placed, he erected castles and towers.

[2 Chronicles 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 27:5</span></span>

HE SUBDUES THE AMMONITES. ([Ch2
27:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2027.htm#005))

He fought also with the king of the Ammonites--This invasion he not only
repelled, but, pursuing the Ammonites into their own territory, he
imposed on them a yearly tribute, which, for two years, they paid. But
when Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, combined to attack
the kingdom of Judah, they took the opportunity of revolting, and Jotham
was too distracted by other matters to attempt the reconquest (see on
[Kg2 15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037)).
