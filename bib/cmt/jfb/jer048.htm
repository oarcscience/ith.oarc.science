<p>
<p>Nebo--a mountain and town of Moab; its meaning is "that which fructifies." 
<p>
<p>Kiriathaim--a city of Moab, consisting of two cities, as the word signifies; originally held by the Emim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005">Gen 14:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>Misgab--meaning "elevation." It lay on an elevation.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#002">Jeremiah 48:2</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_002">jer 48:2</A></FONT></span></p>no more praise-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014">Isa 16:14</A>). 
<p>
<p>in Heshbon--The foe having taken Heshbon, the chief city of Moab (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#045">Jer 48:45</A>), in it devise evil against Moab ("it") saying, Come," &amp;c. Heshbon was midway between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok; it was the residence of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and afterwards a Levitical city in Gad (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026">Num 21:26</A>). There is a play on words in the Hebrew, "Heshbon, Hashbu." Heshbon means a place of devising or counsel. The city, heretofore called the seat of counsel, shall find other counsellors, namely, those who devise its destruction. 
<p>
<p>thou shall be cut down . . . Madmen--rather, by a play on words on the meaning of madmen ("silence"), Thou shalt be brought to silence, so as well to deserve thy name (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001">Isa 15:1</A>). Thou shalt not dare to utter a sound.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#003">Jeremiah 48:3</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_003">jer 48:3</A></FONT></span></p>Horonaim--the same as the city Avara, mentioned by PTOLEMY. The word means "double caves" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#010">Neh 2:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isa 15:5</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#004">Jeremiah 48:4</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_004">jer 48:4</A></FONT></span></p>little ones . . . cry--heightening the distress of the scene. The foe does not spare even infants.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005">Jeremiah 48:5</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_005">jer 48:5</A></FONT></span></p>going up of Luhith . . . going down of Horonaim--Horonaim lay in a plain, Luhith on a height. To the latter, therefore, the Moabites would flee with "continual weeping," as a place of safety from the Chaldeans. Literally, "Weeping shall go up upon weeping."
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006">Jeremiah 48:6</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">jer 48:6</A></FONT></span></p>They exhort one another to flee. 
<p>
<p>heath--or the juniper (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006">Jer 17:6</A>). MAURER translates, "Be like one naked in the wilderness." But the sense is, Live in the wilderness like the heath, or juniper; do not "trust in" walls (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007">Jer 48:7</A>) [GROTIUS]. (Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#016">Mat 24:16-18</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007">Jeremiah 48:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">jer 48:7</A></FONT></span></p>thy works--namely, fortifications built by thy work. Moab was famous for its fortresses (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#018">Jer 48:18</A>). The antithesis is to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006">Jer 48:6</A>, "Be . . . in the wilderness," where there are no fortified cities. 
<p>
<p>thou . . . also--like the rest of the surrounding peoples, Judah, &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>Chemosh--the tutelary god of Moab (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#029">Num 21:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#024">Jdg 11:24</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007">Kg1 11:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#013">Kg2 23:13</A>). When a people were vanquished, their gods also were taken away by the victors (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#012">Jer 43:12</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#008">Jeremiah 48:8</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_008">jer 48:8</A></FONT></span></p>the valley . . . shall perish--that is, those dwelling in the valley.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#009">Jeremiah 48:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">jer 48:9</A></FONT></span></p>Give wings, &amp;c.-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#006">Psa 55:6</A>). Unless it get wings, it cannot escape the foe. "Wings," the Hebrew root meaning is a "flower" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#002">Job 14:2</A>); so the flower-like plumage of a bird.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010">Jeremiah 48:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">jer 48:10</A></FONT></span></p>work of . . . Lord--the divinely appointed utter devastation of Moab. To represent how entirely this is God's will, a curse is pronounced on the Chaldeans, the instrument, if they do it negligently (Margin) or by halves (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#023">Jdg 5:23</A>); compare Saul's sin as to Amalek (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#003">Sa1 15:3</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#009">Sa1 15:9</A>), and Ahab's as to Syria (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#042">Kg1 20:42</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011">Jeremiah 48:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">jer 48:11</A></FONT></span></p>settled on . . . lees--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006">Isa 25:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012">Zep 1:12</A>). As wine left to settle on its own lees retains its flavor and strength (which it would lose by being poured from one vessel into another), so Moab, owing to its never having been dislodged from its settlements, retains its pride of strength unimpaired. 
<p>
<p>emptied from vessel, &amp;c.--To make it fit for use, it used to be filtered from vessel to vessel. 
<p>
<p>scent--retaining the image: the bouquet or perfume of the wine.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#012">Jeremiah 48:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">jer 48:12</A></FONT></span></p>wanderers--rather, "pourers out," retaining the image of <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011">Jer 48:11</A>, that is, the Chaldeans who shall remove Moab from his settlements, as men pour wine from off the lees into other vessels. "His vessels" are the cities of Moab; the broken "bottles" the men slain [GROTIUS]. The Hebrew and the kindred Arabic word means, "to turn on one side," so as to empty a vessel [MAURER].
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013">Jeremiah 48:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">jer 48:13</A></FONT></span></p>ashamed--have the shame of disappointment as to the hopes they entertained of aid from Chemosh, their idol. 
<p>
<p>Beth-el-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027">Kg1 12:27</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029">Kg1 12:29</A>) --that is, the golden calf set up there by Jeroboam.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015">Jeremiah 48:15</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_015">jer 48:15</A></FONT></span></p>gone up . . . gone down--in antithesis. 
<p>
<p>out of her cities--Rather, "Moab . . . and her cities are gone up," namely, pass away in the ascending smoke of their conflagration (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#020">Jos 8:20-21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#040">Jdg 20:40</A>). When this took place, the young warriors would go down from the burning citadels only to meet their own slaughter [GROTIUS]. English Version is somewhat favored by the fact that "gone out" is singular, and "cities" plural. The antithesis favors GROTIUS.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#016">Jeremiah 48:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">jer 48:16</A></FONT></span></p>near--to the prophet's eye, though probably twenty-three years elapsed between the utterance of the prophecy in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002">Kg2 24:2</A>) and its fulfilment in the fifth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#017">Jeremiah 48:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">jer 48:17</A></FONT></span></p>bemoan--Not that Moab deserves pity, but this mode of expression pictures more vividly the grievousness of Moab's calamities. 
<p>
<p>all ye that know his name--those at a greater distance whom the fame of Moab's "name" had reached, as distinguished from those "about him," that is, near. 
<p>
<p>strong staff . . . rod--Moab is so called as striking terror into and oppressing other peoples (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004">Isa 9:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004">Isa 14:4-5</A>); also because of its dignity and power (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Psa 110:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007">Zac 11:7</A>).

<p>
<p>dost inhabit--now so securely settled as if in a lasting habitation. 
<p>
<p>thirst--Dibon, being situated on the Arnon, abounded in water (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009">Isa 15:9</A>). In sad contrast with this, and with her "glory" in general, she shall be reduced not only to shame, but to the want of the commonest necessaries ("thirst") in the arid wilderness (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006">Jer 48:6</A>).
<p>

As it was on "the way" of the Moabites who fled into the desert, its inhabitants "ask" what is the occasion of Moab's flight, and so learn the lot that awaits themselves (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#013">Sa1 4:13</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#016">Sa1 4:16</A>).

He enumerates the Moabite cities at length, as it seemed so incredible that all should be so utterly ruined. Many of them were assigned to the Levites, while Israel stood. 
<p>
<p>in Arnon--the north boundary between Moab and Ammon (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#019">Jer 48:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013">Num 21:13</A>).

<p>
<p>Bozrah--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006">Isa 34:6</A>); at one time under the dominion of Edom, though belonging originally to Moab (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#033">Gen 36:33</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</A>).

<p>

<p>
<p>wallow in . . . vomit--following up the image of a drunken man, that is, shall be so afflicted by God's wrath as to disgorge all his past pride, riches, and vainglory, and fall in his shameful abasement. 
<p>
<p>he also . . . derision--He in his disaster shall be an object of derision to us, as we in ours have been to him (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027">Jer 48:27</A>). Retribution in kind.
<p>

<p>
<p>a derision--The Hebrew has the article: referring to <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026">Jer 48:26</A>, "Was not Israel (the whole nation) the object of derision to thee?" Therefore, Moab is to suffer as formerly for its exultation over the calamity (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006">Kg2 17:6</A>) of the ten tribes under the Assyrian Shalmaneser (Isa. 15:1-16:14), so now for its exultation over the fall of Judah, under the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar. God takes up His people's cause as His own (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#013">Oba 1:13-18</A>). 
<p>
<p>was he . . . among thieves-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#026">Jer 2:26</A>). Proverbial. What did Israel do to deserve such derision? Was he detected in theft, that thou didst so exult over him in speaking of him? Though guilty before God, Israel was guiltless towards thee. 
<p>
<p>since--"since ever" thou didst begin speaking of him. 
<p>
<p>skippedst for joy--at Israel's calamity [CALVIN]; or, "thou didst shake thy head" in "derision" [MAURER].

Moab was the trumpeter of his own fame. Jeremiah adds "loftiness and arrogancy" to Isaiah's picture, so that Moab had not only not been bettered by the chastisement previously endured as foretold by Isaiah, but had even become worse; so that his guilt, and therefore his sentence of punishment, are increased now. Six times Moab's pride (or the synonyms) are mentioned, to show the exceeding hatefulness of his sin.

<p>
<p>it shall not be so--The result shall not be so as he thinks: his lies shall not so effect what he aims at by them. CALVIN translates, "his lies are not right (that is, his vauntings are vain because God will not give them effect); they shall not do so" as they project in their minds, for God will set at naught their plans.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_031">jer 48:31</A></FONT></span></p>I will cry . . . for . . . Moab--Not that it deserves pity, but the prophet's "crying" for it vividly represents the greatness of the calamity. 
<p>
<p>Kir-heres--Kir-hareseth, in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007">Isa 16:7</A>; see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007">Isa 16:7</A>. It means "the city of potters," or else "the city of the sun" [GROTIUS]. Here "the men of Kir-heres" are substituted for "the foundations of Kir-hareseth," in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#007">Isa 16:7</A>. The change answers probably to the different bearing of the disaster under Nebuchadnezzar, as compared with that former one under Shalmaneser.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_032">jer 48:32</A></FONT></span></p>with the weeping--with the same weeping as Jazer, now vanquished, wept with for the destruction of its vines. The same calamity shall befall thee, Sibmah, as befell Jazer. The Hebrew preposition here is different from that in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#009">Isa 16:9</A>, for which reason MAURER translates, "with more than the weeping of Jazer." English Version understands it of the continuation of the weeping; after they have wept for Jazer, fresh subject of lamentation will present itself for the wasting of the vine-abounding Sibmah. 
<p>
<p>plants . . . gone over . . . sea of Jazer--As the Septuagint reads "cities of Jazer," and as no traces of a lake near Jazer are found, the reading of English Version is doubtful. Retaining the present reading, we avoid the difficulty by translating [GROTIUS], "Thy plants (that is, citizens: alluding to the 'vine') are gone over the sea (that is, shall be transported beyond the sea to Cyprus, and such distant lands subject to Babylon; and this, too, in summertime), whereas Jazer (that is, the men of Jazer) reached the sea" (shore only, but are not transported beyond the sea); so that worse shall befall thee than befalls Jazer. 
<p>
<p>spoiler--Nebuzara-dan.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_033">jer 48:33</A></FONT></span></p>the plentiful field--rather, "Carmel": as the parallel "land of Moab" requires, though in <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#010">Isa 16:10</A>, it is "the plentiful field." Joy is taken away as from the nearer regions (Canaan and Palestine), so from the farther "land of Moab"; what has happened to Judah shall befall Moab, too (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#026">Jer 48:26-27</A>) [MAURER]. However, Moab alone seems to be spoken of here; nor does the parallelism forbid "plentiful field" answering to "Moab." English Version is therefore better. 
<p>
<p>shouting--repeated; as at the conclusion of the vintage, men sing over and over again the same cry of joy. A shouting shall be heard, but not the joyous shouting of laborers treading the grapes, but the terrible battle cry of the foe.

There will be continued cries in all quarters, from one end to the other, everywhere slaughter and wasting. 
<p>
<p>as an heifer of three years old--Moab heretofore not having known foreign yoke, and in its full strength, is compared to an heifer of three years old, never yet yoked, nor as yet worn out with many birth-givings (compare Note, see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#005">Isa 15:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>waters . . . of Nimrim--that is, the well-watered and therefore luxuriant pastures of Nimrim. 
<p>
<p>desolate--The Hebrew is stronger: not merely shall be "desolate," but desolation itself multiplied: plural, "desolations." The most fertile tracts shall be dried up.

<p>like pipes--a plaintive instrument, therefore used at funerals and in general mourning. 
<p>
<p>riches . . . gotten--literally, the abundance . . . that which is over and above the necessaries of life. GROTIUS translates, "They who have been left remaining shall perish"; they who have not been slain by the enemy shall perish by disease and famine.

<p>because of the force--that is, "they that fled because of the force" of the enemy: they that fled from it. GLASSIUS translates, "through want of strength." So the Hebrew particle is translated (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#024">Psa 109:24</A>), "faileth of fatness," that is, "faileth through want of fatness"; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#009">Lam 4:9</A>.

<p>but a fire, &amp;c.--copied in part from Sihon's hymn of victory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#027">Num 21:27-28</A>). The old "proverb" shall hold good again. As in ancient times Sihon, king of the Amorites, issued forth from his city, Heshbon, as a devouring "flame" and consumed Moab, so now the Chaldeans, making Heshbon their starting-point, shall advance to the destruction of Moab.

<p>
<p>corner of Moab--that is, Moab from one corner to the other.

<p>crown of . . . head--the most elevated points of Moab. Making some alterations, he here copies Balaam's prophecy (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017">Num 24:17</A>). Margin there translates "princes" for corners; if so, "crown of . . . head" here refers to the nobles. 
<p>
<p>tumultuous ones--sons of tumult; those who have tumultuously revolted from Babylon. Heshbon passed from the Amorite to the Israelite sway. Moab had wrested it from Israel and helped the Chaldeans against the Jews; but revolting from Babylon, they brought ruin on themselves in turn.
