### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 9:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 9:1-18)

declare--rather, explore; the result of my exploring is this, that "the
righteous, &c., are in the hand of God. No man knoweth either the love
or hatred (of God to them) by all that is before them," that is, by what
is outwardly seen in His present dealings ([Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014), [Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017)). However, from the sense of the
same words, in [Ecc 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006), "love and
hatred" seem to be the feelings of the wicked towards the righteous,
whereby they caused to the latter comfort or sorrow. Translate: "Even
the love and hatred" (exhibited towards the righteous, are in God's
hand) ([Psa 76:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#010); [Pro
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#007)). "No man knoweth all that is
before them."

[Ecclesiastes 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 9:2</span></span>

All things . . . alike--not universally; but as to death. [Ecc
9:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002) are made by HOLDEN the
objection of a skeptical sensualist. However, they may be explained as
Solomon's language. He repeats the sentiment already implied in [Ecc
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014); [Ecc
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#020); [Ecc
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#014).

one event--not eternally; but death is common to all.

good--morally.

clean--ceremonially.

sacrificeth--alike to Josiah who sacrificed to God, and to Ahab who made
sacrifice to Him cease.

sweareth--rashly and falsely.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 9:3</span></span>

Translate, "There is an evil above all (evils) that are done," &c.,
namely, that not only "there is one event to all," but "also the heart
of the sons of men" makes this fact a reason for "madly" persisting in
"evil while they live, and after that," &c., sin is "madness."

the dead-- ([Pro 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018); [Pro
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#018)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 9:4</span></span>

For--rather, "Nevertheless." English Version rightly reads as the
Margin, Hebrew, "that is joined," instead of the text, "who is to be
chosen?"

hope--not of mere temporal good ([Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007)); but of yet repenting and being
saved.

dog--metaphor for the vilest persons ([Sa1
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#014)).

lion--the noblest of animals ([Pro
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#030)).

better--as to hope of salvation; the noblest who die unconverted have no
hope; the vilest, so long as they have life, have hope.

[Ecclesiastes 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 9:5</span></span>

know that they shall die--and may thereby be led "so to number their
days, that they may apply their hearts to wisdom" ([Ecc
7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001); [Psa
90:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#012)).

dead know not anything--that is, so far as their bodily senses and
worldly affairs are concerned ([Job
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#021); [Isa
63:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#016)); also, they know no door of
repentance open to them, such as is to all on earth.

neither . . . reward--no advantage from their worldly labors ([Ecc
2:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018); [Ecc
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#009)).

memory--not of the righteous ([Psa
112:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#006); [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016)), but the wicked, who with all
the pains to perpetuate their names ([Psa
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011)) are soon "forgotten" ([Ecc
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#010)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 9:6</span></span>

love, and . . . hatred, &c.--(referring to [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001); see on [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)). Not that these cease in a future
world absolutely ([Eze 32:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#027); [Rev
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#011)); but as the end of this verse
shows, relatively to persons and things in this world. Man's love and
hatred can no longer be exercised for good or evil in the same way as
here; but the fruits of them remain. What he is at death he remains for
ever. "Envy," too, marks the wicked as referred to, since it was
therewith that they assailed the righteous (see on [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)).

portion--Their "portion" was "in this life" ([Psa
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014)), that they now "cannot have any
more."

[Ecclesiastes 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 9:7</span></span>

Addressed to the "righteous wise," spoken of in [Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001). Being "in the hand of God," who
now accepteth "thy works" in His service, as He has previously accepted
thy person ([Gen 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004)), thou mayest
"eat . . . with a cheerful (not sensually 'merry') heart" ([Ecc
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018); [Act
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 9:8</span></span>

white--in token of joy ([Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003)).
Solomon was clad in white (JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8:7,3); hence his
attire is compared to the "lilies" ([Mat
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#029)), typical of the spotless
righteousness of Jesus Christ, which the redeemed shall wear ([Rev
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#018); [Rev
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#014)).

ointment-- ([Psa 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005)), opposed to a
gloomy exterior ([Sa2 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#002); [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007); [Mat
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#017)); typical, also ([Ecc
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001); [Sol
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 9:9</span></span>

wife . . . lovest--godly and true love, opposed to the "snares" of the
"thousand" concubines ([Ecc 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026), [Ecc
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#028)), "among" whom Solomon could not
find the true love which joins one man to one woman ([Pro
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015), [Pro
5:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#018); [Pro
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#022); [Pro
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#014)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 9:10</span></span>

Whatsoever--namely, in the service of God. This and last verse plainly
are the language of Solomon, not of a skeptic, as HOLDEN would explain
it.

hand, &c.-- ([Lev 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#008), Margin; [Sa1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#007), Margin).

thy might--diligence ([Deu 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005); [Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010), Margin).

no work . . . in the grave-- ([Joh
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#004); [Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013)). "The soul's play-day is
Satan's work-day; the idler the man the busier the tempter" \[SOUTH\].

[Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 9:11</span></span>

This verse qualifies the sentiment, [Ecc
9:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#007). Earthly "enjoyments," however
lawful in their place ([Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)), are
to give way when any work to be done for God requires it. Reverting to
the sentiment ([Ecc 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017)), we ought,
therefore, not only to work God's work "with might" ([Ecc
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)), but also with the feeling that
the event is wholly "in God's hand" ([Ecc
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#001)).

race . . . not to the swift-- ([Sa2
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#023)); spiritually ([Zep
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#019); [Rom
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016)).

nor . . . battle to . . . strong-- ([Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047); [Ch2
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009), [Ch2
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#011), [Ch2
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#015); [Psa
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016)).

bread--livelihood.

favour--of the great.

chance--seemingly, really Providence. But as man cannot "find it out"
([Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011)), he needs "with all might"
to use opportunities. Duties are ours; events, God's.

[Ecclesiastes 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 9:12</span></span>

his time--namely, of death ([Ecc 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#015);
[Isa 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)). Hence the danger of delay
in doing the work of God, as one knows not when his opportunity will end
([Ecc 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)).

evil net--fatal to them. The unexpected suddenness of the capture is the
point of comparison. So the second coming of Jesus Christ, "as a snare"
([Luk 21:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#035)).

evil time--as an "evil net," fatal to them.

[Ecclesiastes 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 9:13</span></span>

Rather, "I have seen wisdom of this kind also," that is, exhibited in
the way which is described in what follows \[MAURER\].

[Ecclesiastes 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 9:14</span></span>

([Sa2 20:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#016)).

bulwarks--military works of besiegers.

[Ecclesiastes 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 9:15</span></span>

poor--as to the temporal advantages of true wisdom, though it often
saves others. It receives little reward from the world, which admires
none save the rich and great.

no man remembered-- ([Gen 40:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#023)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 9:16</span></span>

Resuming the sentiment ([Ecc 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019);
[Pro 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#022); [Pro
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#005)).

poor man's wisdom is despised--not the poor man mentioned in [Ecc
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015); for his wisdom could not have
saved the city, had "his words not been heard"; but poor men in general.
So Paul ([Act 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#011)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 9:17</span></span>

The words of wise, &c.--Though generally the poor wise man is not heard
([Ecc 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016)), yet "the words of wise
men, when heard in quiet (when calmly given heed to, as in [Ecc
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#015)), are more serviceable than," &c.

ruleth--as the "great king" ([Ecc
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#014)). Solomon reverts to "the rulers
to their own hurt" ([Ecc 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 9:18</span></span>

one sinner, &c.-- ([Jos 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#001), [Jos
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#011)). Though wisdom excels folly
([Ecc 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016); [Ecc
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#019)), yet a "little folly (equivalent
to sin) can destroy much good," both in himself ([Ecc
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001); [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010)) and in others. "Wisdom" must,
from the antithesis to "sinner," mean religion. Thus typically, the
"little city" may be applied to the Church ([Luk
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022)); the great king to Satan ([Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)); the despised poor wise man,
Jesus Christ ([Isa 53:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002); [Mar
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#003); [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009); [Eph
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007); [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)).
