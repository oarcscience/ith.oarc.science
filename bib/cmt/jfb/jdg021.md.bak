### [Judges Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001.md)

[Judges 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 21:2</span></span>

THE PEOPLE BEWAIL THE DESOLATION OF ISRAEL. ([Jdg
21:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#001).md)

the people came to the house of God, . . . and lifted up their voices,
and wept sore--The characteristic fickleness of the Israelites was not
long in being displayed; for scarcely had they cooled from the
fierceness of their sanguinary vengeance, than they began to relent and
rushed to the opposite extreme of self-accusation and grief at the
desolation which their impetuous zeal had produced. Their victory
saddened and humbled them. Their feelings on the occasion were expressed
by a public and solemn service of expiation at the house of God. And yet
this extraordinary observance, though it enabled them to find vent for
their painful emotions, did not afford them full relief, for they were
fettered by the obligation of a religious vow, heightened by the
addition of a solemn anathema on every violator of the oath. There is no
previous record of this oath; but the purport of it was, that they would
treat the perpetrators of this Gibeah atrocity in the same way as the
Canaanites, who were doomed to destruction; and the entering into this
solemn league was of a piece with the rest of their inconsiderate
conduct in this whole affair.

[Judges 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 21:6</span></span>

There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day--that is, in danger of
becoming extinct; for, as it appears from [Jdg
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#007.md), they had massacred all the women
and children of Benjamin, and six hundred men alone survived of the
whole tribe. The prospect of such a blank in the catalogue of the twelve
tribes, such a gap in the national arrangements, was too painful to
contemplate, and immediate measures must be taken to prevent this great
catastrophe.

[Judges 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 21:8</span></span>

there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly--This
city lay within the territory of eastern Manasseh, about fifteen miles
east of the Jordan, and was, according to JOSEPHUS, the capital of
Gilead. The ban which the assembled tribes had pronounced at Mizpeh
seemed to impose on them the necessity of punishing its inhabitants for
not joining the crusade against Benjamin; and thus, with a view of
repairing the consequences of one rash proceeding, they hurriedly rushed
to the perpetration of another, though a smaller tragedy. But it appears
([Jdg 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#011).md) that, besides acting in
fulfilment of their oath, the Israelites had the additional object by
this raid of supplying wives to the Benjamite remnant. This shows the
intemperate fury of the Israelites in the indiscriminate slaughter of
the women and children.

[Judges 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 21:16</span></span>

THE ELDERS CONSULT HOW TO FIND WIVES FOR THOSE THAT WERE LEFT. ([Jdg
21:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#016).md)

the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them
that remain--Though the young women of Jabesh-gilead had been carefully
spared, the supply was found inadequate, and some other expedient must
be resorted to.

[Judges 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 21:17</span></span>

There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin--As
they were the only rightful owners of the territory, provision must be
made for transmitting it to their legitimate heirs, and a new act of
violence was meditated ([Jdg 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019).md);
the opportunity for which was afforded by the approaching festival--a
feast generally supposed to be the feast of tabernacles. This, like the
other annual feasts, was held in Shiloh, and its celebration was
attended with more social hilarity and holiday rejoicings than the other
feasts.

[Judges 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 21:19</span></span>

on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to
Shechem--The exact site of the place was described evidently for the
direction of the Benjamites.

[Judges 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 21:21</span></span>

daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances--The dance was anciently
a part of the religious observance. It was done on festive occasions, as
it is still in the East, not in town, but in the open air, in some
adjoining field, the women being by themselves. The young women being
alone indulging their light and buoyant spirits, and apprehensive of no
danger, facilitated the execution of the scheme of seizing them, which
closely resembles the Sabine rape in Roman history. The elders undertook
to reconcile the families to the forced abduction of their daughters.
And thus the expression of their public sanction to this deed of
violence afforded a new evidence of the evils and difficulties into
which the unhappy precipitancy of the Israelites in this crisis had
involved them.
