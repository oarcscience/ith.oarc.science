### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 7:1</span></span>

THE ARK AT KIRJATH-JEARIM. ([Sa1
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001).md)

the men of Kirjath-jearim--"the city of woods," also Kirjath-baal ([Jos
15:60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#060.md); [Jos
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#014.md); [Ch1
13:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#005).md). It was the nearest town to
Beth-shemesh and stood on a hill. This was the reason of the message
([Sa1 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#021).md), and why this was chosen
for the convenience of people turning their faces to the ark ([Kg1
8:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#029.md); [Psa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002.md); [Dan
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#010).md).

brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill--Why it was not
transported at once to Shiloh where the tabernacle and sacred vessels
were remaining, is difficult to conjecture.

sanctified . . . his son--He was not a Levite, and was therefore only
set apart or appointed to be keeper of the place.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 7:2</span></span>

the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim . . . twenty years--It appears, in the
subsequent history, that a much longer period elapsed before its final
removal from Kirjath-jearim (2Sa. 6:1-19; [Ch1
13:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1013.htm#001).md). But that length of time had
passed when the Israelites began to revive from their sad state of
religious decline. The capture of the ark had produced a general
indifference either as to its loss or its recovery.

all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord--They were then brought,
doubtless by the influence of Samuel's exhortations, to renounce
idolatry, and to return to the national worship of the true God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 7:3</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES, THROUGH SAMUEL'S INFLUENCE, SOLEMNLY REPENT AT MIZPEH.
([Sa1 7:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#003).md)

Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel--A great national reformation
was effected through the influence of Samuel. Disgusted with their
foreign servitude, and panting for the restoration of liberty and
independence, they were open to salutary impressions; and convinced of
their errors, they renounced idolatry. The re-establishment of the faith
of their fathers was inaugurated at a great public meeting, held at
Mizpeh in Judah, and hallowed by the observance of impressive religious
solemnities. The drawing water, and pouring it out before the Lord,
seems to have been a symbolical act by which, in the people's name,
Samuel testified their sense of national corruption, their need of that
moral purification of which water is the emblem, and their sincere
desire to pour out their hearts in repentance before God.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 7:6</span></span>

Samuel judged . . . Israel in Mizpeh--At the time of Eli's death he
could not have much exceeded twenty years of age; and although his
character and position must have given him great influence, it does not
appear that hitherto he had done more than prophets were wont to do. Now
he entered on the duties of a civil magistrate.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 7:7</span></span>

WHILE SAMUEL PRAYS, THE PHILISTINES ARE DISCOMFITED. ([Sa1
7:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#007).md)

when the Philistines heard, &c.--The character and importance of the
national convention at Mizpeh were fully appreciated by the Philistines.
They discerned in it the rising spirit of religious patriotism among the
Israelites that was prepared to throw off the yoke of their domination.
Anxious to crush it at the first, they made a sudden incursion while the
Israelites were in the midst of their solemn celebration. Unprepared for
resistance, they besought Samuel to supplicate the divine interposition
to save them from their enemies. The prophet's prayers and sacrifice
were answered by such a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning that
the assailants, panic-struck, were disordered and fled. The Israelites,
recognizing the hand of God, rushed courageously on the foe they had so
much dreaded and committed such immense havoc, that the Philistines did
not for long recover from this disastrous blow. This brilliant victory
secured peace and independence to Israel for twenty years, as well as
the restitution of the usurped territory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">sa1 7:12</span></span>

Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen--on an open spot
between the town and "the crag" (some well-known rock in the
neighborhood). A huge stone pillar was erected as a monument of their
victory ([Lev 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001).md). The
name--Eben-ezer--is thought to have been written on the face of it.
