NEHEMIAH appears to have been the author of this book, from his usually
writing in his own name, and indeed, except in those parts which are
unmistakably later editions or borrowed from public documents, he
usually employs the first person. The major portion of the book is
occupied with a history of Nehemiah's twelve years' administration in
Jerusalem, after which he returned to his duties in Shushan. At a later
period he returned with new powers and commenced new and vigorous
measures of reform, which are detailed in the later chapters of the
book.
