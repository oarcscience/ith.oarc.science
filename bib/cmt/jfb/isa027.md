Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 27](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001)

[Isaiah 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 27:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH, TWENTY-FIFTH, AND TWENTY-SIXTH
CHAPTERS. ([Isa 27:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001))

sore--rather, "hard," "well-tempered."

leviathan--literally, in Arabic, "the twisted animal," applicable to
every great tenant of the waters, sea-serpents, crocodiles, &c. In [Eze
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003); [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002); [Dan
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001), &c. [Rev
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#003), &c., potentates hostile to
Israel are similarly described; antitypically and ultimately Satan is
intended ([Rev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010)).

piercing--rigid \[LOWTH\]. Flying \[MAURER and Septuagint\]. Long,
extended, namely, as the crocodile which cannot readily bend back its
body \[HOUBIGANT\].

crooked--winding.

dragon--Hebrew, tenin; the crocodile.

sea--the Euphrates, or the expansion of it near Babylon.

[Isaiah 27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 27:2</span></span>

In that day when leviathan shall be destroyed, the vineyard ([Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008)), the Church of God, purged of
its blemishes, shall be lovely in God's eyes; to bring out this sense
the better, LOWTH, by changing a Hebrew letter, reads "pleasant,"
"lovely," for "red wine."

sing--a responsive song \[LOWTH\].

unto her--rather, "concerning her" (see on [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001)); namely, the Jewish state
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 27:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 27:3</span></span>

lest any hurt it--attack it \[MAURER\]. "Lest aught be wanting in her"
\[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 27:4</span></span>

Fury is not in me--that is, I entertain no longer anger towards my vine.

who would set . . . in battle--that is, would that I had the briers, &c.
(the wicked foe; [Isa 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018); [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017); [Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006)), before me! "I would go
through," or rather, "against them."

[Isaiah 27:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 27:5</span></span>

Or--Else; the only alternative, if Israel's enemies wish to escape being
"burnt together."

strength--rather, "the refuge which I afford" \[MAURER\]. "Take hold,"
refers to the horns of the altar which fugitives often laid hold of as
an asylum ([Kg1 1:50](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#050); [Kg1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#028)). Jesus is God's "strength," or
"refuge" which sinners must repair to and take hold of, if they are to
have "peace" with God ([Isa 45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024);
[Rom 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014); compare [Job
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 27:6</span></span>

He--Jehovah. Here the song of the Lord as to His vineyard ([Isa
27:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002)) ends; and the prophet confirms
the sentiment in the song, under the same image of a vine (compare [Psa
92:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013); [Hos
14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#005)).

Israel . . . fill . . . world-- ([Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 27:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 27:7</span></span>

him . . . those--Israel--Israel's enemies. Has God punished His people
as severely as He has those enemies whom He employed to chastise Israel?
No! Far from it. Israel, after trials, He will restore; Israel's enemies
He will utterly destroy at last.

the slaughter of them that are slain by him--rather, "Is Israel slain
according to the slaughter of the enemy slain?" the slaughter wherewith
the enemy is slain \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 27:8</span></span>

In measure--not beyond measure; in moderation ([Job
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006); [Psa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#001); [Jer
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#024); [Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011); [Jer
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028)).

when it shooteth--image from the vine; rather, passing from the image to
the thing itself, "when sending her away (namely, Israel to exile; [Isa
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001), God only putting the adulteress
away when He might justly have put her to death), Thou didst punish her"
\[GESENIUS\].

stayeth--rather, as Margin, "when He removeth it by His rough wind in
the day," &c.

east wind--especially violent in the East ([Job
27:21](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#021); [Jer
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#017)).

[Isaiah 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 27:9</span></span>

By this--exile of Israel (the "sending away," [Isa
27:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#008)).

purged--expiated \[HORSLEY\].

all the fruit--This is the whole benefit designed to be brought about by
the chastisement; namely, the removal of his (Israel's) sin (namely,
object of idolatry; [Deu 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021); [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008)).

when he--Jehovah; at the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, His
instrument. The Jews ever since have abhorred idolatry (compare [Isa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008)).

not stand up--shall rise no more \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 27:10</span></span>

city--Jerusalem; the beating asunder of whose altars and images was
mentioned in [Isa 27:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009) (compare [Isa
24:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#010)).

calf feed-- ([Isa 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002)); it shall be a
vast wild pasture.

branches--resuming the image of the vine ([Isa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#002), [Isa
27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 27:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 27:11</span></span>

boughs . . . broken off--so the Jews are called ([Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017), [Rom
11:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019)).

set . . . on fire--burn them as fuel; "women" are specified, as probably
it was their office to collect fuel and kindle the fire for cooking.

no understanding--as to the ways of God ([Deu
32:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#028); [Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021); [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006)).

[Isaiah 27:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 27:12</span></span>

Restoration of the Jews from their dispersion, described under the image
of fruits shaken from trees and collected.

beat off--as fruit beaten off a tree with a stick ([Deu
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#020)), and then gathered.

river--Euphrates.

stream of Egypt--on the confines of Palestine and Egypt ([Num
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#005); [Jos
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#004), [Jos
15:47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#047)), now Wady-el-Arish, Jehovah's
vineyard, Israel, extended according to His purpose from the Nile to the
Euphrates ([Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021), [Kg1
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#024); [Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)).

one by one--gathered most carefully, not merely as a nation, but as
individuals.

[Isaiah 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 27:13</span></span>

great trumpet--image from the trumpets blown on the first day of the
seventh month to summon the people to a holy convocation ([Lev
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024)). Antitypically, the gospel
trumpet ([Rev 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015); [Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006)) which the Jews shall hearken to
in the last days ([Zac 12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001)). As the passover in the first
month answers to Christ's crucifixion, so the day of atonement and the
idea of "salvation" connected with the feast of tabernacles in the same
seventh month, answer to the crowning of "redemption" at His second
coming; therefore redemption is put last in [Co1
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030).

Assyria--whither the ten tribes had been carried; Babylonia is mainly
meant, to which Assyria at that time belonged; the two tribes were
restored, and some of the ten accompanied them. However, "Assyria" is
designedly used to point ultimately to the future restoration of the ten
fully, never yet accomplished ([Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018)).

Egypt--whither many had fled at the Babylonish captivity ([Jer
41:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#017)). Compare as to the future
restoration, [Isa 11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011), [Isa
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#016); [Isa
51:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#009) ("Rahab" being Egypt).

The twenty-eighth through thirty-third chapters form almost one
continuous prophecy concerning the destruction of Ephraim, the impiety
and folly of Judah, the danger of their league with Egypt, the straits
they would be reduced to by Assyria, from which Jehovah would deliver
them on their turning to Him; the twenty-eighth chapter refers to the
time just before the sixth year of Hezekiak's reign, the rest not very
long before his fourteenth year.
