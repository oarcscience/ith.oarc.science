### [Isaiah Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 6:1</span></span>

VISION OF JEHOVAH IN HIS TEMPLE. ([Isa
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md)

In . . . year . . . Uzziah died--Either literal death, or civil when he
ceased as a leper to exercise his functions as king \[Chaldee\], ([Ch2
26:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#019).md). 754 B.C. \[CALMET\] 758
(Common Chronology). This is not the first beginning of Isaiah's
prophecies, but his inauguration to a higher degree of the prophetic
office: [Isa 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md), &c., implies the
tone of one who had already experience of the people's obstinacy.

Lord--here Adonai, Jehovah in [Isa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md); Jesus Christ is meant as speaking
in [Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md), according to [Joh
12:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#041.md). Isaiah could only have "seen"
the Son, not the divine essence ([Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md). The words in [Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md) are attributed by Paul ([Act
28:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#025).md) to the Holy Ghost. Thus the
Trinity in unity is implied; as also by the thrice "Holy" ([Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md). Isaiah mentions the robes,
temple, and seraphim, but not the form of God Himself. Whatever it was,
it was different from the usual Shekinah: that was on the mercy seat,
this on a throne; that a cloud and fire, of this no form is specified:
over that were the cherubim, over this the seraphim; that had no
clothing, this had a flowing robe and train.

[Isaiah 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 6:2</span></span>

stood--not necessarily the posture of standing; rather, were in
attendance on Him \[MAURER\], hovering on expanded wings.

the--not in the Hebrew.

seraphim--nowhere else applied to God's attendant angels; but to the
fiery flying (not winged, but rapidly moving) serpents, which bit the
Israelites ([Num 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006).md), called so from
the poisonous inflammation caused by their bites. Seraph is to burn;
implying the burning zeal, dazzling brightness ([Kg2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#011.md); [Kg2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017.md); [Eze
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#013.md); [Mat
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#003).md) and serpent-like rapidity of the
seraphim in God's service. Perhaps Satan's form as a serpent (nachash)
in his appearance to man has some connection with his original form as a
seraph of light. The head of the serpent was the symbol of wisdom in
Egypt (compare [Num 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#008.md); [Kg2
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#004).md). The seraphim, with six wings
and one face, can hardly be identified with the cherubim, which had four
wings (in the temple only two) and four faces ([Eze
1:5-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#005).md). (But compare [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008).md). The "face" and "feet" imply a
human form; something of a serpentine form (perhaps a basilisk's head,
as in the temples of Thebes) may have been mixed with it: so the cherub
was compounded of various animal forms. However, seraph may come from a
root meaning "princely," applied in [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013.md) to Michael \[MAURER\]; just as
cherub comes from a root (changing m into b), meaning "noble."

twain--Two wings alone of the six were kept ready for instant flight in
God's service; two veiled their faces as unworthy to look on the holy
God, or pry into His secret counsels which they fulfilled ([Exo
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md); [Job
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#018.md); [Job
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#015).md); two covered their feet, or
rather the whole of the lower parts of their persons--a practice usual
in the presence of Eastern monarchs, in token of reverence (compare [Eze
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#011), their bodies.md). Man's service a
fortiori consists in reverent waiting on, still more than in active
service for, God.

[Isaiah 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 6:3</span></span>

([Rev 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008).md). The Trinity is implied (on
"Lord," see on [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001).md). God's
holiness is the keynote of Isaiah's whole prophecies.

whole earth--the Hebrew more emphatically, the fulness of the whole
earth is His glory ([Psa 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md); [Psa
72:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 6:4</span></span>

posts of . . . door--rather, foundations of the thresholds.

house--temple.

smoke--the Shekinah cloud ([Kg1 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010.md);
[Eze 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 6:5</span></span>

undone-- ([Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020).md). The same effect
was produced on others by the presence of God ([Jdg
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#022.md); [Jdg
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#022.md); [Job
42:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005.md); [Luk
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008.md); [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).md).

lips--appropriate to the context which describes the praises of the
lips, sung in alternate responses ([Exo
15:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md); [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003).md) by the seraphim: also appropriate
to the office of speaking as the prophet of God, about to be committed
to Isaiah ([Isa 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009).md).

seen--not strictly Jehovah Himself ([Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Ti1
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016).md), but the symbol of His presence.

Lord--Hebrew, "JEHOVAH."

[Isaiah 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 6:6</span></span>

unto me--The seraph had been in the temple, Isaiah outside of it.

live coal--literally, "a hot stone," used, as in some countries in our
days, to roast meat with, for example, the meat of the sacrifices. Fire
was a symbol of purification, as it takes the dross out of metals ([Mal
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md).

the altar--of burnt offering, in the court of the priests before the
temple. The fire on it was at first kindled by God ([Lev
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024).md), and was kept continually
burning.

[Isaiah 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 6:7</span></span>

mouth . . . lips--(See on [Isa 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).md).
The mouth was touched because it was the part to be used by the prophet
when inaugurated. So "tongues of fire" rested on the disciples ([Act
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003).md) when they were being set apart
to speak in various languages of Jesus.

iniquity--conscious unworthiness of acting as God's messenger.

purged--literally, "covered," that is, expiated, not by any physical
effect of fire to cleanse from sin, but in relation to the altar
sacrifices, of which Messiah, who here commissions Isaiah, was in His
death to be the antitype: it is implied hereby that it is only by
sacrifice sin can be pardoned.

[Isaiah 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 6:8</span></span>

I . . . us--The change of number indicates the Trinity (compare [Gen
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md); [Gen
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007).md). Though not a sure argument for
the doctrine, for the plural may indicate merely majesty, it accords
with that truth proved elsewhere.

Whom . . . who--implying that few would be willing to bear the
self-denial which the delivering of such an unwelcome message to the
Jews would require on the part of the messenger (compare [Ch1
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#005).md).

Here am I--prompt zeal, now that he has been specially qualified for it
([Isa 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#007.md); compare [Sa1
3:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010.md); [Act
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 6:9</span></span>

Hear . . . indeed--Hebrew, "In hearing hear," that is, Though ye hear
the prophet's warnings again and again, ye are doomed, because of your
perverse will ([Joh 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017).md), not to
understand. Light enough is given in revelation to guide those sincerely
seeking to know, in order that they may do, God's will; darkness enough
is left to confound the wilfully blind ([Isa
43:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#008).md). So in Jesus' use of parables
([Mat 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014).md).

see . . . indeed--rather, "though ye see again and again," yet, &c.

[Isaiah 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 6:10</span></span>

Make . . . fat-- ([Psa 119:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#017).md).
"Render them the more hardened by thy warnings" \[MAURER\]. This effect
is the fruit, not of the truth in itself, but of the corrupt state of
their hearts, to which God here judicially gives them over ([Isa
63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017).md). GESENIUS takes the imperatives
as futures. "Proclaim truths, the result of which proclamation will be
their becoming the more hardened" ([Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md); [Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018).md); but this does not so well as
the former set forth God as designedly giving up sinners to judicial
hardening ([Rom 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md); [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011).md). In the first member of the
sentence, the order is, the heart, ears, eyes; in the latter, the
reverse order, the eyes, ears, heart. It is from the heart that
corruption flows into the ears and eyes ([Mar
7:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021).md); but through the eyes and
ears healing reaches the heart ([Rom
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017).md), \[BENGEL\]. ([Jer
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#021.md); [Eze
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#002.md); [Zac
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md); [Act
7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004).md). In [Mat
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#015.md), the words are quoted in the
indicative, "is waxed gross" (so the Septuagint), not the imperative,
"make fat"; God's word as to the future is as certain as if it were
already fulfilled. To see with one's eyes will not convince a will that
is opposed to the truth (compare [Joh
11:45-46](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#045.md); [Joh
12:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#010).md). "One must love divine
things in order to understand them" \[PASCAL\].

be healed--of their spiritual malady, sin ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md); [Psa
103:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003.md); [Jer
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 6:11</span></span>

how long--will this wretched condition of the nation being hardened to
its destruction continue?

until-- ([Isa 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009).md) --fulfilled
primarily at the Babylonish captivity, and more fully at the dispersion
under the Roman Titus.

[Isaiah 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 6:12</span></span>

([Kg2 25:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#021).md).

forsaking--abandonment of dwellings by their inhabitants ([Jer
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029).md).

[Isaiah 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 6:13</span></span>

and it shall return, and . . . be eaten--Rather, "but it shall be again
given over to be consumed": if even a tenth survive the first
destruction, it shall be destroyed by a second ([Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md); [Eze
5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#001.md), [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md), \[MAURER and HORSLEY\]. In
English Version, "return" refers to the poor remnant left in the land at
the Babylonish captivity ([Kg2 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md);
[Kg2 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#012).md), which afterwards fled to
Egypt in fear ([Kg2 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#026).md), and
subsequently returned thence along with others who had fled to Moab and
Edom ([Jer 40:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011).md), and suffered
under further divine judgments.

tell--rather, "terebinth" or "turpentine tree" ([Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029).md).

substance . . . when . . . cast . . . leaves--rather, "As a terebinth or
oak in which, when they are cast down (not 'cast their leaves,' [Job
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#007).md), the trunk or stock remains, so
the holy seed ([Ezr 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#002).md) shall be the
stock of that land." The seeds of vitality still exist in both the land
and the scattered people of Judea, waiting for the returning spring of
God's favor ([Rom 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md), [Rom
11:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023).md). According to Isaiah, not
all Israel, but the elect remnant alone, is destined to salvation. God
shows unchangeable severity towards sin, but covenant faithfulness in
preserving a remnant, and to it Isaiah bequeaths the prophetic legacy of
the second part of his book (the fortieth through sixty-sixth chapters).

In the Assyrian inscriptions the name of Rezin, king of Damascus, is
found among the tributaries of Tiglath-pileser, of whose reign the
annals of seventeen years have been deciphered. For the historical facts
in this chapter, compare 2Ki. 15:37-16:9. Rezin of Syria and Pekah of
Israel, as confederates, advanced against Jerusalem. In the first
campaign they "smote Ahaz with a great slaughter" ([Ch2
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#005).md). Their object was probably to
unite the three kingdoms against Assyria. Egypt seems to have favored
the plan, so as to interpose these confederate kingdoms between her own
frontier and Assyria (compare [Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md), "Egypt"; and [Kg2
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004), Hoshea's league with Egypt.md).
Rezin and Pekah may have perceived Ahaz' inclination towards Assyria
rather than towards their own confederacy; this and the old feud between
Israel and Judah ([Kg1 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#016).md)
occasioned their invasion of Judah. Ahaz, at the second inroad of his
enemies (compare 2Ch. 28:1-26 and [Kg2
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#037.md), with [Isa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#005).md), smarting under his former
defeat, applied to Tiglath-pileser, in spite of Isaiah's warning in this
chapter, that he should rather rely on God; that king accordingly
attacked Damascus, and slew Rezin ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009).md); and probably it was at the same
time that he carried away part of Israel captive ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md), unless there were two assaults
on Pekah--that in [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md), the
earlier, and that in which Tiglath helped Ahaz subsequently \[G. V.
SMITH\]. Ahaz was saved at the sacrifice of Judah's independence and the
payment of a large tribute, which continued till the overthrow of
Sennacherib under Hezekiah ([Isa
37:37](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#037.md); [Kg2
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008.md), [Kg2
16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#017.md); [Ch2
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#020).md). Ahaz' reign began about 741
B.C., and Pekah was slain in 738 \[WINER\].
