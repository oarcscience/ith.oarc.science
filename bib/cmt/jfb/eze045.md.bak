### [Ezekiel Chapter 45](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 45:1</span></span>

ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND FOR THE SANCTUARY, THE CITY, AND THE PRINCE. (Eze.
45:1-25)

offer an oblation--from a Hebrew root to "heave" or "raise"; when
anything was offered to God, the offerer raised the hand. The special
territorial division for the tribes is given in the forty-seventh and
forty-eighth chapters. Only Jehovah's portion is here subdivided into
its three parts: (1) that for the sanctuary ([Eze
45:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002)); (2.md) that for the priests
([Eze 45:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#004)); (3.md) that for the Levites
([Eze 45:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#005).md). Compare [Eze
48:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#008.md).

five and twenty thousand reeds, &c.--So English Version rightly fills
the ellipsis (compare Note, see on [Eze
42:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#016).md). Hence "cubits" are mentioned
in [Eze 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#002.md), not here, implying that
there alone cubits are meant. Taking each reed at twelve feet, the area
of the whole would be a square of sixty miles on each side. The whole
forming a square betokens the settled stability of the community and the
harmony of all classes. "An holy portion of the land" ([Eze
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#001).md) comprised the whole length, and
only two-fifths of the breadth. The outer territory in its distribution
harmonizes with the inner and more sacred arrangements of the sanctuary.
No room is to be given for oppression (see [Eze
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#008).md), all having ample provision made
for their wants and comforts. All will mutually co-operate without
constraint or contention.

[Ezekiel 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 45:7</span></span>

The prince's possession is to consist of two halves, one on the west,
the other on the east, of the sacred territory. The prince, as head of
the holy community, stands in closest connection with the sanctuary; his
possession, therefore, on both sides must adjoin that which was
peculiarly the Lord's \[FAIRBAIRN\].

[Ezekiel 45:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 45:12</span></span>

The standard weights were lost when the Chaldeans destroyed the temple.
The threefold enumeration of shekels (twenty, twenty-five, fifteen)
probably refers to coins of different value, representing respectively
so many shekels, the three collectively making up a maneh. By weighing
these together against the maneh, a test was afforded whether they
severally had their proper weight: sixty shekels in all, containing one
coin a fourth of the whole (fifteen shekels), another a third (twenty
shekels), another a third and a twelfth (twenty-five shekels)
\[MENOCHIUS\]. The Septuagint reads, "fifty shekels shall be your
maneh."

[Ezekiel 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 45:13</span></span>

In these oblations there is a progression as to the relation between the
kind and the quantity: of the corn, the sixth of a tenth, that is, a
sixtieth part of the quantity specified; of the oil, the tenth of a
tenth, that is, an hundredth part; and of the flock, one from every two
hundred.

[Ezekiel 45:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 45:18</span></span>

The year is to begin with a consecration service, not mentioned under
the Levitical law; but an earnest of it is given in the feast of
dedication of the second temple, which celebrated its purification by
Judas Maccabeus, after its defilement by Antiochus.

[Ezekiel 45:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 45:20</span></span>

for him that is simple--for sins of ignorance ([Lev
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md), [Lev
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md), [Lev
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027).md).

[Ezekiel 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 45:21</span></span>

As a new solemnity, the feast of consecration is to prepare for the
passover; so the passover itself is to have different sacrifices from
those of the Mosaic law. Instead of one ram and seven lambs for the
daily burnt offering, there are to be seven bullocks and seven rams. So
also whereas the feast of tabernacles had its own offerings, which
diminished as the days of the feast advanced, here the same are
appointed as on the passover. Thus it is implied that the letter of the
law is to give place to its spirit, those outward rites of Judaism
having no intrinsic efficacy, but symbolizing the spiritual truths of
Messiah's kingdom, as for instance the perfect holiness which is to
characterize it. Compare [Co1 5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md),
as to our spiritual "passover," wherein, at the Lord's supper, we feed
on Christ by faith, accompanied with "the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth." Literal ordinances, though not slavishly bound to the letter
of the law, will set forth the catholic and eternal verities of
Messiah's kingdom.
