### [Psalms Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

[Psalms](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">psa 0:0</span></span>

The Hebrew title of this book is Tehilim ("praises" or "hymns"), for a
leading feature in its contents is praise, though the word occurs in the
title of only one Psalm (the hundred forty-fifth). The Greek title (in
the Septuagint, a translation made two hundred years before Christ) is
psalmoi, whence our word "Psalms." This corresponds to the Hebrew word
mizmoi by which sixty-five Psalms are designated in their inscriptions,
and which the Syriac, a language like the Hebrew, uses for the whole
book. It means, as does also the Greek name, an ode, or song, whose
singing is accompanied by an instrument, particularly the harp (compare
[Ch1 16:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#004.md); [Ch2
5:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012).md). To some Psalms, the Hebrew
word (shir) "a song," is prefixed. Paul seems to allude to all these
terms in [Eph 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#019.md), "singing . . . in
psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs."

TITLES.--To more than a hundred Psalms are prefixed inscriptions, which
give one or more (and in one case, \[Psalm 60\], all) of these
particulars: the direction to the musician, the name of the author or
the instrument, the style of the music or of the poetry, the subject or
occasion. The authority of these inscriptions has been disputed by some
writers. They say that the earliest translators, as the Greek and
Syriac, evince a disregard for their authority, by variations from a
proper translation of some, altering others, and, in several instances,
supplying titles to Psalms which, in Hebrew, had none. It is also
alleged that the subject of a Psalm, as given in the title, is often
inconsistent with its contents. But those translators have also varied
from a right translation of many passages in the Bible, which all agree
to be of good authority; and the alleged inconsistency may be shown, on
more accurate investigation, not to exist. The admitted antiquity of
these inscriptions, on the other hand, and even their obscurity, raise a
presumption in their favor, while such prefaces to a composition accord
with the usages of that age and part of the world (compare [Isa
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#009).md).

"The Chief Musician" was the superintendent of the music (compare "to
oversee," [Ch1 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#021), Margin.md). "To"
prefixed to this, means, "pertaining to" in his official character. This
inscription is found in fifty-three Psalms and is attached to Habakkuk's
prayer (Hab. 3:1-19). The same Hebrew preposition is prefixed to the
name of the author and translated "of," as "a Psalm of David," "of
Asaph," except that to "the sons of Korah," it is translated "for,"
which is evidently wrong, as the usual direction, "to the chief
musician," is given, and no other authorship intimated. On the apparent
exception to this last remark, see below, and see on [Psa
88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001.md), title. The explanations of other
particulars in the titles will be given as they occur.

AUTHORS.--This book is often called "The Psalms of David," he being the
only author mentioned in the New Testament ([Luk
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042).md) and his name appearing in more
titles than that of any other writer. Besides about one-half of the
Psalms in which it thus appears, Psalms 2 and 95 are ascribed to him
([Act 4:25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md) and [Heb
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#007).md). He was probably the author of
many others which appear without a name. He used great efforts to
beautify the worship of the sanctuary. Among the two hundred
eighty-eight Levites he appointed for singing and performing
instrumental music, we find mentioned the "sons of Korah" ([Ch1
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1009.htm#019).md); including Heman ([Ch1
6:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#033).md); and also Asaph ([Ch1
6:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#039).md); and Ethan ([Ch1
15:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#017).md). God was doubtless pleased
to endow these men with the inspiration of His Spirit, so that they used
those poetic talents which their connection with the kindred art of
music had led them to cultivate, in the production of compositions like
those of their king and patron. To Asaph are ascribed twelve Psalms; to
the sons of Korah, eleven, including the eighty-eighth, which is also
ascribed to Heman, that being the only instance in which the name of the
"son" (or descendant) is mentioned; and to Ethan, one. Solomon's name
appears before the seventy-second and hundred twenty-seventh; and that
of Moses before the ninetieth. Special questions respecting authorship
will be explained as they arise.

CONTENTS.--As the book contains one hundred fifty independent
compositions, it is not susceptible of any logical analysis. The Jews
having divided it into five books, corresponding to the Five Books of
Moses (First, Psalms 1-42; Second, Psalms 43-72; Third, Psalms 73-89;
Fourth, Psalms 90-106; Fifth, Psalms 107-150), many attempts have been
made to discover, in this division, some critical or practical value,
but in vain. Sundry efforts have been made to classify the Psalms by
subject. Angus' Bible Hand Book is perhaps the most useful, and is
appended.

Still the Psalms have a form and character peculiar to themselves; and
with individual diversities of style and subject, they all assimilate to
that form, and together constitute a consistent system of moral truth.
They are all poetical, and of that peculiar parallelism (see
Introduction to the Poetical Books,) which distinguished Hebrew poetry.
They are all lyrical, or songs adapted to musical instruments, and all
religious lyrics, or such as were designed to be used in the sanctuary
worship.

The distinguishing feature of the Psalms is their devotional character.
Whether their matter be didactic, historical, prophetical, or practical,
it is made the ground or subject of prayer, or praise, or both. The
doctrines of theology and precepts of pure morality are here inculcated.
God's nature, attributes, perfections, and works of creation,
providence, and grace, are unfolded. In the sublimest conceptions of the
most exalted verse, His glorious supremacy over the principalities of
heaven, earth, and hell, and His holy, wise, and powerful control of all
material and immaterial agencies, are celebrated. The great covenant of
grace resting on the fundamental promise of a Redeemer, both alike the
provisions of God's exhaustless mercy, is set forth in respect of the
doctrines of regeneration by the Spirit, forgiveness of sins, repentance
toward God, and faith toward Jesus Christ, while its glorious results,
involving the salvation of men "from the ends of the earth" \[[Act
13:47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047.md)\], are proclaimed in believing,
prophetic prayer and thankful praise. The personal history of the
authors, and especially David's in its spiritual aspects, is that of
God's people generally. Christian biography is edifying only as it is
truth illustrated in experience, such as God's Word and Spirit produce.
It may be factitious in origin and of doubtful authenticity. But here
the experience of the truly pious is detailed, under divine influence,
and "in words which the Holy Ghost" taught \[[Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md)\]. The whole inner life of the
pious man is laid open, and Christians of all ages have here the
temptations, conflicts, perplexities, doubts, fears, penitent moanings,
and overwhelming griefs on the one hand, and the joy and hope of
pardoning mercy, the victory over the seductions of false-hearted
flatterers, and deliverance from the power of Satan on the other, with
which to compare their own spiritual exercises. Here, too, are the
fruits of that sovereign mercy, so often sought in earnest prayer, and
when found, so often sung in rapturous joy, exhibited by patience in
adversity, moderation in prosperity, zeal for God's glory, love for man,
justice to the oppressed, holy contempt for the proud, magnanimity
towards enemies, faithfulness towards friends, delight in the prosperity
of Zion, and believing prayer for her enlargement and perpetuity.

The historical summaries of the Psalms are richly instructive. God's
choice of the patriarchs, the sufferings of the Israelites in Egypt,
their exodus, temptations of God, rebellions and calamities in the
wilderness, settlement in Canaan, backslidings and reformations, furnish
illustrations of God's providential government of His people,
individually and collectively, tending to exalt His adorable grace and
abase human pride. But the promises and prophecies connected with these
summaries, and elsewhere presented in the Psalms, have a far wider
reach, exhibiting the relations of the book to the great theme of
promise and prophecy:

THE MESSIAH AND HIS KINGDOM.--David was God's chosen servant to rule His
people, as the head at once of the State and the Church, the lineal
ancestor, "according to the flesh" \[[Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030.md); [Rom
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md)\], of His adorable Son, and His
type, in His official relations, both in suffering and in triumph.
Generally, David's trials by the ungodly depicted the trials of Christ,
and his final success the success of Christ's kingdom. Typically, he
uses language describing his feelings, which only finds its full meaning
in the feelings of Christ. As such it is quoted and applied in the New
Testament. And further, in view of the great promise ([Sa2
7:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).md) to him and his seed, to which
such frequent reference is made in the Psalms, David was inspired to
know, that though his earthly kingdom should perish, his spiritual would
ever endure, in the power, beneficence, and glory of Christ's. In
repeating and amplifying that promise, he speaks not only as a type, but
"being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him,
that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise
up Christ to sit on his throne," he "foretold the sufferings of Christ
and the glory that should follow. His incarnation, humiliating sorrows,
persecution, and cruel death are disclosed in the plaintive cries of a
despairing sufferer; and His resurrection and ascension, His eternal
priesthood, His royal dignity, His prophetical office, the purchase and
bestowal of the gifts of the Spirit, the conversion of the nations, the
establishment, increase, and perpetuity of the Church, the end of time,
and the blessedness of the righteous who acknowledge, and the ruin of
the wicked who reject this King in Zion, are predicted in the language
of assured confidence and joy." While these great themes have supplied
the people of God with a popular theology and a guide in religious
experience and Christian morality, clothed in the language of devotion,
they have provided an inspired liturgy in which the pious, of all creeds
and sects, have, for nearly three thousand years, poured out their
prayers and praises. The pious Jew, before the coming of Christ, mourned
over the adversity, or celebrated the future glories, of Zion, in the
words of her ancient king. Our Saviour, with His disciples, sang one of
these hymns on the night on which He was betrayed \[[Mat
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#030.md)\]; He took from one the words in
which He uttered the dreadful sorrows of His soul \[[Mat
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046.md)\], and died with those of
another on His lips \[[Luk 23:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#046.md)\].
Paul and Silas in the dungeon \[[Act
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md)\], primitive Christians in their
covert places of worship, or the costly churches of a later day, and the
scattered and feeble Christian flocks in the prevalence of darkness and
error through the Middle Ages, fed their faith and warmed their love
with these consoling songs. Now, throughout the Christian world, in
untold forms of version, paraphrase, and imitation, by Papists and
Protestants, Prelatists and Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists,
Methodists--men of all lands and all creeds, in public and private
worship, God is still adored in the sentiments expressed in these
venerable Psalms. From the tone of sorrow and suffering which pervade
their earlier portions we are gradually borne on amid alternate
conflicts and triumphs, mournful complaints and awakening confidence; as
we approach the close the tones of sorrow grow feebler, and those of
praise wax louder and stronger--till, in the exulting strains of the
last Psalm, the chorus of earth mingles with the hallelujahs of the
multitude, which no man can number, in the sanctuary above.
