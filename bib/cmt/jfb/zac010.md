### [Zechariah Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 10:1</span></span>

PRAYER AND PROMISE. ([Zac 10:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001).md)

Ask . . . rain--on which the abundance of "corn" promised by the Lord
([Zac 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#017).md) depends. Jehovah alone can
give it, and will give it on being asked ([Jer
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#013.md); [Jer
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#022).md).

rain in . . . time of . . . latter rain--that is, the latter rain in its
due time, namely, in spring, about February or March ([Job
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#023.md); [Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md). The latter rain ripened the
grain, as the former rain in October tended to fructify the seed.
Including all temporal blessings; these again being types of spiritual
ones. Though God has begun to bless us, we are not to relax our prayers.
The former rain of conversion may have been given, but we must also ask
for the latter rain of ripened sanctification. Though at Pentecost there
was a former rain on the Jewish Church, a latter rain is still to be
looked for, when the full harvest of the nation's conversion shall be
gathered in to God. The spirit of prayer in the Church is an index at
once of her piety, and of the spiritual blessings she may expect from
God. When the Church is full of prayer, God pours out a full blessing.

bright clouds--rather, "lightnings," the precursors of rain \[MAURER\].

showers of rain--literally, "rain of heavy rain." In [Job
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#006.md) the same words occur in inverted
order \[HENDERSON\].

grass--a general term, including both corn for men and grass for cattle.

[Zechariah 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 10:2</span></span>

idols--literally, "the teraphim," the household gods, consulted in
divination (see on [Hos 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004).md). Derived
by GESENIUS from an Arabic root, "comfort," indicating them as the
givers of comfort. Or an Ethiopian root, "relics." Herein Zechariah
shows that the Jews by their own idolatry had stayed the grace of God
heretofore, which otherwise would have given them all those blessings,
temporal and spiritual, which they are now ([Zac
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#001).md) urged to "ask" for.

diviners--who gave responses to consulters of the teraphim: opposed to
Jehovah and His true prophets.

seen a lie--pretending to see what they saw not in giving responses.

comfort in vain--literally, "give vapor for comfort"; that is, give
comforting promises to consulters which are sure to come to naught ([Job
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#004.md); [Job
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#002.md); [Job
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#034).md).

therefore they went their way--that is, Israel and Judah were led away
captive.

as a flock . . . no shepherd--As sheep wander and are a prey to every
injury when without a shepherd, so the Jews had been while they were
without Jehovah, the true shepherd; for the false prophets whom they
trusted were no shepherds ([Eze 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#005).md).
So now they are scattered, while they know not Messiah their shepherd;
typified in the state of the disciples, when they had forsaken Jesus and
fled ([Mat 26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056.md); compare [Zac
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007).md).

[Zechariah 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 10:3</span></span>

against the shepherds--the civil rulers of Israel and Judah who abetted
idolatry.

punished--literally, "visited upon." The same word "visited," without
the upon, is presently after used in a good sense to heighten the
contrast.

goats--he-goats. As "shepherds" described what they ought to have been,
so "he-goats" describes what they were, the emblem of headstrong
wantonness and offensive lust ([Isa
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#009.md), Margin; [Eze
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#017.md); [Dan
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#005.md); [Mat
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#033).md). The he-goats head the flock.
They who are first in crime will be first in punishment.

visited--in mercy ([Luk 1:68](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#068).md).

as his goodly horse--In [Zac 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013.md) they
were represented under the image of bows and arrows, here under that of
their commander-in-chief, Jehovah's battle horse ([Sol
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#009).md). God can make His people, timid
though they be as sheep, courageous as the charger. The general rode on
the most beautiful and richly caparisoned, and had his horse tended with
the greatest care. Jehovah might cast off the Jews for their vileness,
but He regards His election or adoption of them: whence He calls them
here "His flock," and therefore saves them.

[Zechariah 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 10:4</span></span>

Out of him--Judah is to be no more subject to foreigners, but from
itself shall come its rulers.

the corner--stone, Messiah ([Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md). "Corners" simply express
governors ([Sa1 14:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#038.md), Margin; [Isa
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#013), Margin.md). The Maccabees, Judah's
governors and deliverers from Antiochus the oppressor, are primarily
meant; but Messiah is the Antitype. Messiah supports and binds together
the Church, Jews and Gentiles.

the nail-- ([Jdg 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#021.md); [Isa
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#023).md). The large peg inside an
Oriental tent, on which is hung most of its valuable furniture. On
Messiah hang all the glory and hope of His people.

bow-- ([Zac 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013).md). Judah shall not
need foreign soldiery. Messiah shall be her battle-bow ([Psa
45:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#004.md); [Rev
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#002).md).

every oppressor--rather, in a good sense, ruler, as the kindred Ethiopic
term means. So "exactor," in [Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017.md), namely, one who exacts the
tribute from the nations made tributary to Judah \[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\].

[Zechariah 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 10:5</span></span>

riders on horses--namely, the enemy's horsemen. Though the Jews were
forbidden by the law to multiply horses in battle ([Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016).md), they are made Jehovah's war
horse ([Zac 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003.md); [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md), and so tread down on foot the
foe with all his cavalry ([Eze 38:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#004.md);
[Dan 11:40](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#040).md). Cavalry was the chief
strength of the Syro-Grecian army (I Maccabees 3:39).

[Zechariah 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 10:6</span></span>

Judah . . . Joseph--that is, the ten tribes. The distinct mention of
both Judah and Israel shows that there is yet a more complete
restoration than that from Babylon, when Judah alone and a few
Israelites from the other tribes returned. The Maccabean deliverance is
here connected with it, just as the painter groups on the same canvas
objects in the foreground and hills far distant; or as the comparatively
near planet and the remote fixed star are seen together in the same
firmament. Prophecy ever hastens to the glorious final consummation
under Messiah.

bring them again to place them--namely, securely in their own land. The
Hebrew verb is compounded of two, "I will bring again," and "I will
place them" ([Jer 32:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#037).md) MAURER, from
a different form, translates, "I will make them to dwell."

[Zechariah 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 10:7</span></span>

like a mighty man--in the battle with the foe ([Zac
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#003.md), [Zac
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#005).md).

rejoice--at their victory over the foe.

children shall see it--who are not yet of age to serve. To teach patient
waiting for God's promises. If ye do not at present see the fulfilment,
your children shall, and their joy shall be complete.

rejoice in the Lord--the Giver of such a glorious victory.

[Zechariah 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 10:8</span></span>

hiss for them--Keepers of bees by a whistle call them together. So
Jehovah by the mere word of His call shall gather back to Palestine His
scattered people ([Zac 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010.md); [Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); [Eze
36:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#011).md). The multitudes mentioned by
JOSEPHUS \[Wars of the Jews, 3:2\], as peopling Galilee two hundred
years after this time, were a pledge of the future more perfect
fulfilment of the prophecy.

for I have redeemed them--namely, in My covenant purpose "redeemed" both
temporally and spiritually.

as they have increased--in former times.

[Zechariah 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 10:9</span></span>

sow them among . . . people--Their dispersion was with a special design.
Like seed sown far and wide, they shall, when quickened themselves, be
the fittest instruments for quickening others (compare [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md). The slight hold they have on
every soil where they now live, as also the commercial and therefore
cosmopolitan character of their pursuits, making a change of residence
easy to them, fit them peculiarly for missionary work \[MOORE\]. The
wide dispersion of the Jews just before Christ's coming prepared the way
similarly for the apostles' preaching in the various Jewish synagogues
throughout the world; everywhere some of the Old Testament seed
previously sown was ready to germinate when the New Testament light and
heat were brought to bear on it by Gospel preachers. Thus the way was
opened for entrance among the Gentiles. "Will sow" is the Hebrew future,
said of that which has been done, is being done, and may be done
afterwards \[MAURER\], (compare [Hos
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023).md).

shall remember me in far countries-- ([Deu
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md); [Ch2
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#037).md). Implying the Jews return to a
right mind in "all the nations" where they are scattered simultaneously.
Compare [Luk 15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017.md), with [Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md), "All the ends of the world
remembering and turning unto the Lord," preceded by the "seed of Jacob .
. . Israel . . . fearing and glorifying Him"; also [Psa
102:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md).

live--in political and spiritual life.

[Zechariah 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 10:10</span></span>

Egypt . . . Assyria--the former the first, the latter among the last of
Israel's oppressors (or representing the four great world kingdoms, of
which it was the first): types of the present universal dispersion,
Egypt being south, Assyria north, opposite ends of the compass. MAURER
conjectures that many Israelites fled to "Egypt" on the invasion of
Tiglath-pileser. But [Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011.md) and
this passage rather accord with the view of the future restoration.

Gilead . . . Lebanon--The whole of the Holy Land is described by two of
its boundaries, the eastern ("Gilead" beyond Jordan) and the northern
("Lebanon").

place shall not be found for them--that is, there shall not be room
enough for them through their numbers ([Isa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020.md); [Isa
54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003).md).

[Zechariah 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 10:11</span></span>

pass . . . sea with affliction--Personifying the "sea"; He shall afflict
the sea, that is, cause it to cease to be an obstacle to Israel's return
to Palestine ([Isa 11:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015).md). Vulgate
translates, "The strait of the sea." MAURER, "He shall cleave and
smite." English Version is best ([Psa
114:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#003).md). As Jehovah smote the Red Sea
to make a passage for His people ([Exo
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#016.md), [Exo
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021).md), so hereafter shall He make a
way through every obstacle which opposes Israel's restoration.

the river--the Nile ([Amo 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#008.md); [Amo
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#005).md), or the Euphrates. Thus the Red
Sea and the Euphrates in the former part of the verse answer to
"Assyria" and "Egypt" in the latter.

sceptre of Egypt . . . depart-- ([Eze
30:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#013).md).

[Zechariah 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 10:12</span></span>

I . . . strengthen them in . . . Lord-- ([Hos
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007).md). I, the Father, will strengthen
them in the name, that is, the manifested power, of the Lord, Messiah,
the Son of God.

walk . . . in his name--that is, live everywhere and continually under
His protection, and according to His will ([Gen
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#022.md); [Psa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md), [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md); [Mic
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005).md).
