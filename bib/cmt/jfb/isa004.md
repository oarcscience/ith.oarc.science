### [Isaiah Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 4:2</span></span>

([Isa 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001).md)

In contrast to those on whom vengeance falls, there is a manifestation
of Jesus Christ to the "escaped of Israel" in His characteristic
attributes, beauty and glory, typified in Aaron's garments ([Exo
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#002).md). Their sanctification is
promised as the fruit of their being "written" in the book of life by
sovereign love ([Isa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003).md); the means
of it are the "spirit of judgment" and that of "burning" ([Isa
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004).md). Their "defense" by the special
presence of Jesus Christ is promised ([Isa
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md).

branch--the sprout of JEHOVAH. Messiah ([Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md); [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md); [Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012.md); [Luk
1:78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078), Margin.md). The parallel clause
does not, as MAURER objects, oppose this; for "fruit of the earth"
answers to "branch"; He shall not be a dry, but a fruit-bearing branch
([Isa 27:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#006.md); [Eze
34:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md). He is "of the earth" in His
birth and death, while He is also "of the Lord" (Jehovah) ([Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024).md). His name, "the Branch,"
chiefly regards His descent from David, when the family was low and
reduced ([Luk 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md), [Luk
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md), [Luk
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#024).md); a sprout with more than David's
glory, springing as from a decayed tree ([Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md); [Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002.md); [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016).md).

excellent-- ([Heb 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md); [Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006).md).

comely-- ([Sol 5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#015.md); [Eze
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#014).md).

escaped of Israel--the elect remnant ([Rom
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)); (1.md) in the return from Babylon;
(2) in the escape from Jerusalem's destruction under Titus; (3) in the
still future assault on Jerusalem, and deliverance of "the third part";
events mutually analogous, like concentric circles ([Zac
12:2-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md); [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md), &c.; [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md); [Eze
39:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#023); Joel 3:1-21.md).

[Isaiah 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 4:3</span></span>

left in Zion--equivalent to the "escaped of Israel" ([Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002).md).

shall be called--shall be ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

holy-- ([Isa 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md); [Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md).

written--in the book of life, antitypically ([Phi
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003.md); [Rev
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#005.md); [Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008).md). Primarily, in the register kept
of Israel's families and tribes.

living--not "blotted out" from the registry, as dead; but written there
as among the "escaped of Israel" ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md); [Eze
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009).md). To the elect of Israel, rather
than the saved in general, the special reference is here ([Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 4:4</span></span>

When--that is, After.

washed-- ([Zac 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001).md).

filth--moral ([Isa 1:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021).md).

daughters of Zion--same as in [Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md).

purged--purified by judgments; destroying the ungodly, correcting and
refining the godly.

blood-- ([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015).md).

spirit--Whatever God does in the universe, He does by His Spirit,
"without the hand" of man ([Job 34:20](../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#020.md);
[Psa 104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030).md). Here He is represented
using His power as Judge.

burning-- ([Mat 3:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md). The same
Holy Ghost, who sanctifies believers by the fire of affliction ([Mal
3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#002).md), dooms unbelievers to the fire
of perdition ([Co1 3:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 4:5</span></span>

create--The "new creation" needs as much God's creative omnipotence, as
the material creation ([Co2 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006.md); [Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010).md). So it shall be in the case of
the Holy Jerusalem to come ([Isa
65:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017).md).

upon--The pillar of cloud stood over the tabernacle, as symbol of God's
favor and presence ([Exo 13:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md);
[Psa 91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001).md). Both on individual
families ("every dwelling") and on the general sacred "assemblies" ([Lev
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002).md). The "cloud" became a "fire" by
night in order to be seen by the Lord's people.

upon all the glory--"upon the glorious whole"; namely, the Lord's people
and sanctuary \[MAURER\]. May it not mean, "Upon whatever the glory (the
Shekinah spoken of in the previous clause) shall rest, there shall be a
defense." The symbol of His presence shall ensure also safety. So it was
to Israel against the Egyptians at the Red Sea ([Exo
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019).md). So it shall be to literal
Jerusalem hereafter ([Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005).md). Also
to the Church, the spiritual "Zion" ([Isa
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#018.md); [Isa
33:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#015.md); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md).

tabernacle--Christ's body ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md).
"The word 'tabernacled' (Greek for 'dwelt') among us" ([Joh
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#021.md); [Heb
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#002).md). It is a "shadow from the heat"
and "refuge from the storm" of divine wrath against man's sins ([Isa
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004).md). Heat and storms are violent in
the East; so that a portable tent is a needful part of a traveller's
outfit. Such shall be God's wrath hereafter, from which the "escaped of
Israel" shall be sheltered by Jesus Christ ([Isa
26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002).md).

covert--answering to "defense" ([Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005).md). The Hebrew for defense in [Isa
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#005.md), is "covering"; the lid of the ark
or mercy seat was named from the same Hebrew word, caphar; the
propitiatory; for it, being sprinkled with blood by the high priest once
a year, on the day of atonement, covered the people typically from
wrath. Jesus Christ is the true Mercy Seat, on whom the Shekinah rested,
the propitiatory, or atonement, beneath whom the law is kept, as it was
literally within the ark, and man is covered from the storm. The
redeemed Israel shall also be, by union with Him, a tabernacle for God's
glory, which, unlike that in the wilderness, shall not be taken down
([Isa 38:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#020).md).

A new prophecy; entire in itself. Probably delivered about the same time
as the second and third chapters, in Uzziah's reign. Compare [Isa
5:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md) with [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017.md); and [Isa
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md) with [Isa
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md). However, the close of the
chapter alludes generally to the still distant invasion of Assyrians in
a later reign (compare [Isa 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md) with
[Isa 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018.md); and [Isa
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md) with [Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012).md). When the time drew nigh,
according to the ordinary prophetic usage, he handles the details more
particularly (Isa. 7:1-8:22); namely, the calamities caused by the
Syro-Israelitish invasion, and subsequently by the Assyrians whom Ahaz
had invited to his help.
