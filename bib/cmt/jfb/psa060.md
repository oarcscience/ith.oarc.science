### [Psalms Chapter 60](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001)

[Psalms 60:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 60:1</span></span>

Shushan-eduth--Lily of testimony. The lily is an emblem of beauty (see
on [Psa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#001), title). As a description
of the Psalm, those terms combined may denote a beautiful poem,
witnessing--that is, for God's faithfulness as evinced in the victories
referred to in the history cited. Aram-naharaim--Syria of the two
rivers, or Mesopotamia beyond the river (Euphrates) ([Sa2
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#016)). Aram-zobah--Syria of Zobah
([Sa2 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#006)), to whose king the king of
the former was tributary. The war with Edom, by Joab and Abishai ([Ch2
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#012), [Ch2
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/ch2018.htm#025)), occurred about the same time.
Probably, while doubts and fears alternately prevailed respecting the
issue of these wars, the writer composed this Psalm, in which he
depicts, in the language of God's people, their sorrows under former
disasters, offers prayer in present straits, and rejoices in confident
hope of triumph by God's aid. ([Psa
60:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#001))

allude to disasters.

cast . . . off--in scorn ([Psa 43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002);
[Psa 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009)).

scattered--broken our strength (compare [Sa2
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#020)).

Oh, turn thyself--or, "restore to us" (prosperity). The figures of
physical, denote great civil, commotions ([Psa
46:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002)).

[Psalms 60:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 60:3</span></span>

drink . . . wine of astonishment--literally, "of staggering"--that is,
made us weak (compare [Psa 75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017), [Isa
51:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#022)).

[Psalms 60:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 60:4</span></span>

Yet to God's banner they will rally, and pray that, led and sustained by
His power (right hand, [Psa 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007); [Psa
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006)), they may be safe.

[Psalms 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 60:5</span></span>

hear me--or, "hear us."

[Psalms 60:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 60:6</span></span>

God hath spoken in--or, "by."

his holiness-- ([Psa 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035); [Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002)), on the pledge of His attributes
([Psa 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003); [Psa
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#004)). Taking courage from God's
promise to give them possession ([Exo
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031); [Deu
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#024)) (and perhaps renewed to him by
special revelation), with triumphant joy he describes the conquest as
already made.

Shechem, and . . . Succoth--as widely separated points, and--

[Psalms 60:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 60:7</span></span>

Gilead . . . and Manasseh--as large districts, east and west of Jordan,
represent the whole land.

divide . . . and mete out--means to have entire control over.

Ephraim--denotes the military ([Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017)); and--

Judah--(the lawgiver, [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)), the
civil power. Foreign nations are then presented as subdued.

[Psalms 60:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 60:8</span></span>

Moab--is a my washpot--the most ordinary vessel.

over--or, "at"

Edom--(as a slave) he casts his shoe.

Philistia, triumph, &c.--or, rather, "shout."

for me--acknowledges subjection (compare [Psa
108:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#009), "over Philistia will I
triumph").

[Psalms 60:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 60:9</span></span>

He feels assured that, though once angry, God is now ready to favor His
people.

who will lead me-- or, who has led me, as if the work were now begun.

[Psalms 60:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 60:10</span></span>

Wilt not thou?--or, "Is it not Thou?"

[Psalms 60:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 60:11</span></span>

Hence he closes with a prayer for success, and an assurance of a
hearing.
