### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 2:1</span></span>

HIS MANNER OF PREACHING, AND THEIRS OF RECEIVING, THE GOSPEL; HIS DESIRE
TO HAVE REVISITED THEM FRUSTRATED BY SATAN. (1Th. 2:1-20)

For--confirming [Th1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#009.md). He discusses
the manner of his fellow missionaries' preaching among them ([Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md), and former part of [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009).md) at [Th1
2:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001.md); and the Thessalonians'
reception of the word (compare [Th1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#006.md), and latter part of [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009).md) at [Th1
2:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md).

yourselves--Not only do strangers report it, but you know it to be true
\[ALFORD\] "yourselves."

not in vain--Greek, "not vain," that is, it was full of "power" ([Th1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005).md). The Greek for "was," expresses
rather "hath been and is," implying the permanent and continuing
character of his preaching.

[1 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 2:2</span></span>

even after that we had suffered before--at Philippi (Acts 16:11-40): a
circumstance which would have deterred mere natural, unspiritual men
from further preaching.

shamefully entreated--ignominiously scourged ([Act
16:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#022).md).

bold-- ([Act 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029.md); [Eph
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020).md).

in our God--The ground of our boldness in speaking was the realization
of God as "OUR God."

with much contention--that is, literally, as of competitors in a
contest: striving earnestness ([Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md); [Col
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001).md). But here outward conflict with
persecutors, rather than inward and mental, was what the missionaries
had to endure ([Act 17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005.md); [Phi
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 2:3</span></span>

For--The ground of his "boldness" ([Th1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#002).md), his freedom from all "deceit,
uncleanness, and guile"; guile, before God, deceit (Greek, "imposture"),
towards men (compare [Co2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md); [Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md); [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).md); uncleanness, in relation to
one's self (impure motives of carnal self-gratification in gain, [Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005).md), or lust; such as actuated false
teachers of the Gentiles ([Phi 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md);
[Pe2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#010.md), [Pe2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014.md); [Jde
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008.md); [Rev
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#014).md). So Simon Magus and Cerinthus
taught \[ESTIUS\].

exhortation--The Greek means "consolation" as well as "exhortation." The
same Gospel which exhorts comforts. Its first lesson to each is that of
peace in believing amidst outward and inward sorrows. It comforts them
that mourn (compare [Th1 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011.md); [Isa
61:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md); [Co2
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003).md).

of--springing from--having its source in--deceit, &c.

[1 Thessalonians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 2:4</span></span>

as--according as; even as.

allowed--Greek, "We have been approved on trial," "deemed fit." This
word corresponds to "God which trieth our hearts" below. This approval
as to sincerity depends solely on the grace and mercy of God ([Act
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md); [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md); [Co2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md); [Ti1
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).md).

not as pleasing--not as persons who seek to please men; characteristic
of false teachers ([Gal 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 2:5</span></span>

used we flattering words--literally, "become (that is, have we been
found) in (the use of) language of flattery"; the resource of those who
try to "please men."

as ye know--"Ye know" as to whether I flattered you; as to
"covetousness," GOD, the Judge of the heart, alone can be "my witness."

cloak of--that is, any specious guise under which I might cloak
"covetousness."

[1 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 2:6</span></span>

Literally, "Nor of men (have we been found, [Th1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#005).md) seeking glory." The "of" here
represents a different Greek word from "of" in the clause "of you . . .
of others." ALFORD makes the former (Greek, "ex") express the abstract
ground of the glory; the latter (apo) the concrete object from which it
was to come. The former means "originating from"; the latter means "on
the part of." Many teach heretical novelties, though not for fain, yet
for "glory." Paul and his associates were free even from this motive
\[GROTIUS\], ([Joh 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044).md).

we might have been burdensome--that is, by claiming maintenance ([Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md); [Co2
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009.md); [Co2
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016.md); [Th2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#008).md). As, however, "glory" precedes,
as well as "covetousness," the reference cannot be restricted to the
latter, though I think it is not excluded. Translate, "when we might
have borne heavily upon you," by pressing you with the weight of
self-glorifying authority, and with the burden of our sustenance. Thus
the antithesis is appropriate in the words following, "But we were
gentle (the opposite of pressing weightily) among you" ([Th1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007).md). On weight being connected with
authority, compare Note, see on [Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md), "His letters are weighty" ([Co1
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021).md). ALFORD'S translation, which
excludes reference to his right of claiming maintenance ("when we might
have stood on our dignity"), seems to me disproved by [Th1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md), which uses the same Greek word
unequivocally for "chargeable." Twice he received supplies from Philippi
while at Thessalonica ([Phi 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016).md).

as the apostles--that is, as being apostles.

[1 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 2:7</span></span>

we were--Greek, "we were made" by God's grace.

gentle--Greek, "mild in bearing with the faults of others" \[TITTMANN\];
one, too, who is gentle (though firm) in reproving the erroneous
opinions of others ([Ti2 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024).md). Some
of the oldest manuscripts read, "we became little children" (compare
[Mat 18:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003).md). Others support the
English Version reading, which forms a better antithesis to [Th1
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#006.md), and harmonizes better with what
follows; for he would hardly, in the same sentence, compare himself both
to the "infants" or "little children," and to "a nurse," or rather,
"suckling mother." Gentleness is the fitting characteristic of a nurse.

among you--Greek, "in the midst of you," that is, in our intercourse
with you being as one of yourselves.

nurse--a suckling mother.

her--Greek, "her own children" (compare [Th1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011).md). So [Gal
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 2:8</span></span>

So--to be joined to "we were willing"; "As a nurse cherisheth . . . so
we were willing," &c. \[ALFORD\]. But BENGEL, "So," that is, seeing that
we have such affection for you.

being affectionately desirous--The oldest reading in the Greek implies,
literally, to connect one's self with another; to be closely attached to
another.

willing--The Greek is stronger, "we were well content"; "we would gladly
have imparted," &c. "even our own lives" (so the Greek for "souls" ought
to be translated); as we showed in the sufferings we endured in giving
you the Gospel (Acts 17:1-34). As a nursing mother is ready to impart
not only her milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only
imparted gladly the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our
own lives for your spiritual nourishment, imitating Him who laid down
His life for His friends, the greatest proof of love ([Joh
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013).md).

ye were--Greek, "ye were become," as having become our spiritual
children.

dear--Greek, "dearly beloved."

[1 Thessalonians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 2:9</span></span>

labour and travail--The Greek for "labor" means hardship in bearing;
that for "travail," hardship in doing; the former, toil with the utmost
solicitude; the latter, the being wearied with fatigue \[GROTIUS\].
ZANCHIUS refers the former to spiritual (see [Th1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005).md), the latter to manual labor. I
would translate, "weariness (so the Greek is translated, [Co2
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#027).md) and travail" (hard labor,
toil).

for--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

labouring--Greek, "working," namely, at tent-making ([Act
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003).md).

night and day--The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset, so that
"night" is put before "day" (compare [Act
20:31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031).md). Their labors with their hands
for a scanty livelihood had to be engaged in not only by day, but by
night also, in the intervals between spiritual labors.

because we would not be chargeable--Greek, "with a view to not burdening
any of you" ([Co2 11:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009).md).

preached unto you--Greek, "unto and among you." Though but "three
Sabbaths" are mentioned, [Act 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002.md),
these refer merely to the time of his preaching to the Jews in the
synagogue. When rejected by them as a body, after having converted a few
Jews, he turned to the Gentiles; of these (whom he preached to in a
place distinct from the synagogue) "a great multitude believed" ([Act
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004.md), where the oldest manuscripts
read, "of the devout \[proselytes\] and Greeks a great multitude"); then
after he had, by labors continued among the Gentiles for some time,
gathered in many converts, the Jews, provoked by his success, assaulted
Jason's house, and drove him away. His receiving "once and again"
supplies from Philippi, implies a longer stay at Thessalonica than three
weeks ([Phi 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 2:10</span></span>

Ye are witnesses--as to our outward conduct.

God--as to our inner motives.

holily--towards God.

justly--towards men.

unblamably--in relation to ourselves.

behaved ourselves--Greek, "were made to be," namely, by God.

among you that believe--rather, "before (that is, in the eyes of) you
that believe"; whatever we may have seemed in the eyes of the
unbelieving. As [Th1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md) refers to
their outward occupation in the world; so [Th1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010.md), to their character among
believers.

[1 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 2:11</span></span>

exhorted and comforted--Exhortation leads one to do a thing willingly;
consolation, to do it joyfully \[BENGEL\], ([Th1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#014).md). Even in the former term,
"exhorted," the Greek includes the additional idea of comforting and
advocating one's cause: "encouragingly exhorted." Appropriate in this
case, as the Thessalonians were in sorrow, both through persecutions,
and also through deaths of friends ([Th1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013).md).

charged--"conjured solemnly," literally, "testifying"; appealing
solemnly to you before God.

every one of you--in private ([Act
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#020).md), as well as publicly. The
minister, if he would be useful, must not deal merely in generalities,
but must individualize and particularize.

as a father--with mild gravity. The Greek is, "his own children."

[1 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 2:12</span></span>

worthy of God--"worthy of the Lord" ([Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010).md); "worthily of the saints" ([Rom
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002), Greek.md): ". . . of the Gospel"
([Phi 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#027).md) ". . . of the vocation
wherewith ye are called" ([Eph 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001).md).
Inconsistency would cause God's name to be "blasphemed among the
Gentiles" ([Rom 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024).md). The Greek
article is emphatical, "Worthy of THE God who is calling you."

hath called--So one of the oldest manuscripts and Vulgate. Other oldest
manuscripts, "Who calleth us."

his kingdom--to be set up at the Lord's coming.

glory--that ye may share His glory ([Joh
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022.md); [Col
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 2:13</span></span>

For this cause--Seeing ye have had such teachers ([Th1
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#010).md) \[BENGEL\], "we also (as well
as 'all that believe' in Macedonia and Achaia) thank God without ceasing
('always' . . . 'in our prayers,' [Th1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#002).md), that when ye received the word
of God which ye heard from us (literally, 'God's word of hearing from
us,' [Rom 10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md), ye accepted it
not as the word of men, but, even as it is truly, the word of God."
ALFORD omits the "as" of English Version. But the "as" is required by
the clause, "even as it is truly." "Ye accepted it, not (as) the word of
men (which it might have been supposed to be), but (as) the word of God,
even as it really is." The Greek for the first "received," implies
simply the hearing of it; the Greek of the second is "accepted," or
"welcomed" it. The proper object of faith, it hence appears, is the word
of God, at first oral, then for security against error, written ([Joh
20:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md); [Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md); [Gal
4:30](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#030).md). Also, that faith is the work of
divine grace, is implied by Paul's thanksgiving.

effectually worketh also in you that believe--"Also," besides your
accepting it with your hearts, it evidences itself in your lives. It
shows its energy in its practical effects on you; for instance, working
in you patient endurance in trial ([Th1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md); compare [Gal
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md); [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th1 2:14</span></span>

followers--Greek, "imitators." Divine working is most of all seen and
felt in affliction.

in Judea--The churches of Judea were naturally the patterns to other
churches, as having been the first founded, and that on the very scene
of Christ's own ministry. Reference to them is specially appropriate
here, as the Thessalonians, with Paul and Silas, had experienced from
Jews in their city persecutions ([Act
17:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005).md) similar to those which "the
churches in Judea" experienced from Jews in that country.

in Christ Jesus--not merely "in God"; for the synagogues of the Jews
(one of which the Thessalonians were familiar with, [Act
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001).md) were also in God. But the
Christian churches alone were not only in God, as the Jews in contrast
to the Thessalonian idolaters were, but also in Christ, which the Jews
were not.

of your own countrymen--including primarily the Jews settled at
Thessalonica, from whom the persecution originated, and also the
Gentiles there, instigated by the Jews; thus, "fellow countrymen" (the
Greek term, according to Herodian, implies, not the enduring relation of
fellow citizenship, but sameness of country for the time being),
including naturalized Jews and native Thessalonians, stand in contrast
to the pure "Jews" in Judea ([Mat
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#036).md). It is an undesigned
coincidence, that Paul at this time was suffering persecutions of the
Jews at Corinth, whence he writes ([Act
18:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005.md), [Act
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012).md); naturally his letter would the
more vividly dwell on Jewish bitterness against Christians.

even as they-- ([Heb 10:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032).md). There
was a likeness in respect to the nation from which both suffered,
namely, Jews, and those their own countrymen; in the cause for which,
and in the evils which, they suffered, and also in the steadfast manner
in which they suffered them. Such sameness of fruits, afflictions, and
experimental characteristics of believers, in all places and at all
times, is a subsidiary evidence of the truth of the Gospel.

[1 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th1 2:15</span></span>

the Lord Jesus--rather as Greek, "Jesus THE LORD." This enhances the
glaring enormity of their sin, that in killing Jesus they killed the
LORD (Compare [Act 3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014).md).

their own--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

prophets-- ([Mat 21:33-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033.md); [Mat
23:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031.md); [Luk
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#033).md).

persecuted us--rather as Greek (see Margin), "By persecution drove us
out" ([Luk 11:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#049).md).

please not God--that is, they do not make it their aim to please God. He
implies that with all their boast of being God's peculiar people, they
all the while are "no pleasers of God," as certainly as, by the
universal voice of the world, which even they themselves cannot
contradict, they are declared to be perversely "contrary to all men."
JOSEPHUS \[Against Apion, 2.14\], represents one calling them "Atheists
and Misanthropes, the dullest of barbarians"; and TACITUS \[Histories,
5.5\], "They have a hostile hatred of all other men." However, the
contrariety to all men here meant is, in that they "forbid us to speak
to the Gentiles that they may be saved" ([Th1
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th1 2:16</span></span>

Forbidding--Greek, "Hindering us from speaking," &c.

to fill up their sins alway--Tending thus "to the filling up (the full
measure of, [Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md); [Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023.md); [Mat
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032).md) their sins at all times," that
is, now as at all former times. Their hindrance of the Gospel preaching
to the Gentiles was the last measure added to their continually
accumulating iniquity, which made them fully ripe for vengeance.

for--Greek, "but." "But," they shall proceed no further, for ([Ti2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008).md) "the" divine "wrath has (so the
Greek) come upon (overtaken unexpectedly; the past tense expressing the
speedy certainty of the divinely destined stroke) them to the
uttermost"; not merely partial wrath, but wrath to its full extent,
"even to the finishing stroke" \[EDMUNDS\]. The past tense implies that
the fullest visitation of wrath was already begun. Already in A.D. 48, a
tumult had occurred at the Passover in Jerusalem, when about thirty
thousand (according to some) were slain; a foretaste of the whole
vengeance which speedily followed ([Luk
19:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#043.md); [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th1 2:17</span></span>

But we--resumed from [Th1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md); in
contrast to the Jews, [Th1 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015.md).

taken--rather as Greek, "severed (violently, [Act
17:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007).md) from you," as parents bereft
of their children. So "I will not leave you comfortless," Greek,
"orphanized" ([Joh 14:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#018).md).

for a short time--literally, "for the space of an hour." "When we had
been severed from you but a very short time (perhaps alluding to the
suddenness of his unexpected departure), we the more abundantly (the
shorter was our separation; for the desire of meeting again is the more
vivid, the more recent has been the parting) endeavored," &c. (Compare
[Ti2 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004).md). He does not hereby, as many
explain, anticipate a short separation from them, which would be a false
anticipation; for he did not soon revisit them. The Greek past
participle also forbids their view.

Wherefore--The oldest manuscripts read, "Because," or "Inasmuch as."

we would--Greek, "we wished to come"; we intended to come.

even I Paul--My fellow missionaries as well as myself wished to come; I
can answer for myself that I intended it more than once. His slightly
distinguishing himself here from his fellow missionaries, whom
throughout this Epistle he associates with himself in the plural,
accords with the fact that Silvanus and Timothy stayed at Berea when
Paul went on to Athens; where subsequently Timothy joined him, and was
thence sent by Paul alone to Thessalonica ([Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001).md).

Satan hindered us--On a different occasion "the Holy Ghost, the Spirit
of Jesus" (so the oldest manuscripts read), [Act
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006.md), forbad or hindered them in a
missionary design; here it is Satan, acting perhaps by wicked men, some
of whom had already driven him out of Thessalonica ([Act
17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013.md); compare [Joh
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027).md), or else by some more direct
"messenger of Satan--a thorn in the flesh" ([Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md); compare [Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014).md). In any event, the Holy Ghost
and the providence of God overruled Satan's opposition to further His
own purpose. We cannot, in each case, define whence hindrances in good
undertakings arise; Paul in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to
say; the hindrance was from Satan. GROTIUS thinks Satan's mode of
hindering Paul's journey to Thessalonica was by instigating the Stoic
and Epicurean philosophers to cavil, which entailed on Paul the
necessity of replying, and so detained him; but he seems to have left
Athens leisurely ([Act 17:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#033.md); [Act
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001).md). The Greek for "hindered" is
literally, "to cut a trench between one's self and an advancing foe, to
prevent his progress"; so Satan opposing the progress of the
missionaries.

For--giving the reason for his earnest desire to see them.

Are not even ye in the presence of . . . Christ--"Christ" is omitted in
the oldest manuscripts. Are not even ye (namely, among others; the
"even" or "also," implies that not they alone will be his crown) our
hope, joy, and crown of rejoicing before Jesus, when He shall come ([Co2
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#014.md); [Phi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016.md); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001).md)? The "hope" here meant is his
hope (in a lower sense), that these his converts might be found in
Christ at His advent ([Th1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013).md).
Paul's chief "hope" was JESUS CHRIST ([Ti1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001).md).

[1 Thessalonians 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">th1 2:20</span></span>

Emphatical repetition with increased force. Who but ye and our other
converts are our hope, &c., hereafter, at Christ's coming? For it is ye
who ARE now our glory and joy.
