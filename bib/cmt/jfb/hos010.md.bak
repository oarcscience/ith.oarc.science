### [Hosea Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 10:1</span></span>

ISRAEL'S IDOLATRY, THE SOURCE OF PERJURIES AND UNLAWFUL LEAGUES, SOON
DESTINED TO BE THE RUIN OF THE STATE, THEIR KING AND THEIR IMAGES BEING
ABOUT TO BE CARRIED OFF; A JUST CHASTISEMENT, THE REAPING CORRESPONDING
TO THE SOWING. ([Hos 10:1-15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001).md)

The prophecy was uttered between Shalmaneser's first and second
invasions of Israel. Compare [Hos
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md); also [Hos
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md), referring to Hoshea's calling So
of Egypt to his aid; also [Hos 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md),
[Hos 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md).

empty--stripped of its fruits \[CALVIN\], ([Nah
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002).md); compelled to pay tribute to Pul
([Kg2 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#020).md). MAURER translates, "A
widespreading vine"; so the Septuagint. Compare [Gen
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#022.md); [Psa
80:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#009.md); [Eze
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006.md).

bringeth forth fruit unto himself--not unto ME.

according to . . . multitude of . . . fruit . . . increased . . .
altars--In proportion to the abundance of their prosperity, which called
for fruit unto God (compare [Rom
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022).md), was the abundance of their
idolatry ([Hos 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004.md), [Hos
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#011).md).

[Hosea 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 10:2</span></span>

heart . . . divided-- ([Kg1 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md);
[Mat 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008).md).

now--that is soon.

he--Jehovah.

break down--"cut off," namely the heads of the victims. Those altars,
which were the scene of cutting off the victims' heads, shall be
themselves cut off.

[Hosea 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 10:3</span></span>

now, &c.--Soon they, deprived of their king, shall be reduced to say, We
have no king ([Hos 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md), for Jehovah deprived us of
him, because of our not fearing God. What then (seeing God is against
us) should a king be able to do for us, if we had one? As they rejected
the heavenly King, they were deprived of their earthly king.

[Hosea 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 10:4</span></span>

words--mere empty words.

swearing falsely in making a covenant--breaking their engagement to
Shalmaneser ([Kg2 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004).md), and making a
covenant with So, though covenants with foreigners were forbidden.

judgment . . . as hemlock--that is, divine judgment shall spring up as
rank, and as deadly, as hemlock in the furrows ([Deu
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#018.md); [Amo
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007.md); [Amo
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012).md). GESENIUS translates, "poppy."
GROTIUS, "darnel."

[Hosea 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 10:5</span></span>

fear because of the calves--that is, shall fear for them.

Beth-aven--substituted for Beth-el in contempt ([Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md).

it--singular, the one in Beth-el; after the pattern of which the other
"calves" (plural) were made. "Calves" in the Hebrew is feminine, to
express contempt.

priests--The Hebrew is only used of idolatrous priests ([Kg2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md); [Zep
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004).md), from a root meaning either "the
black garment" in which they were attired; or, "to resound," referring
to their howling cries in their sacred rites \[CALVIN\].

that rejoiced on it--because it was a source of gain to them. MAURER
translates, "Shall leap in trepidation on account of it"; as Baal's
priests did ([Kg1 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#026).md).

the glory thereof--the magnificence of its ornaments and its worship.

[Hosea 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 10:6</span></span>

It . . . also--The calf, so far from saving its worshippers from
deportation, itself shall be carried off; hence "Israel shall be
ashamed" of it.

Jareb--(See on [Hos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013).md). "A present
to the king (whom they looked to as) their defender," or else avenger,
whose wrath they wished to appease, namely, Shalmaneser. The minor
states applied this title to the Great King, as the avenging Protector.

his own counsel--the calves, which Jeroboam set up as a stroke of policy
to detach Israel from Judah. Their severance from Judah and Jehovah
proved now to be not politic, but fatal to them.

[Hosea 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 10:7</span></span>

([Hos 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#003.md), [Hos
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015).md).

foam--denoting short-lived existence and speedy dissolution. As the
foam, though seeming to be eminent raised on the top of the water, yet
has no solidity, such is the throne of Samaria. MAURER translates, "a
chip" or broken branch that cannot resist the current.

[Hosea 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 10:8</span></span>

Aven--that is, Beth-aven.

the sin--that is, the occasion of sin ([Deu
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021.md); [Kg1
12:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030).md).

they shall say to . . . mountains, Cover us--So terrible shall be the
calamity, that men shall prefer death to life ([Luk
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#030.md); [Rev
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#016.md); [Rev
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#006).md). Those very hills on which were
their idolatrous altars (one source of their confidence, as their
"king," [Hos 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#007), was the other.md), so
far from helping them, shall be called on by them to overwhelm them.

[Hosea 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 10:9</span></span>

Gibeah-- ([Hos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009); Jdg. 19:1-20:48.md).
They are singled out as a specimen of the whole nation.

there they stood--The Israelites have, as there and then, so ever since,
persisted in their sin \[CALVIN\]. Or, better, "they stood their
ground," that is, did not perish then \[MAURER\].

the battle . . . did not overtake them--Though God spared you then, He
will not do so now; nay, the battle whereby God punished the Gibeonite
"children of iniquity," shall the more heavily visit you for your
continued impenitence. Though "they stood" then, it shall not be so now.
The change from "thou" to "they" marks God's alienation from them; they
are, by the use of the third person, put to a greater distance from God.

[Hosea 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 10:10</span></span>

my desire . . . chastise--expressing God's strong inclination to
vindicate His justice against sin, as being the infinitely holy God
([Deu 28:63](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063).md).

the people--Foreign invaders "shall be gathered against them."

when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows--image from two
oxen ploughing together side by side, in two contiguous furrows: so the
Israelites shall join themselves, to unite their powers against all
dangers, but it will not save them from My destroying them \[CALVIN\].
Their "two furrows" may refer to their two places of setting up the
calves, their ground of confidence, Dan and Beth-el; or, the two
divisions of the nation, Israel and Judah, "in their two furrows," that
is, in their respective two places of habitation; [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md), which specifies the two, favors
this view. HENDERSON prefers the Keri (Hebrew Margin) "for their two
iniquities"; and translates, "when they are bound" in captivity. English
Version is best, as the image is carried out in [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md); only it is perhaps better to
translate, "the people (the invaders) binding them," that is, making
them captives; and so [Hos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md)
alludes to the yoke being put on the neck of Ephraim and Judah.

[Hosea 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 10:11</span></span>

taught--that is, accustomed.

loveth to tread out . . . corn--a far easier and more self-indulgent
work than ploughing. In treading corn, cattle were not bound together
under a yoke, but either trod it singly with their feet, or drew a
threshing sledge over it ([Isa
28:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#027).md): they were free to eat some
of the corn from time to time, as the law required they should be
unmuzzled ([Deu 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004).md), so that they
grew fat in this work. An image of Israel's freedom, prosperity, and
self-indulgence heretofore. But now God will put the Assyrian yoke upon
her, instead of freedom, putting her to servile work.

I passed over upon--I put the yoke upon.

make . . . to ride--as in [Job 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#022.md);
that is, hurry Ephraim away to a distant region \[CALVIN\]. LYRA
translates, "I will make (the Assyrian) to ride upon Ephraim." MAURER,
"I will make Ephraim to carry," namely, a charioteer.

his clods--"the clods before him."

[Hosea 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 10:12</span></span>

Continuation of the image in [Hos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011.md) ([Pro
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018).md). Act righteously and ye shall
reap the reward; a reward not of debt, but of grace.

in mercy--according to the measure of the divine "mercy," which over and
above repays the goodness or "mercy" which we show to our fellow man
([Luk 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038).md).

break . . . fallow ground--Remove your superstitions and vices, and be
renewed.

seek . . . Lord, fill he come--Though not answered immediately,
persevere unceasingly "till He come."

rain--send down as a copious shower.

righteousness--the reward of righteousness, that is, salvation, temporal
and spiritual ([Sa1 26:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#023.md); compare
[Joe 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023) .md).

[Hosea 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 10:13</span></span>

reaped iniquity--that is, the fruit of iniquity; as "righteousness"
([Hos 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012).md) is "the fruit of
righteousness" ([Job 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#008.md); [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008.md); [Gal
6:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007).md).

lies--false and spurious worship.

trust in thy way--thy perverse way ([Isa
57:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#010.md); [Jer
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#023).md), thy worship of false gods. This
was their internal safeguard, as their external was "the multitude of
their mighty men."

[Hosea 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 10:14</span></span>

tumult--a tumultuous war.

among thy people--literally, "peoples": the war shall extend to the
whole people of Israel, through all the tribes, and the peoples allied
to her.

Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel--that is, Shalmaneser, a compound name, in
which the part common to it and the names of three other Assyrian kings,
is omitted; Tiglath-pileser, Esar-haddon, Shar-ezer. So Jeconiah is
abbreviated to Coniah. Arbel was situated in Naphtali in Galilee, on the
border nearest Assyria. Against it Shalmaneser, at his first invasion of
Israel ([Kg2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md), vented his chief
rage. God threatens Israel's fortresses with the same fate as Arbel
suffered "in the day (on the occasion) of the battle" then well-known,
though not mentioned elsewhere (compare [Kg2
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#034).md). This event, close on the reign
of Hezekiah, shows the inscription of Hosea ([Hos
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md) to be correct.

[Hosea 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 10:15</span></span>

So shall Beth-el do unto you--Your idolatrous calf at Beth-el shall be
the cause of a like calamity befalling you.

your great wickedness--literally, "the wickedness of your wickedness."

in a morning--speedily as quickly as the dawn is put to flight by the
rising sun ([Hos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004.md); [Hos
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md); [Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005).md).

king--Hoshea.
