### [Romans Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md)

[Romans 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 10:1</span></span>

SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED--HOW ISRAEL CAME TO MISS SALVATION, AND THE
GENTILES TO FIND IT. (Rom. 10:1-21)

Brethren, my heart's desire--The word here expresses "entire
complacency," that in which the heart would experience full
satisfaction.

and prayer--"supplication."

to God for Israel--"for them" is the true reading; the subject being
continued from the close of the preceding chapter.

is, that they may be saved--"for their salvation." Having before poured
forth the anguish of his soul at the general unbelief of his nation and
its dreadful consequences ([Rom
9:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001).md), he here expresses in the most
emphatic terms his desire and prayer for their salvation.

[Romans 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 10:2</span></span>

For I bear them record--or, "witness," as he well could from his own sad
experience.

that they have a zeal of--"for"

God, but not according to knowledge--(Compare [Act
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md); [Act
26:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md); [Gal
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013).md). He alludes to this
well-meaning of his people, notwithstanding their spiritual blindness,
not certainly to excuse their rejection of Christ and rage against His
saints, but as some ground of hope regarding them. (See [Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md).

[Romans 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 10:3</span></span>

For they being ignorant of God's righteousness--that is, for the
justification of the guilty (see on [Rom
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md).

and going about--"seeking"

to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God--The apostle views the general rejection of
Christ by the nation as one act.

[Romans 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 10:4</span></span>

For Christ is the end--the object or aim.

of the law for--justifying

righteousness to every one that believeth--that is, contains within
Himself all that the law demands for the justification of such as
embrace Him, whether Jew or Gentile ([Gal
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024).md).

[Romans 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 10:5</span></span>

For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man
that doeth--"hath done"

those things--which it commands.

shall live in them-- ([Lev 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005).md). This
is the one way of justification and life--by "the righteousness which is
of (or, by our own obedience to) the law."

[Romans 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 10:6</span></span>

But the--justifying

righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise--"speaketh
thus"--its language or import is to this effect (quoting in substance
[Deu 30:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#013).md).

Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring
Christ down, &c.--that is, "Ye have not to sigh over the impossibility
of attaining to justification; as if one should say, oh! if I could but
get someone to mount up to heaven and fetch me down Christ, there might
be some hope, but since that cannot be, mine is a desperate case."

[Romans 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 10:7</span></span>

Or, Who shall descend, &c.--another case of impossibility, suggested by
[Pro 30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md), and perhaps also [Amo
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md) --probably proverbial expressions
of impossibility (compare [Psa
139:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md); [Pro
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#007), &c..md).

[Romans 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 10:8</span></span>

But what saith it? It saith--continuing the quotation from [Deu
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#014.md).

The word is nigh thee--easily accessible.

in thy mouth--when thou confessest Him.

and in thine heart--when thou believest on Him. Though it is of the law
which Moses more immediately speaks in the passage quoted, yet it is of
the law as Israel shall be brought to look upon it when the Lord their
God shall circumcise their heart "to love the Lord their God with all
their heart" ([Rom 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md); and thus, in
applying it, the apostle (as OLSHAUSEN truly observes) is not merely
appropriating the language of Moses, but keeping in the line of his
deeper thought.

that is, the word of faith, which we preach--that is, the word which men
have to believe for salvation (compare [Ti1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006).md).

[Romans 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 10:9</span></span>

That if thou shalt, &c.--So understanding the words, the apostle is here
giving the language of the true method of justification; and this sense
we prefer (with CALVIN, BEZA, FERME, LOCKE, JOWETT). But able
interpreters render the words, "For," or "Because if thou shalt," &c.
\[Vulgate, LUTHER, DE WETTE, STUART, PHILIPPI, ALFORD, Revised
Version\]. In this case, these are the apostle's own remarks, confirming
the foregoing statements as to the simplicity of the gospel method of
salvation.

confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus--that is, probably, "If thou shalt
confess Jesus \[to be\] the Lord," which is the proper manifestation or
evidence of faith ([Mat 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032.md); [Jo1
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#015).md). This is put first merely to
correspond with the foregoing quotation--"in thy mouth and in thine
heart." So in [Pe1 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#010.md) the "calling
of believers" is put before their "election," as that which is first
"made sure," although in point of time it comes after it.

and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised--"that God raised"

him from the dead, &c.--(See on [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025).md). In [Rom
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010.md) the two things are placed in
their natural order.

[Romans 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 10:10</span></span>

For with the heart man believeth unto--justifying

righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation--This confession of Christ's name, especially in times of
persecution, and whenever obloquy is attached to the Christian
profession, is an indispensable test of discipleship.

[Romans 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 10:11</span></span>

For the scripture saith--in [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md), a glorious Messianic passage.

Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed--Here, as in [Rom
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md), the quotation is from the
Septuagint, which renders those words of the original, "shall not make
haste" (that is, fly for escape, as from conscious danger), "shall not
be put to shame," which comes to the same thing.

[Romans 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 10:12</span></span>

For there is no difference--or "distinction"

between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord over all--that is, not God (as
CALVIN, GROTIUS, OLSHAUSEN, HODGE), but Christ, as will be seen, we
think, by comparing [Rom 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md), [Rom
10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#012.md) and observing the apostle's
usual style on such subjects. (So CHRYSOSTOM, MELVILLE, BENGEL, MEYER,
DE WETTE, FRITZSCHE, THOLUCK, STUART, ALFORD, PHILIPPI).

is rich--a favorite Pauline term to express the exuberance of that
saving grace which is in Christ Jesus.

unto all that call upon him--This confirms the application of the
preceding words to Christ; since to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus
is a customary expression. (See [Act
7:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md); [Act
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md), [Act
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021.md); [Act
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#016.md); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022).md).

[Romans 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 10:13</span></span>

For--saith the scripture

whosoever--The expression is emphatic, "Everyone whosoever"

shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved-- ([Joe
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#032).md); quoted also by Peter, in his
great Pentecostal sermon ([Act 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#021).md),
with evident application to Christ.

[Romans 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 10:14</span></span>

How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and . .
. believe in him of whom they have not heard? and . . . hear without a
preacher? and . . . preach except . . . sent?--that is, "True, the same
Lord over all is rich unto all alike that call upon Him. But this
calling implies believing, and believing hearing, and hearing preaching,
and preaching a mission to preach: Why, then, take ye it so ill, O
children of Abraham, that in obedience to our heavenly mission ([Act
26:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016).md) we preach among the Gentiles
the unsearchable riches of Christ?"

[Romans 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 10:15</span></span>

as it is written-- ([Isa 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md).

How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace,
&c.--The whole chapter of Isaiah from which this is taken, and the three
that follow, are so richly Messianic, that there can be no doubt "the
glad tidings" there spoken of announce a more glorious release than of
Judah from the Babylonish captivity, and the very feet of its preachers
are called "beautiful" for the sake of their message.

[Romans 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 10:16</span></span>

But they have not all obeyed the gospel--that is, the Scripture hath
prepared us to expect this sad result.

For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?--that is,"Where
shall one find a believer?" The prophet speaks as if next to none would
believe: The apostle softens this into "They have not all believed."

[Romans 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 10:17</span></span>

So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God--"This
is another confirmation of the truth that faith supposes the hearing of
the Word, and this a commission to preach it."

[Romans 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 10:18</span></span>

But I say, Have they not heard?--"Did they not hear?" Can Israel,
through any region of his dispersion, plead ignorance of these glad
tidings?

Yes, verily, their sound went--"their voice went out"

into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world--These
beautiful words are from [Psa 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md).
Whether the apostle quoted them as in their primary intention applicable
to his subject (as OLSHAUSEN, ALFORD, &c.), or only "used scriptural
language to express his own ideas, as is done involuntarily almost by
every preacher in every sermon" \[HODGE\], expositors are not agreed.
But though the latter may seem the more natural since "the rising of the
Sun of righteousness upon the world" ([Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002).md), "the Dayspring from on high
visiting us, giving light to them that sat in darkness, and guiding our
feet into the way of peace" ([Luk
1:78-79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078).md), must have been familiar and
delightful to the apostle's ear, we cannot doubt that the irradiation of
the world with the beams of a better Sun by the universal diffusion of
the Gospel of Christ, must have a mode of speaking quite natural, and to
him scarcely figurative.

[Romans 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 10:19</span></span>

But I say, Did not Israel know?--know, from their own Scriptures, of
God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?

First--that is First in the prophetic line \[DE WETTE\].

Moses saith, &c.--"I will provoke you to jealousy ('against') \[them
that are\] not a nation, and against a nation without understanding will
I anger you" ([Deu 32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md). In this
verse God warns His ancient people that because they had (that is, in
aftertimes would) moved Him to jealousy with their "no-gods," and
provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would move
them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a "no-people," and provoke
them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding.

[Romans 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 10:20</span></span>

But Esaias is very bold, and saith--that is, is still plainer, and goes
even the length of saying.

I was found of them that sought me not--until I sought them.

I was made--"became"

manifest unto them that asked not after me--until the invitation from Me
came to them. That the calling of the Gentiles was meant by these words
of the prophet ([Isa 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001).md) is manifest
from what immediately follows, "I said, Behold Me, behold Me, unto a
nation that was not called by My name."

[Romans 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 10:21</span></span>

But to--rather, "with regard to"

Israel he saith, All day--"All the day"

long I have stretched out my hands--"did I stretch forth"

my hands--the attitude of gracious entreaty.

unto a disobedient and gainsaying people--These words, which immediately
follow the announcement just quoted of the calling of the Gentiles, were
enough to forewarn the Jews both of God's purpose to eject them from
their privileges, in favor of the Gentiles, and of the cause of it on
their own part.

Note, (1) Mere sincerity, and even earnestness in religion--though it
may be some ground of hope for a merciful recovery from error--is no
excuse, and will not compensate, for the deliberate rejection of saving
truth, when in the providence of God presented for acceptance ([Rom
10:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001.md); and see on [Rom
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007), Note 7). (2.md) The true cause of
such rejection of saving truth, by the otherwise sincere, is the
prepossession of the mind by some false notions of its own. So long as
the Jews "sought to set up their own righteousness," it was in the
nature of things impossible that they should "submit themselves to the
righteousness of God"; the one of these two methods of acceptance being
in the teeth of the other ([Rom 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003).md).
(3) The essential terms of salvation have in every age been the same:
"Whosoever will" is invited to "take of the water of life freely," [Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md) ([Rom
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#013)). (4.md) How will the remembrance
of the simplicity, reasonableness, and absolute freeness of God's plan
of salvation overwhelm those that perish from under the sound of it
([Rom 10:4-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004)). (5.md) How piercingly and
perpetually should that question--"HOW SHALL THEY HEAR WITHOUT A
PREACHER?"--sound in the ears of all churches, as but the apostolic echo
of their Lord's parting injunction, "PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY
CREATURE" ([Mar 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015).md), and how far
below the proper standard of love, zeal, and self-sacrifice must the
churches as yet be, when with so plenteous a harvest the laborers are
yet so few ([Mat 9:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037).md), and that
cry from the lips of pardoned, gifted, consecrated men--"Here am I, send
me" ([Isa 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#008).md), is not heard
everywhere ([Rom 10:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014))! (6.md) The
blessing of a covenant relation to God is the irrevocable privilege of
no people and no Church; it can be preserved only by fidelity, on our
part, to the covenant itself ([Rom
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019)). (7.md) God is often found by
those who apparently are the farthest from Him, while He remains
undiscovered by those who think themselves the nearest ([Rom
10:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020)). (8.md) God's dealings even
with reprobate sinners are full of tenderness and compassion; all the
day long extending the arms of His mercy even to the disobedient and
gainsaying. This will be felt and acknowledged at last by all who
perish, to the glory of God's forbearance and to their own confusion
([Rom 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#021).md).
