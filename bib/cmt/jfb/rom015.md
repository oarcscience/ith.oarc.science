### [Romans Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001)

[Romans 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 15:1</span></span>

SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED AND CONCLUDED. ([Rom
15:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001))

We then that are strong--on such points as have been discussed, the
abolition of the Jewish distinction of meats and days under the Gospel.
See on [Rom 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014); [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020).

ought . . . not to please ourselves--ought to think less of what we may
lawfully do than of how our conduct will affect others.

[Romans 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 15:2</span></span>

Let every one of us--lay himself out to

please his neighbour--not indeed for his mere gratification, but

for his good--with a view

to his edification.

[Romans 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 15:3</span></span>

For even Christ pleased not--lived not to please

himself; but, as it is written-- ([Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)).

The reproaches, &c.--see [Mar
10:42-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042).

[Romans 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 15:4</span></span>

For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning--"instruction"

through, &c.--"through the comfort and the patience of the Scriptures"

might have hope--that is, "Think not that because such portions of
Scripture relate immediately to Christ, they are inapplicable to you;
for though Christ's sufferings, as a Saviour, were exclusively His own,
the motives that prompted them, the spirit in which they were endured,
and the general principle involved in His whole work--self-sacrifice for
the good of others--furnish our most perfect and beautiful model; and so
all Scripture relating to these is for our instruction; and since the
duty of forbearance, the strong with the weak, requires 'patience,' and
this again needs 'comfort,' all those Scriptures which tell of patience
and consolation, particularly of the patience of Christ, and of the
consolation which sustained Him under it, are our appointed and
appropriate nutriment, ministering to us 'hope' of that blessed day when
these shall no more be needed." See on [Rom
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#007), Note 7. (For the same connection
between "patience and hope" see on [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012), and [Th1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003)).

[Romans 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 15:5</span></span>

Now the God of patience and consolation--Such beautiful names of God are
taken from the graces which He inspires: as "the God of hope" ([Rom
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013)), "the God of peace" ([Rom
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033)).

grant you to be likeminded--"of the same mind"

according to Christ Jesus--It is not mere unanimity which the apostle
seeks for them; for unanimity in evil is to be deprecated. But it is
"according to Christ Jesus"--after the sublimest model of Him whose
all-absorbing desire was to do, "not His own will, but the will of Him
that sent Him" ([Joh 6:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038)).

[Romans 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 15:6</span></span>

That, &c.--rather, "that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; the mind and the mouth of
all giving harmonious glory to His name. What a prayer! And shall this
never be realized on earth?

[Romans 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 15:7</span></span>

Wherefore--returning to the point

receive ye one another . . . to the glory of God--If Christ received us,
and bears with all our weaknesses, well may we receive and compassionate
one with another, and by so doing God will be glorified.

[Romans 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 15:8</span></span>

Now--"For" is the true reading: the apostle is merely assigning an
additional motive to Christian forbearance.

I say that Jesus Christ was--"hath become"

a minister of the circumcision--a remarkable expression, meaning "the
Father's Servant for the salvation of the circumcision (or, of Israel)."

for the truth of God--to make good the veracity of God towards His
ancient people.

to confirm the--Messianic

promises made unto the fathers--To cheer the Jewish believers, whom he
might seem to have been disparaging, and to keep down Gentile pride, the
apostle holds up Israel's salvation as the primary end of Christ's
mission. But next after this, Christ was sent.

[Romans 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 15:9</span></span>

that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy--A number of
quotations from the Old Testament here follow, to show that God's plan
of mercy embraced, from the first, the Gentiles along with the Jews.

as it is written-- ([Psa 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049)).

I will confess to--that is, glorify

thee among the Gentiles.

[Romans 15:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 15:10</span></span>

And again-- ([Deu 32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043), though there
is some difficulty in the Hebrew).

Rejoice, ye Gentiles--along

with his people--Israel.

[Romans 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 15:11</span></span>

And again-- ([Psa 117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001)).

Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye
people--"peoples"--the various nations outside the pale of Judaism.

[Romans 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 15:12</span></span>

And again, Esaias saith-- ([Isa
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)).

There shall be a--"the"

root of Jesse--meaning, not "He from whom Jesse sprang," but "He that is
sprung from Jesse" (that is, Jesse's son David)--see [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016).

and he that shall rise, &c.--So the Septuagint in substantial, though
not verbal, agreement with the original.

[Romans 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 15:13</span></span>

Now, &c.--This seems a concluding prayer, suggested by the whole
preceding subject matter of the epistle.

the God of hope--(See on [Rom 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005)).

fill you with all joy and peace in believing--the native truth of that
faith which is the great theme of this epistle (compare [Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)).

that ye may abound in hope--"of the glory of God." (See on [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)).

through the power of the Holy Ghost--to whom, in the economy of
redemption, it belongs to inspire believers with all gracious
affections.

On the foregoing portion, Note, (1) No Christian is at liberty to regard
himself as an isolated disciple of the Lord Jesus, having to decide
questions of duty and liberty solely with reference to himself. As
Christians are one body in Christ, so the great law of love binds them
to act in all things with tenderness and consideration for their
brethren in "the common salvation" ([Rom
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001)). (2) Of this unselfishness
CHRIST is the perfect model of all Christians ([Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003)). (3) Holy Scripture is the
divine storehouse of all furniture for the Christian life, even in its
most trying and delicate features ([Rom
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)). (4) The harmonious
glorification of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ by the
whole body of the redeemed, as it is the most exalted fruit of the
scheme of redemption, so it is the last end of God in it ([Rom
15:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005)).

[Romans 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 15:14</span></span>

CONCLUSION: IN WHICH THE APOSTLE APOLOGIZES FOR THUS WRITING TO THE
ROMAN CHRISTIANS, EXPLAINS WHY HE HAD NOT YET VISITED THEM, ANNOUNCES
HIS FUTURE PLANS, AND ASKS THEIR PRAYERS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THEM.
(Rom. 15:14-33)

And, &c.--rather, "Now I am persuaded, my brethren, even I myself,
concerning you"

that ye also yourselves are full of goodness--of inclination to all I
have been enjoining on you

filled with all knowledge--of the truth expounded

and able--without my intervention.

to admonish one another.

[Romans 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 15:15</span></span>

Nevertheless, I have written the more boldly unto you in some
sort--"measure"

as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of
God--as an apostle of Jesus Christ.

[Romans 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 15:16</span></span>

that I should be the--rather, "a"

minister--The word here used is commonly employed to express the office
of the priesthood, from which accordingly the figurative language of the
rest of the verse is taken.

of Jesus Christ--"Christ Jesus," according to the true reading.

to the Gentiles--a further proof that the Epistle was addressed to a
Gentile church. (See on [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013)).

ministering the gospel of God--As the word here is a still more priestly
one, it should be rendered, "ministering as a priest in the Gospel of
God."

that the offering up of the Gentiles--as an oblation to God, in their
converted character.

might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost--the end to
which the ancient offerings typically looked.

[Romans 15:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 15:17</span></span>

I have therefore whereof I may glory--or (adding the article, as the
reading seems to be), "I have my glorying."

through--"in"

Christ Jesus in those things which pertain to God--the things of the
ministry committed to me of God.

[Romans 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 15:18</span></span>

For I will not dare to speak of any--"to speak aught"

of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me--a modest, though
somewhat obscure form of expression, meaning, "I will not dare to go
beyond what Christ hath wrought by me"--in which form accordingly the
rest of the passage is expressed. Observe here how Paul ascribes all the
success of his labors to the activity of the living Redeemer, working in
and by him.

by word and deed--by preaching and working; which latter he explains in
the next clause.

[Romans 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 15:19</span></span>

Through mighty--literally, "in the power of"

signs and wonders--that is, glorious miracles.

by the power of the Spirit of God--"the Holy Ghost," as the true reading
seems to be. This seems intended to explain the efficacy of the word
preached, as well as the working of the miracles which attested it.

so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto--"as far as"

Illyricum--to the extreme northwestern boundary of Greece. It
corresponds to the modern Croatia and Dalmatia ([Ti2
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)). See [Act
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001).

I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

[Romans 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 15:20</span></span>

Yea, &c.--rather, "Yet making it my study (compare [Co2
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009); [Th1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#011), Greek) so to preach the Gospel,
not where Christ was \[already\] named, that I might not build upon
another man's foundation: but (might act) as it is written, To whom no
tidings of Him came, they shall see," &c.

[Romans 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 15:22</span></span>

For which cause--"Being so long occupied with this missionary work, I
have been much (or, 'for the most part') hindered," &c. (See on [Rom
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009).)

[Romans 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 15:23</span></span>

But now having no more place--"no longer having place"--that is,
unbroken ground, where Christ has not been preached.

and having a great desire--"a longing"

these many years to come unto you--(as before, see on [Rom
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)).

[Romans 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 15:24</span></span>

whensoever I take my journey into Spain--Whether this purpose was ever
accomplished has been much disputed, as no record of it nor allusion to
it anywhere occurs. Those who think our apostle was never at large after
his first imprisonment at Rome will of course hold that it never was;
while those who are persuaded, as we are, that he underwent a second
imprisonment, prior to which he was at large for a considerable time
after his first, incline naturally to the other opinion.

I will come to you--If these words were not originally in the text, and
there is weighty evidence against them, they must at least be inserted
as a necessary supplement.

in my journey, &c.--"as I pass through by you, to be set forward on my
journey thither, if first I be somewhat filled with your company": that
is, "I should indeed like to stay longer with you than I can hope to do,
but I must, to some extent at least, have my fill of your company."

[Romans 15:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 15:25</span></span>

But now I go to Jerusalem to minister--"ministering"

to the saints--in the sense immediately to be explained.

[Romans 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 15:26</span></span>

For, &c.--better, "For Macedonia and Achaia have thought good to make a
certain contribution for the poor of the saints which are at Jerusalem."
(See [Act 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017)). "They have thought
it good; and their debtors verily they are"; that is, "And well they
may, considering what the Gentile believers owe to their Jewish
brethren."

[Romans 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 15:27</span></span>

For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
their duty is also--"they owe it also"

to minister unto them in carnal things--(Compare [Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011); [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006); and see [Luk
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#004); [Act
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#002)).

[Romans 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 15:28</span></span>

When therefore I have . . . sealed--that is, delivered over safely

to them this fruit--of the faith and love of the Gentile converts

I will come--"come back," or "return"

by you into Spain--(See on [Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024)).

[Romans 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 15:29</span></span>

And I am sure--"I know"

that . . . I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ--Such,
beyond all doubts, is the true reading, the words "of the gospel" being
in hardly any manuscripts of antiquity and authority. Nor was the
apostle mistaken in this confidence, though his visit to Rome was in
very different circumstances from what he expected. See Acts 28:16-31.

[Romans 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 15:30</span></span>

Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for
the love of the Spirit--or, "by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love
of the Spirit"--not the love which the Spirit bears to us, but that love
which He kindles in the hearts of believers towards each other; that is
"By that Saviour whose name is alike dear to all of us and whose
unsearchable riches I live only to proclaim, and by that love one to
another which the blessed Spirit diffuses through all the brotherhood,
making the labors of Christ's servants a matter of common interest to
all--I beseech you."

that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me--implying
that he had his grounds for anxious fear in this matter.

[Romans 15:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">rom 15:31</span></span>

That I may be delivered from them that do not believe--"that do not
obey," that is, the truth, by believing it; as in [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008).

in Judea--He saw the storm that was gathering over him in Judea, which,
if at all, would certainly burst upon his head when he reached the
capital; and the event too clearly showed the correctness of these
apprehensions.

and that my service which I have for Jerusalem--(See on [Rom
15:25-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#025)).

may be accepted of--"prove acceptable to"

the saints--Nor was he without apprehension lest the opposition he had
made to the narrow jealousy of the Jewish converts against the free
reception of their Gentile brethren, should make this gift of theirs to
the poor saints at Jerusalem less welcome than it ought to be. He would
have the Romans therefore to join him in wrestling with God that this
gift might be gratefully received, and prove a cement between the two
parties. But further.

[Romans 15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 15:32</span></span>

That I may come unto you with--"in"

joy by the will of God-- ([Act 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#021);
[Co1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019); [Co1
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007); [Heb
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#003); [Jam
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015))

and may with you be refreshed--rather, "with you refresh myself," after
all his labors and anxieties, and so be refitted for future service.

[Romans 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 15:33</span></span>

Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen--The peace here sought is to
be taken in its widest sense: the peace of reconciliation to God, first,
"through the blood of the everlasting covenant" ([Heb
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#020); [Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Th2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016); [Phi
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#009)); then the peace which that
reconciliation diffuses among all the partakers of it ([Co1
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033); [Co2
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#011); and see on [Rom
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020)); more widely still, that peace
which the children of God, in beautiful imitation of their Father in
Heaven, are called and privileged to diffuse far and wide through this
sin-distracted and divided world ([Rom
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018); [Mat
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009); [Heb
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018)).

Note, (1) Did "the chiefest of the apostles" apologize for writing to a
Christian church which he had never seen, and a church that he was
persuaded was above the need of it, save to "stir up their pure minds by
way of remembrance" ([Pe2 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013); [Pe2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001)); and did he put even this upon
the sole plea of apostolic responsibility ([Rom
15:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014))? What a contrast is thus
presented to hierarchical pride, and in particular to the affected
humility of the bishop of this very Rome! How close the bond which the
one spirit draws between ministers and people--how wide the separation
produced by the other! (2) There is in the Christian Church no real
priesthood, and none but figurative sacrifices. Had it been otherwise,
it is inconceivable that [Rom 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016)
should have been expressed as it is. Paul's only priesthood and
sacrificial offerings lay, first, in ministering to them as "the apostle
of the Gentiles," not the sacrament with the "real presence" of Christ
in it, or the sacrifice of the mass, but "the Gospel of God," and then,
when gathered under the wing of Christ, presenting them to God as a
grateful offering, "being sanctified \[not by sacrificial gifts, but\]
by the Holy Ghost." (See [Heb
13:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#009)). (3) Though the debt we owe
to those by whom we have been brought to Christ can never be discharged,
we should feel it a privilege when we render them any lower benefit in
return ([Rom 15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026)). (4) Formidable
designs against the truth and the servants of Christ should, above all
other ways of counteracting them, be met by combined prayer to Him who
rules all hearts and controls all events; and the darker the cloud, the
more resolutely should all to whom Christ's cause is dear "strive
together in their prayers to God" for the removal of it ([Rom
15:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#030)). (5) Christian fellowship is
so precious that the most eminent servants of Christ, amid the toils and
trials of their work, find it refreshing and invigorating; and it is no
good sign of any ecclesiastic, that he deems it beneath him to seek and
enjoy it even amongst the humblest saints in the Church of Christ ([Rom
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024), [Rom
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032)).
