### [Luke Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md)

[Luke 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 2:1</span></span>

BIRTH OF CHRIST. ([Luk 2:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001).md)

CÃ&brvbr;sar Augustus--the first of the Roman emperors.

all the world--so the vast Roman Empire was termed.

taxed--enrolled, or register themselves.

[Luke 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 2:2</span></span>

first . . . when Cyrenius, &c.--a very perplexing verse, inasmuch as
Cyrenius, or Quirinus, appears not to have been governor of Syria for
about ten years after the birth of Christ, and the "taxing" under his
administration was what led to the insurrection mentioned in [Act
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md). That there was a taxing,
however, of the whole Roman Empire under Augustus, is now admitted by
all; and candid critics, even of skeptical tendency, are ready to allow
that there is not likely to be any real inaccuracy in the statement of
our Evangelist. Many superior scholars would render the words thus,
"This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria"--as
the word "first" is rendered in [Joh
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015.md); [Joh
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018.md). In this case, of course, the
difficulty vanishes. But it is perhaps better to suppose, with others,
that the registration may have been ordered with a view to the taxation,
about the time of our Lord's birth, though the taxing itself--an
obnoxious measure in Palestine--was not carried out till the time of
Quirinus.

[Luke 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 2:3</span></span>

went . . . to his own city--the city of his extraction, according to the
Jewish custom, not of his abode, which was the usual Roman method.

[Luke 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 2:4</span></span>

Not only does Joseph, who was of the royal line, go to Bethlehem ([Sa1
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001).md), but Mary too--not from choice
surely in her condition, but, probably, for personal enrollment, as
herself an heiress.

[Luke 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 2:5</span></span>

espoused wife--now, without doubt, taken home to him, as related in [Mat
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md); [Mat
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#006.md).

[Luke 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 2:6</span></span>

while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be
delivered--Mary had up to this time been living at the wrong place for
Messiah's birth. A little longer stay at Nazareth, and the prophecy
would have failed. But lo! with no intention certainly on her part, much
less of CÃ&brvbr;sar Augustus, to fulfil the prophecy, she is brought
from Nazareth to Bethlehem, and at that nick of time her period arrives,
and her Babe is born ([Psa 118:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023).md).
"Every creature walks blindfold; only He that dwells in light knows
whether they go" \[BISHOP HALL\].

[Luke 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 2:7</span></span>

first-born--So [Mat 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025.md); yet the law,
in speaking of the first-born, regardeth not whether any were born after
or no, but only that none were born before \[LIGHTFOOT\].

wrapt him . . . laid him--The mother herself did so. Had she then none
to help her? It would seem so ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md).

a manger--the manger, the bench to which the horses' heads were tied, on
which their food could rest \[WEBSTER and WILKINSON\].

no room in the inn--a square erection, open inside, where travellers put
up, and whose rear parts were used as stables. The ancient tradition,
that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with
this, the country being rocky. In Mary's condition the journey would be
a slow one, and ere they arrived, the inn would be fully
occupied--affecting anticipation of the reception He was throughout to
meet with ([Joh 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011).md).

Wrapt in His swaddling--bands,

And in His manger laid,

The hope and glory of all lands

Is come to the world's aid.

No peaceful home upon His cradle smiled,

Guests rudely went and came where slept the royal Child.

KEBLE

But some "guests went and came" not "rudely," but reverently. God sent
visitors of His own to pay court to the new-born King.

[Luke 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 2:8</span></span>

ANGELIC ANNUNCIATION TO THE SHEPHERDS--THEIR VISIT TO THE NEWBORN BABE.
([Luk 2:8-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008).md)

abiding in the fields--staying there, probably in huts or tents.

watch . . . by night--or, night watches, taking their turn of watching.
From about passover time in April until autumn, the flocks pastured
constantly in the open fields, the shepherds lodging there all that
time. (From this it seems plain that the period of the year usually
assigned to our Lord's birth is too late). Were these shepherds chosen
to have the first sight of the blessed Babe without any respect of their
own state of mind? That, at least, is not God's way. "No doubt, like
Simeon ([Luk 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025).md), they were among
the waiters for the Consolation of Israel" \[OLSHAUSEN\]; and, if the
simplicity of their rustic minds, their quiet occupation, the stillness
of the midnight hours, and the amplitude of the deep blue vault above
them for the heavenly music which was to fill their ear, pointed them
out as fit recipients for the first tidings of an Infant Saviour, the
congenial meditations and conversations by which, we may suppose, they
would beguile the tedious hours would perfect their preparation for the
unexpected visit. Thus was Nathanael engaged, all alone but not unseen,
under the fig tree, in unconscious preparation for his first interview
with Jesus. (See on [Joh 1:48](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048).md). So was
the rapt seer on his lonely rock "in the spirit on the Lord's Day,"
little thinking that this was his preparation for hearing behind him the
trumpet voice of the Son of man ([Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010), &c..md). But if the shepherds in
His immediate neighborhood had the first, the sages from afar had the
next sight of the new-born King. Even so still, simplicity first,
science next, finds its way to Christ, whom

In quiet ever and in shade

Shepherds and Sage may find--

They, who have bowed untaught to Nature's sway,

And they, who follow Truth along her star-pav'd way.

glory of the Lord--"the brightness or glory which is represented as
encompassing all heavenly visions" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

sore afraid--So it ever was ([Dan
10:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#007.md); [Luk
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#012.md); [Rev
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017).md). Men have never felt easy with
the invisible world laid suddenly open to their gaze. It was never meant
to be permanent; a momentary purpose was all it was intended to serve.

[Luke 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 2:10</span></span>

afterwards opened up to the whole world. (See on [Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 2:11</span></span>

unto you is born--you shepherds, Israel, mankind \[BENGEL\]. Compare
[Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md), "Unto us a Child is born."
It is a birth--"The Word is made flesh" ([Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). When? "This day." Where? "In
the city of David"--in the right line and at the right "spot"; where
prophecy bade us look for Him, and faith accordingly expected Him. How
dear to us should be these historic moorings of our faith! With the loss
of them, all substantial Christianity is lost. By means of them how many
have been kept from making shipwreck, and attained to a certain external
admiration of Him, ere yet they have fully "beheld His glory."

a Saviour--not One who shall be a Saviour, but "born a Saviour."

Christ the Lord--"magnificent appellation!" \[BENGEL\]. "This is the
only place where these words come together; and I see no way of
understanding this "Lord" but as corresponding to the Hebrew JEHOVAH"
\[ALFORD\].

[Luke 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 2:12</span></span>

a sign--"the sign."

the babe--"a Babe."

a manger--"the manger." The sign was to consist, it seems, solely in the
overpowering contrast between the things just said of Him and the lowly
condition in which they would find Him--Him whose goings forth have been
from of old, from everlasting, "ye shall find a Babe"; whom the heaven
of heavens cannot contain, "wrapt in swaddling bands"; the "Saviour,
Christ the Lord," lying in a manger! Thus early were these amazing
contrasts, which are His chosen style, held forth. (See [Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)..md)

[Luke 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013.md)

and should be regarded on earth.

[Luke 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 2:14</span></span>

Glory, &c.--brief but transporting hymn--not only in articulate human
speech, for our benefit, but in tunable measure, in the form of a Hebrew
parallelism of two complete clauses, and a third one only amplifying the
second, and so without a connecting "and." The "glory to God," which the
new-born "Saviour" was to bring, is the first note of this sublime hymn:
to this answers, in the second clause, the "peace on earth," of which He
was to be "the Prince" ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md)
--probably sung responsively by the celestial choir; while quickly
follows the glad echo of this note, probably by a third detachment of
the angelic choristers--"good will to men." "They say not, glory to God
in heaven, where angels are, but, using a rare expression, "in the
highest \[heavens\]," whither angels aspire not," ([Heb
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md) \[BENGEL\]. "Peace" with God is
the grand necessity of a fallen world. To bring in this, and all other
peace in its train, was the prime errand of the Saviour to this earth,
and, along with it, Heaven's whole "good will to men"--the divine
complacency on a new footing--descends to rest upon men, as upon the Son
Himself, in whom God is "well-pleased." ([Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017), the same word as here..md)

[Luke 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 2:15</span></span>

Let us go, &c.--lovely simplicity of devoutness and faith this! They are
not taken up with the angels, the glory that invested them, and the
lofty strains with which they filled the air. Nor do they say, Let us go
and see if this be true--they have no misgivings. But "Let us go and see
this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto
us." Does not this confirm the view given on [Luk
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md) of the spirit of these humble men?

[Luke 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 2:16</span></span>

the angels ([Luk 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#013).md), and in [Luk
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#037.md), and [Luk
24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md), leads us to suppose that theirs
was a song too, probably some canticle from the Psalter--meet vehicle
for the swelling emotions of their simple hearts at what "they had heard
and seen."

[Luke 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">luk 2:22</span></span>

PURIFICATION OF THE VIRGIN--PRESENTATION OF THE BABE IN THE TEMPLE-SCENE
THERE WITH SIMEON AND ANNA. (Luke 2:22-40)

her purification--Though the most and best copies read "their," it was
the mother only who needed purifying from the legal uncleanness of
childbearing. "The days" of this purification for a male child were
forty in all ([Lev 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md), [Lev
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004).md), on the expiry of which the
mother was required to offer a lamb for a burnt offering, and a turtle
dove or a young pigeon for a sin offering. If she could not afford a
lamb, the mother had to bring another turtle dove or young pigeon; and,
if even this was beyond her means, then a portion of fine flour, but
without the usual fragrant accompaniments of oil and frankincense, as it
represented a sin offering ([Lev
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006.md); [Lev
5:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007).md). From the intermediate
offering of "a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons," we gather
that Joseph and the Virgin were in poor circumstances ([Co2
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009).md), though not in abject poverty.
Being a first-born male, they "bring him to Jerusalem, to present him to
the Lord." All such had been claimed as "holy to the Lord," or set apart
to sacred uses, in memory of the deliverance of the first-born of Israel
from destruction in Egypt, through the sprinkling of blood ([Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002).md). In lieu of these, however, one
whole tribe, that of Levi, was accepted, and set apart to occupations
exclusively sacred (Num. 3:11-38); and whereas there were two hundred
seventy-three fewer Levites than first-born of all Israel on the first
reckoning, each of these first-born was to be redeemed by the payment of
five shekels, yet not without being "presented (or brought) unto the
Lord," in token of His rightful claim to them and their service ([Num
3:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044.md); [Num
18:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015).md). It was in obedience to this
"law of Moses," that the Virgin presented her babe unto the Lord, "in
the east gate of the court called Nicanor's Gate, where she herself
would be sprinkled by the priest with the blood of her sacrifice"
\[LIGHTFOOT\]. By that Babe, in due time, we were to be redeemed, "not
with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Christ" ([Pe1 1:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018).md), and the
consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of her with
the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding realization in
the "living sacrifice" of the Christian mother herself, in the fulness
of a "heart sprinkled from an evil conscience," by "the blood which
cleanseth from all sin."

[Luke 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md)

unhesitating certainty, the promised Messiah, without needing Mary to
inform him of what had happened to her. \[OLSHAUSEN\]. The remarkable
act of taking the babe in his arms must not be overlooked. It was as if
he said, "This is all my salvation and all my desire" ([Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005).md).

Master's word of command to "depart."

Christ Jesus," who never saw in Him "God's Salvation." This estimate of
an object of sight, an unconscious, helpless babe, was pure faith. He
"beheld His glory" ([Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014).md). In
another view it was prior faith rewarded by present sight.

kingdom of Christ than that of Zacharias, though the kingdom they sing
of is one.

fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken
against--Perhaps the former of these phrases expresses the two stages of
temporary "fall of many in Israel" through unbelief, during our Lord's
earthly career, and the subsequent "rising again" of the same persons
after the effusion of the Spirit at pentecost threw a new light to them
on the whole subject; while the latter clause describes the determined
enemies of the Lord Jesus. Such opposite views of Christ are taken from
age to age.

deep share of the struggles and sufferings which this Babe is to

cross, and her desolate condition thereafter, but to dreadful
alternations of faith and unbelief, of hope and fear regarding Him,
which she would have to pass through.

years, she could not at this time be less than a hundred three years
old.

day, and even during the night services of the temple watchmen ([Psa
134:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001).md), "serving God with fastings
and prayer." (See [Ti1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md), suggested

found "standing by," as Simeon's testimony to the blessed Babe died
away, ready to take it up "in turn" (as the word rendered "likewise"
here means).

to all them, &c.--the sense is, "to all them in Jerusalem that were
looking for redemption"--saying in effect, In that Babe are wrapt up all
your expectations. If this was at the hour of prayer, when numbers
flocked to the temple, it would account for her having such an audience
as the words imply \[ALFORD\].

visit of the Magi, with the flight into and return from Egypt ([Mat

to the circumcision and presentation of Christ in the temple, here
recorded. It is perhaps best to leave this in the obscurity in which we
find it, as the result of two independent, though if we knew all, easily
reconcilable narratives.

2:41-52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#041).md)

went up--"were wont to go." Though males only were required to go up to
Jerusalem at the three annual festivals ([Exo
23:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014).md), devout women, when family
duties permitted, went also, as did Hannah ([Sa1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007).md), and, as we here see, the mother
of Jesus.

when twelve years old--At this age every Jewish boy was styled "a son of
the law," being put under a course of instruction and trained to fasting
and attendance on public worship, besides being set to learn a trade. At
this age accordingly our Lord is taken up for the first time to
Jerusalem, at the passover season, the chief of the three annual
festivals. But oh, with what thoughts and feelings must this Youth have
gone up! Long ere He beheld it, He had doubtless "loved the habitation
of God's house and the place where His honor dwelt" ([Psa
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008).md), a love nourished, we may be
sure, by that "word hid in His heart," with which in afterlife He showed
so perfect a familiarity. As the time for His first visit approached,
could one's ear have caught the breathings of His young soul, he might
have heard Him whispering, "As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
so panteth my soul after Thee, O God. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob. I was glad when they said unto me,
Let us go unto the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy
gates, O Jerusalem!" ([Psa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md); [Psa
87:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002.md); [Psa
122:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001).md). On catching the first view
of "the city of their solemnities," and high above all in it, "the place
of God's rest," we hear Him saying to Himself, "Beautiful for situation,
the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the
city of the great King: Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God doth
shine" ([Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002.md); [Psa
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002).md). Of His feelings or actions
during all the eight days of the feast not a word is said. As a devout
child, in company with its parents, He would go through the services,
keeping His thoughts to Himself. But methinks I hear Him, after the
sublime services of that feast, saying to Himself, "He brought me to the
banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. I sat down under his
shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste" ([Sol
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003).md).

[Luke 2:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#043.md)

as they returned--If the duties of life must give place to worship,
worship, in its turn, must give place to them. Jerusalem is good, but
Nazareth is good, too; let him who neglects the one, on pretext of
attending to the other, ponder this scene.

tarried behind . . . Joseph and his mother knew not--Accustomed to the
discretion and obedience of the lad \[OLSHAUSEN\], they might be thrown
off their guard.

[Luke 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 2:44</span></span>

sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances--On these sacred
journeys, whole villages and districts travelled in groups together,
partly for protection, partly for company; and as the well-disposed
would beguile the tediousness of the way by good discourse, to which the
child Jesus would be no silent listener, they expect to find Him in such
a group.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 2:45</span></span>

After three sorrowing days, they find Him still in Jerusalem, not gazing
on its architecture, or surveying its forms of busy life, but in the
temple--not the "sanctuary" (as in [Luk
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009).md), to which only the priests had
access, but in some one of the enclosures around it, where the rabbins,
or "doctors," taught their scholars.

[Luke 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 2:46</span></span>

hearing . . . asking--The method of question and answer was the
customary form of rabbinical teaching; teacher and learner becoming by
turns questioner and answerer, as may be seen from their extant works.
This would give full scope for all that "astonished them in His
understanding and answers." Not that He assumed the office of
teaching--"His hour" for that "was not yet come," and His equipment for
that was not complete; for He had yet to "increase in wisdom" as well as
"stature" ([Luk 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052).md). In fact, the
beauty of Christ's example lies very much in His never at one stage of
His life anticipating the duties of another. All would be in the style
and manner of a learner, "opening His mouth and panting." "His soul
breaking for the longing that it had unto God's judgments at all times"
([Psa 119:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020).md), and now more than ever
before, when finding Himself for the first time in His Father's house.
Still there would be in His questions far more than in their answers;
and if we may take the frivolous interrogatories with which they
afterwards plied Him, about the woman that had seven husbands and such
like, as a specimen of their present drivelling questions, perhaps we
shall not greatly err, if we suppose that "the questions" which He now
"asked them" in return were just the germs of those pregnant questions
with which He astonished and silenced them in after years: "What think
ye of Christ? Whose Son is He? If David call Him Lord, how is He then
his Son?" "Which is the first and great commandment?" "Who is my
neighbour?"

[Luke 2:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 2:49</span></span>

about my Father's business--literally, "in" or "at My Fathers," that is,
either "about My Father's affairs," or "in My Father's courts"--where He
dwells and is to be found--about His hand, so to speak. This latter
shade of meaning, which includes the former, is perhaps the true one,
Here He felt Himself at home, breathing His own proper air. His words
convey a gentle rebuke of their obtuseness in requiring Him to explain
this. "Once here, thought ye I should so readily hasten away? Let
ordinary worshippers be content to keep the feast and be gone; but is
this all ye have learnt of Me?" Methinks we are here let into the holy
privacies of Nazareth; for what He says they should have known, He must
have given them ground to know. She tells Him of the sorrow with which
His father and she had sought Him. He speaks of no Father but one,
saying, in effect, My Father has not been seeking Me; I have been with
Him all this time; "the King hath brought me into His chambers . . . His
left hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace me" ([Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Sol
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006).md). How is it that ye do not
understand? ([Mar 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#021).md).

[Luke 2:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">luk 2:50</span></span>

understood not--probably He had never expressly said as much, and so
confounded them, though it was but the true interpretation of many
things which they had seen and heard from Him at home. (See on [Joh
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#004)..md) But lest it should be thought
that now He threw off the filial yoke, and became His own Master
henceforth, and theirs too, it is purposely added, "And He went down
with them, and was subject unto them." The marvel of this condescension
lies in its coming after such a scene, and such an assertion of His
higher Sonship; and the words are evidently meant to convey this. "From
this time we have no more mention of Joseph. The next we hear is of his
"mother and brethren" ([Joh 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012).md);
whence it is inferred, that between this time and the commencement of
our Lord's public life, Joseph died" \[ALFORD\], having now served the
double end of being the protector of our Lord's Virgin--mother, and
affording Himself the opportunity of presenting a matchless pattern of
subjection to both parents.

[Luke 2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052.md)

stature--or better, perhaps, as in the Margin, "age," which implies the
other. This is all the record we have of the next eighteen years of that
wondrous life. What seasons of tranquil meditation over the lively
oracles, and holy fellowship with His Father; what inlettings, on the
one hand, of light, and love, and power from on high, and outgoings of
filial supplication, freedom, love, and joy on the other, would these
eighteen years contain! And would they not seem "but a few days" if they
were so passed, however ardently He might long to be more directly
"about His Father's business?"
