### [Jeremiah Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 17:1</span></span>

THE JEWS' INVETERATE LOVE OF IDOLATRY. (Jer. 17:1-27)

The first of the four clauses relates to the third, the second to the
fourth, by alternate parallelism. The sense is: They are as keen after
idols as if their propensity was "graven with an iron pen ([Job
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#024).md) on their hearts," or as if it
were sanctioned by a law "inscribed with a diamond point" on their
altars. The names of their gods used to be written on "the horns of the
altars" ([Act 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023).md). As the clause
"on their hearts" refers to their inward propensity, so "on . . .
altars," the outward exhibition of it. Others refer "on the horns of . .
. altars" to their staining them with the blood of victims, in imitation
of the Levitical precept ([Exo 29:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#012.md);
[Lev 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#007.md), [Lev
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#018).md), but "written . . . graven,"
would thus be inappropriate.

table of . . . heart--which God intended to be inscribed very
differently, namely, with His truths ([Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md); [Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003).md).

your--Though "their" preceded, He directly addresses them to charge the
guilt home to them in particular.

[Jeremiah 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 17:2</span></span>

children remember--Instead of forsaking the idolatries of their fathers,
they keep them up ([Jer 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018).md). This is
given as proof that their sin is "graven upon . . . altars" ([Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001).md), that is, is not merely
temporary. They corrupt their posterity after them. CASTALIO less
probably translates, "They remember their altars as (fondly as) they do
their children."

groves--rather, "images of Astarte," the goddess of the heavenly hosts,
represented as a sacred tree, such as is seen in the Assyrian sculptures
([Kg2 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007.md); [Ch2
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#018).md). "Image of the grove." The
Hebrew for "grove" is Asherah, that is, Assarak, Astarte, or Ashtaroth.

by the green trees--that is, near them: the sacred trees (idol symbols)
of Astarte being placed in the midst of natural trees: "green trees" is
thus distinguished from "groves," artificial trees. HENDERSON, to avoid
taking the same Hebrew particle in the same sentence differently, "by .
. . upon" translates "images of Astarte on the green trees." But it is
not probable that images, in the form of a sacred tree, should be hung
on trees, rather than near them.

[Jeremiah 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 17:3</span></span>

mountain--Jerusalem, and especially Zion and the temple.

in the field--As Jerusalem was surrounded by mountains ([Psa
125:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa125.htm#002).md), the sense probably is, Ye rely
on your mountainous position ([Jer
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#023).md), but I will make "My mountain"
to become as if it were in a plain (field), so as to give thy substance
an easy prey to the enemy \[CALVIN\]. "Field" may, however, mean all
Judea; it and "My mountain" will thus express the country and its
capital. (GESENIUS translates, "together with," instead of "in"; as the
Hebrew is translated in [Jer 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md);
[Hos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md); but this is not absolutely
needed), "the substance" of both of which God "will give to the spoil."

thy high places--corresponding in parallelism to "My mountain" (compare
[Isa 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009).md), as "all thy borders," to
"the field" (which confirms the view that "field" means all Judea).

for sin--connected with high places" in English Version, namely,
frequented for sin, that is, for idolatrous sacrifices. But [Jer
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013.md) makes the rendering probable, "I
will give thy substance . . . to . . . spoil . . . on account of thy sin
throughout all thy borders."

[Jeremiah 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 17:4</span></span>

even thyself--rather, "owing to thyself," that is, by thy own fault
([Jer 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013).md).

discontinue from--be dispossessed of. Not only thy substance, but
thyself shall be carried off to a strange land ([Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 17:5</span></span>

Referring to the Jews' proneness to rely on Egypt, in its fear of
Assyria and Babylon ([Isa 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001.md), [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003).md).

trusteth--This word is emphatic. We may expect help from men, so far as
God enables them to help us, but we must rest our trust in God alone
([Psa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005).md).

[Jeremiah 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 17:6</span></span>

heath--In [Psa 102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md); [Isa
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#011.md); [Hab
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#009.md), the Hebrew is translated, "bare,"
"naked," "destitute"; but as the parallel in [Jer
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md) is "tree," some plant must be
meant of which this is the characteristic epithet ([Jer
48:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#006), Margin.md), "a naked tree."
ROBINSON translates, "the juniper tree," found in the Arabah or Great
Valley, here called "the desert," south of the Dead Sea. The "heath" was
one of the plants, according to PLINY (13.21; 16.26), excluded from
religious uses, because it has neither fruit nor seed, and is neither
sown nor planted.

not see . . . good-- ([Job 20:17](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#017).md).

salt land-- ([Deu 29:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#023).md), barren
ground.

[Jeremiah 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 17:7</span></span>

([Psa 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md); [Pro
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#020.md); [Isa
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#018).md). Jeremiah first removed the
weeds (false trusts), so that there might be room for the good grain
\[CALVIN\].

[Jeremiah 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 17:8</span></span>

([Psa 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003).md).

shall not see--that is, feel. Answering to [Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md); whereas the unbelievers "shall
not see (even) when good cometh," the believer "shall not see (so as to
be overwhelmed by it even) when heat (fiery trial) cometh." Trials shall
come upon him as on all, nay, upon him especially ([Heb
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006).md); but he shall not sink under
them, because the Lord is his secret strength, just as the "roots spread
out by a river" (or, "water-course") draw hidden support from it ([Co2
4:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008).md).

careful--anxious, as one desponding ([Luk
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029.md); [Pe1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007).md).

drought--literally, "withholding," namely, of rain ([Jer
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#001).md); he here probably alludes to the
drought which had prevailed, but makes it the type of all kinds of
distress.

[Jeremiah 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 17:9</span></span>

deceitful--from a root, "supplanting," "tripping up insidiously by the
heel," from which Jacob ([Hos 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003).md)
took his name. In speaking of the Jews' deceit of heart, he
appropriately uses a term alluding to their forefather, whose deceit,
but not whose faith, they followed. His "supplanting" was in order to
obtain Jehovah's blessing. They plant Jehovah for "trust in man" ([Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005).md), and then think to deceive God,
as if it could escape His notice, that it is in man, not in Him, they
trust.

desperately wicked--"incurable" \[HORSLEY\], ([Mic
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#009).md). Trust in one's own heart is as
foolish as in our fellow man ([Pro
28:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#026).md).

[Jeremiah 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 17:10</span></span>

Lest any should infer from [Jer 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009.md),
"who can know it?" that even the Lord does not know, and therefore
cannot punish, the hidden treachery of the heart, He says, "I the Lord
search the heart," &c. ([Ch1 28:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1028.htm#009.md);
[Psa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md); [Pro
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#003.md); [Rev
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#023).md).

even to give--and that in order that I may give ([Jer
32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019).md).

[Jeremiah 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 17:11</span></span>

partridge-- ([Sa1 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#020).md). Hebrew,
korea, from a root, "to call," alluding to its cry; a name still applied
to a bustard by the Arabs. Its nest is liable, being on the ground, to
be trodden under foot, or robbed by carnivorous animals, notwithstanding
all the beautiful manoeuvres of the parent birds to save the brood. The
translation, "sitteth on eggs which it has not laid," alludes to the
ancient notion that she stole the eggs of other birds and hatched them
as her own; and that the young birds when grown left her for the true
mother. It is not needful to make Scripture allude to an exploded
notion, as if it were true. MAURER thinks the reference is to
Jehoiakim's grasping cupidity ([Jer
22:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#013).md). Probably the sense is more
general; as previously He condemned trust in man ([Jer
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005).md), He now condemns another object
of the deceitful hearts' trust, unjustly gotten riches ([Psa
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md); [Psa
49:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md); [Psa
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023).md).

fool-- ([Pro 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#005.md); [Luk
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#020).md); "their folly" ([Psa
49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013).md). He himself, and all, shall at
last perceive he was not the wise man he thought he was.

[Jeremiah 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 17:12</span></span>

throne--the temple of Jerusalem, the throne of Jehovah. Having condemned
false objects of trust, "high places for sin" ([Jer
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#003).md), and an "arm of flesh," he next
sets forth Jehovah, and His temple, which was ever open to the Jews, as
the true object of confidence, and sanctuary to flee to. HENDERSON makes
Jehovah, in [Jer 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md), the subject,
and this verse predicate, "A throne of glory, high from the beginning,
the place of our sanctuary, the hope of Israel is Jehovah." "Throne" is
thus used for Him who sits on it; compare thrones ([Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md). He is called a "sanctuary" to
His people ([Isa 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md); [Eze
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016).md). So Syriac and Arabic.

[Jeremiah 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 17:13</span></span>

me--"Jehovah." Though "Thee" precedes. This sudden transition is usual
in the prophetic style, owing to the prophet's continual realization of
Jehovah's presence.

all that forsake thee-- ([Psa 73:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#027.md);
[Isa 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#028).md).

written in the earth--in the dust, that is, shall be consigned to
oblivion. So Jesus' significant writing "on the ground (probably the
accusers' names)" ([Joh 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006).md). Names
written in the dust are obliterated by a very slight wind. Their hopes
and celebrity are wholly in the earth, not in the heavenly book of life
([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008.md); [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md), [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md). The Jews, though boasting that
they were the people of God, had no portion in heaven, no status before
God and His angels. Contrast "written in heaven," that is, in the
muster-roll of its blessed citizens ([Luk
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020).md). Also, contrast "written in a
book," and "in the rock for ever" ([Job
19:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#023).md).

living waters-- ([Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 17:14</span></span>

Prayer of the prophet for deliverance from the enemies whom he excited
by his faithful denunciations.

Heal . . . save--not only make me whole (as to the evils of soul as well
as body which I am exposed to by contact with ungodly foes, [Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018).md), but keep me so.

my praise--He whom I have to praise for past favors, and therefore to
whom alone I look for the time to come.

[Jeremiah 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 17:15</span></span>

Where is the word?-- ([Isa 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018).md). Where is the fulfilment of the
threats which thou didst utter as from God? A characteristic of the last
stage of apostasy ([Pe2 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 17:16</span></span>

I have not refused Thy call of me to be a prophet ([Jon
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#003).md), however painful to me it was to
utter what would be sure to irritate the hearers ([Jer
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#004), &c..md).; therefore Thou shouldest
not forsake me ([Jer 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015), &c..md).

to follow thee--literally, "after thee"; as an under-pastor following
Thee, the Chief Shepherd ([Ecc 12:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#011.md);
[Pe1 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004).md).

neither . . . desired--I have not wished for the day of calamity, though
I foretell it as about to come on my countrymen; therefore they have no
reason for persecuting me.

thou knowest--I appeal to Thee for the truth of what I assert.

that which came out of my lips--my words ([Deu
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023).md).

right before thee--rather, "was before Thee"; was known to Thee-- ([Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021).md).

[Jeremiah 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 17:17</span></span>

a terror--namely, by deserting me: all I fear is Thine abandoning me; if
Thou art with me, I have no fear of evil from enemies.

[Jeremiah 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 17:18</span></span>

destroy . . . destruction--"break them with a double breach," Hebrew
([Jer 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md). On "double," see on [Jer
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md).

[Jeremiah 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 17:19</span></span>

Delivered in the reign of Jehoiakim, who undid the good effected by
Josiah's reformation, especially as to the observance of the Sabbath
\[EICHORN\].

gate of . . . children of . . . people--The gate next the king's palace,
called the gate of David, and the gate of the people, from its being the
principal thoroughfare: now the Jaffa gate. It is probably the same as
"the gate of the fountain" at the foot of Zion, near which were the
king's garden and pool ([Jer 39:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#004.md);
[Kg2 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004.md); [Neh
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#014.md); [Neh
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#015.md); [Neh
12:37](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#037).md).

[Jeremiah 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 17:20</span></span>

kings--He begins with the kings, as they ought to have repressed such a
glaring profanation.

[Jeremiah 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 17:21</span></span>

Take heed to yourselves--literally, "to your souls." MAURER explains,
"as ye love your lives"; a phrase used here to give the greater weight
to the command.

sabbath--The non-observance of it was a chief cause of the captivity,
the number of years of the latter, seventy, being exactly made to agree
with the number of Sabbaths which elapsed during the four hundred ninety
years of their possession of Canaan from Saul to their removal ([Lev
26:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md); [Ch2
36:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#021).md). On the restoration, therefore,
stress was especially laid on Sabbath observance ([Neh
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#019).md).

Jerusalem--It would have been scandalous anywhere; but in the capital,
Jerusalem, it was an open insult to God. Sabbath-hallowing is intended
as a symbol of holiness in general ([Eze
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012).md); therefore much stress is laid
on it; the Jews' gross impiety is manifested in their setting God's will
at naught, in the case of such an easy and positive command.

[Jeremiah 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 17:23</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 17:24</span></span>

A part put for the whole, "If ye keep the Sabbath and My other laws."

[Jeremiah 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 17:25</span></span>

kings . . . in chariots--The kingdom at this time had been brought so
low that this promise here was a special favor.

remain--Hebrew, "be inhabited" ([Jer
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#006.md); [Isa
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#020).md).

[Jeremiah 17:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 17:26</span></span>

plain mountains . . . south-- ([Jos
15:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001).md). The southern border had
extended to the river of Egypt, but was now much curtailed by Egyptian
invasions ([Ch2 35:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#020.md); [Ch2
36:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#003).md). The Hebrew for "south" means
dry; the arid desert south of Judea is meant. The enumeration of all the
parts of Judea, city, country, plain, hill, and desert, implies that no
longer shall there be aught wanting of the integrity of the Jewish land
([Zac 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#007).md).

sacrifices--As in [Jer 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#022.md), one
constituent of Judea's prosperity is mentioned, namely, its kings on
David's throne, the pledge of God being its guardian; so in this verse
another constituent, namely, its priests, a pledge of God being
propitious to it ([Psa 107:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#022).md).

[Jeremiah 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 17:27</span></span>

burden . . . in . . . gates . . . fire in the gates--retribution
answering to the sin. The scene of their sin shall be the scene of their
punishment ([Jer 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#013.md); [Kg2
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#009).md).
