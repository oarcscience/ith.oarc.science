### [Numbers Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001)

[Numbers 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">num 25:1</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES' WHOREDOM AND IDOLATRY WITH MOAB. (Num. 25:1-18)

Israel abode in Shittim--a verdant meadow, so called from a grove of
acacia trees which lined the eastern side of the Jordan. (See [Num
33:49](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049)).

[Numbers 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">num 25:3</span></span>

Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor--Baal was a general name for
"lord," and Peor for a "mount" in Moab. The real name of the idol was
Chemosh, and his rites of worship were celebrated by the grossest
obscenity. In participating in this festival, then, the Israelites
committed the double offense of idolatry and licentiousness.

[Numbers 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">num 25:4</span></span>

The Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang
them up--Israelite criminals, who were capitally punished, were first
stoned or slain, and then gibbeted. The persons ordered here for
execution were the principal delinquents in the Baal-peor outrage--the
subordinate officers, rulers of tens or hundreds.

before the Lord--for vindicating the honor of the true God.

against the sun--that is, as a mark of public ignominy; but they were to
be removed towards sunset ([Deu
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)).

[Numbers 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">num 25:5</span></span>

judges of Israel--the seventy elders, who were commanded not only to
superintend the execution within their respective jurisdictions, but to
inflict the punishment with their own hands. (See on [Sa1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#033)).

[Numbers 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">num 25:6</span></span>

behold, one of the children of Israel . . . brought . . . a Midianitish
woman--This flagitious act most probably occurred about the time when
the order was given and before its execution.

who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle--Some of the rulers
and well-disposed persons were deploring the dreadful wickedness of the
people and supplicating the mercy of God to avert impending judgments.

[Numbers 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">num 25:8</span></span>

the plague--some sudden and widespread mortality.

[Numbers 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">num 25:9</span></span>

those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand--Only
twenty-three thousand perished ([Co1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008)) from pestilence. Moses includes
those who died by the execution of the judges \[[Num
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#005)\].

[Numbers 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">num 25:11</span></span>

Phinehas . . . hath turned my wrath away--This assurance was a signal
mark of honor that the stain of blood, instead of defiling, confirmed
him in office and that his posterity should continue as long as the
national existence of Israel.

[Numbers 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">num 25:14</span></span>

Zimri, . . . a prince . . . among the Simeonites--The slaughter of a man
of such high rank is mentioned as a proof of the undaunted zeal of
Phinehas, for there might be numerous avengers of his blood.

[Numbers 25:17](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">num 25:17</span></span>

Vex the Midianites, and smite them--They seem to have been the most
guilty parties. (Compare [Num 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#004);
[Num 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008)).

[Numbers 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">num 25:18</span></span>

they vex you with their wiles--Instead of open war, they plot insidious
ways of accomplishing your ruin by idolatry and corruption.

their sister--their countrywoman.
