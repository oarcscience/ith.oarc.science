### [1 Corinthians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

[1 Corinthians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 2:1</span></span>

PAUL'S SUBJECT OF PREACHING, CHRIST CRUCIFIED, NOT IN WORLDLY, BUT IN
HEAVENLY, WISDOM AMONG THE PERFECT. (1Co. 2:1-16)

And I--"So I" \[CONYBEARE\] as one of the "foolish, weak, and despised"
instruments employed by God ([Co1
1:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md); "glorying in the Lord," not
in man's wisdom ([Co1 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031).md). Compare
[Co1 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023.md), "We."

when I came-- ([Act 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001), &c..md). Paul
might, had he pleased, have used an ornate style, having studied secular
learning at Tarsus of Cilicia, which STRABO preferred as a school of
learning to Athens or Alexandria; here, doubtless, he read the Cilician
Aratus' poems (which he quotes, [Act
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028).md), and Epimenides ([Tit
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012).md), and Menander ([Co1
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#033).md). Grecian intellectual
development was an important element in preparing the way for the
Gospel, but it failed to regenerate the world, showing that for this a
superhuman power is needed. Hellenistic (Grecizing) Judaism at Tarsus
and Alexandria was the connecting link between the schools of Athens and
those of the Rabbis. No more fitting birthplace could there have been
for the apostle of the Gentiles than Tarsus, free as it was from the
warping influences of Rome, Alexandria, and Athens. He had at the same
time Roman citizenship, which protected him from sudden violence. Again,
he was reared in the Hebrew divine law at Jerusalem. Thus, as the three
elements, Greek cultivation, Roman polity ([Luk
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001).md), and the divine law given to the
Jews, combined just at Christ's time, to prepare the world for the
Gospel, so the same three, by God's marvellous providence, met together
in the apostle to the Gentiles \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

testimony of God--"the testimony of Christ" ([Co1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#006).md); therefore Christ is God.

[1 Corinthians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 2:2</span></span>

The Greek implies, "The only definite thing that I made it my business
to know among you, was to know Jesus Christ (His person) and Him
crucified (His office)" \[ALFORD\], not exalted on the earthly throne of
David, but executed as the vilest malefactor. The historical fact of
Christ's crucifixion had probably been put less prominently forward by
the seekers after human wisdom in the Corinthian church, to avoid
offending learned heathens and Jews. Christ's person and Christ's office
constitute the sum of the Gospel.

[1 Corinthians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 2:3</span></span>

I--the preacher: as [Co1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002.md) describes
the subject, "Christ crucified," and [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md) the mode of preaching: "my speech
. . . not with enticing words," "but in demonstration of the Spirit."

weakness--personal and bodily ([Co2
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md), [Co2
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md); [Gal
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#013).md).

trembling--(compare [Phi 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).md). Not
personal fear, but a trembling anxiety to perform a duty; anxious
conscientiousness, as proved by the contrast to "eye service" ([Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005).md) \[CONYBEARE and HOWSON\].

[1 Corinthians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 2:4</span></span>

my speech--in private.

preaching--in public \[BENGEL\]. ALFORD explains it, My discourse on
doctrines, and my preaching or announcement of facts.

enticing--rather, "persuasive."

man's wisdom--man's is omitted in the oldest authorities. Still "wisdom"
does refer to "man's" wisdom.

in demonstration of . . . Spirit, &c.--Persuasion is man's means of
moving his fellow man. God's means is demonstration, leaving no doubt,
and inspiring implicit faith, by the powerful working of the Spirit
(then exhibited both outwardly by miracles, and inwardly by working on
the heart, now in the latter and the more important way only, [Mat
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#029.md); [Act
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010.md); [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md); compare also [Rom
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019).md). The same simple power
accompanies divine truth now, producing certain persuasion and
conversion, when the Spirit demonstrates by it.

[1 Corinthians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 2:5</span></span>

stand in . . . wisdom of men--rest on it, owe its origin and continuance
to it.

[1 Corinthians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 2:6</span></span>

Yet the Gospel preaching, so far from being at variance with true
"wisdom," is a wisdom infinitely higher than that of the wise of the
world.

we speak--resuming "we" (preachers, I, Apollos, &c.) from "we preach"
([Co1 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md), only that here, "we
speak" refers to something less public (compare [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md), [Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013), "mystery . . . hidden".md) than "we
preach," which is public. For "wisdom" here denotes not the whole of
Christian doctrine, but its sublimer and deeper principles.

perfect--Those matured in Christian experience and knowledge alone can
understand the true superiority of the Christian wisdom which Paul
preached. Distinguished not only from worldly and natural men, but also
from babes, who though "in Christ" retain much that is "carnal" ([Co1
3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001).md), and cannot therefore
understand the deeper truths of Christianity ([Co1
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md); [Phi
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md); [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014).md). Paul does not mean by the
"mystery" or "hidden wisdom" ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007).md) some hidden tradition distinct
from the Gospel (like the Church of Rome's disciplina arcani and
doctrine of reserve), but the unfolding of the treasures of knowledge,
once hidden in God's counsels, but now announced to all, which would be
intelligently comprehended in proportion as the hearer's inner life
became perfectly transformed into the image of Christ. Compare instances
of such "mysteries," that is, deeper Christian truths, not preached at
Paul's first coming to Corinth, when he confined himself to the
fundamental elements ([Co1 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002).md), but
now spoken to the "perfect" ([Co1
15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md); [Rom
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md); [Eph
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005).md). "Perfect" is used not of
absolute perfection, but relatively to "babes," or those less ripe in
Christian growth (compare [Phi 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md),
[Phi 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#015.md), with [Jo1
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012).md). "God" ([Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007).md) is opposed to the world, the
apostles to "the princes \[great and learned men\] of this world" ([Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md); compare [Co1
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020).md) \[BENGEL\].

come to naught--nothingness ([Co1
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md). They are transient, not
immortal. Therefore, their wisdom is not real \[BENGEL\]. Rather,
translate with ALFORD, "Which are being brought to naught," namely, by
God's choosing the "things which are not (the weak and despised things
of the Gospel), to bring to naught (the same verb as here) things that
are" ([Co1 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028).md).

[1 Corinthians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 2:7</span></span>

wisdom of God--emphatically contrasted with the wisdom of men and of
this world ([Co1 2:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#005).md).

in a mystery--connected in construction with "we speak": We speak as
dealing with a mystery; that is not something to be kept hidden, but
what heretofore was so, but is now revealed. Whereas the pagan mysteries
were revealed only to a chosen few, the Gospel mysteries were made known
to all who would obey the truth. "If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to
them that are lost" ([Co2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003).md), "whom
the God of this world hath blinded." Ordinarily we use "mystery" in
reference to those from whom the knowledge is withheld; the apostles, in
reference to those to whom it is revealed \[WHATELY\]. It is hidden
before it is brought forward, and when it is brought forward it still
remains hidden to those that are imperfect \[BENGEL\].

ordained--literally, "foreordained" (compare [Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md), "prepared for them that love
Him."

before the world--rather, "before the ages" (of time), that is, from
eternity. This infinitely antedates worldly wisdom in antiquity. It was
before not only the wisdom of the world, but eternally before the world
itself and its ages.

to our glory--ours both now and hereafter, from "the Lord of glory"
([Co1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008).md), who brings to naught "the
princes of this world."

[1 Corinthians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 2:8</span></span>

Which--wisdom. The strongest proof of the natural man's destitution of
heavenly wisdom.

crucified . . . Lord of glory--implying the inseparable connection of
Christ's humanity and His divinity. The Lord of glory (which He had in
His own right before the world was, [Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004.md), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024).md) was crucified.

[1 Corinthians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 2:9</span></span>

But--(it has happened) as it is written.

Eye hath not seen, &c.--ALFORD translates, "The things which eye saw not
. . . the things which God prepared . . . to us God revealed through His
Spirit." Thus, however, the "but" of [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md) is ignored. Rather construe, as
ESTIUS, "('We speak,' supplied from [Co1
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008).md), things which eye saw not
(heretofore), . . . things which God prepared . . . But God revealed
them to us," &c. The quotation is not a verbatim one, but an inspired
exposition of the "wisdom" ([Co1 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md),
from [Isa 64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004).md). The exceptive words,
"O God, beside (that is, except) Thee," are not quoted directly, but are
virtually expressed in the exposition of them ([Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010).md), "None but thou, O God, seest
these mysteries, and God hath revealed them to us by His Spirit."

entered--literally, "come up into the heart." A Hebraism (compare, [Jer
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016), Margin.md). In [Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md) it is "Prepared (literally, 'will
do') for him that waiteth for Him"; here, "for them that love Him." For
Isaiah spake to them who waited for Messiah's appearance as future;
Paul, to them who love Him as having actually appeared ([Jo1
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019).md); compare [Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md), "the things that are freely
given to us of God"

[1 Corinthians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 2:10</span></span>

revealed . . . by . . . Spirit--The inspiration of thoughts (so far as
truth essential to salvation is concerned) makes the Christian ([Co1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003.md); [Mat
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013.md); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md), [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).md); that of words, the PROPHET
([Sa2 23:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001.md); [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md), [Kg1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#005).md), "by the word of the Lord" ([Co1
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md); [Joh
20:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#030.md); [Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021).md). The secrets of revelation are
secret to some, not because those who know them will not reveal them
(for indeed, the very notion of revelation implies an unveiling of what
had been veiled), but because those to whom they are announced have not
the will or power to comprehend them. Hence the Spirit-taught alone know
these secrets ([Psa 25:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#014.md); [Pro
3:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032.md); [Joh
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md); [Joh
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015).md).

unto us--the "perfect" or fully matured in Christian experience ([Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006).md). Intelligent men may understand
the outline of doctrines; but without the Holy Spirit's revelation to
the heart, these will be to them a mere outline--a skeleton, correct
perhaps, but wanting life \[WHATLEY, Cautions for the Times, 14\], ([Luk
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021).md).

the Spirit searcheth--working in us and with our spirits (compare [Rom
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md), [Rom
8:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md). The Old Testament shows us
God (the Father) for us. The Gospels, God (the Son) with us. The Acts
and Epistles, God (the Holy Ghost) in us \[MONOD\], ([Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014).md).

deep things of God-- ([Psa 92:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#005).md). His
divine nature, attributes, and counsels. The Spirit delights to explore
the infinite depths of His own divine mind, and then reveal them to us,
according as we are capable of understanding them ([Deu
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029).md). This proves the personality
and Godhead of the Holy Ghost. Godhead cannot be separated from the
Spirit of God, as manhood cannot be separated from the Spirit of man
\[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 2:11</span></span>

what man, &c.--literally, "who of men knoweth the things of a man, save
the spirit of that man?"

things of God knoweth no man--rather, "none knoweth," not angel or man.
This proves the impossibility of any knowing the things of God, save by
the Spirit of God (who alone knows them, since even in the case of man,
so infinitely inferior in mind to God, none of his fellow men, but his
own spirit alone knows the things hidden within him).

[1 Corinthians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 2:12</span></span>

we . . . received, not . . . spirit of . . . world--the personal evil
"spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002).md). This spirit is natural in the
unregenerate, and needs not to be received.

Spirit which is of God--that is, which comes from God. We have received
it only by the gift of God, whose Spirit it is, whereas our own spirit
is the spirit that is in us men ([Co1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011).md).

that we might know . . . things . . . freely given . . . of God--present
experimental knowledge, to our unspeakable comfort, of His deep
mysteries of wisdom, and of our future possession of the good "things
which God hath prepared for them that love Him" ([Co1
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009).md).

[1 Corinthians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 2:13</span></span>

also--We not only know by the Holy Ghost, but we also speak the "things
freely given to us of God" ([Co1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012).md).

which the Holy Ghost teacheth--The old manuscripts read "the Spirit"
simply, without "Holy."

comparing spiritual things with spiritual--expounding the
Spirit-inspired Old Testament Scripture, by comparison with the Gospel
which Jesus by the same Spirit revealed \[GROTIUS\]; and conversely
illustrating the Gospel mysteries by comparing them with the Old
Testament types \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. So the Greek word is translated,
"comparing" ([Co2 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012).md). WAHL (Key of
the New Testament) translates, "explaining (as the Greek is translated,
[Gen 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen040.htm#008), the Septuagint.md) to
spiritual (that is, Spirit-taught) men, spiritual things (the things
which we ourselves are taught by the Spirit)." Spirit-taught men alone
can comprehend spiritual truths. This accords with [Co1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), [Co1
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009.md), [Co1
2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md); [Co1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md). ALFORD translates, "Putting
together (combining) spirituals with spirituals"; that is, attaching
spiritual words to spiritual things, which we should not do, if we were
to use words of worldly wisdom to expound spiritual things (so [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), [Co1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md); [Pe1
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011).md). Perhaps the generality of the
neuters is designed to comprehend these several notions by implication.
Comparing, or combining, spirituals with spirituals; implying both that
spiritual things are only suited to spiritual persons (so "things"
comprehended persons, [Co1 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027).md), and
also that spiritual truths can only be combined with spiritual (not
worldly-wise) words; and lastly, spirituals of the Old and New
Testaments can only be understood by mutual comparison or combination,
not by combination with worldly "wisdom," or natural perceptions ([Co1
1:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021.md); [Co1
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#001.md), [Co1
2:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md); compare [Psa
119:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#018).md).

[1 Corinthians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co1 2:14</span></span>

natural man--literally, "a man of animal soul." As contrasted with the
spiritual man, he is governed by the animal soul, which overbears his
spirit, which latter is without the Spirit of God ([Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019).md). So the animal (English Version,
"natural") body, or body led by the lower animal nature (including both
the mere human fallen reason and heart), is contrasted with the
Spirit-quickened body ([Co1 15:44-46](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044).md).
The carnal man (the man led by bodily appetites, and also by a
self-exalting spirit, estranged from the divine life) is closely akin;
so too the "earthly." "Devilish," or "demon-like"; "led by an evil
spirit," is the awful character of such a one, in its worst type ([Jam
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015).md).

receiveth not--though they are offered to him, and are "worthy of being
received by all men" ([Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015).md).

they are foolishness unto him--whereas he seeks "wisdom" ([Co1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022).md).

neither can he--Not only does he not, but he cannot know them, and
therefore has no wish to "receive" them ([Rom
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007).md).

[1 Corinthians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 2:15</span></span>

He that is spiritual--literally, "the spiritual (man)." In [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md), it is "A \[not 'the,' as English
Version\] natural man." The spiritual is the man distinguished above his
fellow men, as he in whom the Spirit rules. In the unregenerate, the
spirit which ought to be the organ of the Holy Spirit (and which is so
in the regenerate), is overridden by the animal soul, and is in
abeyance, so that such a one is never called "spiritual."

judgeth all things--and persons, by their true standard (compare [Co1
6:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002.md); [Jo1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001).md), in so far as he is spiritual.
"Discerneth . . . is discerned," would better accord with the
translation of the same Greek ([Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).md). Otherwise for "discerned," in
[Co1 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md), translate, "judged of," to
accord with the translation, "judgeth . . . is judged" in this fifteenth
verse. He has a practical insight into the verities of the Gospel,
though he is not infallible on all theoretical points. If an individual
may have the Spirit without being infallible, why may not the Church
have the Spirit, and yet not be infallible (a refutation of the plea of
Rome for the Church's infallibility, from [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md); [Joh
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#013).md)? As the believer and the Church
have the Spirit, and are yet not therefore impeccable, so he and the
Church have the Spirit, and yet are not infallible or impeccable. He and
the Church are both infallible and impeccable, only in proportion to the
degree in which they are led by the Spirit. The Spirit leads into all
truth and holiness; but His influence on believers and on the Church is
as yet partial. Jesus alone, who had the Spirit without measure ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034).md), is both infallible and
impeccable. Scripture, because it was written by men, who while writing
were infallibly inspired, is unmixed truth ([Pro
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#005.md); [Jo1
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#027).md).

[1 Corinthians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016.md)

For--proof of [Co1 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015.md), that the
spiritual man "is judged of no man." In order to judge the spiritual
man, the ordinary man must "know the mind of the Lord." But "who of
ordinary men knows" that?

that he may instruct him--that is, so as to be able to set Him right as
His counsellor (quoted from [Isa
40:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013).md). So the Septuagint
translates the Greek verb, which means to "prove," in [Act
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md). Natural men who judge spiritual
men, living according to the mind of God ("We have the mind of Christ"),
are virtually wishing to instruct God, and bring Him to another mind, as
counsellors setting to right their king.

we have the mind of Christ--in our degree of capability to apprehend it.
[Isa 40:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md) refers to JEHOVAH:
therefore, as it is applied here to Christ, He is Jehovah.
