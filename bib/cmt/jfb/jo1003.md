[1 John 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 3:1</span></span>

DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD AND THE CHILDREN OF THE
DEVIL. BROTHERLY LOVE THE ESSENCE OF TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS. (1Jo. 3:1-24)

Behold--calling attention, as to some wonderful exhibition, little as
the world sees to admire. This verse is connected with the previous [Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md), thus: All our doing of
righteousness is a mere sign that God, of His matchless love, has
adopted us as children; it does not save us, but is a proof that we are
saved of His grace.

what manner of--of what surpassing excellence, how gracious on His part,
how precious to us.

love . . . bestowed--He does not say that God hath given us some gift,
but love itself and the fountain of all honors, the heart itself, and
that not for our works or efforts, but of His grace \[LUTHER\].

that--"what manner of love"; resulting in, proved by, our being, &c. The
immediate effect aimed at in the bestowal of this love is, "that we
should be called children of God."

should be called--should have received the privilege of such a glorious
title (though seeming so imaginary to the world), along with the
glorious reality. With God to call is to make really to be. Who so great
as God? What nearer relationship than that of sons? The oldest
manuscripts add, "And we ARE SO" really.

therefore--"on this account," because "we are (really) so."

us--the children, like the Father.

it knew him not--namely, the Father. "If they who regard not God, hold
thee in any account, feel alarmed about thy state" \[BENGEL\]. Contrast
[Jo1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#001.md). The world's whole course is
one great act of non-recognition of God.

[1 John 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 3:2</span></span>

Beloved--by the Father, and therefore by me.

now--in contrast to "not yet." We now already are really sons, though
not recognized as such by the world, and (as the consequence) we look
for the visible manifestation of our sonship, which not yet has taken
place.

doth not yet appear--Greek, "it hath not yet ('at any time,' Greek
aorist) been visibly manifested what we shall be"--what further glory we
shall attain by virtue of this our sonship. The "what" suggests a
something inconceivably glorious.

but--omitted in the oldest manuscripts. Its insertion in English Version
gives a wrong antithesis. It is not, "We do not yet know manifestly what
. . . but we know," &c. Believers have some degree of the manifestation
already, though the world has not. The connection is, The manifestation
to the world of what we shall be, has not yet taken place; we know (in
general; as a matter of well-assured knowledge; so the Greek) that when
(literally, "if"; expressing no doubt as to the fact, but only as to the
time; also implying the coming preliminary fact, on which the
consequence follows, [Mal 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md); [Joh
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#003).md) He (not "it," namely, that which
is not yet manifested \[ALFORD\]) shall be manifested ([Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005.md); [Jo1
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).md), we shall be like Him (Christ;
all sons have a substantial resemblance to their father, and Christ,
whom we shall be like, is "the express image of the Father's person," so
that in resembling Christ, we shall resemble the Father). We wait for
the manifestation (literally, the "apocalypse"; the same term as is
applied to Christ's own manifestation) of the sons of God. After our
natural birth, the new birth into the life of grace is needed, which is
to be followed by the new birth into the life of glory; the two latter
alike are termed "the regeneration" ([Mat
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028).md). The resurrection of our bodies
is a kind of coming out of the womb of the earth, and being born into
another life. Our first temptation was that we should be like God in
knowledge, and by that we fell; but being raised by Christ, we become
truly like Him, by knowing Him as we are known, and by seeing Him as He
is \[PEARSON, Exposition of the Creed\]. As the first immortality which
Adam lost was to be able not to die, so the last shall be not to be able
to die. As man's first free choice or will was to be able not to sin, so
our last shall be not to be able to sin \[AUGUSTINE, The City of God,
22.30\]. The devil fell by aspiring to God's power; man, by aspiring to
his knowledge; but aspiring after God's goodness, we shall ever grow in
His likeness. The transition from God the Father to "He," "Him,"
referring to Christ (who alone is ever said in Scripture to be
manifested; not the Father, [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018).md), implies the entire unity of the
Father and the Son.

for, &c.--Continual beholding generates likeness ([Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).md); as the face of the moon being
always turned towards the sun, reflects its light and glory.

see him--not in His innermost Godhead, but as manifested in Christ. None
but the pure can see the infinitely Pure One. In all these passages the
Greek is the same verb opsomai; not denoting the action of seeing, but
the state of him to whose eye or mind the object is presented; hence the
Greek verb is always in the middle or reflexive voice, to perceive and
inwardly appreciate \[TITTMANN\]. Our spiritual bodies will appreciate
and recognize spiritual beings hereafter, as our natural bodies now do
natural objects.

[1 John 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 3:3</span></span>

this hope--of being hereafter "like Him." Faith and love, as well as
hope, occur in [Jo1 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md), [Jo1
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md).

in--rather, "(resting) upon Him"; grounded on His promises.

purifieth himself--by Christ's Spirit in him ([Joh
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#005), end.md). "Thou purifiest thyself,
not of thyself, but of Him who comes that He may dwell in thee"
\[AUGUSTINE\]. One's justification through faith is presupposed.

as he is pure--unsullied with any uncleanness. The Second Person, by
whom both the Law and Gospel were given.

[1 John 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 3:4</span></span>

Sin is incompatible with birth from God ([Jo1
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md). John often sets forth the same
truth negatively, which he had before set forth positively. He had
shown, birth from God involves self-purification; he now shows where
sin, that is, the want of self-purification, is, there is no birth from
God.

Whosoever--Greek, "Every one who."

committeth sin--in contrast to [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md), "Every man that hath this hope in
Him purifieth himself"; and [Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md),
"He that doeth righteousness."

transgresseth . . . the law--Greek, "committeth transgression of law."
God's law of purity; and so shows he has no such hope of being hereafter
pure as God is pure, and, therefore, that he is not born of God.

for--Greek, "and."

sin is . . . transgression of . . . law--definition of sin in general.
The Greek having the article to both, implies that they are convertible
terms. The Greek "sin" (hamartia) is literally, "a missing of the mark."
God's will being that mark to be ever aimed at. "By the law is the
knowledge of sin." The crookedness of a line is shown by being brought
into juxtaposition with a straight ruler.

[1 John 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 3:5</span></span>

Additional proof of the incompatibility of sin and sonship; the very
object of Christ's manifestation in the flesh was to take away (by one
act, and entirely, aorist) all sins, as the scapegoat did typically.

and--another proof of the same.

in him is no sin--not "was," but "is," as in [Jo1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md), "He is righteous," and [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003.md), "He is pure." Therefore we are to
be so.

[1 John 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 3:6</span></span>

He reasons from Christ's own entire separation from sin, that those in
him must also be separate from it.

abideth in him--as the branch in the vine, by vital union living by His
life.

sinneth not--In so far as he abides in Christ, so far is he free from
all sin. The ideal of the Christian. The life of sin and the life of God
mutually exclude one another, just as darkness and light. In matter of
fact, believers do fall into sins ([Jo1
1:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md); [Jo1
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001).md); but all such sins are alien
from the life of God, and need Christ's cleansing blood, without
application to which the life of God could not be maintained. He sinneth
not so long as he abideth in Christ.

whosoever sinneth hath not seen him--Greek perfect, "has not seen, and
does not see Him." Again the ideal of Christian intuition and knowledge
is presented ([Mat 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023).md). All sin as
such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated. Not that
"whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor known God"; but in
so far as sin exists, in that degree the spiritual intuition and
knowledge of God do not exist in him.

neither--"not even." To see spiritually is a further step than to know;
for by knowing we come to seeing by vivid realization and
experimentally.

[1 John 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 3:7</span></span>

The same truth stated, with the addition that he who sins is, so far as
he sins, "of the devil."

let no man deceive you--as Antinomians try to mislead men.

righteousness--Greek, "the righteousness," namely, of Christ or God.

he that doeth . . . is righteous--Not his doing makes him righteous, but
his being righteous (justified by the righteousness of God in Christ,
[Rom 10:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003).md) makes him to do
righteousness: an inversion common in familiar language, logical in
reality, though not in form, as in [Luk
7:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047.md); [Joh
8:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#047.md). Works do not justify, but the
justified man works. We infer from his doing righteousness that he is
already righteous (that is, has the true and only principle of doing
righteousness, namely, faith), and is therefore born of God ([Jo1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009).md); just as we might say, The tree
that bears good fruit is a good tree, and has a living root; not that
the fruit makes the tree and its root to be good, but it shows that they
are so.

he--Christ.

[1 John 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 3:8</span></span>

He that committeth sin is of the devil--in contrast to "He that doeth
righteousness," [Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007.md). He is a son
of the devil ([Jo1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md); [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).md). John does not, however, say,
"born of the devil." as he does "born of God," for "the devil begets
none, nor does he create any; but whoever imitates the devil becomes a
child of the devil by imitating him, not by proper birth" \[AUGUSTINE,
Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John, Homily 4.10\]. From the devil
there is not generation, but corruption \[BENGEL\].

sinneth from the beginning--from the time that any began to sin
\[ALFORD\]: from the time that he became what he is, the devil. He seems
to have kept his first estate only a very short time after his creation
\[BENGEL\]. Since the fall of man \[at the beginning of our world\] the
devil is (ever) sinning (this is the force of "sinneth"; he has sinned
from the beginning, is the cause of all sins, and still goes on sinning;
present). As the author of sin, and prince of this world, he has never
ceased to seduce man to sin \[LUECKE\].

destroy--break up and do away with; bruising and crushing the serpent's
head.

works of the devil--sin, and all its awful consequences. John argues,
Christians cannot do that which Christ came to destroy.

[1 John 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 3:9</span></span>

Whosoever is born of God--literally, "Everyone that is begotten of God."

doth not commit sin--His higher nature, as one born or begotten of God,
doth not sin. To be begotten of God and to sin, are states mutually
excluding one another. In so far as one sins, he makes it doubtful
whether he be born of God.

his seed--the living word of God, made by the Holy Spirit the seed in us
of a new life and the continual mean of sanctification.

remaineth--abideth in him (compare Note, see on [Jo1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006.md); [Joh
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038).md). This does not contradict [Jo1
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008.md); the regenerate show the utter
incompatibility of sin with regeneration, by cleansing away every sin
into which they may be betrayed by the old nature, at once in the blood
of Christ.

cannot sin, because he is born of God--"because it is of God that he is
born" (so the Greek order, as compared with the order of the same words
in the beginning of the verse); not "because he was born of God" (the
Greek is perfect tense, which is present in meaning, not aorist); it is
not said, Because a man was once for all born of God he never afterwards
can sin; but, Because he is born of God, the seed abiding now in Him, he
cannot sin; so long as it energetically abides, sin can have no place.
Compare [Gen 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#009.md), Joseph, "How CAN I
do this great wickedness and sin against God?" The principle within me
is at utter variance with it. The regenerate life is incompatible with
sin, and gives the believer a hatred for sin in every shape, and an
unceasing desire to resist it. "The child of God in this conflict
receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms or makes
peace with his deadly foe" \[LUTHER\]. The exceptional sins into which
the regenerate are surprised, are owing to the new life principle being
for a time suffered to lie dormant, and to the sword of the Spirit not
being drawn instantly. Sin is ever active, but no longer reigns. The
normal direction of the believer's energies is against sin; the law of
God after the inward man is the ruling principle of his true self though
the old nature, not yet fully deadened, rebels and sins. Contrast [Jo1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018.md) with [Joh
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034.md); compare [Psa
18:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#022.md); [Psa
32:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md); [Psa
119:113](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#113.md), [Psa
119:176](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#176.md). The magnetic needle, the
nature of which is always to point to the pole, is easily turned aside,
but always reseeks the pole.

[1 John 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 3:10</span></span>

children of the devil--(See on [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md); [Act
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010).md). There is no middle class
between the children of God and the children of the devil.

doeth not righteousness--Contrast [Jo1
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md).

he that loveth not his brother-- ([Jo1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#008).md); a particular instance of that
love which is the sum and fulfilment of all righteousness, and the token
(not loud professions, or even seemingly good works) that distinguishes
God's children from the devil's.

[1 John 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jo1 3:11</span></span>

the message--"announcement," as of something good; not a mere command,
as the law. The Gospel message of Him who loved us, announced by His
servants, is, that we love the brethren; not here all mankind, but those
who are our brethren in Christ, children of the same family of God, of
whom we have been born anew.

[1 John 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jo1 3:12</span></span>

who--not in the Greek.

of that wicked one--Translate, "evil one," to accord with "Because his
own works were evil." Compare [Jo1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md), "of the devil," in contrast to
"of God," [Jo1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md).

slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's
righteous--through envy and hatred of his brother's piety, owing to
which God accepted Abel's, but rejected Cain's offering. Enmity from the
first existed between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.

[1 John 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jo1 3:13</span></span>

Marvel not--The marvel would be if the world loved you.

the world--of whom Cain is the representative ([Jo1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#012).md).

hate you--as Cain hated even his own brother, and that to the extent of
murdering him. The world feels its bad works tacitly reproved by your
good works.

[1 John 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jo1 3:14</span></span>

We--emphatical; hated though we be by the world, we know what the world
knows not.

know--as an assured fact.

passed--changed our state. [Col 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md),
"from the power of darkness . . . translated into the kingdom of His
dear Son."

from death unto life--literally, "out of the death (which enthrals the
unregenerate) into the life (of the regenerate)." A palpable coincidence
of language and thought, the beloved disciple adopting his Lord's words.

because we love the brethren--the ground, not of our passing over out of
death into life, but of our knowing that we have so. Love, on our part,
is the evidence of our justification and regeneration, not the cause of
them. "Let each go to his own heart; if he find there love to the
brethren, let him feel assured that he has passed from death unto life.
Let him not mind that his glory is only hidden; when the Lord shall
come, then shall he appear in glory. For he has vital energy, but it is
still wintertime; the root has vigor, but the branches are as it were
dry; within there is marrow which is vigorous, within are leaves, within
fruits, but they must wait for summer" \[AUGUSTINE\].

He that loveth not--Most of the oldest manuscripts omit "his brother,"
which makes the statement more general.

abideth--still.

in death--"in the (spiritual) death" (ending in eternal death) which is
the state of all by nature. His want of love evidences that no saving
change has passed over him.

[1 John 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jo1 3:15</span></span>

hateth--equivalent to "loveth not" ([Jo1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014).md); there is no medium between the
two. "Love and hatred, like light and darkness, life and death,
necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another"
\[ALFORD\].

is a murderer--because indulging in that passion, which, if followed out
to its natural consequences, would make him one. "Whereas, [Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md) desires us to lay down our lives
for the brethren; duels require one (awful to say!) to risk his own
life, rather than not deprive another of life" \[BENGEL\]. God regards
the inward disposition as tantamount to the outward act which would flow
from it. Whomsoever one hates, one wishes to be dead.

hath--Such a one still "abideth in death." It is not his future state,
but his present, which is referred to. He who hates (that is, loveth
not) his brother ([Jo1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014).md), cannot
in this his present state have eternal life abiding in him.

[1 John 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jo1 3:16</span></span>

What true love to the brethren is, illustrated by the love of Christ to
us.

Hereby--Greek, "Herein."

the love of God--The words "of God" are not in the original. Translate,
"We arrive at the knowledge of love"; we apprehend what true love is.

he--Christ.

and we--on our part, if absolutely needed for the glory of God, the good
of the Church, or the salvation of a brother.

lives--Christ alone laid down His one life for us all; we ought to lay
down our lives severally for the lives of the brethren; if not actually,
at least virtually, by giving our time, care, labors, prayers,
substance: Non nobis, sed omnibus. Our life ought not to be dearer to us
than God's own Son was to Him. The apostles and martyrs acted on this
principle.

[1 John 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jo1 3:17</span></span>

this world's good--literally, "livelihood" or substance. If we ought to
lay down our lives for the brethren ([Jo1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016).md), how much more ought we not to
withhold our substance?

seeth--not merely casually, but deliberately contemplates as a
spectator; Greek, "beholds."

shutteth up his bowels of compassion--which had been momentarily opened
by the spectacle of his brother's need. The "bowels" mean the heart, the
seat of compassion.

how--How is it possible that "the love of (that is, 'to') God dwelleth
(Greek, 'abideth') in him?" Our superfluities should yield to the
necessities; our comforts, and even our necessaries in some measure,
should yield to the extreme wants of our brethren. "Faith gives Christ
to me; love flowing from faith gives me to my neighbor."

[1 John 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jo1 3:18</span></span>

When the venerable John could no longer walk to the meetings of the
Church but was borne thither by his disciples, he always uttered the
same address to the Church; he reminded them of that one commandment
which he had received from Christ Himself, as comprising all the rest,
and forming the distinction of the new covenant, "My little children,
love one another." When the brethren present, wearied of hearing the
same thing so often, asked why he always repeated the same thing, he
replied, "Because it is the commandment of the Lord, and if this one
thing be attained, it is enough" \[JEROME\].

in word--Greek, "with word . . . with tongue, but in deed and truth."

[1 John 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jo1 3:19</span></span>

hereby--Greek, "herein"; in our loving in deed and in truth ([Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018).md).

we know--The oldest manuscripts have "we shall know," namely, if we
fulfil the command ([Jo1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018).md).

of the truth--that we are real disciples of, and belonging to, the
truth, as it is in Jesus: begotten of God with the word of truth. Having
herein the truth radically, we shall be sure not to love merely in word
and tongue. ([Jo1 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018).md).

assure--literally, "persuade," namely, so as to cease to condemn us;
satisfy the questionings and doubts of our consciences as to whether we
be accepted before God or not (compare [Mat
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#014.md); [Act
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md), "having made Blastus their
friend," literally, "persuaded"). The "heart," as the seat of the
feelings, is our inward judge; the conscience, as the witness, acts
either as our justifying advocate, or our condemning accuser, before God
even now. [Joh 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#009.md), has "conscience,"
but the passage is omitted in most old manuscripts. John nowhere else
uses the term "conscience." Peter and Paul alone use it.

before him--as in the sight of Him, the omniscient Searcher of hearts.
Assurance is designed to be the ordinary experience and privilege of the
believer.

[1 John 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020.md)

LUTHER and BENGEL take this verse as consoling the believer whom his
heart condemns; and who, therefore, like Peter, appeals from conscience
to Him who is greater than conscience. "Lord, Thou knowest all things:
thou knowest that I love Thee." Peter's conscience, though condemning
him of his sin in denying the Lord, assured him of his love; but fearing
the possibility, owing to his past fall, of deceiving himself, he
appeals to the all-knowing God: so Paul, [Co1
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#003.md). So if we be believers, even if
our heart condemns us of sin in general, yet having the one sign of
sonship, love, we may still assure our hearts (some oldest manuscripts
read heart, [Jo1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md), as well as [Jo1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020).md), as knowing that God is greater
than our heart, and knoweth all things. But thus the same Greek is
translated "because" in the beginning, and "(we know) that" in the
middle of the verse, and if the verse were consolatory, it probably
would have been, "Because EVEN if our heart condemn us," &c. Therefore
translate, "Because (rendering the reason why it has been stated in [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md) to be so important to 'assure our
hearts before Him') if our heart condemn (Greek, 'know \[aught\] against
us'; answering by contrast to 'we shall know that we are of the truth')
us (it is) because God is greater than our heart and knoweth all
things." If our heart judges us unfavorably, we may be sure that He,
knowing more than our heart knows, judges us more unfavorably still
\[ALFORD\]. A similar ellipsis ("it is") occurs in [Co1
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#027.md); [Co2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#006.md); [Co2
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023.md). The condemning testimony of our
conscience is not alone, but is the echo of the voice of Him who is
greater and knoweth all things. Our hypocrisy in loving by word and
tongue, not in deed and truth, does not escape even our conscience,
though weak and knowing but little, how much less God who knows all
things! Still the consolatory view may be the right one. For the Greek
for "we shall assure our hearts" (see on [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019).md), is gain over, persuade so as to
be stilled, implying that there was a previous state of
self-condemnation by the heart ([Jo1
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020).md), which, however, is got over by
the consolatory thought, "God is greater than my heart" which condemns
me, and "knows all things" (Greek "ginoskei," "knows," not
"kataginoskei," "condemns"), and therefore knows my love and desire to
serve Him, and knows my frame so as to pity my weakness of faith. This
gaining over the heart to peace is not so advanced a stage as the having
CONFIDENCE towards God which flows from a heart condemning us not. The
first "because" thus applies to the two alternate cases, [Jo1
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020.md) (giving the ground of saying,
that having love we shall gain over, or assure our minds before Him,
[Jo1 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019).md); the second "because"
applies to the first alternate alone, namely, "if our heart condemn us."
When he reaches the second alternate, [Jo1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md), he states it independently of
the former "because" which had connected it with [Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019.md), inasmuch as CONFIDENCE toward
God is a farther stage than persuading our hearts, though always
preceded by it.

[1 John 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jo1 3:21</span></span>

Beloved--There is no "But" contrasting the two cases, [Jo1
3:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020.md), because "Beloved"
sufficiently marks the transition to the case of the brethren walking in
the full confidence of love ([Jo1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#018).md). The two results of our being
able to "assure our hearts before Him" ([Jo1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#019).md), and of "our heart condemning us
not" (of insincerity as to the truth in general, and as to LOVE in
particular) are, (1) confidence toward God; (2) a sure answer to our
prayers. John does not mean that all whose hearts do not condemn them,
are therefore safe before God; for some have their conscience seared,
others are ignorant of the truth, and it is not only sincerity, but
sincerity in the truth which can save men. Christians are those meant
here: knowing Christ's precepts and testing themselves by them.

[1 John 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jo1 3:22</span></span>

we receive--as a matter of fact, according to His promise. Believers, as
such, ask only what is in accordance with God's will; or if they ask
what God wills not, they bow their will to God's will, and so God grants
them either their request, or something better than it.

because we keep his commandments--Compare [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018.md); [Psa
34:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015.md); [Psa
145:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md). Not as though our merits
earned a hearing for our prayers, but when we are believers in Christ,
all our works of faith being the fruit of His Spirit in us, are
"pleasing in God's sight"; and our prayers being the voice of the same
Spirit of God in us, naturally and necessarily are answered by Him.

[1 John 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jo1 3:23</span></span>

Summing up of God's commandments under the Gospel dispensation in one
commandment.

this is his commandment--singular: for faith and love are not separate
commandments, but are indissolubly united. We cannot truly love one
another without faith in Christ, nor can we truly believe in Him without
love.

believe--once for all; Greek aorist.

on the name of his Son--on all that is revealed in the Gospel concerning
Him, and on Himself in respect to His person, offices, and atoning work.

as he--as Jesus gave us commandment.

[1 John 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jo1 3:24</span></span>

dwelleth in him--The believer dwelleth in Christ.

and he in him--Christ in the believer. Reciprocity. "Thus he returns to
the great keynote of the Epistle, abide in Him, with which the former
part concluded" ([Jo1 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#028).md).

hereby--herein we (believers) know that he abideth in us, namely, from
(the presence in us of) the Spirit "which He hath given us." Thus he
prepares, by the mention of the true Spirit, for the transition to the
false "spirit," [Jo1 4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md); after
which he returns again to the subject of love.
