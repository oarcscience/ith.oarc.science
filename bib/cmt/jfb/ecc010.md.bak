### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

[Ecclesiastes 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 10:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 10:1-20)

Following up [Ecc 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018.md).

him that is in reputation--for example, David ([Sa2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#014)); Solomon (1Ki. 11:1-43.md);
Jehoshaphat (2Ch. 18:1-34; [Ch2 19:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#002).md);
Josiah ([Ch2 35:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2035.htm#022).md). The more delicate
the perfume, the more easily spoiled is the ointment. Common oil is not
so liable to injury. So the higher a man's religious character is, the
more hurt is caused by a sinful folly in him. Bad savor is endurable in
oil, but not in what professes to be, and is compounded by the perfumer
("apothecary") for, fragrance. "Flies" answer to "a little folly" (sin),
appropriately, being small ([Co1 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#006).md);
also, "Beelzebub" means prince of flies. "Ointment" answers to
"reputation" ([Ecc 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#001.md); [Gen
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#030).md). The verbs are singular, the
noun plural, implying that each of the flies causes the stinking savor.

[Ecclesiastes 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 10:2</span></span>

([Ecc 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#014).md).

right--The right hand is more expert than the left. The godly wise is
more on his guard than the foolish sinner, though at times he slip.
Better a diamond with a flaw, than a pebble without one.

[Ecclesiastes 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 10:3</span></span>

by the way--in his ordinary course; in his simplest acts ([Pro
6:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012).md). That he "saith," virtually,
"that he" himself, &c. \[Septuagint\]. But Vulgate, "He thinks that
every one (else whom he meets) is a fool."

[Ecclesiastes 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 10:4</span></span>

spirit--anger.

yielding pacifieth-- ([Pro 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001).md). This
explains "leave not thy place"; do not in a resisting spirit withdraw
from thy post of duty ([Ecc 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#003).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 10:5</span></span>

as--rather, "by reason of an error" \[MAURER and HOLDEN\].

[Ecclesiastes 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 10:6</span></span>

rich--not in mere wealth, but in wisdom, as the antithesis to "folly"
(for "foolish men") shows. So Hebrew, rich, equivalent to "liberal," in
a good sense ([Isa 32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005).md). Mordecai and
Haman ([Est 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/est003.htm#001.md); [Est
6:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/est006.htm#006).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 10:7</span></span>

servants upon horses--the worthless exalted to dignity ([Jer
17:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#025).md); and vice versa ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 10:8</span></span>

The fatal results to kings of such an unwise policy; the wrong done to
others recoils on themselves ([Ecc
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#009).md); they fall into the pit which
they dug for others ([Est 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/est007.htm#010.md); [Psa
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md); [Pro
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#027).md). Breaking through the wise
fences of their throne, they suffer unexpectedly themselves; as when one
is stung by a serpent lurking in the stones of his neighbor's garden
wall ([Psa 80:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012).md), which he
maliciously pulls down ([Amo 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 10:9</span></span>

removeth stones--namely, of an ancient building \[WEISS\]. His
neighbor's landmarks \[HOLDEN\]. Cuts out from the quarry \[MAURER\].

endangered--by the splinters, or by the head of the hatchet, flying back
on himself. Pithy aphorisms are common in the East. The sense is:
Violations of true wisdom recoil on the perpetrators.

[Ecclesiastes 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 10:10</span></span>

iron . . . blunt--in "cleaving wood" ([Ecc
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#009).md), answering to the "fool set in
dignity" ([Ecc 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#006).md), who wants
sharpness. More force has then to be used in both cases; but "force"
without judgment "endangers" one's self. Translate, "If one hath blunted
his iron" \[MAURER\]. The preference of rash to judicious counsellors,
which entailed the pushing of matters by force, proved to be the "hurt"
of Rehoboam (1Ki. 12:1-33).

wisdom is profitable to direct--to a prosperous issue. Instead of
forcing matters by main "strength" to one's own hurt ([Ecc
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016.md), [Ecc
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#018).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 10:11</span></span>

A "serpent will bite" if "enchantment" is not used; "and a babbling
calumniator is no better." Therefore, as one may escape a serpent by
charms ([Psa 58:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#004).md), so one may
escape the sting of a calumniator by discretion ([Ecc
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012).md), \[HOLDEN\]. Thus, "without
enchantment" answers to "not whet the edge" ([Ecc
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#010).md), both expressing, figuratively,
want of judgment. MAURER translates, "There is no gain to the enchanter"
(Margin, "master of the tongue") from his enchantments, because the
serpent bites before he can use them; hence the need of continual
caution. [Ecc 10:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#008.md), caution in
acting; [Ecc 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011.md) and following
verses, caution in speaking.

[Ecclesiastes 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 10:12</span></span>

gracious--Thereby he takes precaution against sudden injury ([Ecc
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#011).md).

swallow up himself-- ([Pro 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#008.md), [Pro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#014.md), [Pro
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#021.md), [Pro
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#032.md); [Pro
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#013.md); [Pro
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#002.md); [Pro
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#011).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 10:13</span></span>

Illustrating the folly and injuriousness of the fool's words; last
clause of [Ecc 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#012.md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 10:14</span></span>

full of words-- ([Ecc 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#002).md).

a man cannot tell what shall be-- ([Ecc
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022.md); [Ecc
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#012.md); [Ecc
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#007.md); [Ecc
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#002.md); [Pro
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#001).md). If man, universally (including
the wise man), cannot foresee the future, much less can the fool; his
"many words" are therefore futile.

[Ecclesiastes 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 10:15</span></span>

labour . . . wearieth-- ([Isa 55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002.md);
[Hab 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#013).md).

knoweth not how to go to the city--proverb for ignorance of the most
ordinary matters ([Ecc 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#003).md);
spiritually, the heavenly city ([Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007.md); [Mat
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013).md). MAURER connects [Ecc
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#015.md) with the following verses. The
labor (vexation) caused by the foolish (injurious princes, [Ecc
10:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#004).md) harasses him who "knows not
how to go to the city," to ingratiate himself with them there. English
Version is simpler.

[Ecclesiastes 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 10:16</span></span>

a child--given to pleasures; behaves with childish levity. Not in years;
for a nation may be happy under a young prince, as Josiah.

eat in the morning--the usual time for dispensing justice in the East
([Jer 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#012).md); here, given to feasting
([Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md); [Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015).md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 10:17</span></span>

son of nobles--not merely in blood, but in virtue, the true nobility
([Sol 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol007.htm#001.md); [Isa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#005.md), [Isa
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#008).md).

in due season-- ([Ecc 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001).md), not until
duty has first been attended to.

for strength--to refresh the body, not for revelry (included in
"drunkenness").

[Ecclesiastes 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 10:18</span></span>

building--literally, "the joining of the rafters," namely, the kingdom
([Ecc 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016.md); [Isa
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006.md); [Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011).md).

hands-- ([Ecc 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#005.md); [Pro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#010).md).

droppeth--By neglecting to repair the roof in time, the rain gets
through.

[Ecclesiastes 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 10:19</span></span>

Referring to [Ecc 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#018.md). Instead of
repairing the breaches in the commonwealth (equivalent to "building"),
the princes "make a feast for laughter ([Ecc
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016).md), and wine maketh their life
glad ([Psa 104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015)), and (but.md) money
supplieth (answereth their wishes by supplying) all things," that is,
they take bribes to support their extravagance; and hence arise the
wrongs that are perpetrated ([Ecc
10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#005.md); [Ecc
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016.md); [Isa
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023.md); [Isa
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#023).md). MAURER takes "all things" of
the wrongs to which princes are instigated by "money"; for example, the
heavy taxes, which were the occasion of Rehoboam losing ten tribes ([Kg1
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#004), &c..md).

[Ecclesiastes 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ecc 10:20</span></span>

thought--literally, "consciousness."

rich--the great. The language, as applied to earthly princes knowing the
"thought," is figurative. But it literally holds good of the King of
kings (Psa. 139:1-24), whose consciousness of every evil thought we
should ever realize.

bed-chamber--the most secret place ([Kg2
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#012).md).

bird of the air, &c.--proverbial (compare [Hab
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#011.md); [Luk
19:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#040).md); in a way as marvellous and
rapid, as if birds or some winged messenger carried to the king
information of the curse so uttered. In the East superhuman sagacity was
attributed to birds (see on [Job
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#021); hence the proverb.md).
