### [Genesis Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001)

[Genesis 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 18:1</span></span>

ENTERTAINMENT OF ANGELS. ([Gen 18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001))

the Lord appeared--another manifestation of the divine presence, more
familiar than any yet narrated; and more like that in the fulness of
time, when the Word was made flesh.

plains of Mamre--rather, terebinth or oak of Mamre; a tall-spreading
tree or grove of trees.

sat in the tent door--The tent itself being too close and sultry at
noon, the shaded open front is usually resorted to for the air that may
be stirring.

[Genesis 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 18:2</span></span>

lift up his eyes . . . and, lo, three men--Travellers in that quarter
start at sunrise and continue till midday when they look out for some
resting-place.

he ran to meet them--When the visitor is an ordinary person, the host
merely rises; but if of superior rank, the custom is to advance a little
towards the stranger, and after a very low bow, turn and lead him to the
tent, putting an arm round his waist, or tapping him on the shoulder as
they go, to assure him of welcome.

[Genesis 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 18:3</span></span>

My Lord, if now I have found favor--The hospitalities offered are just
of the kind that are necessary and most grateful, the refreshment of
water, for feet exposed to dust and heat by the sandals, being still the
first observed among the pastoral people of Hebron.

[Genesis 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 18:5</span></span>

for therefore are ye come--No questions were asked. But Abraham knew
their object by the course they took--approaching directly in front of
the chief sheik's tent, which is always distinguishable from the rest
and thus showing their wish to be his guests.

[Genesis 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gen 18:6</span></span>

Abraham hastened . . . unto Sarah . . . make cakes upon the
hearth--Bread is baked daily, no more than is required for family use,
and always by the women, commonly the wife. It is a short process. Flour
mixed with water is made into dough, and being rolled out into cakes, it
is placed on the earthen floor, previously heated by a fire. The fire
being removed, the cakes are laid on the ground, and being covered over
with hot embers, are soon baked, and eaten the moment they are taken
off.

[Genesis 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gen 18:7</span></span>

Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf--Animal food is never
provided, except for visitors of a superior rank when a kid or lamb is
killed. A calf is still a higher stretch of hospitality, and it would
probably be cooked as is usually done when haste is required--either by
roasting it whole or by cutting it up into small pieces and broiling
them on skewers over the fire. It is always eaten along with boiled corn
swimming in butter or melted fat, into which every morsel of meat, laid
upon a piece of bread, is dipped, before being conveyed by the fingers
to the mouth.

[Genesis 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 18:8</span></span>

milk--A bowl of camel's milk ends the repast.

he stood by them under the tree--The host himself, even though he has a
number of servants, deems it a necessary act of politeness to stand
while his guests are at their food, and Abraham evidently did this
before he was aware of the real character of his visitors.

[Genesis 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 18:10</span></span>

REPROOF OF SARAH. An inquiry about his wife, so surprising in strangers,
the subject of conversation, and the fulfilment of the fondly cherished
promise within a specified time, showed Abraham that he had been
entertaining more than ordinary travellers ([Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002)). ([Gen
18:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#009))

Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him--The women's
apartment is in the back of the tent, divided by a thin partition from
the men's.

[Genesis 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gen 18:12</span></span>

Therefore Sarah laughed within herself--Long delay seems to have
weakened faith. Sarah treated the announcement as incredible, and when
taxed with the silent sneer, she added falsehood to distrust. It was an
aggravated offense ([Act 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004)), and
nothing but grace saved her ([Rom
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018)).

[Genesis 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 18:16</span></span>

DISCLOSURE OF SODOM'S DOOM. ([Gen
18:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#016))

the men rose . . . Abraham went with them--It is customary for a host to
escort his guests a little way.

[Genesis 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 18:17</span></span>

the Lord said, Shall I hide--The chief stranger, no other than the Lord,
disclosed to Abraham the awful doom about to be inflicted on Sodom and
the cities of the plain for their enormous wickedness.

[Genesis 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 18:21</span></span>

I will go down . . . and see--language used after the manner of men.
These cities were to be made examples to all future ages of God's
severity; and therefore ample proof given that the judgment was neither
rash nor excessive ([Eze 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023); [Jer
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007)).

[Genesis 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">gen 18:23</span></span>

ABRAHAM'S INTERCESSION. ([Gen
18:23-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023))

Abraham drew near, and said, &c.--The scene described is full of
interest and instruction--showing in an unmistakable manner the efficacy
of prayer and intercession. (See also [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008); [Jam
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)). Abraham reasoned justly as to
the rectitude of the divine procedure ([Rom
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005)), and many guilty cities and
nations have been spared on account of God's people ([Mat
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013); [Mat
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#022)).

[Genesis 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">gen 18:33</span></span>

the Lord . . . left communing . . . and Abraham returned unto his
place--Why did Abraham cease to carry his intercessions farther? Either
because he fondly thought that he was now sure of the cities being
preserved ([Luk 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#009)), or because the
Lord restrained his mind from further intercession ([Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016); [Jer
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014)). But there were not ten
"righteous persons." There was only one, and he might without injustice
have perished in the general overthrow ([Ecc
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)). But a difference is sometimes
made, and on this occasion the grace of God was manifested in a signal
manner for the sake of Abraham. What a blessing to be connected with a
saint of God!
