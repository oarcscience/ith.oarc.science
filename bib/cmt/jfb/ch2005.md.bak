### [2 Chronicles Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 5:1</span></span>

THE DEDICATED TREASURES. ([Ch2 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#001).md)

Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had
dedicated--the immense sums and the store of valuable articles which his
father and other generals had reserved and appropriated for the temple
([Ch1 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#014.md); [Ch1
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch1026.htm#026).md).

[2 Chronicles 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 5:2</span></span>

BRINGING UP OF THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. ([Ch2
5:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002).md)

Then Solomon assembled . . . in the feast which was in the seventh
month--The feast of the dedication of the temple was on the eighth day
of that month. This is related, word for word, the same as in [Kg1
8:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#001.md).

[2 Chronicles 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 5:9</span></span>

there it is unto this day--that is, at the time when this history was
composed; for after the Babylonish captivity there is no trace of either
ark or staves.

[2 Chronicles 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 5:11</span></span>

all the priests that were present . . . did not then wait by course--The
rotation system of weekly service introduced by David was intended for
the ordinary duties of the priesthood; on extraordinary occasions, or
when more than wonted solemnity attached to them, the priests attended
in a body.

[2 Chronicles 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 5:12</span></span>

the Levites which were the singers--On great and solemn occasions, such
as this, a full choir was required, and their station was taken with
scrupulous regard to their official parts: the family of Heman occupied
the central place, the family of Asaph stood on his right, and that of
Jeduthun on his left; the place allotted to the vocal department was a
space between the court of Israel and the altar in the east end of the
priests' court.

with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets--The
trumpet was always used by the priests, and in the divine service it was
specially employed in calling the people together during the holy
solemnities, and in drawing attention to new and successive parts of the
ritual. The number of trumpets used in the divine service could not be
less than two ([Num 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002).md), and their
greatest number never exceeded the precedent set at the dedication of
the temple. The station where the priests were sounding with trumpets
was apart from that of the other musicians; for while the Levite singers
occupied an orchestra east of the altar, the priests stood at the marble
table on the southwest of the altar. There both of them stood with their
faces to the altar. The manner of blowing the trumpets was, first, by a
long plain blast, then by one with breakings and quaverings, and then by
a long plain blast again \[BROWN, Jewish Antiquities\].

[2 Chronicles 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 5:13</span></span>

the house was filled with a cloud--(See on [Kg1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#010).md).
