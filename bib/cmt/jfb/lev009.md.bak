[Leviticus 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#001.md)

THE PRIESTS' ENTRY INTO OFFICE. (Lev. 9:1-24)

Moses called . . . Take thee a young calf for a sin offering--The
directions in these sacred things were still given by Moses, the
circumstances being extraordinary. But he was only the medium of
communicating the divine will to the newly made priests. The first of
their official acts was the sacrifice of another sin offering to atone
for the defects of the inauguration services; and yet that sacrifice did
not consist of a bullock--the sacrifice appointed for some particular
transgression, but of a calf, perhaps not without a significant
reference to Aaron's sin in the golden calf \[[Exo
32:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022.md)\]. Then followed a burnt
offering, expressive of their voluntary and entire self-devotement to
the divine service. The newly consecrated priests having done this on
their own account, they were called to offer a sin offering and burnt
offering for the people, ending the ceremonial by a peace offering,
which was a sacred feast. This injunction, "to make atonement for
himself and for the people" (Septuagint, "for thy family"), at the
commencement of his sacred functions, furnishes a striking evidence of
the divine origin of the Jewish system of worship. In all false or
corrupt forms of religion, the studied policy has been to inspire the
people with an idea of the sanctity of the priesthood as in point of
purity and favor with the Divinity far above the level of other men. But
among the Hebrews the priests were required to offer for the expiation
of their own sins as well as the humblest of the people. This
imperfection of Aaron's priesthood, however, does not extend to the
gospel dispensation: for our great High Priest, who has entered for us
into "the true tabernacle," "knew no sin" ([Heb
10:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010).md).

[Leviticus 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#008.md)

Aaron . . . went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
offering--Whether it had been enjoined the first time, or was
unavoidable from the divisions of the priestly labor not being as yet
completely arranged, Aaron, assisted by his sons, appears to have slain
the victims with his own hands, as well as gone through all the
prescribed ritual at the altar.

[Leviticus 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 9:17</span></span>

meat offering . . . wave offering--It is observable that there is no
notice taken of these in the offerings the priests made for themselves.
They could not bear their own sins: and therefore, instead of eating any
part of their own sin offering, as they were at liberty to do in the
case of the people's offering, they had to carry the whole carcasses
"without the camp and burn them with fire" \[[Exo
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014.md); [Lev
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#012.md)\].

[Leviticus 9:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 9:22</span></span>

Aaron lifted up his hand . . . and blessed them--The pronouncing of a
benediction on the people assembled in the court was a necessary part of
the high priest's duty, and the formula in which it was to be given is
described ([Num 6:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023).md).

came down from offering--The altar was elevated above the level of the
floor, and the ascent was by a gentle slope ([Exo
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#026).md).

[Leviticus 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">lev 9:23</span></span>

Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle--Moses, according to the divine
instructions he had received, accompanied Aaron and his sons to initiate
them into their sacred duties. Their previous occupations had detained
them at the altar, and they now entered in company into the sacred
edifice to bear the blood of the offerings within the sanctuary.

the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people--perhaps in a
resplendent effulgence above the tabernacle as a fresh token of the
divine acceptance of that newly established seat of His worship.

[Leviticus 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 9:24</span></span>

there came a fire out from . . . the Lord--A flame emanating from that
resplendent light that filled the holy place flashed upon the brazen
altar and kindled the sacrifices. This miraculous fire--for the descent
of which the people had probably been prepared, and which the priests
were enjoined never to let go out ([Lev
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#013).md) --was a sign, not only of the
acceptance of the offerings and of the establishment of Aaron's
authority, but of God's actual residence in that chosen dwelling-place.
The moment the solemn though welcome spectacle was seen, a simultaneous
shout of joy and gratitude burst from the assembled congregation, and in
the attitude of profoundest reverence they worshipped "a present Deity."
