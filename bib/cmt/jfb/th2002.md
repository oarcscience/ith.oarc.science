### [2 Thessalonians Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)

[2 Thessalonians 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th2 2:1</span></span>

CORRECTION OF THEIR ERROR AS TO CHRIST'S IMMEDIATE COMING. THE APOSTASY
THAT MUST PRECEDE IT. EXHORTATION TO STEADFASTNESS, INTRODUCED WITH
THANKSGIVING FOR THEIR ELECTION BY GOD. (2Th. 2:1-17)

Now--rather, "But"; marking the transition from his prayers for them to
entreaties to them.

we beseech you--or "entreat you." He uses affectionate entreaty, rather
than stern reproof, to win them over to the right view.

by--rather, "with respect to"; as the Greek for "of" ([Co2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008)).

our gathering together unto him--the consummating or final gathering
together of the saints to Him at His coming, as announced, [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031); [Th1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017). The Greek noun is nowhere else
found except in [Heb 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025), said of
the assembling together of believers for congregational worship. Our
instinctive fears of the judgment are dispelled by the thought of being
gathered together UNTO HIM ("even as the hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings"), which ensures our safety.

[2 Thessalonians 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th2 2:2</span></span>

soon--on trifling grounds, without due consideration.

shaken--literally, "tossed" as ships tossed by an agitated sea. Compare
for the same image, [Eph 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).

in mind--rather as the Greek, "from your mind," that is, from your
mental steadfastness on the subject.

troubled--This verb applies to emotional agitation; as "shaken" to
intellectual.

by spirit--by a person professing to have the spirit of prophecy ([Co1
12:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008); [Jo1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)). The Thessalonians had been
warned ([Th1 5:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#020)) to "prove" such
professed prophesyings, and to "hold fast (only) that which is good."

by word--of mouth (compare [Th2 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005),
[Th2 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015)); some word or saying
alleged to be that of Paul, orally communicated. If oral tradition was
liable to such perversion in the apostolic age (compare a similar
instance, [Joh 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#023)), how much more
in our age!

by letter as from us--purporting to be from us, whereas it is a forgery.
Hence he gives a test by which to know his genuine letters ([Th2
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017)).

day of Christ--The oldest manuscripts read, "day of the Lord."

is at hand--rather, "is immediately imminent," literally, "is present";
"is instantly coming." Christ and His apostles always taught that the
day of the Lord's coming is at hand; and it is not likely that Paul
would imply anything contrary here; what he denies is, that it is so
immediately imminent, instant, or present, as to justify the neglect of
everyday worldly duties. CHRYSOSTOM, and after him ALFORD, translates,
"is (already) present" (compare [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)), a kindred error. But in [Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001), the same Greek verb is translated
"come." WAHL supports this view. The Greek is usually used of actual
presence; but is quite susceptible of the translation, "is all but
present."

[2 Thessalonians 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th2 2:3</span></span>

by any means--Greek, "in any manner." Christ, in [Mat
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#004), gives the same warning in
connection with the same event. He had indicated three ways ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)) in which they might be deceived
(compare other ways, [Th2 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009), and
[Mat 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005), [Mat
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024)).

a falling away--rather as the Greek, "the falling away," or "apostasy,"
namely, the one of which "I told you" before ([Th2
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005)), "when I was yet with you," and
of which the Lord gave some intimation ([Mat
24:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010); [Joh
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043)).

that man of sin be revealed--The Greek order is, "And there have been
revealed the man of sin." As Christ was first in mystery, and afterwards
revealed ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)), so Antichrist
(the term used [Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018); [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)) is first in mystery, and
afterwards shall be developed and revealed ([Th2
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)). As righteousness found its
embodiment in Christ, "the Lord our righteousness," so "sin" shall have
its embodiment in "the man of sin." The hindering power meanwhile
restrains its manifestation; when that shall be removed, then this
manifestation shall take place. The articles, "the apostasy," and "the
man of sin," may also refer to their being well known as foretold in
[Dan 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008), [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025), "the little horn speaking great
words against the Most High, and thinking to change times and laws"; and
[Dan 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036), the wilful king who "shall
exalt and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous
things against the God of gods; neither shall he regard any god."

the son of perdition--a title applied besides to Judas (the traitor,
[Joh 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012)), and to none else.
Antichrist (the second "beast" coming up out of the earth); therefore he
shall at first be "like a lamb, while he speaks as a dragon" ([Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011)); "coming in peaceably and by
flatteries," "working deceitfully," but "his heart shall be against the
holy covenant" ([Dan 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#021), [Dan
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#023), [Dan
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#028), [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030)). Seeds of "the falling away"
soon appear ([Ti1 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)), but the full
development and concentration of these anti-Christian elements in one
person are still to appear. Contrast the King of Zion's coming as JESUS:
(1) righteous or just; (2) having salvation; (3) lowly; whereas
Antichrist is: (1) "the man of (the embodiment of) sin; (2) the son of
perdition; (3) exalting himself above all that is worshipped. He is the
son of perdition, as consigning many to it, and finally doomed to it
himself ([Rev 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008), [Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)). "He whose essence and
inheritance is perdition" \[ALFORD\]. As "the kingdom of heaven" is
first brought before us in the abstract, then in the concrete, the King,
the Lord Jesus; so here, first we have ([Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)) "the mystery of iniquity," then
"the iniquitous one" ([Th2 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)).
Doubtless "the apostasy" of Romanism (the abstract) is one of the
greatest instances of the working of the mystery of iniquity, and its
blasphemous claims for the Pope (the concrete) are forerunners of the
final concentration of blasphemy in the man of sin, who shall not
merely, as the Pope, usurp God's honor as vicegerent of God, but oppose
God openly at last.

[2 Thessalonians 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th2 2:4</span></span>

[Dan 11:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036) is here referred to. The
words used there as to Antiochus Epiphanes, Paul implies, shall even be
more applicable to the man of sin, who is the New Testament actual
Antichrist, as Antiochus was the Old Testament typical Antichrist. The
previous world kingdoms had each one extraordinary person as its
representative head and embodiment (thus Babylon had Nebuchadnezzar,
[Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038), end; Medo-Persia had Cyrus;
Greece had Alexander, and Antiochus Epiphanes, the forerunner of
Antichrist); so the fourth and last world kingdom, under which we now
live, shall have one final head, the concentrated embodiment of all the
sin and lawless iniquity which have been in pagan and papal Rome. Rome's
final phase will probably be an unholy alliance between idolatrous
superstition and godless infidelity.

Who opposeth and exalteth himself--There is but one Greek article to
both participles, implying that the reason why he opposeth himself is in
order that he may exalt himself above, &c. ALFORD takes the former
clause absolutely, "He that withstands (CHRIST)," that is, Antichrist
([Jo1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018)). As at the conclusion of
the Old Testament period, Israel apostate allied itself with the heathen
world power against Jesus and His apostles ([Luk
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#012); and at Thessalonica, [Act
17:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)), and was in righteous
retribution punished by the instrumentality of the world power itself
(Jerusalem being destroyed by Rome), [Dan
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026); so the degenerate Church
(become an "harlot"), allying itself with the godless world power (the
"beast" of Revelation) against vital religion (that is, the harlot
sitting on the beast), shall be judged by that world power which shall
be finally embodied in Antichrist ([Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002); [Rev
17:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016)). In this early Epistle, the
apostate Jewish Church as the harlot, and pagan Rome as the beast, form
the historical background on which Paul draws his prophetic sketch of
the apostasy. In the Pastoral Epistles, which were later, this prophecy
appears in connection with Gnosticism, which had at that time infected
the Church. The harlot (the apostate Church) is first to be judged by
the beast (the world power) and its kings ([Rev
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#016)); and afterwards the beasts and
their allies (with the personal Antichrist at their head, who seems to
rise after the judgment on the harlot, or apostate Church) shall be
judged by the coming of Jesus Himself ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)). Anti-Christian tendencies
produce different Antichrists: these separate Antichrists shall
hereafter find their consummation in an individual exceeding them all in
the intensity of his evil character \[AUBERLEN\]. But judgment soon
overtakes him. He is necessarily a child of death, immediately after his
ascent as the beast out of the bottomless pit going into perdition ([Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008), [Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)). Idolatry of self, spiritual
pride, and rebellion against God, are his characteristics; as
Christ-worship, humility, and dependence on God, characterize
Christianity. He not merely assumes Christ's character (as the "false
Christs," [Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024)), but "opposes"
Christ. The Greek implies one situated on an opposite side (compare [Jo1
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022); [Jo2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#007)). One who, on the destruction of
every religion, shall seek to establish his own throne, and for God's
great truth, "God is man," to substitute his own lie, "Man is God"
\[TRENCH\].

above all that is called God-- ([Co1
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005)). The Pope (for instance, Clement
VI) has even commanded the angels to admit into Paradise, without the
alleged pains of purgatory, certain souls. But still this is only a
foreshadowing of the Antichrist, who will not, as the Pope, act in God's
name, but against God.

or that is worshipped--Rome here again gives a presage of Antichrist.
The Greek is Sebasma; and Sebastus is the Greek for Augustus, who was
worshipped as the secular ruler and divine vicegerent. The papacy has
risen on the overthrow of CÃ&brvbr;sar's power. Antichrist shall exalt
himself above every object of worship, whether on earth as the
CÃ&brvbr;sar, or in heaven as God. The various prefigurations of
Antichrist, Mohammed, Rome, Napoleon, and modern infidel secularism,
contain only some, not all, his characteristics. It is the union of all
in some one person that shall form the full Antichrist, as the union in
one Person, Jesus, of all the types and prophecies constituted the full
Christ \[OLSHAUSEN\].

in the temple of God . . . that he is God--"He will reign a time, times,
and half a time" ([Dan 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025)), that is,
three and a half years, and will sit in the temple at Jerusalem: then
the Lord shall come from heaven and cast him into the take of fire and
shall bring to the saints the times of their reigning, the seventh day
of hallowed rest, and give to Abraham the promised inheritance"
\[IRENÃ†US, Against Heresies, 30.4\].

showing himself--with blasphemous and arrogant DISPLAY (compare a type,
[Act 12:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021)). The earliest Fathers
unanimously looked for a personal Antichrist. Two objections exist to
Romanism being regarded the Antichrist, though probably Romanism will
leave its culmination in him: (1) So far is Romanism from opposing all
that is called God, that adoration of gods and lords many (the Virgin
Mary and saints) is a leading feature in it; (2) the papacy has existed
for more than twelve centuries, and yet Christ is not come, whereas the
prophecy regards the final Antichrist as short-lived, and soon going to
perdition through the coming of Christ ([Rev
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#008), [Rev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)). Gregory the Great declared
against the patriarch of Constantinople, that whosoever should assume
the title of "universal bishop" would be "the forerunner of Antichrist."
The papacy fulfilled this his undesigned prophecy. The Pope has been
called by his followers, "Our Lord God the Pope"; and at his
inauguration in St. Peter's, seated in his chair upon the high altar,
which is treated as his footstool, he has vividly foreshadowed him who
"exalteth himself above all that is called God." An objection fatal to
interpreting the temple of God here as the Church ([Co1
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)) is, the apostle would never
designate the apostate anti-Christian Church "the temple of God." It is
likely that, as Messiah was revealed among the Jews at Jerusalem, so
Antimessiah shall appear among them when restored to their own land, and
after they have rebuilt their temple at Jerusalem. Thus [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041), [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045) (see on [Dan
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041); [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045)), corresponds, "He shall enter
the glorious land (Judea), and he shall plant the tabernacles of his
palaces between the seas in the glorious holy mountain"; and then ([Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)) "Michael, the great prince,
shall stand up" to deliver God's people. Compare Note, see on [Dan
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026). Also the king of Assyria,
type of Antichrist ([Isa 14:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012)).
"Lucifer" (a title of Messiah, assumed by Antichrist, [Rev
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#016)); "I will exalt my throne above
the stars of God." "I will sit upon the mount of the congregation (that
is, God's place of meeting His people of old, the temple), in the sides
of the north ([Psa 48:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002)); I will be
like the Most High." [Rev 11:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#001), "The
temple of God . . . the holy city" (namely, Jerusalem, [Mat
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005)), compare [Psa
68:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#018), [Psa
68:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#029), referring to a period since
Christ's ascension, therefore not yet fulfilled ([Isa
2:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001); Eze. 40:1-44:31; [Zac
14:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016); [Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)). "In the temple of God," implies
that it an internal, not an external, enemy which shall assail the
Church. Antichrist shall, the first three and a half years of the
prophetical week, keep the covenant, then break it and usurp divine
honors in the midst of the week. Some think Antichrist will be a Jew. At
all events he will, "by flatteries," bring many, not only of the
Gentiles, but also of "the tribes" of Israel (so the Greek for
"kindreds," [Rev 11:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008)), to own him
as their long-looked-for Messiah, in the same "city where our Lord was
crucified." "Sitteth" here implies his occupying the place of power and
majesty in opposition to Him who "sitteth on the right hand of the
Majesty on high" ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)), and who
shall come to "sit" there where the usurper had sat ([Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)). See on [Dan
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027); [Rev
11:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002), [Rev
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#009), [Rev
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#011). Compare [Eze
38:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#002), [Eze
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#006), [Eze
38:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#009), [Eze
38:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#013), [Eze
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#016), as to Tyre, the type of
Antichrist, characterized by similar blasphemous arrogance.

[2 Thessalonians 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th2 2:5</span></span>

Remember, &c.--confuting those who represent Paul as having labored
under error as to Christ's immediate coming when writing his first
Epistle, and as now correcting that error.

I told you--more than once, literally, "I was telling," or "used to
tell."

[2 Thessalonians 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th2 2:6</span></span>

now ye know--by my having told you. The power must have been one "known"
to the Thessalonians.

what withholdeth--that which holds him back; "keeps him in check": the
power that has restrained the man of sin from his full and final
development, is the moral and conservative influence of political states
\[OLSHAUSEN\]: the fabric of human polity as a coercive power; as "he
who now letteth" refers to those who rule that polity by which the great
upbursting of godlessness is kept down \[ALFORD\]. The "what
withholdeth" refers to the general hindrance; "he who now letteth," to
the person in whom that hindrance is summed up. Romanism, as a
forerunner of Antichrist, was thus kept in check by the Romanemperor
(the then representative of the coercive power) until Constantine,
having removed the seat of empire to Constantinople, the Roman bishop by
degrees first raised himself to precedency, then to primacy, and then to
sole empire above the secular power. The historical fact from which Paul
starts in his prediction was probably the emperor Claudius' expulsion of
the Jews, the representative of the anti-Christian adversary in Paul's
day, from Rome, thus "withholding" them in some degree in their attacks
on Christianity; this suggested the principle holding good to the end of
time, and about to find its final fulfilment in the removal of the
withholding person or authority, whereupon Antichrist in his worst shape
shall start up.

that he might be--Greek, "in order that": ye know that which keeps him
back, in God's purposes, from being sooner manifested, "in order that he
may be revealed in his own time" (that is, the time appointed by God to
him as his proper time for being manifested), not sooner (compare [Dan
11:35](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#035)). The removal of the withholding
power will be when the civil polity, derived from the Roman empire,
which is to be, in its last form, divided into ten kingdoms ([Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003), [Rev
17:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#011)), shall, with its leading
representative head for the time being ("he who now letteth," Greek,
"withholdeth," as in [Th2 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006)), yield
to the prevalent godless "lawlessness" with "the lawless one" as its
embodiment. The elect Church and the Spirit cannot well be, as DE BURGH
suggests, the withholding power meant; for both shall never be wholly
"taken out of the way" ([Mat 28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)).
However, the testimony of the elect Church, and the Spirit in her, are
the great hindrance to the rise of the apostasy; and it is possible
that, though the Lord shall have a faithful few even then, yet the full
energy of the Spirit in the visible Church, counteracting the energy or
"working" of "the mystery of lawlessness" by the testimony of the elect,
shall have been so far "taken out of the way," or set aside, as to admit
the manifestation of "the lawless one"; and so DE BURGH'S'S view may be
right ([Luk 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008); [Rev
11:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#003)). This was a power of which
the Thessalonians might easily "know" through Paul's instruction.

[2 Thessalonians 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th2 2:7</span></span>

the mystery of iniquity--the counterwork to "the mystery of godliness"
([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)). Anti-Christianity
latently working, as distinguished from its final open manifestation.
"Mystery" in Scripture means, not what remains always a secret, but that
which is for a while hidden, but in due time manifested (compare [Eph
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004)). Satan will resort to a mode of
opposition more conformed to the then imminent "appearing" and
"presence" of the Saviour, and will anticipate Him with a last effort to
maintain the dominion of the world \[DE BURGH\], just as at His first
advent he rushed into open opposition, by taking possession of the
bodies of men. "Iniquity," Greek, "lawlessness"; defiant rejection of
God's law (compare Note, see on [Zac
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009), [Zac
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#010)). "Wickedness" (translated by the
Septuagint by the same Greek, meaning "lawlessness," which Paul employs
here), embodied there as a woman, answers to "the mystery of iniquity,"
here embodied finally in "the man of sin": as the former was ultimately
banished for ever from the Holy Land to her own congenial soil, Babylon,
so iniquity and the man of sin shall fall before Michael and the Lord
Himself, who shall appear as the Deliverer of His people ([Dan
12:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001); [Zac
14:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003)). Compare [Mat
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#043). The Jewish nation dispossessed
of the evil spirit, the demon of idolatry being cast out through the
Babylonian captivity, receives ultimately a worse form of the evil
spirit, Christ-opposing self-righteousness. Also, the Christian Church
in course of time taken possession of by the demon of Romish idolatry,
then dispossessed of it by the Reformation, then its house "garnished"
by hypocrisy, secularity, and rationalism, but "swept empty" of living
faith, then finally apostatizing and repossessed by "the man of sin,"
and outwardly destroyed for a brief time (though even then Christ shall
have witnesses for Him among both the Jews, [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009), and Gentiles, [Mat
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)), when Christ shall suddenly
come ([Dan 11:32-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032); [Luk
18:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#007)).

already-- ([Jo2 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#009); [Col
2:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)); compare "even now already" ([Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018); [Jo1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#003)) as distinguished from "in his own
time" of being revealed hereafter. Antiquity, it appears from hence, is
not a justification for unscriptural usages or dogmas, since these were
"already," even in Paul's time, beginning to spring up: the written word
is the only sure test. "Judaism infecting Christianity is the fuel; the
mystery of iniquity is the spark." "It is one and the same impurity
diffusing itself over many ages" \[BENGEL\].

only he who now letteth will let--The italicized words are not in the
Greek. Therefore, translate rather, "only (that is, the continuance of
the MYSTERY of iniquity-working will be only) until he who now
withholdeth (the same Greek as in [Th2
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006)) be taken out of the way." "Only
(waiting, [Heb 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013)) until he," &c.
Then it will work no longer in mystery, but in open manifestation.

[2 Thessalonians 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th2 2:8</span></span>

Translate, "the lawless one"; the embodiment of all the godless
"lawlessness" which has been working in "mystery" for ages ([Th2
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#007)) : "the man of sin" ([Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)).

whom the Lord--Some of the oldest manuscripts read, "the Lord Jesus."
How awful that He whose very name means God-Saviour, should appear as
the Destroyer; but the salvation of the Church requires the destruction
of her foe. As the reign of Israel in Canaan was ushered in by judgments
on the nations for apostasy (for the Canaanites were originally
worshippers of the true God: thus Melchisedek, king of Salem, was the
"priest of the most high God," [Gen
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018) : Ammon and Moab came from
righteous Lot), so the Son of David's reign in Zion and over the whole
earth, is to be ushered in by judgments on the apostate Christian world.

consume . . . and . . . destroy--So [Dan
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026), "consume and destroy"; [Dan
11:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#045). He shall "consume" him by His
mere breath ([Isa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033)) : the sentence of judgment
being the sharp sword that goeth out of His mouth ([Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015), [Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021)). Antichrist's manifestation and
destruction are declared in the same breath; at his greatest height he
is nearest his fall, like Herod his type ([Isa
1:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024); [Act
12:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020)). As the advancing fire,
while still at a distance consumes little insects \[CHRYSOSTOM\] by its
mere heat, so Christ's mere approach is enough to consume Antichrist.
The mere "appearance of the coming" of the Lord of glory is sufficient
to show to Antichrist his perfect nothingness. He is seized and "cast
alive into the take of fire" ([Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)). So the world kingdoms, and the
kingdom of the beast, give place to that of the Son of man and His
saints. The Greek for "destroy" means "abolish" (the same Greek is so
translated, [Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010)); that is, cause
every vestige of him to disappear. Compare as to Gog attacking Israel
and destroyed by Jehovah (Eze. 38:1-39:29), so as not to leave a vestige
of him.

with the brightness of his coming--Greek, "the manifestation, (or
appearance) of His presence": the first outburst of His advent--the
first gleam of His presence--is enough to abolish utterly all traces of
Antichrist, as darkness disappears before the dawning day. Next, his
adherents are "slain with the sword out of His mouth" ([Rev
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#021)). BENGEL'S distinction between
"the appearance of His coming" and the "coming" itself is not justified
by [Ti1 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#014); [Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Ti2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001), [Ti2
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013), where the same Greek for
"appearing" (English Version, here "the brightness") plainly refers to
the coming itself. The expression, "manifestation (appearing) of His
presence," is used in awful contrast to the revelation of the wicked one
in the beginning of the verse.

[2 Thessalonians 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th2 2:9</span></span>

whose coming--The same Greek as was used for the Lord's coming ([Th2
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008)) or personal "presence."

is--in its essential character.

after--according to the working ("energy") of Satan, as opposed to the
energy or working of the Holy Spirit in the Church (see on [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)). As Christ is related to God, so
is Antichrist to Satan, his visible embodiment and manifestation: Satan
works through him. [Rev 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#002), "The
dragon gave him (the beast) his power . . . seat . . . great authority."

lying wonders--literally, "wonders" or "prodigies of falsehood." His
"power, signs, and wonders," all have falsehood for their base, essence,
and aim ([Joh 8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044)), \[ALFORD\]. In
[Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024) Jesus implies that the
miracles shall be real, though demoniac, such mysterious effects of the
powers of darkness as we read of in the case of the Egyptian sorcerers,
not such as Jesus performed in their character, power, or aim; for they
are against the revealed Word, and therefore not to be accepted as
evidences of truth; nay, on the authority of that sure Word of prophecy
(here, and [Mat 24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024)), to be known
and rejected as wrought in support of falsehood ([Deu
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001), [Deu
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005); [Gal
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008); [Rev
13:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011); [Rev
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#020)). The same three Greek words
occur for miracles of Jesus ([Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022); [Heb
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)); showing that as the Egyptian
magicians imitated Moses ([Ti2 3:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)),
so Antichrist will try to imitate Christ's works as a "sign," or proof
of divinity.

[2 Thessalonians 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th2 2:10</span></span>

deceivableness--rather as Greek, "deceit of (to promote)
unrighteousness" ([Th2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)).

in--The oldest manuscripts and versions omit "in." Translate, "unto them
that are perishing" ([Co2 2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015);
[Co2 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003)): the victims of him whose
very name describes his perishing nature, "the son of perdition"; in
contrast to you whom ([Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)) "God
hath from the beginning chosen to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth."

because--literally, "in requital for"; in just retribution for their
having no love for the truth which was within their reach (on account of
its putting a check on their bad passions), and for their having
"pleasure in unrighteousness" ([Th2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012); [Rom
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018)); they are lost because they
loved not, but rejected, the truth which would have saved them.

received not--Greek, "welcomed not"; admitted it not cordially.

love of the truth--not merely love of truth, but love of THE truth (and
of, Jesus who is the Truth, in opposition to Satan's "lie," [Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009), [Th2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011); [Joh
8:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#042)), can save ([Eph
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021)). We are required not merely to
assent to, but to love the truth ([Psa
119:97](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#097)). The Jews rejected Him who
came in His divine Father's name; they will receive Antichrist coming in
his own name ([Joh 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#043)). Their
pleasant sin shall prove their terrible scourge.

[2 Thessalonians 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th2 2:11</span></span>

for this cause--because "they received not the love of the truth." The
best safeguard against error is "the love of the truth."

shall send--Greek, "sends," or "is sending"; the "delusion" is already
beginning. God judicially sends hardness of heart on those who have
rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment to Satan's
delusions ([Isa 6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009); [Rom
1:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024), [Rom
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)). They first cast off the love of
the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions, then they settle
down into "believing the lie": an awful climax ([Kg1
22:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022); [Eze
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#009); [Job
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/job012.htm#016); [Mat
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005), [Mat
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011); [Ti1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)).

strong delusion--Greek, "the powerful working of error," answering to
the energizing "working of Satan" ([Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009)); the same expression as is
applied to the Holy Ghost's operation in believers: "powerful" or
"effectual (energizing) working" ([Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019)).

believe a lie--rather, "the lie" which Antichrist tells them, appealing
to his miracles as proofs of it . . . ([Th2
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009)).

[2 Thessalonians 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th2 2:12</span></span>

they all . . . damned--rather as Greek, "that all," &c. He here states
the general proposition which applies specially to Antichrist's
adherents. Not all in the Church of Rome, or other anti-Christian
systems, shall be damned, but only "all who believed not the truth,"
when offered to them, "but had pleasure in unrighteousness" ([Rom
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032); [Rom
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008)). Love of unrighteousness being
the great obstacle to believing the truth.

[2 Thessalonians 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th2 2:13</span></span>

But--In delightful contrast to the damnation of the lost ([Th2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)) stands the "salvation" of Paul's
converts.

are bound--in duty ([Th2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003)).

thanks . . . to God--not to ourselves, your ministers, nor to you, our
converts.

beloved of the Lord--Jesus ([Rom 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037);
[Gal 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020); [Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002), [Eph
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)). Elsewhere God the Father is
said to love us ([Th2 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016); [Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016); [Eph
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#004); [Col
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)). Therefore Jesus and the Father
are one.

from the beginning--"before the foundation of the world" ([Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004); compare [Co1
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009)); in contrast to those that shall
"worship the beast, whose names are not written in the book of life of
the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" ([Rev
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008)). Some of the oldest manuscripts
read as English Version, but other oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read,
"as first-fruits." The Thessalonians were among the first converts in
Europe (compare [Rom 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005); [Co1
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015)). In a more general sense, it
occurs in [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018); [Rev
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#004); so I understand it here
including the more restricted sense.

chosen you--The Greek, is not the ordinary word for "elected," implying
His eternal selection; but taken for Himself, implying His having
adopted them in His eternal purpose. It is found in the Septuagint ([Deu
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007); [Deu
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#015)).

through--rather as Greek, "in sanctification" as the element in which
the choice to salvation had place (compare [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002)), standing in contrast to the
"unrighteousness," the element in which Antichrist's followers are given
over by God to damnation ([Th2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)).

of the Spirit--wrought by the Spirit who sanctifies all the elect people
of God, first by eternally consecrating them to perfect holiness in
Christ, once for all, next by progressively imparting it.

belief of the truth--contrasted with "believed not the truth" ([Th2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#012)).

[2 Thessalonians 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">th2 2:14</span></span>

you--The oldest manuscripts read, "us."

by our gospel--"through" the Gospel which we preach.

to . . . glory--In [Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013) it was
"salvation," that is, deliverance from all evil, of body and soul ([Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009)); here it is positive good, even
"glory," and that "the glory of our Lord Jesus" Himself, which believers
are privileged to share with Him ([Joh
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024); [Rom
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017), [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029); [Ti2
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)).

[2 Thessalonians 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">th2 2:15</span></span>

Therefore--God's sovereign choice of believers, so far from being a
ground for inaction on their part, is the strongest incentive to action
and perseverance in it. Compare the argument, [Phi
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012), "Work out your own salvation,
FOR it is God which worketh in you," &c. We cannot fully explain this in
theory; but to the sincere and humble, the practical acting on the
principle is plain. "Privilege first, duty afterwards" \[EDMUNDS\].

stand fast--so as not to be "shaken or troubled" ([Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)).

hold--so as not to let go. Adding nothing, subtracting nothing
\[BENGEL\]. The Thessalonians had not held fast his oral instructions
but had suffered themselves to be imposed upon by pretended
spirit-revelations, and words and letters pretending to be from Paul
([Th2 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002)), to the effect that "the
day of the Lord was instantly imminent."

traditions--truths delivered and transmitted orally, or in writing ([Th2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006); [Co1
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002); Greek, "traditions"). The Greek
verb from which the noun comes, is used by Paul in [Co1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023); [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003). From the three passages in which
"tradition" is used in a good sense, Rome has argued for her
accumulation of uninspired traditions, virtually overriding God's Word,
while put forward as of co-ordinate authority with it. She forgets the
ten passages ([Mat 15:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#002), [Mat
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006); [Mar
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#003), [Mar
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#005), [Mar
7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#008), [Mar
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#013); [Gal
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#014); [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)) stigmatizing man's uninspired
traditions. Not even the apostles' sayings were all inspired (for
example, Peter's dissimulation, [Gal
2:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011)), but only when they claimed
to be so, as in their words afterwards embodied in their canonical
writings. Oral inspiration was necessary in their case, until the canon
of the written Word should be complete; they proved their possession of
inspiration by miracles wrought in support of the new revelation, which
revelation, moreover, accorded with the existing Old Testament
revelation; an additional test needed besides miracles (compare [Deu
13:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001); [Act
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011)). When the canon was complete,
the infallibility of the living men was transferred to the written Word,
now the sole unerring guide, interpreted by the Holy Spirit. Little else
has come down to us by the most ancient and universal tradition save
this, the all-sufficiency of Scripture for salvation. Therefore, by
tradition, we are constrained to cast off all tradition not contained
in, or not provable by, Scripture. The Fathers are valuable witnesses to
historical facts, which give force to the intimations of Scripture: such
as the Christian Lord's day, the baptism of infants, and the genuineness
of the canon of Scripture. Tradition (in the sense of human testimony)
cannot establish a doctrine, but can authenticate a fact, such as the
facts just mentioned. Inspired tradition, in Paul's sense, is not a
supplementary oral tradition completing our written Word, but it is
identical with the written Word now complete; then the latter not being
complete, the tradition was necessarily in part oral, in part written,
and continued so until, the latter being complete before the death of
St. John, the last apostle, the former was no longer needed. Scripture
is, according to Paul, the complete and sufficient rule in all that
appertains to making "the man of God perfect, throughly furnished unto
all good works" ([Ti2 3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)). It is
by leaving Paul's God-inspired tradition for human traditions that Rome
has become the forerunner and parent of the Antichrist. It is striking
that, from this very chapter denouncing Antichrist, she should draw an
argument for her "traditions" by which she fosters anti-Christianity.
Because the apostles' oral word was as trustworthy as their written
word, it by no means follows that the oral word of those not apostles is
as trustworthy as the written word of those who were apostles or
inspired evangelists. No tradition of the apostles except their written
word can be proved genuine on satisfactory evidence. We are no more
bound to accept implicitly the Fathers' interpretations of Scripture,
because we accept the Scripture canon on their testimony, than we are
bound to accept the Jews' interpretation of the Old Testament, because
we accept the Old Testament canon on their testimony.

our epistle--as distinguished from a "letter AS from us," [Th2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#002), namely, that purports to be from
us, but is not. He refers to his first Epistle to the Thessalonians.

[2 Thessalonians 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">th2 2:16</span></span>

himself--by His own might, as contrasted with our feebleness; ensuring
the efficacy of our prayer. Here our Lord Jesus stands first; in [Th1
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011), "God our Father."

which . . . loved us--in the work of our redemption. Referring both to
our Lord Jesus ([Rom 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037); [Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)) and God our Father ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)).

everlasting consolation--not transitory, as worldly consolations in
trials ([Rom 8:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038)). This for all
time present, and then "good hope" for the future \[ALFORD\].

through grace--rather as Greek "IN grace"; to be joined to "hath given."
Grace is the element in which the gift was made.

[2 Thessalonians 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">th2 2:17</span></span>

Comfort your hearts--unsettled as you have been through those who
announced the immediate coming of the Lord.

good word and work--The oldest manuscripts invert the order, "work and
word." Establishment in these were what the young converts at
Thessalonica needed, not fanatical teaching (compare [Co1
15:58](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#058)).
