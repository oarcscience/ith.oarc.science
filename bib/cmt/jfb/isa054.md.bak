### [Isaiah Chapter 54](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 54:1</span></span>

THE FRUIT OF MESSIAH'S SUFFERINGS, AND OF ISRAEL'S FINAL PENITENCE AT
HER PAST UNBELIEF ([Isa 53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006).md): HER
JOYFUL RESTORATION AND ENLARGEMENT BY JEHOVAH, WHOSE WRATH WAS
MOMENTARY, BUT HIS KINDNESS EVERLASTING. (Isa. 54:1-17)

Sing--for joy ([Zep 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#014).md).

barren--the Jewish Church once forsaken by God, and therefore during
that time destitute of spiritual children ([Isa
54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006).md).

didst not bear--during the Babylonian exile primarily. Secondarily, and
chiefly, during Israel's present dispersion.

the children--the Gentiles adopted by special grace into the original
Church ([Isa 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md); [Isa
49:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#020).md).

than . . . married wife--than were her spiritual children, when Israel
was still a married wife (under the law, before the Babylonian exile),
before God put her away \[MAURER\]. So Paul contrasts the universal
Church of the New Testament with the Church of the Old Testament legal
dispensation, quoting this very passage ([Gal
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#027).md). But the full accomplishment of
it is yet future.

[Isaiah 54:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 54:2</span></span>

([Isa 49:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#019.md); [Jer
31:31-36](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md), [Jer
31:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#038).md). Thy children shall be so
many that thy borders must be extended to contain them.

curtains--the cloth forming the covering of the tent.

spare not--give abundantly the means for the enlargement of the Church
([Co2 9:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#005).md).

cords . . . stakes--The more the tent is enlarged by lengthening the
cords by which the cloth covering is fastened to the ground, the more
the stakes supporting the tent need to be strengthened; the Church is
not merely to seek new converts, but to strengthen those she has in the
faith. The image is appropriate, as the tabernacle was the symbol of the
old Israelitish Church (see on [Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 54:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 54:3</span></span>

break forth--rather, "burst forth" with increase; thy offspring shall
grow, answering to "thy seed" in the parallel clause.

thy seed--Israel and her children, as distinguished from "the Gentiles."

desolate cities--of Israel ([Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md).

[Isaiah 54:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 54:4</span></span>

([Isa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010.md), [Isa
41:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#014).md).

shame of thy youth--Israel's unfaithfulness as wife of Jehovah, almost
from her earliest history.

reproach of widowhood--Israel's punishment in her consequent dismissal
from God and barrenness of spiritual children in Babylon and her present
dispersion ([Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md); [Isa
49:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#021.md); [Jer
3:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#024.md); [Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019.md); [Hos
2:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002).md).

[Isaiah 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 54:5</span></span>

([Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005.md); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014).md). That God was Israel's "Maker,"
both as individuals and as the theocratic kingdom, is the pledge of
assurance that He will be her Redeemer ([Isa
43:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#001).md). Hebrew, "makers . . .
husbands"; plural for singular, to denote excellency.

of Israel . . . whole earth--Not until He manifests Himself as God of
Israel shall He appear as God of the whole earth ([Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), [Psa
102:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005.md), [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 54:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 54:6</span></span>

called--that is, recalled: the prophetic past for the future.

forsaken--that had been forsaken.

when thou--or, "when she was rejected"; one who had been a wife of youth
([Eze 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008.md), [Eze
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#022.md), [Eze
16:60](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#060.md); [Jer
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#002)) at the time when (thou, or.md) she
was rejected for infidelity \[MAURER\]. "A wife of youth but afterwards
rejected" \[LOWTH\].

[Isaiah 54:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 54:7</span></span>

small moment--as compared with Israel's coming long prosperity ([Isa
26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md); [Isa
60:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#010).md). So the spiritual Israel ([Psa
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#005.md); [Co2
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017).md).

gather thee--to Myself from thy dispersions.

[Isaiah 54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 54:8</span></span>

In a little wrath--rather, "In the overflowing of wrath"; as [Pro
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#004.md), Margin, \[GESENIUS\]. The wrath,
though but "for a moment," was overflowing while it lasted.

hid . . . face-- ([Isa 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md); [Psa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007).md).

everlasting--in contrast to "for a moment."

[Isaiah 54:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 54:9</span></span>

I am about to do the same in this instance as in Noah's flood. As I
swore then that it should not return ([Gen
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md); [Gen
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#011).md), and I kept that promise, so I
swear now to My people, and will perform My promise, that there shall be
no return of the deluge of My wrath upon them. LOWTH, on insufficient
authority, reads (the same will I do now as), "in the days of Noah."

[Isaiah 54:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 54:10</span></span>

([Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006.md); [Psa
89:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#033.md); [Rom
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029).md).

covenant of my peace-- ([Sa2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005).md).
The covenant whereby I have made thee at peace with Me.

[Isaiah 54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 54:11</span></span>

not comforted--by anyone; none gave her help or comfort.

lay . . . with fair colours--rather, "lay . . . in cement of vermilion"
\[LOWTH\]. The Hebrew for "fair colors" means stibium, the paint with
which Eastern women painted their eyelids and eyelashes ([Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md). The very cement shall be of the
most beautiful color ([Rev 21:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018).md).

[Isaiah 54:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 54:12</span></span>

windows--rather, "battlements"; literally, "suns"; applied to
battlements from their radiated appearance.

agates--rather, "rubies."

carbuncles--literally, "sparkling gems"; the carbuncle when held to the
sun becomes like a burning coal.

all thy borders--rather, "thy whole circuit," consisting of precious
stones. The glory of the Church on earth, when the Hebrew Church,
according to the original design, shall be the metropolis of
Christendom.

[Isaiah 54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 54:13</span></span>

Quoted by the Saviour ([Joh 6:45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#045).md), to
prove that in order to come to Him, men must be "drawn" by the Father.
So [Jer 31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md); [Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002.md); [Co1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010.md); [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); [Heb
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#016.md); [Jo1
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020.md).

great . . . peace--generally ([Psa
119:165](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#165).md). Specially referring to the
peaceful prosperity which shall prevail under Messiah in the latter days
([Isa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md), [Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 54:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 54:14</span></span>

righteousness--the characteristic of the reign of Messiah ([Isa
11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md); [Psa
72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002.md), [Psa
72:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#004.md); [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011).md).

far from oppression, &c.--far from suffering oppression; "for thou shall
have nothing to fear."

[Isaiah 54:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 54:15</span></span>

gather together, &c.--that is, If it should happen that enemies "gather
together" against thee ([Psa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002).md),
they will not have been sent by Me (compare [Hos
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004).md) as instruments of My wrath (nay,
it will be with My disapproval); for "whosoever shall gather together,"
&c. ([Psa 59:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#003).md).

fall for thy sake--rather, "shall come over to thy side" \[LOWTH\].
Literally, "fall to thee" ([Jer 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#009.md);
[Jer 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009).md). To be fully fulfilled to
Jerusalem hereafter ([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 54:16</span></span>

The workman that forms "weapons against thee" ([Isa
54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017).md) is wholly in My power,
therefore thou needest not fear, having Me on thy side.

for his work--rather, "by his labor \[HORSLEY\]. "According to the
exigencies of his work" \[MAURER\].

waster to destroy-- ([Isa 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Isa
37:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md); [Isa
45:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). Desolating conquerors who use
the "instruments" framed by "the smith." The repetition of the "I"
implies, however, something in the latter half of the verse contrasted
with the former understand it, therefore, thus: "I have in My power both
him who frames arms and him who destroys them (arms)" \[ROSENMULLER\].

[Isaiah 54:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 54:17</span></span>

tongue . . . condemn--image from a court of justice. Those who desire to
"condemn" thee thou shalt "condemn" ([Exo
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#007.md); [Jos
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#021.md); [Psa
64:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#008.md); [Rom
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md), [Rom
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033).md).

righteousness . . . of me-- ([Isa
45:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#024.md); [Isa
46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013)). Rather, "(this is.md) their
justification from Me." Their enemies would "condemn" them, but I
justify and vindicate them, and so they condemn their enemies.
