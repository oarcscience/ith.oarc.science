THE NATURE AND USE OF PROVERBS.--A proverb is a pithy sentence,
concisely expressing some well-established truth susceptible of various
illustrations and applications. The word is of Latin derivation,
literally meaning for a word, speech, or discourse; that is, one
expression for many. The Hebrew word for "proverb" (mashal) means a
"comparison." Many suppose it was used, because the form or matter of
the proverb, or both, involved the idea of comparison. Most of the
proverbs are in couplets or triplets, or some modifications of them, the
members of which correspond in structure and length, as if arranged to
be compared one with another. They illustrate the varieties of
parallelism, a distinguishing feature of Hebrew poetry. Compare
Introduction to Poetical Books. Many also clearly involve the idea of
comparison in the sentiments expressed (compare [Pro
12:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001.md); [Pro
25:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#010.md); [Pro
26:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#001).md). Sometimes, however, the
designed omission of one member of the comparison, exercising the
reader's sagacity or study for its supply, presents the proverb as a
"riddle" or "dark saying" (compare Pro. 30:15-33; [Pro
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#006.md); [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004).md). The sententious form of
expression, which thus became a marked feature of the proverbial style,
was also adopted for continuous discourse, even when not always
preserving traces of comparison, either in form or matter (compare Pro.
1:1-9:18). In [Eze 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001.md); [Eze
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md), we find the same word properly
translated "parable," to designate an illustrative discourse. Then the
Greek translators have used a word, parabola ("parable"), which the
gospel writers (except John) employ for our Lord's discourses of the
same character, and which also seems to involve the idea of comparison,
though that may not be its primary meaning. It might seem, therefore,
that the proverbial and parabolic styles of writing were originally and
essentially the same. The proverb is a "concentrated parable, and the
parable an extension of the proverb by a full illustration." The proverb
is thus the moral or theme of a parable, which sometimes precedes it, as
in [Mat 19:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#030.md) (compare [Pro
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#001).md); or succeeds it, as in Mat.
22:1-16; [Luk 15:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#001.md). The style being
poetical, and adapted to the expression of a high order of poetical
sentiment, such as prophecy, we find the same term used to designate
such compositions (compare [Num 23:7](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#007.md);
[Mic 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#004.md); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md).

Though the Hebrews used the same term for proverb and parable, the Greek
employs two, though the sacred writers have not always appeared to
recognize a distinction. The term for proverb is, paroimia, which the
Greek translators employ for the title of this book, evidently with
special reference to the later definition of a proverb, as a trite,
sententious form of speech, which appears to be the best meaning of the
term. John uses the same term to designate our Saviour's instructions,
in view of their characteristic obscurity (compare [Pro
16:25-29](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025), Greek.md), and even for his
illustrative discourses ([Pro 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#006).md),
whose sense was not at once obvious to all his hearers. This form of
instruction was well adapted to aid the learner. The parallel structure
of sentences, the repetition, contrast, or comparison of thought, were
all calculated to facilitate the efforts of memory; and precepts of
practical wisdom which, extended into logical discourses, might have
failed to make abiding impressions by reason of their length or
complicated character, were thus compressed into pithy, and, for the
most part, very plain statements. Such a mode of instruction has
distinguished the written or traditional literature of all nations, and
was, and still is, peculiarly current in the East.

In this book, however, we are supplied with a proverbial wisdom
commended by the seal of divine inspiration. God has condescended to
become our teacher on the practical affairs belonging to all the
relations of life. He has adapted His instruction to the plain and
unlettered, and presented, in this striking and impressive method, the
great principles of duty to Him and to our fellow men. To the prime
motive of all right conduct, the fear of God, are added all lawful and
subordinate incentives, such as honor, interest, love, fear, and natural
affection. Besides the terror excited by an apprehension of God's justly
provoked judgments, we are warned against evil-doing by the exhibition
of the inevitable temporal results of impiety, injustice, profligacy,
idleness, laziness, indolence, drunkenness, and debauchery. To the
rewards of true piety which follow in eternity, are promised the peace,
security, love, and approbation of the good, and the comforts of a clear
conscience, which render this life truly happy.

INSPIRATION AND AUTHORSHIP.--With no important exception, Jewish and
Christian writers have received this book as the inspired production of
Solomon. It is the first book of the Bible prefaced by the name of the
author. The New Testament abounds with citations from the Proverbs. Its
intrinsic excellence commends it to us as the production of a higher
authority than the apocryphal writings, such as Wisdom or
Ecclesiasticus. Solomon lived five hundred years before the "seven wise
men" of Greece, and seven hundred before the age of Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle. It is thus very evident, whatever theory of his sources of
knowledge be adopted, that he did not draw upon any heathen repositories
with which we are acquainted. It is far more probable, that by the
various migrations, captivities, and dispersions of the Jews, heathen
philosophers drew from this inspired fountain many of those streams
which continue to refresh mankind amid the otherwise barren and parched
deserts of profane literature.

As, however, the Psalms are ascribed to David, because he was the
leading author, so the ascription of this book to Solomon is entirely
consistent with the titles of the thirtieth and thirty-first chapters,
which assign those chapters to Agur and Lemuel respectively. Of these
persons we know nothing. This is not the place for discussing the
various speculations respecting them. By a slight change of reading some
propose to translate [Pro 30:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#001.md) : "The
words of Agur, the son of her who was obeyed Massa," that is, "the queen
of Massa"; and [Pro 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro031.htm#001.md) : "The words
of Lemuel, king of Massa"; but to this the earliest versions are
contradictory, and nothing other than the strongest exegetical necessity
ought to be allowed to justify a departure from a well-established
reading and version when nothing useful to our knowledge is gained. It
is better to confess ignorance than indulge in useless conjectures.

It is probable that out of the "three thousand proverbs" ([Kg1
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#032).md) which Solomon spoke, he selected
and edited Pro. 1:1-24:34 during his life. Pro. 25:1-29:27 were also of
his production, and copied out in the days of Hezekiah, by his "men,"
perhaps the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah. Such a work was evidently
in the spirit of this pious monarch, who set his heart so fully on a
reformation of God's worship. Learned men have endeavored to establish
the theory that Solomon himself was only a collector; or that the other
parts of the book, as these chapters, were also selections by later
hands; but the reasons adduced to maintain these views have never
appeared so satisfactory as to change the usual opinions on the subject,
which have the sanction of the most ancient and reliable authorities.

DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK.--Such a work is, of course, not susceptible of
any logical analysis. There are, however, some well-defined marks of
division, so that very generally the book is divided into five or six
parts.

1\. The first contains nine chapters, in which are discussed and
enforced by illustration, admonition, and encouragement the principles
and blessings of wisdom, and the pernicious schemes and practices of
sinful persons. These chapters are introductory. With few specimens of
the proper proverb, they are distinguished by its conciseness and
terseness. The sentences follow very strictly the form of parallelism,
and generally of the synonymous species, only forty of the synthetic and
four ([Pro 3:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#032).md) of the antithetic
appearing. The style is ornate, the figures bolder and fuller, and the
illustrations more striking and extended.

2\. The antithetic and synthetic parallelism to the exclusion of the
synonymous distinguish Pro. 10:1-22:16, and the verses are entirely
unconnected, each containing a complete sense in itself.

3\. Pro. 22:16-24:34 present a series of admonitions as if addressed to
a pupil, and generally each topic occupies two or more verses.

4\. Pro. 25:1-29:27 are entitled to be regarded as a distinct portion,
for the reason given above as to its origin. The style is very much
mixed; of the peculiarities, compare parts two and three.

5\. Pro. 30:1-33 is peculiar not only for its authorship, but as a
specimen of the kind of proverb which has been described as "dark
sayings" or "riddles."

6\. To a few pregnant but concise admonitions, suitable for a king, is
added a most inimitable portraiture of female character. In both parts
five and six the distinctive peculiarity of the original proverbial
style gives place to the modifications already mentioned as marking a
later composition, though both retain the concise and nervous method of
stating truth, equally valuable for its deep impression and permanent
retention by the memory.
