### [Leviticus Chapter 23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 23:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 23:2</span></span>

OF SUNDRY FEASTS. ([Lev 23:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#001).md)

Speak unto the children of Israel, . . . concerning the feasts of the
Lord--literally, "the times of assembling, or solemnities" ([Isa
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020).md); and this is a preferable
rendering, applicable to all sacred seasons mentioned in this chapter,
even the day of atonement, which was observed as a fast. They were
appointed by the direct authority of God and announced by a public
proclamation, which is called "the joyful sound" ([Psa
89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015).md). Those "holy convocations" were
evidences of divine wisdom, and eminently subservient to the maintenance
and diffusion of religious knowledge and piety.

[Leviticus 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 23:3</span></span>

Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of
rest--(See on [Exo 20:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#008).md). The Sabbath
has the precedence given to it, and it was to be "a holy convocation,"
observed by families "in their dwellings"; where practicable, by the
people repairing to the door of the tabernacle; at later periods, by
meeting in the schools of the prophets, and in synagogues.

[Leviticus 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 23:4</span></span>

These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim in their
seasons--Their observance took place in the parts of the year
corresponding to our March, May, and September. Divine wisdom was
manifested in fixing them at those periods; in winter, when the days
were short and the roads broken up, a long journey was impracticable;
while in summer the harvest and vintage gave busy employment in the
fields. Besides, another reason for the choice of those seasons probably
was to counteract the influence of Egyptian associations and habits. And
God appointed more sacred festivals for the Israelites in the month of
September than the people of Egypt had in honor of their idols. These
institutions, however, were for the most part prospective, the
observance being not binding on the Israelites during their wanderings
in the wilderness, while the regular celebration was not to commence
till their settlement in Canaan.

[Leviticus 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 23:5</span></span>

THE PASSOVER. ([Lev 23:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#005).md)

the Lord's passover--(See [Exo 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#002.md),
[Exo 12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md), [Exo
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#018).md). The institution of the
passover was intended to be a perpetual memorial of the circumstances
attending the redemption of the Israelites, while it had a typical
reference to a greater redemption to be effected for God's spiritual
people. On the first and last days of this feast, the people were
forbidden to work \[[Lev 23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#007.md)\]; but
while on the Sabbath they were not to do any work, on feast days they
were permitted to dress meat--and hence the prohibition is restricted to
"no servile work." At the same time, those two days were devoted to
"holy convocation"--special seasons of social devotion. In addition to
the ordinary sacrifices of every day, there were to be "offerings by
fire" on the altar (see [Num 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#019).md),
while unleavened bread was to be eaten in families all the seven days
(see [Co1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008).md).

[Leviticus 23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 23:10</span></span>

THE SHEAF OF FIRST FRUITS. ([Lev
23:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#009).md)

ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the
priest--A sheaf, literally, an omer, of the first-fruits of the barley
harvest. The barley being sooner ripe than the other grains, the reaping
of it formed the commencement of the general harvest season. The
offering described in this passage was made on the sixteenth of the
first month, the day following the first Passover Sabbath, which was on
the fifteenth (corresponding to the beginning of our April); but it was
reaped after sunset on the previous evening by persons deputed to go
with sickles and obtain samples from different fields. These, being laid
together in a sheaf or loose bundle, were brought to the court of the
temple, where the grain was winnowed, parched, and bruised in a mortar.
Then, after some incense had been sprinkled on it, the priest waved the
sheaf aloft before the Lord towards the four different points of the
compass, took a part of it and threw it into the fire of the altar--all
the rest being reserved to himself. It was a proper and beautiful act,
expressive of dependence on the God of nature and providence--common
among all people, but more especially becoming the Israelites, who owed
their land itself as well as all it produced to the divine bounty. The
offering of the wave-sheaf sanctified the whole harvest ([Rom
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016).md). At the same time, this feast
had a typical character, and pre-intimated the resurrection of Christ
([Co1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020).md), who rose from the dead
on the very day the first-fruits were offered.

[Leviticus 23:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lev 23:15</span></span>

FEAST OF PENTECOST. ([Lev 23:15-22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015).md)

ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath--that is,
after the first day of the passover week, which was observed as a
Sabbath.

[Leviticus 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 23:16</span></span>

number fifty days--The forty-ninth day after the presentation of the
first-fruits, or the fiftieth, including it, was the feast of Pentecost.
(See also [Exo 23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md); [Deu
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#009).md).

[Leviticus 23:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lev 23:17</span></span>

Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
deals, &c.--These loaves were made of "fine" or wheaten flour, the
quantity contained in them being somewhat more than ten pounds in
weight. As the wave-sheaf gave the signal for the commencement, the two
loaves solemnized the termination of the harvest season. They were the
first-fruits of that season, being offered unto the Lord by the priest
in name of the whole nation. (See [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022).md). The loaves used at the
Passover were unleavened; those presented at Pentecost were leavened--a
difference which is thus accounted for, that the one was a memorial of
the bread hastily prepared at their departure, while the other was a
tribute of gratitude to God for their daily food, which was leavened.

[Leviticus 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lev 23:21</span></span>

ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy
convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein--Though it
extended over a week, the first day only was held as a Sabbath, both for
the national offering of first-fruits and a memorial of the giving of
the law.

[Leviticus 23:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 23:22</span></span>

thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou
reapest, &c.--(See on [Lev 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#009).md). The
repetition of this law here probably arose from the priests reminding
the people, at the presentation of the first-fruits, to unite piety to
God with charity to the poor.

[Leviticus 23:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">lev 23:24</span></span>

FEAST OF TRUMPETS. ([Lev 23:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#023).md)

In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a
sabbath--That was the first day of the ancient civil year.

a memorial of blowing of trumpets--Jewish writers say that the trumpets
were sounded thirty successive times, and the reason for the institution
was for the double purpose of announcing the commencement of the new
year, which was ([Lev 23:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#025).md) to be
religiously observed (see [Num 29:3](../../../bib/kjv/num029.htm#003).md),
and of preparing the people for the approaching solemn feast.

[Leviticus 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">lev 23:27</span></span>

there shall be a day of atonement . . . and ye shall afflict your
souls--an unusual festival, at which the sins of the whole year were
expiated. (See [Lev 16:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029).md). It is
here only stated that the severest penalty was incurred by the violation
of this day.

[Leviticus 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 23:34</span></span>

the feast of tabernacles, for seven days unto the Lord--This festival,
which was instituted in grateful commemoration of the Israelites having
securely dwelt in booths or tabernacles in the wilderness, was the third
of the three great annual festivals, and, like the other two, it lasted
a week. It began on the fifteenth day of the month, corresponding to the
end of our September and beginning of October, which was observed as a
Sabbath; and it could be celebrated only at the place of the sanctuary,
offerings being made on the altar every day of its continuance. The Jews
were commanded during the whole period of the festival to dwell in
booths, which were erected on the flat roofs of houses, in the streets
or fields; and the trees made use of are by some stated to be the
citron, the palm, the myrtle, and the willow, while others maintain the
people were allowed to take any trees they could obtain that were
distinguished for verdure and fragrance. While the solid branches were
reserved for the construction of the booths, the lighter branches were
carried by men, who marched in triumphal procession, singing psalms and
crying "Hosanna!" which signifies, "Save, we beseech thee!" ([Psa
118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md), [Psa
118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025).md). It was a season of great
rejoicing. But the ceremony of drawing water from the pool, which was
done on the last day, seems to have been the introduction of a later
period ([Joh 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). That last day was
the eighth, and, on account of the scene at Siloam, was called "the
great day of the feast." The feast of ingathering, when the vintage was
over, was celebrated also on that day \[[Exo
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016.md); [Exo
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#022.md)\], and, as the conclusion of one
of the great festivals, it was kept as a sabbath.
