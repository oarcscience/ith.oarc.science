### [Hosea Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 5:1</span></span>

GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON THE PRIESTS, PEOPLE, AND PRINCES OF ISRAEL FOR THEIR
SINS. ([Hos 5:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001).md)

Judah, too, being guilty shall be punished; nor shall Assyria, whose aid
they both sought, save them; judgments shall at last lead them to
repentance.

the king--probably Pekah; the contemporary of Ahaz, king of Judah, under
whom idolatry was first carried so far in Judah as to call for the
judgment of the joint Syrian and Israelite invasion, as also that of
Assyria.

judgment is towards you--that is, threatens you from God.

ye have been a snare on Mizpah . . . net . . . upon Tabor--As hunters
spread their net and snares on the hills, Mizpah and Tabor, so ye have
snared the people into idolatry and made them your prey by injustice. As
Mizpah and Tabor mean a "watch tower," and a "lofty place," a fit scene
for hunters, playing on the words, the prophet implies, in the lofty
place in which I have set you, whereas ye ought to have been the
watchers of the people, guarding them from evil, ye have been as hunters
entrapping them into it \[JEROME\]. These two places are specified,
Mizpah in the east and Tabor in the west, to include the high places
throughout the whole kingdom, in which Israel's rulers set up idolatrous
altars.

[Hosea 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 5:2</span></span>

revolters--apostates.

profound--deeply rooted \[CALVIN\] and sunk to the lowest depths,
excessive in their idolatry ([Hos 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009.md);
[Isa 31:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#006).md) \[HENDERSON\]. From the
antithesis ([Hos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003).md), "not hid from
me," I prefer explaining, profoundly cunning in their idolatry. Jeroboam
thought it a profound piece of policy to set up golden calves to
represent God in Dan and Beth-el, in order to prevent Israel's heart
from turning again to David's line by going up to Jerusalem to worship.
So Israel's subsequent idolatry was grounded by their leaders on various
pleas of state expediency (compare [Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015).md).

to . . . slaughter--He does not say "to sacrifice," for their so-called
sacrifices were butcheries rather than sacrifices; there was nothing
sacred about them, being to idols instead of to the holy God.

though--MAURER translates, "and (in spite of their hope of safety
through their slaughter of victims to idols) I will be a chastisement to
them all." English Version is good sense: They have deeply revolted,
notwithstanding all my prophetical warnings.

[Hosea 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 5:3</span></span>

Ephraim--the tribe so called, as distinguished from "Israel" here, the
other nine tribes. It was always foremost of the tribes of the northern
kingdom. For four hundred years in early history, it, with Manasseh and
Benjamin, its two dependent tribes, held the pre-eminence in the whole
nation. Ephraim is here addressed as foremost in idolatry.

I how . . . not hid from me--notwithstanding their supposed profound
cunning ([Hos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002.md); [Rev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#002.md), [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009.md), [Rev
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#013.md), [Rev
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#019).md).

now--"though I have been a rebuker of all them" ([Hos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002).md) who commit such spiritual
whoredoms, thou art now continuing in them.

[Hosea 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 5:4</span></span>

They--Turning from a direct address to Ephraim, he uses the third person
plural to characterize the people in general. The Hebrew is against the
Margin, their doings will not suffer them" the omission of "them" in the
Hebrew after the verb being unusual. The sense is, they are incurable,
for they will not permit (as the Hebrew literally means) their doings to
be framed so as to turn unto God. Implying that they resist the Spirit
of God, not suffering Him to renew them; and give themselves up to "the
spirit of whoredoms" (in antithesis to "the Spirit of God" implied in
"suffer" or "permit") ([Hos 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md); [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010.md); [Eze
16:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#043.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

[Hosea 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 5:5</span></span>

the pride of Israel--wherewith they reject the warnings of God's
prophets ([Hos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#002).md), and prefer their
idols to God ([Hos 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#010.md); [Jer
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017).md).

testify to his face--openly to his face he shall be convicted of the
pride which is so palpable in him. Or, "in his face," as in [Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009.md).

Judah . . . shall fall with them--This prophecy is later than [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md), when Judah had not gone so far
in idolatry; now her imitation of Israel's bad example provokes the
threat of her being doomed to share in Israel's punishment.

[Hosea 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 5:6</span></span>

with . . . flocks--to propitiate Jehovah ([Isa
1:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011).md).

seek . . . not find--because it is slavish fear that leads them to seek
Him; and because it then shall be too late ([Pro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#028.md); [Joh
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#034).md).

[Hosea 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 5:7</span></span>

treacherously--as to the marriage covenant ([Jer
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020).md).

strange children--alluding to "children of whoredoms" ([Hos
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md); [Hos
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004).md). "Strange" or foreign implies
that their idolatry was imported from abroad \[HENDERSON\]. Or rather,
"regarded by God as strangers, not His," as being reared in idolatry.
The case is desperate, when not only the existing, but also the rising,
generation is reared in apostasy.

a month--a very brief space of time shall elapse, and then punishment
shall overtake them ([Zac 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#008).md). The
allusion seems to be to money loans, which were by the month, not as
with us by the year. You cannot put it off; the time of your destruction
is immediately and suddenly coming on you; just as the debtor must meet
the creditor's demand at the expiration of the month. The prediction is
of the invasion of Tiglath-pileser, who carried away Reuben, Gad,
Naphtali, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

portions--that is, possessions. Their resources and garrisons will not
avail to save them. HENDERSON explains from [Isa
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#006.md), "portions" as their idols; the
context favors this, "the Lord" the true "portion of His people" ([Deu
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009).md), being in antithesis to "their
portions," the idols.

[Hosea 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 5:8</span></span>

The arrival of the enemy is announced in the form of an injunction to
blow an alarm.

cornet . . . trumpet--The "cornet" was made of the curved horn of
animals and was used by shepherds. The "trumpet" was of brass or silver,
straight, and used in wars and on solemn occasions. The Hebrew is
hatzotzerah, the sound imitating the trumpet note ([Hos
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#001.md); [Num
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#002.md); [Jer
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md); [Joe
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#001).md).

Gibeah . . . Ramah--both in Benjamin ([Isa
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#029).md).

Beth-aven--in Benjamin; not as in [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md); Beth-el, but a town east of it
([Jos 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#002).md). "Cry aloud," namely, to
raise the alarm. "Benjamin" is put for the whole southern kingdom of
Judah (compare [Hos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005).md), being the
first part of it which would meet the foe advancing from the north.
"After thee, O Benjamin," implies the position of Beth-aven, behind
Benjamin, at the borders of Ephraim. When the foe is at Beth-aven, he is
at Benjamin's rear, close upon thee, O Benjamin ([Jdg
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#014).md).

[Hosea 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 5:9</span></span>

Israel is referred to in [Hos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#009.md),
Judah in [Hos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md).

the day of rebuke--the day when I shall chastise him.

among the tribes of Israel have I made known--proving that the scene of
Hosea's labor was among the ten tribes.

that which shall surely be--namely, the coming judgment here foretold.
It is no longer a conditional decree, leaving a hope of pardon on
repentance; it is absolute, for Ephraim is hopelessly impenitent.

[Hosea 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 5:10</span></span>

remove the bound-- ([Deu 19:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#014.md); [Deu
27:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#017.md); [Job
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#002.md); [Pro
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#028.md); [Pro
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#010).md). Proverbial for the rash
setting aside of the ancestral laws by which men are kept to their duty.
Ahaz and his courtiers ("the princes of Judah"), setting aside the
ancient ordinances of God, removed the borders of the bases and the
layer and the sea and introduced an idolatrous altar from Damascus ([Kg2
16:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#010).md); also he burnt his children
in the valley of Hinnom, after the abominations of the heathen ([Ch2
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003).md).

[Hosea 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 5:11</span></span>

broken in judgment--namely, the "judgment" of God on him ([Hos
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001).md).

walked after the commandment--Jeroboam's, to worship the calves ([Kg2
10:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#028).md). Compare [Mic
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md), "the statutes of Omri," namely,
idolatrous statutes. We ought to obey God rather than men ([Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029).md). JEROME reads "filthiness." The
Septuagint gives the sense, not the literal translation: "after
vanities."

[Hosea 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 5:12</span></span>

as a moth--consuming a garment ([Job
13:28](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#028.md); [Psa
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md); [Isa
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009).md).

Judah . . . rottenness--Ephraim, or the ten tribes, are as a garment
eaten by the moth; Judah as the body itself consumed by rottenness ([Pro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004).md). Perhaps alluding to the
superiority of the latter in having the house of David, and the temple,
the religious center of the nation \[GROTIUS\]. As in [Hos
5:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md), the violence of the calamity
is prefigured by the "wound" which "a lion" inflicts, so here its long
protracted duration, and the certainty and completeness of the
destruction from small unforeseen beginnings, by the images of a slowly
but surely consuming moth and rottenness.

[Hosea 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 5:13</span></span>

wound--literally, "bandage"; hence a bandaged wound ([Isa
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#006.md); [Jer
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#012).md). "Saw," that is, felt its
weakened state politically, and the dangers that threatened it. It
aggravates their perversity, that, though aware of their unsound and
calamitous state, they did not inquire into the cause or seek a right
remedy.

went . . . to the Assyrian--First, Menahem ([Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md) applied to Pul; again, Hoshea
to Shalmaneser ([Kg2 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003).md).

sent to King Jareb--Understand Judah as the nominative to "sent." Thus,
as "Ephraim saw his sickness" (the first clause) answers in the
parallelism to "Ephraim went to the Assyrian" (the third clause), so
"Judah saw his wound" (the second clause) answers to (Judah) "sent to
King Jareb" (the fourth clause). Jareb ought rather to be translated,
"their defender," literally, "avenger" \[JEROME\]. The Assyrian "king,"
ever ready, for his own aggrandizement, to mix himself up with the
affairs of neighboring states, professed to undertake Israel's and
Judah's cause; in [Jdg 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#032.md), Jerub, in
Jerub-baal is so used, namely, "plead one's cause." Judah, under Ahaz,
applied to Tiglath-pileser for aid against Syria and Israel ([Kg2
16:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#007.md); [Ch2
28:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#016).md); the Assyrian "distressed
him, but strengthened him not," fulfiling the prophecy here, "he could
not heal your, nor cure you of your wound.

[Hosea 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 5:14</span></span>

lion--The black lion and the young lion are emblems of strength and
ferocity ([Psa 91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013).md).

I, even I--emphatic; when I, even I, the irresistible God, tear in
pieces ([Psa 50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022).md), no Assyrian power
can rescue.

go away--as a lion stalks leisurely back with his prey to his lair.

[Hosea 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 5:15</span></span>

return to my place--that is, withdraw My favor.

till they acknowledge their offence--The Hebrew is, "till they suffer
the penalty of their guilt." Probably "accepting the punishment of their
guilt" (compare [Zac 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005).md) is included
in the idea, as English Version translates. Compare [Lev
26:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md); [Jer
29:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md); [Eze
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md); [Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031.md).

seek my face--that is, seek My favor ([Pro
29:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#026), Margin.md).

in . . . affliction . . . seek me early--that is, diligently; rising up
before dawn to seek Me ([Psa 119:147](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#147.md);
compare [Psa 78:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#034).md).
