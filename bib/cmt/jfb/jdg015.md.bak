### [Judges Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md)

[Judges 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 15:1</span></span>

SAMSON IS DENIED HIS WIFE. ([Jdg
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#001).md)

in the time of wheat harvest--that is, about the end of our April, or
the beginning of our May. The shocks of grain were then gathered into
heaps, and lying on the field or on the threshing-floors. It was the dry
season, dry far beyond our experience, and the grain in a most
combustible state.

Samson visited his wife with a kid--It is usual for a visitor in the
East to carry some present; in this case, it might be not only as a
token of civility, but of reconciliation.

he said--that is, to himself. It was his secret purpose.

into the chamber--the female apartments or harem.

[Judges 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 15:2</span></span>

her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated
her--This allegation was a mere sham, a flimsy pretext to excuse his
refusal of admittance. The proposal he made of a marriage with her
younger sister was but an insult to Samson, and one which it was
unlawful for an Israelite to accept ([Lev
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#018).md).

[Judges 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 15:3</span></span>

HE BURNS THE PHILISTINES' CORN. ([Jdg
15:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#003).md)

Samson said . . ., Now shall I be more blameless than the
Philistines--This nefarious conduct provoked the hero's just
indignation, and he resolved to take signal vengeance.

[Judges 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 15:4</span></span>

went and caught three hundred foxes--rather, "jackals"; an animal
between a wolf and a fox, which, unlike our fox, a solitary creature,
prowls in large packs or herds and abounds in the mountains of
Palestine. The collection of so great a number would require both time
and assistance.

took firebrands--torches or matches which would burn slowly, retaining
the fire, and blaze fiercely when blown by the wind. He put two jackals
together, tail by tail, and fastened tightly a fire match between them.
At nightfall he lighted the firebrand and sent each pair successively
down from the hills, into the "Shefala," or plain of Philistia, lying on
the borders of Dan and Judah, a rich and extensive corn district. The
pain caused by the fire would make the animals toss about to a wide
extent, kindling one great conflagration. But no one could render
assistance to his neighbor: the devastation was so general, the panic
would be so great.

[Judges 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jdg 15:6</span></span>

Who hath done this--The author of this outrage, and the cause that
provoked such an extraordinary retaliation, soon became known; and the
sufferers, enraged by the destruction of their crops, rushing with
tumultuous fury to the house of Samson's wife, "burnt her and her father
with fire." This was a remarkable retribution. To avoid this menace, she
had betrayed her husband; and by that unprincipled conduct, eventually
exposed herself to the horrid doom which, at the sacrifice of conjugal
fidelity, she had sought to escape \[[Jdg
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#015.md)\].

[Judges 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 15:7</span></span>

Samson said . . ., Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of
you--By that act the husbandmen had been the instruments in avenging his
private and personal wrongs. But as a judge, divinely appointed to
deliver Israel, his work of retribution was not yet accomplished.

[Judges 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 15:8</span></span>

smote them hip and thigh--a proverbial expression for a merciless
slaughter.

he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam--rather went down and
dwelt in the cleft--that is, the cave or cavern of the cliff Etam.

[Judges 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 15:9</span></span>

HE IS BOUND BY THE MEN OF JUDAH, AND DELIVERED TO THE PHILISTINES. ([Jdg
15:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#009).md)

Then the Philistines went up--to the high land of Judah.

and spread themselves in Lehi--now El-Lekieh, abounding with limestone
cliffs; the sides of which are perforated with caves. The object of the
Philistines in this expedition was to apprehend Samson, in revenge for
the great slaughter he had committed on their people. With a view of
freeing his own countrymen from all danger from the infuriated
Philistines, he allowed himself to be bound and surrendered a fettered
prisoner into their power. Exulting with joy at the near prospect of
riddance from so formidable an enemy, they went to meet him. But he
exerted his superhuman strength, and finding a new (or moist) jawbone of
an ass, he laid hold of it, and with no other weapon, slew a thousand
men at a place which he called Ramath-lehi--that is, "the hill of the
jawbone."

[Judges 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 15:16</span></span>

With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass
have I slain a thousand men--The inadequacy of the weapon plainly shows
this to have been a miraculous feat, "a case of supernatural strength,"
just as the gift of prophecy is a case of supernatural knowledge
\[CHALMERS\].

[Judges 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 15:19</span></span>

a hollow place . . . in the jaw--"in Lehi"--taking the word as a proper
noun, marking the place.

there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
again--His strength, exhausted by the violent and long-continued
exertion, was recruited by the refreshing draft from the spring; and it
was called

En-hakkore--the "supplication well," a name which records the piety of
this heroic champion.
