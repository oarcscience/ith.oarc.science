### [1 Corinthians Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

[1 Corinthians 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co1 16:1</span></span>

DIRECTIONS AS TO THE COLLECTION FOR THE JUDEAN CHRISTIANS: PAUL'S FUTURE
PLANS: HE COMMENDS TO THEM TIMOTHY, APOLLOS, &C. SALUTATIONS AND
CONCLUSIONS. (1Co. 16:1-24)

collection for the saints--at Jerusalem ([Rom
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026)) and in Judea ([Act
11:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029); [Act
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017); compare [Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004); [Co2
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#001), [Co2
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#012)). He says "saints" rather than
"the poor," to remind the Corinthians that in giving, it is to the
Lord's people, their own brethren in the faith. Towards the close of the
national existence of the Jews, Judea and Jerusalem were harassed with
various troubles, which in part affected the Jewish Christians. The
community of goods which existed among them for a time gave temporary
relief but tended ultimately to impoverish all by paralyzing individual
exertion ([Act 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044)), and hence was
soon discontinued. A beautiful fruit of grace it was, that he who had by
persecutions robbed many of their all ([Act
26:10](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#010)), should become the foremost in
exertions for their relief.

as I have given--rather, "gave order," namely, during my journey through
Galatia, that mentioned in [Act 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023).
The churches of Galatia and Phrygia were the last which Paul visited
before writing this Epistle. He was now at Ephesus, and came thither
immediately from visiting them ([Act
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023); [Act
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)). That he had not been silent in
Galatia on contributions for the poor, appears from the hint let fall in
his Epistle to that church ([Gal
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010)): an undesigned coincidence and
mark of genuineness \[PALEY, HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. He proposes
the Galatians as an example to the Corinthians, the Corinthians to the
Macedonians, the Corinthians and Macedonians to the Romans ([Rom
15:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#026); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002)). There is great force in example.

[1 Corinthians 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co1 16:2</span></span>

first day of . . . week--already kept sacred by Christians as the day of
the Lord's resurrection, the beginning day both of the physical and of
the new spiritual creations: it gradually superseded the Jewish sabbath
on the seventh day ([Psa 118:22-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022);
[Joh 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019), [Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026); [Act
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007); [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010)). So the beginning of the year
was changed from autumn to spring when Israel was brought out of Egypt.
Three annual feasts, all typical of Christian truths, were directed to
be kept on the first day of the week: the feast of the wave offering of
the first sheaf, answering to the Lord's resurrection; Pentecost, or the
feast of weeks, typical of the fruits of the resurrection in the
Christian Church ([Lev 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#011), [Lev
23:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#015), [Lev
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#036)); the feast of tabernacles at
harvest, typical of the ingathering of the full number of the elect from
one end of heaven to the other. Easter was directed to be kept as a holy
sabbath ([Exo 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#016)). The Christian
Sabbath commemorates the respective works of the Three Persons of the
Triune God--creation, redemption (the resurrection), and sanctification
(on Pentecost the Holy Ghost being poured out). Jesus came to fulfil the
Spirit of the Law, not to cancel it, or to lower its standard. The
primary object of the sabbath is holiness, not merely rest: "Remember
that thou keep holy the sabbath day." Compare [Gen
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#003), "God blessed and sanctified it,
because . . . in it He had rested," &c. The word "Remember" implies that
it was in existence before the giving of the law from Sinai, and refers
to its institution in Paradise (compare [Exo
16:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#022), [Exo
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#026), [Exo
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#030)). "Six days shalt thou labor":
the spirit of the command is fulfilled whether the six days' labor be on
the last six days or on the first. A perpetual sabbath would doubtless
be the highest Christian ideal; but living in a world of business where
the Christian ideal is not yet realized, if a law of definite times was
necessary in Paradise, it is still more so now.

every one of yon--even those in limited circumstances.

lay by him--though there be not a weekly public collection, each is
privately to set apart a definite proportion of his weekly income for
the Lord's cause and charity.

in store--abundantly: the earnest of a better store laid up for the
giver ([Ti1 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#019)).

as God hath prospered him--literally, "whatsoever he may be prospered
in," or "may by prosperity have acquired" \[ALFORD\], ([Mat
25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015); [Co2
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#012)).

that there be no gatherings when I come--that they may not then have to
be made, when your and my time ought to be employed m more directly
spiritual things. When men give once for all, not so much is given. But
when each lays by something every Lord's day, more is collected than one
would have given at once \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co1 16:3</span></span>

approve by your letters--rather translate, "Whomsoever ye shall approve,
them will I send with letters": namely, letters to several persons at
Jerusalem, which would be their credentials. There could be no need of
letters from them before Paul's coming, if the persons recommended were
not to be sent off before it. Literally, "by letters"; an abbreviated
expression for "I will send, recommending them by letters" \[GROTIUS\].
If English Version be retained, the sense will be, "When I come, I will
send those whom by your letters, then to be given them, ye shall
approve." But the antithesis (opposition or contrast) to Paul himself
([Co1 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004)) favors GROTIUS' view. So
"by" means with ([Rom 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)); and the
Greek for "by" is translated, with ([Co2
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)).

liberality--literally, gracious or free gift ([Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co1 16:4</span></span>

meet--"worth while." If your collections be large enough to be worth an
apostle's journey (a stimulus to their liberality), I will accompany
them myself instead of giving them letters credential ([Co1
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#003); compare [Act
20:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)).

with me--to guard against all possible suspicion of evil ([Co2
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004), [Co2
8:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#019)).

[1 Corinthians 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co1 16:5</span></span>

His first intention had been ([Co2
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#015)) to pass through them
(Corinth) to Macedonia, and again return to them from Macedonia, and so
to Judea; this he had announced in the lost epistle ([Co1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#009)); now having laid aside this
intention (for which he was charged with levity, [Co2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017), &c., whereas it was through
lenity, [Co2 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023); [Co2
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#001)), he announces his second plan of
"not seeing them now by the way," but "passing through Macedonia" first
on his way to them, and then "tarrying a while," and even "abiding and
wintering with them."

for I do pass--as much as to say, "This is what I at last resolve upon"
(not as the erroneous subscription of the Epistle represents it, as if
he was THEN at Philippi, on his way through Macedonia); implying that
there had been some previous communication upon the subject of the
journey, and also that there had been some indecisiveness in the
apostle's plan \[PALEY\]. In accordance with his second plan, we find
him in Macedonia when Second Corinthians was written ([Co2
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013); [Co2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001); [Co2
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002), [Co2
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004)), and on his way to Corinth ([Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014); [Co2
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001); compare [Act
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001)). "Pass through" is opposed to
"abide" ([Co1 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)). He was not yet in
Macedonia (as [Co1 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008) shows), but at
Ephesus; but he was thinking of passing through it (not abiding as he
purposed to do at Corinth).

[1 Corinthians 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co1 16:6</span></span>

He did "abide and even winter" for the three WINTER months in Greece
(Corinth), [Act 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003), [Act
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006); from which passage it seems that
Paul probably left Corinth about a month before the "days of unleavened
bread" or the Passover (so as to allow time to touch at Thessalonica and
Berea, from which cities two of his companions were; as we read he did
at Philippi); so that thus the three months at Corinth would be
December, January, and February \[BIRKS, HorÃ&brvbr;
ApostolicÃ&brvbr;\].

ye--emphatical in the Greek.

whithersoever I go--He purposed to go to Judea ([Co2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#016)) from Corinth, but his plans were
not positively fixed as yet (see on [Co1
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#004); compare [Act
19:21](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)).

[1 Corinthians 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co1 16:7</span></span>

I will not see you now by the way--literally, "I do not wish to see you
this time in passing"; that is, to pay you now what would have to be a
merely passing visit as I did in the second visit ([Co2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#014)). In contrast to "a while," that
is, some time, as the Greek might better be translated.

but--The oldest manuscripts read "for."

[1 Corinthians 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co1 16:8</span></span>

at Ephesus--whence Paul writes this Epistle. Compare [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019), "Asia," wherein Ephesus was.

until Pentecost--He seems to have stayed as he here purposes: for just
when the tumult which drove him away broke out, he was already intending
to leave Ephesus ([Act 19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021)).
Combined with [Co1 5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007), this verse
fixes the date of this Epistle to a few weeks before Pentecost, and very
soon after the Passover.

[1 Corinthians 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co1 16:9</span></span>

door-- ([Co2 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)). An opening for the
extension of the Gospel. Wise men are on the watch for, and avail
themselves of, opportunities. So "door of hope," [Hos
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015). "Door of faith," [Act
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027). "An open door," [Rev
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#008). "A door of utterance," [Col
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003). "Great," that is, extensive.
"Effectual," that is, requiring great labors \[ESTIUS\]; or opportune
for effecting great results \[BEZA\].

many adversaries--who would block up the way and prevent us from
entering the open door. Not here false teachers, but open adversaries:
both Jews and heathen. After Paul, by his now long-continued labors at
Ephesus, had produced effects which threatened the interests of those
whose gains were derived from idolatry, "many adversaries" arose ([Act
19:9-23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009)). Where great good is, there
evil is sure to start up as its antagonist.

[1 Corinthians 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co1 16:10</span></span>

Now--rather, "But." Therefore Timothy was not the bearer of the Epistle;
for it would not then be said, "IF Timothy come." He must therefore have
been sent by Paul from Ephesus before this Epistle was written, to
accord with [Co1 4:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017); and yet the
passage here implies that Paul did not expect him to arrive at Corinth
till after the letter was received. He tells them how to treat him "if"
he should arrive. [Act 19:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021) clears
up the difficulty: Timothy, when sent from Ephesus, where this Epistle
was written, did not proceed direct to Corinth, but went first to
Macedonia; thus though sent before the letter, he might not reach
Corinth till after it was received in that city. The undesigned
coincidence between the Epistle and the history, and the clearing up of
the meaning of the former (which does not mention the journey to
Macedonia at all) by the latter, is a sure mark of genuineness \[PALEY,
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\]. It is not certain that Timothy actually
reached Corinth; for in [Act 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022)
only Macedonia is mentioned; but it does not follow that though
Macedonia was the immediate object of his mission, Corinth was not the
ultimate object. The "IF Timothy come," implies uncertainty. [Co2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#001) represents him with Paul in
Macedonia; and [Co2 12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018), speaking of
Titus and others sent to Corinth, does not mention Timothy, which it
would have probably done, had one so closely connected with the apostle
as Timothy was, stayed as his delegate at Corinth. The mission of Titus
then took place, when it became uncertain whether Timothy could go
forward from Macedonia to Corinth, Paul being anxious for immediate
tidings of the state of the Corinthian Church. ALFORD argues that if so,
Paul's adversaries would have charged him with fickleness in this case
also ([Co2 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#017)), as in the case of
his own change of purpose. But Titus was sent directly to Corinth, so as
to arrive there before Timothy could by the route through Macedonia.
Titus' presence would thus make amends for the disappointment as to the
intended visit of Timothy and would disarm adversaries of a charge in
this respect ([Co2 7:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#006)).

without fear--Referring perhaps to a nervous timidity in Timothy's
character ([Ti1 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015); [Ti1
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022), [Ti1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#024)). His youth would add to this
feeling, as well as his country, Lystra, likely to be despised in
refined Corinth.

[1 Corinthians 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co1 16:11</span></span>

despise--This charge is not given concerning any other of the many
messengers whom Paul sent. [Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)
accounts for it (compare [Psa
119:141](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#141)). He was a young man, younger
probably than those usually employed in the Christian missions; whence
Paul apprehending lest he should, on that account, be exposed to
contempt, cautions him, "Let no man despise thy youth" \[PALEY,
HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\].

conduct--set him on his way with every mark of respect, and with
whatever he needs ([Tit 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013)).

in peace-- ([Act 15:33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033); [Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031)). "Peace" is the salutation of
kindness and respect in the East; and so it stands for every blessing.
Perhaps here there is too a contrast between "peace" and the
"contentions" prevalent at Corinth ([Co1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#011)).

I look for him--He and Titus were appointed to meet Paul in Troas,
whither the apostle purposed proceeding from Ephesus ([Co2
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#012)). Paul thus claims their
respect for Timothy as one whom he felt so necessary to himself as "look
for" to him \[THEOPHYLACT\].

with the brethren--Others besides Erastus accompanied Timothy to
Macedonia (compare [Co1 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012); [Act
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#022)).

[1 Corinthians 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co1 16:12</span></span>

Apollos, I greatly desired . . . to come unto you--He says this lest
they should suspect that he from jealousy prevented Apollos' coming to
them; perhaps they had expressly requested Apollos to be sent to them.
Apollos was not at Ephesus when Paul wrote (compare [Co1
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019), and [Co1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001)). Probably Apollos' unwillingness
to go to Corinth at this time was because, being aware of the undue
admiration of his rhetorical style which led astray many at Corinth, he
did not wish to sanction it ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012); [Co1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#004)). Paul's noble freedom from all
selfish jealousy led him to urge Apollos to go; and, on the other hand,
Apollos, having heard of the abuse of his name at Corinth to party
purposes, perseveringly refused to go. Paul, of course, could not state
in his letter particularly these reasons in the existing state of
division prevalent there. He calls Apollos "brother" to mark the unity
that was between the two.

with the brethren--who bear this letter ([Co1
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#017)). (See [Co1
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024), subscription added to the
Epistle). CONYBEARE thinks Titus was one of the bearers of this first
letter ([Co2 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#006), [Co2
8:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#016); [Co2
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#018)). ALFORD thinks "the brethren"
here may be the same as in [Co1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011).

convenient time--Apollos did return to Corinth when their divisions were
moderated \[JEROME\], and so it was a more seasonable time.

[1 Corinthians 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co1 16:13</span></span>

He shows that they ought to make their hopes of salvation to depend not
on Apollos or any other teacher; that it rests with themselves. "Watch
ye": for ye are slumbering. "Stand": for ye are like men tottering.
"Quit you like men; be strong": for ye are effeminate ([Co1
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#014)). "Let all your things be done
with charity" ([Co1 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#001); [Co1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#001)): not with strifes as at present
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]. "In the faith" which was assailed by some ([Co1
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001), [Co1
15:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012)).

[1 Corinthians 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co1 16:15</span></span>

first-fruits of Achaia--the first AchÃ&brvbr;an converts (compare [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005)). The image is from the
first-fruits offered to the Lord ([Lev
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010); compare [Co1
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020)). The members of this family had
been baptized by Paul himself ([Co1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#016)).

addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints--Translate, "Set
themselves, (that is, voluntarily) to minister unto the saints" (compare
[Co2 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#004)).

[1 Corinthians 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co1 16:16</span></span>

for their self-devotion \[ALFORD\].

Fortunatus . . . Achaicus--probably of Stephanas' household.

that . . . lacking on your part--So far as you were unable yourselves to
"refresh my spirit," in that you are absent from me, "they have
supplied" by coming to me from you, and so supplying the means of
intercourse between you and me. They seem to have carried this letter
back; see the subscription below: hence the exhortations, [Co1
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#016), [Co1
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018), as though they would be at
Corinth when the Epistle arrived.

[1 Corinthians 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co1 16:18</span></span>

refreshed my spirit and yours--"yours" will be refreshed on receiving
this letter, by knowing that "my spirit is refreshed" by their having
come to me from you; and (perhaps) by the good report they gave of many
of you ([Co1 1:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004)); my refreshment of
spirit redounds to yours, as being my disciples ([Co2
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013); compare [Zac
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#008)).

acknowledge--render them due acknowledgments by a kind reception of
them: [Th1 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#012), "know" them in their
true worth and treat them accordingly.

18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002); [Rom
16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003)). Originally driven out of
Italy by Claudius, they had come to Corinth (whence their salutation of
the Corinthians is appropriate here), and then had removed with Paul
from Corinth to Ephesus ([Act 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002),
[Act 18:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018), [Rom
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003), [Rom
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005)). A pattern to Christian husbands
and wives. Their Christian self-devoting love appears wherever they were
([Rom 16:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003)). Even the gifted
Apollos, so highly admired at Corinth, owed much of his knowledge to
them ([Act 18:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)). In [Co1
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020), "All the brethren" (that is,
the whole Church) seem to be distinguished from "the church that is in
their house," which was but a partial and private assembly out of the
general Church at Corinth. NEANDER thinks [Rom
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023) refers to "the whole Church"
meeting at the house of Gaius (compare [Col
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015)). "Synagogue" implies an assembly
in general, without reference to the character or motives of its
members. "Church," like the Hebrew Kahal, implies an assembly legally
convened; as, for instance, the Jews met as a body politic to receive
the law (hence Stephen calls it "the Church in the wilderness," [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038)), and having a legal bond of
union. Christ's followers when dispersed from one another cease to be a
congregation (synagogue), but still are a Church, having the common bond
of union to the same Head by the same faith and hope \[VITRINGA,
Synagogue and Temple\]. From this we may explain Paul's entering "into
every house and haling men and women": he would in searching for
Christians go to their several "houses"' of prayer.

in the Lord--They pray for all blessings on you from the Lord, the
source of every good \[GROTIUS\]. ALFORD explains, "in a Christian
manner," as mindful of your common Lord. "In the Lord" seems to me to
refer to their union together in Christ, their prayers for one another's
good being in virtue of that union.

[1 Corinthians 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">co1 16:20</span></span>

holy kiss--the token of the mutual love of Christians, especially at the
Lord's Supper (compare [Rom 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016);
[Th1 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#026)), "in which all the
dissensions of the Corinthians would be swallowed up" \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">co1 16:21</span></span>

salutation . . . with mine own hand--He therefore dictated all the rest
of the Epistle.

[1 Corinthians 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">co1 16:22</span></span>

A solemn closing warning added in his own hand as in [Eph
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024); [Col
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018).

the Lord--who ought to be "loved" above Paul, Apollos, and all other
teachers. Love to one another is to be in connection with love to Him
above all. IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the Romans, 7\] writes of Christ, "My
love, has been crucified" (compare [Sol
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#007)).

Jesus Christ--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

let him be Anathema--accursed with that curse which the Jews who call
Jesus "accursed" ([Co1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)) are
bringing righteously on their own heads \[BENGEL\]. So far from
"saluting" him, I bid him be accursed.

Maranatha--Syriac for, "the Lord cometh." A motto or watchword to urge
them to preparedness for the Lord's coming; as in [Phi
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005), "The Lord is at hand."

[1 Corinthians 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">co1 16:23</span></span>

The grace, &c.--This is the salutation meant in [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021); and from which unbelievers
([Co1 16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022); compare [Jo2
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010)) are excluded \[BENGEL\].

[1 Corinthians 16:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">co1 16:24</span></span>

My love, &c.--After having administered some severe rebukes, he closes
with expressions of "love": his very rebukes were prompted by love, and
therefore are altogether in harmony with the profession of love here
made: it was love in Christ Jesus, and therefore embraced "all" who
loved Him.

The subscription represents the Epistle as written from Philippi. [Co1
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008) shows it was written at Ephesus.
BENGEL conjectures that perhaps, however, it was sent from Philippi
([Co1 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#005)), because the deputies of
the Corinthians had accompanied Paul thither. From Ephesus there was a
road to Corinth above Philippi.
