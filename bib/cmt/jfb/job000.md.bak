JOB A REAL PERSON.--It has been supposed by some that the book of Job is
an allegory, not a real narrative, on account of the artificial
character of many of its statements. Thus the sacred numbers, three and
seven, often occur. He had seven thousand sheep, seven sons, both before
and after his trials; his three friends sit down with him seven days and
seven nights; both before and after his trials he had three daughters.
So also the number and form of the speeches of the several speakers seem
to be artificial. The name of Job, too, is derived from an Arabic word
signifying repentance.

But [Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md) (compare [Eze
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#016.md), [Eze
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020).md) speaks of "Job" in conjunction
with "Noah and Daniel," real persons. St. James ([Jam
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#011).md) also refers to Job as an example
of "patience," which he would not have been likely to do had Job been
only a fictitious person. Also the names of persons and places are
specified with a particularity not to be looked for in an allegory. As
to the exact doubling of his possessions after his restoration, no doubt
the round number is given for the exact number, as the latter approached
near the former; this is often done in undoubtedly historical books. As
to the studied number and form of the speeches, it seems likely that the
arguments were substantially those which appear in the book, but that
the studied and poetic form was given by Job himself, guided by the Holy
Spirit. He lived one hundred and forty years after his trials, and
nothing would be more natural than that he should, at his leisure, mould
into a perfect form the arguments used in the momentous debate, for the
instruction of the Church in all ages. Probably, too, the debate itself
occupied several sittings; and the number of speeches assigned to each
was arranged by preconcerted agreement, and each was allowed the
interval of a day or more to prepare carefully his speech and replies;
this will account for the speakers bringing forward their arguments in
regular series, no one speaking out of his turn. As to the name
Job--repentance (supposing the derivation correct)--it was common in old
times to give a name from circumstances which occurred at an advanced
period of life, and this is no argument against the reality of the
person.

WHERE JOB LIVED.--"Uz," according to GESENIUS, means a light, sandy
soil, and was in the north of Arabia-Deserta, between Palestine and the
Euphrates, called by PTOLEMY (Geography, 19) Ausitai or Aisitai. In [Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023.md); [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md); [Gen
36:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#028.md); and [Ch1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#017.md), [Ch1
1:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#042.md), it is the name of a man. In [Jer
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#020.md); [Lam
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md); and [Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md), it is a country. Uz, in [Gen
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md), is said to be the son of Nahor,
brother of Abraham--a different person from the one mentioned ([Gen
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#023).md), a grandson of Shem. The
probability is that the country took its name from the latter of the
two; for this one was the son of Aram, from whom the Arameans take their
name, and these dwelt in Mesopotamia, between the rivers Euphrates and
Tigris. Compare as to the dwelling of the sons of Shem in [Gen
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#030.md), "a mount of the East,"
answering to "men of the East" ([Job
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md). RAWLINSON, in his deciphering of
the Assyrian inscriptions, states that "Uz is the prevailing name of the
country at the mouth of the Euphrates." It is probable that Eliphaz the
Temanite and the Sabeans dwelt in that quarter; and we know that the
Chaldeans resided there, and not near Idumea, which some identify with
Uz. The tornado from "the wilderness" ([Job
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#019).md) agrees with the view of it being
Arabia-Deserta. Job ([Job 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#003).md) is
called "the greatest of the men of the East"; but Idumea was not east,
but south of Palestine: therefore in Scripture language, the phrase
cannot apply to that country, but probably refers to the north of
Arabia-Deserta, between Palestine, Idumea, and the Euphrates. So the
Arabs still show in the Houran a place called Uz as the residence of
Job.

THE AGE WHEN JOB LIVED.--EUSEBIUS fixes it two ages before Moses, that
is, about the time of Isaac: eighteen hundred years before Christ, and
six hundred after the Deluge. Agreeing with this are the following
considerations: 1. Job's length of life is patriarchal, two hundred
years. 2. He alludes only to the earliest form of idolatry, namely, the
worship of the sun, moon, and heavenly hosts (called Saba, whence arises
the title "Lord of Sabaoth," as opposed to Sabeanism) ([Job
31:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026).md). 3. The number of oxen and
rams sacrificed, seven, as in the case of Balaam. God would not have
sanctioned this after the giving of the Mosaic law, though He might
graciously accommodate Himself to existing customs before the law. 4.
The language of Job is Hebrew, interspersed occasionally with Syriac and
Arabic expressions, implying a time when all the Shemitic tribes spoke
one common tongue and had not branched into different dialects, Hebrew,
Syriac, and Arabic. 5. He speaks of the most ancient kind of writing,
namely, sculpture. Riches also are reckoned by cattle. The Hebrew word,
translated "a piece of money," ought rather be rendered "a lamb." 6.
There is no allusion to the exodus from Egypt and to the miracles that
accompanied it; nor to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (PATRICK,
however, thinks there is); though there is to the Flood ([Job
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#017).md); and these events, happening in
Job's vicinity, would have been striking illustrations of the argument
for God's interposition in destroying the wicked and vindicating the
righteous, had Job and his friends known of them. Nor is there any
undoubted reference to the Jewish law, ritual, and priesthood. 7. The
religion of Job is that which prevailed among the patriarchs previous to
the law; sacrifices performed by the head of the family; no officiating
priesthood, temple, or consecrated altar.

THE WRITER.--All the foregoing facts accord with Job himself having been
the author. The style of thought, imagery, and manners, are such as we
should look for in the work of an Arabian emir. There is precisely that
degree of knowledge of primitive tradition (see [Job
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#033), as to Adam.md) which was
universally spread abroad in the days of Noah and Abraham, and which was
subsequently embodied in the early chapters of Genesis. Job, in his
speeches, shows that he was much more competent to compose the work than
Elihu, to whom LIGHTFOOT attributes it. The style forbids its being
attributed to Moses, to whom its composition is by some attributed,
"whilst he was among the Midianites, about 1520 B.C." But the fact, that
it, though not a Jewish book, appears among the Hebrew sacred writings,
makes it likely that it came to the knowledge of Moses during the forty
years which he passed in parts of Arabia, chiefly near Horeb; and that
he, by divine guidance, introduced it as a sacred writing to the
Israelites, to whom, in their affliction, the patience and restoration
of Job were calculated to be a lesson of especial utility. That it is
inspired appears from the fact that Paul ([Co1
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#019).md) quotes it ([Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013).md) with the formula, "It is
written." Our Savior, too [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028).md),
plainly refers to [Job 29:30](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#030.md). Compare
also [Jam 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md) and [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md) with [Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029.md); [Rom
11:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md) with [Job
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008.md). It is probably the oldest book
in the world. It stands among the Hagiographa in the threefold division
of Scripture into the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa ("Psalms,"
[Luk 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044).md).

DESIGN OF THE BOOK.--It is a public debate in poetic form on an
important question concerning the divine government; moreover the
prologue and epilogue, which are in prose, shed the interest of a living
history over the debate, which would otherwise be but a contest of
abstract reasonings. To each speaker of the three friends three speeches
are assigned. Job having no one to stand by him is allowed to reply to
each speech of each of the three. Eliphaz, as the oldest, leads the way.
Zophar, at his third turn, failed to speak, thus virtually owning
himself overcome (Job 27:1-23). Therefore Job continued his reply, which
forms three speeches ([Job 26:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#001.md);
Job 27:1-23; Job 28:1-28; Job 29:1-31:40). Elihu (Job 32:1-37:24) is
allowed four speeches. Jehovah makes three addresses (Job 38:1-41:34).
Thus, throughout there is a tripartite division. The whole is divided
into three parts--the prologue, poem proper, and epilogue. The poem,
into three--(1) The dispute of Job and his three friends; (2) The
address of Elihu; (3) The address of God. There are three series in the
controversy, and in the same order. The epilogue (Job 42:1-17) also is
threefold; Job's justification, reconciliation with his friends,
restoration. The speakers also in their successive speeches regularly
advance from less to greater vehemence. With all this artificial
composition, everything seems easy and natural.

The question to be solved, as exemplified in the case of Job, is, Why
are the righteous afflicted consistently with God's justice? The
doctrine of retribution after death, no doubt, is the great solution of
the difficulty. And to it Job plainly refers in [Job
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014.md), and [Job
19:25](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025.md). The objection to this, that the
explicitness of the language on the resurrection in Job is inconsistent
with the obscurity on the subject in the early books of the Old
Testament, is answered by the fact that Job enjoyed the divine vision
([Job 38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001.md); [Job
42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005).md), and therefore, by inspiration,
foretold these truths. Next, the revelations made outside of Israel
being few needed to be the more explicit; thus Balaam's prophecy ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017).md) was clear enough to lead the
wise men of the East by the star ([Mat
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002).md); and in the age before the
written law, it was the more needful for God not to leave Himself
without witness of the truth. Still Job evidently did not fully realize
the significance designed by the Spirit in his own words (compare [Pe1
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#011).md). The doctrine, though
existing, was not plainly revealed or at least understood. Hence he does
not mainly refer to this solution. Yes, and even now, we need something
in addition to this solution. David, who firmly believed in a future
retribution ([Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md); [Psa
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015).md), still felt the difficulty not
entirely solved thereby (Psa. 83:1-18). The solution is not in Job's or
in his three friends' speeches. It must, therefore, be in Elihu's. God
will hold a final judgment, no doubt, to clear up all that seems dark in
His present dealings; but He also now providentially and morally governs
the world and all the events of human life. Even the comparatively
righteous are not without sin which needs to be corrected. The justice
and love of God administer the altogether deserved and merciful
correction. Affliction to the godly is thus mercy and justice in
disguise. The afflicted believer on repentance sees this. "Via crucis,
via salutis" \["The way of the cross, the way of deliverance"\]. Though
afflicted, the godly are happier even now than the ungodly, and when
affliction has attained its end, it is removed by the Lord. In the Old
Testament the consolations are more temporal and outward; in the New
Testament, more spiritual; but in neither to the entire exclusion of the
other. "Prosperity," says BACON, "is the blessing of the Old Testament;
adversity that of the New Testament, which is the mark of God's more
especial favor. Yet even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David's
harp, you shall hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil
of the Holy Ghost has labored more in describing the afflictions of Job
than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears and
distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes." This
solution of Elihu is seconded by the addresses of God, in which it is
shown God must be just (because He is God), as Elihu had shown how God
can be just, and yet the righteous be afflicted. It is also acquiesced
in by Job, who makes no reply. God reprimands the "three" friends, but
not Elihu. Job's general course is approved; he is directed to intercede
for his friends, and is restored to double his former prosperity.

POETRY.--In all countries poetry is the earliest form of composition as
being best retained in the memory. In the East especially it was
customary for sentiments to be preserved in a terse, proverbial, and
poetic form (called maschal). Hebrew poetry is not constituted by the
rhythm or meter, but in a form peculiar to itself: 1. In an alphabetical
arrangement somewhat like our acrostic. For instance, Lam. 1:1-22. 2.
The same verse repeated at intervals; as in [Psa
42:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md); Psa. 107:1-43. 3. Rhythm of
gradation. Psalms of degrees, Psa. 120:1-134:3, in which the expression
of the previous verse is resumed and carried forward in the next ([Psa
121:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001).md). 4. The chief characteristic
of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, or the correspondence of the same ideas
in the parallel clauses. The earliest instance is Enoch's prophecy ([Jde
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014).md), and Lamech's parody of it ([Gen
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023)). Three kinds occur: (1.md) The
synonymous parallelism, in which the second is a repetition of the
first, with or without increase of force ([Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027.md); [Isa
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#001).md); sometimes with double
parallelism ([Isa 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)). (2.md) The
antithetic, in which the idea of the second clause is the converse of
that in the first ([Pro 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001)). (3.md) The
synthetic, where there is a correspondence between different
propositions, noun answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member,
the sentiment, moreover, being not merely echoed, or put in contrast,
but enforced by accessory ideas ([Job
3:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003).md). Also alternate ([Isa
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#019).md). "Desolation and destruction,
famine and sword," that is, desolation by famine, and destruction by the
sword. Introverted; where the fourth answers to the first, and the third
to the second ([Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006).md). Parallelism
thus often affords a key to the interpretation. For fuller information,
see LOWTH (Introduction to Isaiah, and Lecture on Hebrew Poetry) and
HERDER (Spirit of Hebrew Poetry, translated by Marsh). The simpler and
less artificial forms of parallelism prevail in Job--a mark of its early
age.
