### [Revelation Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 4:1</span></span>

VISION OF GOD'S THRONE IN HEAVEN; THE FOUR AND TWENTY ELDERS; THE FOUR
LIVING CREATURES. ([Rev 4:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001).md)

After this--Greek, "After these things," marking the opening of the next
vision in the succession. Here is the transition from "the things which
are" ([Rev 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019).md), the existing state
of the seven churches, as a type of the Church in general, in John's
time, to "the things which shall be hereafter," namely, in relation to
the time when John wrote.

I looked--rather as Greek, "I saw" in vision; not as English Version
means, I directed my look that way.

was--Omit, as not being in the Greek.

opened--"standing open"; not as though John saw it in the act of being
opened. Compare [Eze 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md); [Mat
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md); [Act
7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md); [Act
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011.md). But in those visions the
heavens opened, disclosing the visions to those below on earth. Whereas
here, heaven, the temple of God, remains closed to those on earth, but
John is transported in vision through an open door up into heaven,
whence he can see things passing on earth or in heaven, according as the
scenes of the several visions require.

the first voice which I heard--the voice which I heard at first, namely,
in [Rev 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md); the former voice.

was as it were--Omit was, it not being in the Greek. "Behold" governs in
sense both "a door," &c., and "the first voice," &c.

Come up hither--through the "open door."

be--come to pass.

hereafter--Greek, "after these things": after the present time ([Rev
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#019).md).

[Revelation 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 4:2</span></span>

And--omitted in the two oldest manuscripts, Vulgate, Syriac.

I was, &c.--Greek, "I became in the Spirit" (see on [Rev
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010).md): I was completely rapt in vision
into the heavenly world.

was set--not was placed, but was situated, literally, "lay."

one sat on the throne--the Eternal Father: the Creator ([Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011).md): also compare [Rev
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md) with [Rev
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md), where also the Father is
designated, "which is, and was, and is to come." When the Son, "the
Lamb," is introduced, [Rev 5:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005.md), a
new song is sung which distinguishes the Sitter on the throne from the
Lamb, "Thou hast redeemed us to God," and [Rev
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#013.md), "Unto Him that sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb." So also in [Rev
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#007.md), as in [Dan
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md), the Son of man brought before
the Ancient of days is distinguished from Him. The Father in essence is
invisible, but in Scripture at times is represented as assuming a
visible form.

[Revelation 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 4:3</span></span>

was--omitted in the two oldest manuscripts but supported by Vulgate and
Coptic.

to look upon--Greek, "in sight," or "appearance."

jasper--From [Rev 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011.md), where it is
called most precious, which the jasper was not, EBRARD infers it was a
diamond. Ordinarily, the jasper is a stone of various wavy colors,
somewhat transparent: in [Rev 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011.md) it
represents watery crystalline brightness. The sardine, our cornelian, or
else a fiery red. As the watery brightness represents God's holiness, so
the fiery red His justice executing fiery wrath. The same union of white
or watery brightness and fiery redness appears in [Rev
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md); [Rev
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#001.md); [Eze
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md); [Eze
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#002.md); [Dan
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md).

rainbow round about the throne--forming a complete circle (type of God's
perfection and eternity: not a half circle as the earthly rainbow)
surrounding the throne vertically. Its various colors, which combined
form one pure solar ray, symbolize the varied aspects of God's
providential dealings uniting in one harmonious whole. Here, however,
the predominating color among the prismatic colors is green, the most
refreshing of colors to look upon, and so symbolizing God's consolatory
promises in Christ to His people amidst judgments on His foes. Moreover,
the rainbow was the appointed token of God's covenant with all flesh,
and His people in particular. Hereby God in type renewed to man the
grant originally made to the first Adam. The antitype will be the "new
heavens and the new earth" restored to redeemed man, just as the earth,
after the destruction by the flood, was restored to Noah. As the rainbow
was first reflected on the waters of the world's ruin, and continues to
be seen only when a cloud is brought over the earth, so another deluge,
namely, of fire, shall precede the new heavens and earth: the Lord, as
here, on His throne, whence ([Rev 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005).md)
proceed "lightnings and thunderings," shall issue the commission to rid
the earth of its oppressors: but then, amidst judgment, when other men's
hearts fail them for fear, the believer shall be reassured by the
rainbow, the covenant token, round the throne (compare DE BURGH,
Exposition of Revelation). The heavenly bow speaks of the shipwreck of
the world through sin: it speaks also of calm and sunshine after the
storm. The cloud is the regular token of God's and Christ's presence,
for example, in the tabernacle's holiest place; on Mount Sinai at the
giving of the law; at the ascension ([Act
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009).md); at His coming again ([Rev
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007).md).

[Revelation 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 4:4</span></span>

seats--rather as the Greek is translated in this very verse, "thrones,"
of course lower and smaller than the grand central throne. So [Rev
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#010), "the seat (rather, throne.md) of
the beasts," in hellish parody of God's throne.

four and twenty elders--Greek, "the four and twenty (or as one oldest
manuscript, 'twenty-four') elders": the well-known elders \[ALFORD\].
But TREGELLES translates, "Upon the twenty-four thrones (I saw: omitted
in two oldest manuscripts) elders sitting": which is more probable, as
the twenty-four elders were not mentioned before, whereas the
twenty-four thrones were. They are not angels, for they have white robes
and crowns of victory, implying a conflict and endurance, "Thou hast
redeemed us": they represent the Heads of the Old and New Testament
churches respectively, the Twelve Patriarchs (compare [Rev
7:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#005.md), not in their personal, but in
their representative character), and Twelve Apostles. So in [Rev
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#003.md), "the song of Moses, and of the
Lamb," the double constituents of the Church are implied, the Old
Testament and the New Testament. "Elders" is the very term for the
ministry both of the Old and New Testament, the Jewish and the catholic
Gentile Church. The tabernacle was a "pattern" of the heavenly antitype;
the holy place, a figure of HEAVEN ITSELF. Thus Jehovah's throne is
represented by the mercy seat in the holiest, the Shekinah-cloud over
it. "The seven lamps of fire before the throne" ([Rev
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005).md) are antitypical to the
seven-branched candlestick also in the holiest, emblem of the manifold
Spirit of God: "the sea of glass" ([Rev
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md) corresponds to the molten sea
before the sanctuary, wherein the priests washed themselves before
entering on their holy service; so introduced here in connection with
the redeemed "priests unto God" (compare Note, see on [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002).md). The "four living creatures"
([Rev 4:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md) answer to the cherubim
over the mercy seat. So the twenty-four throned and crowned elders are
typified by the twenty-four chiefs of the twenty-four courses of
priests, "Governors of the sanctuary, and governors of God" ([Ch1
24:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#005); 1Ch. 25:1-31.md).

[Revelation 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 4:5</span></span>

proceeded--Greek, "proceed."

thunderings and voices--The two oldest manuscripts transpose, "voices
and thunderings." Compare at the giving of the law on Sinai, [Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md). "The thunderings express God's
threats against the ungodly: there are voices in the thunders ([Rev
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev010.htm#003).md), that is, not only does He
threaten generally, but also predicts special judgments" \[GROTIUS\].

seven lamps . . . seven Spirits--The Holy Spirit in His sevenfold
operation, as the light-and-life Giver (compare [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006.md), seven eyes . . . the seven
Spirits of God; [Rev 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004.md); [Rev
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md); [Psa
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105).md) and fiery purifier of the
godly, and consumer of the ungodly ([Mat
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011).md).

[Revelation 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 4:6</span></span>

Two oldest manuscripts, A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, and Syriac read, "As it
were a sea of glass."

like . . . crystal--not imperfectly transparent as the ancient common
glass, but like rock crystal. Contrast the turbid "many waters" on which
the harlot "sitteth" ([Rev 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md), [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015).md). Compare [Job
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#018.md), "the sky . . . as a molten
looking-glass." Thus, primarily, the pure ether which separates God's
throne from John, and from all things before it, may be meant,
symbolizing the "purity, calmness, and majesty of God's rule"
\[ALFORD\]. But see the analogue in the temple, the molten sea before
the sanctuary (see on [Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004.md),
above). There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the
fluidity and instability of the natural sea (compare [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md). It stands solid, calm, and
clear, God's judgments are called "a great deep" ([Psa
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006).md). In [Rev
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md) it is a "sea of glass mingled
with fire." Thus there is symbolized here the purificatory baptism of
water and the Spirit of all who are made "kings and priests unto God."
In [Rev 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#002.md) the baptism with the fire
of trial is meant. Through both all the king-priests have to pass in
coming to God: His judgments, which overwhelm the ungodly, they stand
firmly upon, as on a solid sea of glass; able like Christ to walk on the
sea, as though it were solid.

round about the throne--one in the midst of each side of the throne.

four beasts--The Greek for "beasts," [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md), [Rev
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#011.md), is different, therion, the
symbol for the carnal man by opposition to God losing his true glory, as
lord, under Him, of the lower creatures, and degraded to the level of
the beast. Here it is zoon, "living creatures"; not beast.

[Revelation 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 4:7</span></span>

calf--"a steer" \[ALFORD\]. The Septuagint often uses the Greek term
here for an ox ([Exo 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001.md); [Exo
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#010), &c..md).

as a man--The oldest manuscripts have "as of a man."

[Revelation 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 4:8</span></span>

about him--Greek, "round about him." ALFORD connects this with the
following sentence: "All round and within (their wings) they are (so two
oldest manuscripts, A, B, and Vulgate read) full of eyes." John's object
is to show that the six wings in each did not interfere with that which
he had before declared, namely, that they were "full of eyes before and
behind." The eyes were round the outside of each wing, and up the inside
of each when half expanded, and of the part of body in that inward
recess.

rest not--literally, "have no rest." How awfully different the reason
why the worshippers of the beast "have no rest day nor night," namely,
"their torment for ever and ever."

Holy, holy, holy--The "tris-hagion" of the Greek liturgies. In [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md), as here, it occurs; also [Psa
99:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#003.md), [Psa
99:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md), [Psa
99:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#009.md), where He is praised as "holy,"
(1) on account of His majesty ([Rev
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#001)) about to display itself; (2.md) His
justice ([Rev 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#004).md) already displaying
itself; (3) His mercy ([Rev 4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#006).md)
which displayed itself in times past. So here "Holy," as He "who was";
"Holy," as He "who is": "Holy," as He "who is to come." He showed
Himself an object of holy worship in the past creation of all things:
more fully He shows Himself so in governing all things: He will, in the
highest degree, show Himself so in the consummation of all things. "Of
(from) Him, through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory
for ever. Amen." In [Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md) there is
added, "the whole EARTH is full of His glory." But in Revelation this is
deferred until the glory of THE LORD fills the earth, His enemies having
been destroyed \[BENGEL\].

Almighty--answering to "Lord of hosts" (Sabaoth), [Isa
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md).

The cherubim here have six wings, like the seraphim in [Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md); whereas the cherubim in [Eze
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md) had four wings each. They are
called by the same name, "living creatures." But whereas in Ezekiel each
living creature has all four faces, here the four belong severally one
to each. See on [Eze 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#006.md). The four
living creatures answer by contrast to the four world powers represented
by four beasts. The Fathers identified them with the four Gospels,
Matthew the lion, Mark the ox, Luke the man, John the eagle: these
symbols, thus viewed, express not the personal character of the
Evangelists, but the manifold aspect of Christ in relation to the world
(four being the number significant of world-wide extension, for example,
the four quarters of the world) presented by them severally: the lion
expressing royalty, as Matthew gives prominence to this feature of
Christ; the ox, laborious endurance, Christ's prominent characteristic
in Mark; man, brotherly sympathy with the whole race of man, Christ's
prominent feature in Luke; the eagle, soaring majesty, prominent in
John's description of Christ as the Divine Word. But here the context
best suits the view which regards the four living creatures as
representing the redeemed election-Church in its relation of ministering
king-priests to God, and ministers of blessing to the redeemed earth,
and the nations on it, and the animal creation, in which man stands at
the head of all, the lion at the head of wild beasts, the ox at the head
of tame beasts, the eagle at the head of birds and of the creatures of
the waters. Compare [Rev 5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008.md), "Thou
hast redeemed us by Thy blood out of every kindred . . . and hast made
us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth"; and
[Rev 20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004.md), the partakers with Christ
of the first resurrection, who conjointly with Him reign over the
redeemed nations that are in the flesh. Compare as to the happy and
willing subjection of the lower animal world, [Isa
11:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md); [Isa
65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025.md); [Eze
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#025.md); [Hos
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018.md). Jewish tradition says the "four
standards" under which Israel encamped in the wilderness, to the east,
Judah, to the north, Dan, to the west, Ephraim, to the south, Reuben,
were respectively a lion, an eagle, an ox, and a man, while in the midst
was the tabernacle containing the Shekinah symbol of the Divine
Presence. Thus we have "the picture of that blessed period when--the
earth having been fitted for being the kingdom of the Father--the court
of heaven will be transferred to earth, and the 'tabernacle of God shall
be with men' ([Rev 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md), and the
whole world will be subject to a never-ending theocracy" (compare DE
BURGH, Exposition of Revelation). The point of union between the two
views given above is: Christ is the perfect realization of the ideal of
man; Christ is presented in His fourfold aspect in the four Gospels
respectively. The redeemed election-Church similarly, when in and
through Christ (with whom she shall reign) she realizes the ideal of
man, shall combine in herself human perfections having a fourfold
aspect: (1) kingly righteousness with hatred of evil and judicial
equity, answering to the "lion"; (2) laborious diligence in every duty,
the "ox"; (3) human sympathy, the "man"; (4) the contemplation of
heavenly truth, the "eagle." As the high-soaring intelligence, the
eagle, forms the contrasted complement to practical labor, the ox bound
to the soil; so holy judicial vengeance against evil, the lion springing
suddenly and terribly on the doomed, forms the contrasted complement to
human sympathy, the man. In [Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md)
we read, "Each had six wings: with twain he covered his face (in
reverence, as not presuming to lift up his face to God), with twain he
covered his feet (in humility, as not worthy to stand in God's holy
presence), and with twain he did fly \[in obedient readiness to do
instantly God's command\]."

[Revelation 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 4:9</span></span>

The ground of praise here is God's eternity, and God's power and glory
manifested in the creation of all things for His pleasure. Creation is
the foundation of all God's other acts of power, wisdom, and love, and
therefore forms the first theme of His creatures' thanksgivings. The
four living creatures take the lead of the twenty-four elders, both in
this anthem, and in that new song which follows on the ground of their
redemption ([Rev 5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#008).md).

when--that is, whensoever: as often as. A simultaneous giving of glory
on the part of the beasts, and on the part of the elders.

give--"shall give" in one oldest manuscript.

for ever and ever--Greek, "unto the ages of the ages."

[Revelation 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 4:10</span></span>

fall--immediately. Greek, "shall fall down": implying that this
ascription of praise shall be repeated onward to eternity. So also,
"shall worship . . . shall cast their crowns," namely, in acknowledgment
that all the merit of their crowns (not kingly diadems, but the crowns
of conquerors) is due to Him.

[Revelation 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 4:11</span></span>

O Lord--The two oldest manuscripts, A, B, Vulgate, and Syriac add, "and
our God." "Our" by virtue of creation, and especially redemption. One
oldest manuscript, B, and Syriac insert "the Holy One." But another, A,
Vulgate, and Coptic omit this, as English Version does.

glory, &c.--"the glory . . . the honour . . . the power."

thou--emphatic in the Greek: "It is THOU who didst create."

all things--Greek, "the all things": the universe.

for, &c.--Greek, "on account of"; "for the sake of Thy pleasure," or
"will." English Version is good Greek. Though the context better suits,
it was because of Thy will, that "they were" (so one oldest manuscript,
A, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read, instead of English Version "are":
another oldest manuscript, B, reads, "They were not, and were created,"
were created out of nothing), that is, were existing, as contrasted with
their previous non-existence. With God to will is to effect: to
determine is to perform. So in [Gen
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md), "Let there be light, and there
was light": in Hebrew an expressive tautology, the same word and tense
and letters being used for "let there be," and "there was," marking the
simultaneity and identity of the will and the effect. D. LONGINUS \[On
the Sublime, 9\], a heathen, praises this description of God's power by
"the lawgiver of the Jews, no ordinary man," as one worthy of the theme.

were created--by Thy definite act of creation at a definite time.
