### [Job Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

[Job 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 3:1</span></span>

JOB CURSES THE DAY OF HIS BIRTH AND WISHES FOR DEATH. (Job 3:1-19)

opened his mouth--The Orientals speak seldom, and then sententiously;
hence this formula expressing deliberation and gravity ([Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002).md). He formally began.

cursed his day--the strict Hebrew word for "cursing:" not the same as in
[Job 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md). Job cursed his birthday, but
not his God.

[Job 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 3:2</span></span>

spake--Hebrew, "answered," that is, not to any actual question that
preceded, but to the question virtually involved in the case. His
outburst is singularly wild and bold ([Jer
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#014).md). To desire to die so as to be
free from sin is a mark of grace; to desire to die so as to escape
troubles is a mark of corruption. He was ill-fitted to die who was so
unwilling to live. But his trials were greater, and his light less, than
ours.

[Job 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 3:3</span></span>

the night in which--rather "the night which said." The words in italics
are not in the Hebrew. Night is personified and poetically made to
speak. So in [Job 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#007.md), and in [Psa
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#002.md). The birth of a male in the East
is a matter of joy; often not so of a female.

[Job 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 3:4</span></span>

let not God regard it--rather, more poetically, "seek it out." "Let not
God stoop from His bright throne to raise it up from its dark
hiding-place." The curse on the day in [Job
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#003.md), is amplified in [Job
3:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004.md); that on the night, in [Job
3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md).

[Job 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 3:5</span></span>

Let . . . the shadow of death--("deepest darkness," [Isa
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002).md).

stain it--This is a later sense of the verb \[GESENIUS\]; better the old
and more poetic idea, "Let darkness (the ancient night of chaotic gloom)
resume its rights over light ([Gen
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002).md), and claim that day as its own."

a cloud--collectively, a gathered mass of dark clouds.

the blackness of the day terrify it--literally, "the obscurations";
whatever darkens the day \[GESENIUS\]. The verb in Hebrew expresses
sudden terrifying. May it be suddenly affrighted at its own darkness.
UMBREIT explains it as "magical incantations that darken the day,"
forming the climax to the previous clauses; [Job
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md) speaks of "cursers of the day"
similarly. But the former view is simpler. Others refer it to the
poisonous simoom wind.

[Job 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 3:6</span></span>

seize upon it--as its prey, that is, utterly dissolve it.

joined unto the days of the year--rather, by poetic personification,
"Let it not rejoice in the circle of days and nights and months, which
form the circle of years."

[Job 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 3:7</span></span>

solitary--rather, "unfruitful." "Would that it had not given birth to
me."

[Job 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 3:8</span></span>

them . . . curse the day--If "mourning" be the right rendering in the
latter clause of this verse, these words refer to the hired mourners of
the dead ([Jer 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017).md). But the Hebrew
for "mourning" elsewhere always denotes an animal, whether it be the
crocodile or some huge serpent ([Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001).md), such as is meant by
"leviathan." Therefore, the expression, "cursers of day," refers to
magicians, who were believed to be able by charms to make a day one of
evil omen. (So Balaam, [Num 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#005).md).
This accords with UMBREIT'S view ([Job
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#007).md); or to the Ethiopians and
Atlantes, who "used to curse the sun at his rising for burning up them
and their country" \[HERODOTUS\]. Necromancers claimed power to control
or rouse wild beasts at will, as do the Indian serpent-charmers of our
day ([Psa 58:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#005).md). Job does not say they
had the power they claimed; but, supposing they had, may they curse the
day. SCHUTTENS renders it by supplying words as follows:--Let those that
are ready for anything, call it (the day) the raiser up of leviathan,
that is, of a host of evils.

[Job 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 3:9</span></span>

dawning of the day--literally, "eyelashes of morning." The Arab poets
call the sun the eye of day. His early rays, therefore, breaking forth
before sunrise, are the opening eyelids or eyelashes of morning.

[Job 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 3:12</span></span>

Why did the knees prevent me?--Old English for "anticipate my wants."
The reference is to the solemn recognition of a new-born child by the
father, who used to place it on his knees as his own, whom he was bound
to rear ([Gen 30:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#003.md); [Gen
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023.md); [Isa
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012).md).

[Job 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 3:13</span></span>

lain . . . quiet . . . slept--a gradation. I should not only have lain,
but been quiet, and not only been quiet, but slept. Death in Scripture
is called "sleep" ([Psa 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003).md);
especially in the New Testament, where the resurrection-awakening is
more clearly set forth ([Co1 15:51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md);
[Th1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014.md); [Th1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#010).md).

[Job 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 3:14</span></span>

With kings . . . which built desolate places for themselves--who built
up for themselves what proved to be (not palaces, but) ruins! The
wounded spirit of Job, once a great emir himself, sick of the vain
struggles of mortal great men, after grandeur, contemplates the palaces
of kings, now desolate heaps of ruins. His regarding the repose of death
the most desirable end of the great ones of earth, wearied with heaping
up perishable treasures, marks the irony that breaks out from the black
clouds of melancholy \[UMBREIT\]. The "for themselves" marks their
selfishness. MICHAELIS explains it weakly of mausoleums, such as are
found still, of stupendous proportions, in the ruins of Petra of Idumea.

[Job 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 3:15</span></span>

filled their houses with silver--Some take this to refer to the
treasures which the ancients used to bury with their dead. But see [Job
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#026.md).

[Job 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 3:16</span></span>

untimely birth-- ([Psa 58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008).md);
preferable to the life of the restless miser ([Ecc
6:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#003).md).

[Job 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 3:17</span></span>

the wicked--the original meaning, "those ever restless," "full of
desires" ([Isa 57:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#020).md).

the weary--literally, "those whose strength is wearied out" ([Rev
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013).md).

[Job 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 3:18</span></span>

There the prisoners rest--from their chains.

[Job 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 3:19</span></span>

servant--The slave is there manumitted from slavery.

[Job 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 3:20</span></span>

HE COMPLAINS OF LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS ANGUISH. ([Job
3:20-26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#020).md)

Wherefore giveth he light--namely, God; often omitted reverentially
([Job 24:23](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#023.md); [Ecc
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#009).md). Light, that is, life. The joyful
light ill suits the mourners. The grave is most in unison with their
feelings.

[Job 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">job 3:23</span></span>

whose way is hid--The picture of Job is drawn from a wanderer who has
lost his way, and who is hedged in, so as to have no exit of escape
([Hos 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#006.md); [Lam
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#007.md), [Lam
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#009).md).

[Job 3:24](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">job 3:24</span></span>

my sighing cometh before I eat--that is, prevents my eating \[UMBREIT\];
or, conscious that the effort to eat brought on the disease, Job must
sigh before eating \[ROSENMULLER\]; or, sighing takes the place of good
([Psa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#003).md) \[GOOD\]. But the first
explanation accords best with the text.

my roarings are poured out like the waters--an image from the rushing
sound of water streaming.

[Job 3:25](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">job 3:25</span></span>

the thing which I . . . feared is come upon me--In the beginning of his
trials, when he heard of the loss of one blessing, he feared the loss of
another; and when he heard of the loss of that, he feared the loss of a
third.

that which I was afraid of is come unto me--namely, the ill opinion of
his friends, as though he were a hypocrite on account of his trials.

[Job 3:26](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">job 3:26</span></span>

I was not in safety . . . yet trouble came--referring, not to his former
state, but to the beginning of his troubles. From that time I had no
rest, there was no intermission of sorrows. "And" (not, "yet") a fresh
trouble is coming, namely, my friends' suspicion of my being a
hypocrite. This gives the starting-point to the whole ensuing
controversy.
