### [Jeremiah Chapter 44](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 44:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 44:1</span></span>

JEREMIAH REPROVES THE JEWS FOR THEIR IDOLATRY IN EGYPT, AND DENOUNCES
GOD'S JUDGMENTS ON THEM AND EGYPT ALIKE. (Jer. 44:1-30)

Migdol--meaning a "tower." A city east of Egypt, towards the Red Sea
([Exo 14:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#002.md); [Num
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#007).md).

Noph--Memphis, now Cairo ([Jer 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#016).md).

Pathros--Upper Egypt ([Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 44:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 44:2</span></span>

evil . . . upon Jerusalem--If I spared not My own sacred city, much less
shall ye be safe in Egypt, which I loathe.

[Jeremiah 44:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 44:3</span></span>

they went--implying perverse assiduity: they went out of their way to
burn incense (one species of idolatry put for all kinds), &c.

[Jeremiah 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 44:4</span></span>

([Ch2 36:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 44:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 44:7</span></span>

now--after so many warnings.

commit . . . this . . . evil against your souls-- ([Jer
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#019.md); [Num
16:38](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#038.md); [Pro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036).md). It is not God whom you injure,
but yourselves.

[Jeremiah 44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 44:8</span></span>

in . . . Egypt--where they polluted themselves to ingratiate themselves
with the Egyptians.

ye be gone--not compelled by fear, but of your own accord, when I
forbade you, and when it was free to you to stay in Judea.

that ye might cut yourselves off--They, as it were, purposely courted
their own ruin.

[Jeremiah 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 44:9</span></span>

Have you forgotten how the wickednesses of your fathers were the source
of the greatest calamities to you?

their wives--The Jews' worldly queens were great promoters of idolatry
([Kg1 11:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#001.md); [Kg1
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#013.md); [Kg1
16:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#031).md).

the land of Judah--They defiled the land which was holy unto God.

[Jeremiah 44:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 44:10</span></span>

They . . . you--The third person puts them to a distance from God on
account of their alienating themselves from Him. The second person
implies that God formerly had directly addressed them.

humbled--literally, "contrite" ([Psa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#017).md).

neither . . . feared-- ([Pro 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014).md).

[Jeremiah 44:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 44:11</span></span>

Behold, I will set my face against you for evil--(See on [Lev
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010).md).

and to cut off all Judah--that is, all the idolaters; [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md) shows that some returned to
Judea (compare [Jer 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 44:14</span></span>

none . . . shall escape . . . that they should return, &c.--The Jews had
gone to Egypt with the idea that a return to Judea, which they thought
hopeless to their brethren in Babylon, would be an easy matter to
themselves in Egypt: the exact reverse should happen in the case of each
respectively. The Jews whom God sent to Babylon were there weaned from
idolatry, and were restored; those who went to Egypt by their perverse
will were hardened in idolatry, and perished there.

have a desire--literally, "lift up (their) soul," that is, their hopes
(compare [Jer 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027.md), Margin; [Deu
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015), Margin.md).

none shall return but such as shall escape--namely, the "small number"
([Jer 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028).md) who were brought by force
into Egypt, as Jeremiah and Baruch, and those who, in accordance with
Jeremiah's advice, should flee from Egypt before the arrival of the
Chaldeans (see on [Jer 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017).md). CALVIN
less probably refers the words to the return of the exiles in Babylon,
which the Jews in Egypt regarded as hopeless.

[Jeremiah 44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 44:15</span></span>

their wives--The idolatry began with them ([Kg1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#004.md); [Ti1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#014).md). Their husbands' connivance
implicated them in the guilt.

[Jeremiah 44:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 44:16</span></span>

we will not-- ([Jer 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 44:17</span></span>

whatsoever . . . goeth . . . out of our . . . mouth--whatever vow we
have uttered to our gods ([Jer 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#025.md);
[Deu 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023.md); [Jdg
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#036).md). The source of all
superstitions is that men oppose their own will and fancies to God's
commands.

queen of heaven--(See on [Jer 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#018).md);
Ashtaroth or Astarte.

we . . . fathers . . . king, &c.--The evil was restricted to no one
class: all from the highest to the lowest shared the guilt.

then had we plenty--Fools attribute their seeming prosperity to God's
connivance at their sin: but see [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md); [Ecc
8:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011.md). In fact, God had often
chastised them for their idolatry (see [Jdg
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#014).md); but it is the curse of impiety
not to perceive the hand of God in calamities.

victuals--Men cast away the bread of the soul for the bread that
perisheth ([Deu 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md); [Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027).md). So Esau ([Heb
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 44:18</span></span>

They impute their calamities to their service of God, but these are
often marks of His favor, not of wrath, to do His people good at their
latter end ([Deu 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#016).md).

[Jeremiah 44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 44:19</span></span>

make . . . cakes to worship her--MAURER translates, "to form her image."
Crescent-shaped cakes were offered to the moon. Vulgate supports English
Version.

without our men--The women mentioned ([Jer
44:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015).md); "a great multitude" here
speak: we have not engaged in secret night orgies which might justly be
regarded unfavorably by our husbands: our sacred rites have been open,
and with their privity. They wish to show how unreasonable it is that
Jeremiah should oppose himself alone to the act of all, not merely
women, but men also. The guilty, like these women, desire to shield
themselves under the complicity of others. Instead of helping one
another towards heaven, husband and wife often ripen one another for
hell.

[Jeremiah 44:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 44:21</span></span>

The incense . . . did not the Lord remember--Jeremiah owns that they did
as they said, but in retort asks, did not God repay their own
evil-doing? Their very land in its present desolation attests this ([Jer
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#022).md), as was foretold ([Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md), [Jer
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md), [Jer
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038).md).

[Jeremiah 44:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jer 44:23</span></span>

law--the moral precepts.

statutes--the ceremonial.

testimonies--the judicial ([Dan
9:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 44:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 44:25</span></span>

Ye . . . have both spoken with . . . mouths, and fulfilled with . . .
hand--ironical praise. They had pleaded their obligation to fulfil their
vows, in excuse for their idolatry. He answers, no one can accuse you of
unsteadiness as to your idolatrous vows; but steadfastness towards God
ought to have prevented you from making, or, when made, from keeping
such vows.

ye will surely accomplish . . . vows--Jeremiah hereby gives them up to
their own fatal obstinacy.

[Jeremiah 44:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 44:26</span></span>

I have sworn--I, too have made a vow which I will fulfil. Since ye will
not hear Me speaking and warning, hear Me swearing.

by my great name--that is, by Myself ([Gen
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016).md), the greatest by whom God can
swear ([Heb 6:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md).

my name shall no more be named--The Jews, heretofore, amidst all their
idolatry, had retained the form of appeal to the name of God and the
law, the distinctive glory of their nation; God will allow this no more
([Eze 20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039).md): there shall be none left
there to profane His name thus any more.

[Jeremiah 44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 44:27</span></span>

watch over . . . for evil-- ([Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md); [Eze
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#006).md). The God, whose providence is
ever solicitously watching over His people for good, shall solicitously,
as it were, watch for their hurt. Contrast [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028.md); [Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041.md).

[Jeremiah 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 44:28</span></span>

small number--(see on [Jer 44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md); and
[Jer 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#017.md); [Isa
27:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#013).md); compare "all-consumed" ([Jer
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027).md). A band easily counted, whereas
they were expecting to return triumphantly in large numbers.

shall know--most of them experimentally, and to their cost.

whose words . . . mine, or theirs--Hebrew, "that from Me and them."
Jehovah's words are His threats of destruction to the Jews; theirs, the
assertion that they expected all goods from their gods ([Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017).md), &c. "Mine"; by which I predict
ruin to them. "Theirs"; by which they give themselves free scope in
iniquity.

shall stand-- ([Psa 33:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 44:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">jer 44:29</span></span>

this . . . sign unto you--The calamity of Pharaoh-hophra (see on [Jer
44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030).md) shall be a sign to you that as
he shall fall before his enemy, so you shall subsequently fall before
Nebuchadnezzar ([Mat 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#008).md)
\[GROTIUS\]. CALVIN makes the "sign" to be simultaneous with the event
signified, not antecedent to it, as in [Exo
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012.md). The Jews believed Egypt
impregnable, so shut in was it by natural barriers. The Jews being
"punished in this place" will be a sign that their view is false, and
God's threat true. He calls it "a sign unto you," because God's
prediction is equivalent to the event, so that they may even now take it
as a sign. When fulfilled it would cease to be a sign to them: for they
would be dead.

[Jeremiah 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 44:30</span></span>

Hophra--in HERODOTUS called Apries. He succeeded Psammis, the successor
of Pharaoh-necho, who was beaten by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish, on the
Euphrates. Amasis rebelled against, and overcame him, in the city Sais.

them that seek his life--HERODOTUS, in curious accordance with this,
records that Amasis, after treating Hophra well at first, was
instigated, by persons who thought they could not be safe unless he were
put to death, to strangle him. "His enemies" refer to Amasis, &c.; the
words are accurately chosen, so as not to refer to Nebuchadnezzar, who
is not mentioned till the end of the verse, and in connection with
Zedekiah ([Eze 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#003.md); [Eze
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#021).md). Amasis' civil war with Hophra
pioneered the way for Nebuchadnezzar's invasion in the twenty-third year
of his reign \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 10.11\].

After the completion of the prophecies and histories appertaining to the
Jewish people and kings, Jeremiah subjoins one referring to an
individual, Baruch; even as there are subjoined to the epistles of Paul
addressed to churches, epistles to individuals, some of which were prior
in date to the former. Afterwards follow the prophecies referring to
other nations, closing the book \[GROTIUS\]. The date of the events here
told is eighteen years before the taking of the city; this chapter in
point of time follows the thirty-sixth chapter. Baruch seems to have
been regularly employed by Jeremiah to commit his prophecies to writing
([Jer 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md), [Jer
36:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004.md), [Jer
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032).md).
