### [1 Chronicles Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

[1 Chronicles 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch1 7:1</span></span>

SONS OF ISSACHAR. ([Ch1 7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#001).md)

Jashub--or Job ([Gen 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#013).md).

[1 Chronicles 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 7:2</span></span>

whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six
hundred--Although a census was taken in the reign of David by order of
that monarch, it is not certain that the sacred historian had it in
mind, since we find here the tribe of Benjamin enumerated \[[Ch1
7:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)\], which was not taken in
David's time; and there are other points of dissimilarity.

[1 Chronicles 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch1 7:3</span></span>

five: all of them chief men--Four only are mentioned; so that as they
are stated to be five, in this number the father, Izrahiah, must be
considered as included; otherwise one of the names must have dropped out
of the text. They were each at the head of a numerous and influential
division of their tribe.

[1 Chronicles 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch1 7:5</span></span>

fourscore and seven thousand--exclusive of the 58,600 men which the Tola
branch had produced ([Ch1 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#024).md), so
that in the days of David the tribe would have contained a population of
45,600. This large increase was owing to the practice of polygamy, as
well as the fruitfulness of the women. A plurality of wives, though
tolerated among the Hebrews, was confined chiefly to the great and
wealthy; but it seems to have been generally esteemed a privilege by the
tribe of Issachar, "for they had many wives and sons" \[[Ch1
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#004.md)\].

[1 Chronicles 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch1 7:6</span></span>

OF BENJAMIN. ([Ch1 7:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#006).md)

The sons of Benjamin--Ten are named in [Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021.md), but only five later ([Ch1
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1008.htm#001.md); [Num
26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038).md). Perhaps five of them were
distinguished as chiefs of illustrious families, but two having fallen
in the bloody wars waged against Benjamin ([Jdg
20:46](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#046).md), there remained only three
branches of this tribe, and these only are enumerated.

Jediael--Or Asbel (Genesis 46. 21).

[1 Chronicles 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch1 7:7</span></span>

the sons of Bela--Each of them was chief or leader of the family to
which he belonged. In an earlier period seven great families of Benjamin
are mentioned ([Num 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#038).md), five of
them being headed by these five sons of Benjamin, and two descended from
Bela. Here five families of Bela are specified, whence we are led to
conclude that time or the ravages of war had greatly changed the
condition of Benjamin, or that the five families of Bela were
subordinate to the other great divisions that sprang directly from the
five sons of the patriarch.

[1 Chronicles 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch1 7:12</span></span>

Shuppim also, and Huppim--They are called Muppim and Huppim ([Gen
46:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#021).md) and Hupham and Shupham ([Num
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#039).md). They were the children of Ir,
or Iri ([Ch1 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007).md).

and Hushim, the sons--"son."

of Aher--"Aher" signifies "another," and some eminent critics, taking
"Aher" as a common noun, render the passage thus, "and Hushim, another
son." Shuppim, Muppim, and Hushim are plural words, and therefore denote
not individuals, but the heads of their respective families; and as they
were not comprised in the above enumeration ([Ch1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#007.md), [Ch1
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#009).md) they are inserted here in the
form of an appendix. Some render the passage, "Hushim, the son of
another," that is, tribe or family. The name occurs among the sons of
Dan ([Gen 46:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#023).md), and it is a
presumption in favor of this being the true rendering, that after having
recorded the genealogy of Naphtali ([Ch1
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013).md) the sacred historian adds, "the
sons of Bilhah, the handmaid, who was the mother of Dan and Naphtali."
We naturally expect, therefore, that these two will be noticed together,
but Dan is not mentioned at all, if not in this passage.

[1 Chronicles 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch1 7:13</span></span>

OF NAPHTALI. ([Ch1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013).md)

Shallum--or Shillem ([Gen 46:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#024).md).

sons of Bilhah--As Dan and Naphtali were her sons, Hushim, as well as
these enumerated in [Ch1 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#013.md), were
her grandsons.

[1 Chronicles 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch1 7:14</span></span>

OF MANASSEH. (1Ch. 7:14-40)

The sons of Manasseh--or descendants; for Ashriel was a grandson, and
Zelophehad was a generation farther removed in descent ([Num
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#033).md). The text, as it stands, is so
confused and complicated that it is exceedingly difficult to trace the
genealogical thread, and a great variety of conjectures have been made
with a view to clear away the obscurity. The passage \[[Ch1
7:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014.md)\] should probably be rendered
thus: "The sons of Manasseh were Ashriel, whom his Syrian concubine bare
to him, and Machir, the father of Gilead (whom his wife bare to him).
Machir took for a wife Maachah, sister to Huppim and Shuppim."

[1 Chronicles 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch1 7:21</span></span>

whom the men of Gath . . . slew, &c.--This interesting little episode
gives us a glimpse of the state of Hebrew society in Egypt; for the
occurrence narrated seems to have taken place before the Israelites left
that country. The patriarch Ephraim was then alive, though he must have
arrived at a very advanced age; and the Hebrew people, at all events
those of them who were his descendants, still retained their pastoral
character. It was in perfect consistency with the ideas and habits of
Oriental shepherds that they should have made a raid on the neighboring
tribe of the Philistines for the purpose of plundering their flocks. For
nothing is more common among them than hostile incursions on the
inhabitants of towns, or on other nomad tribes with whom they have no
league of amity. But a different view of the incident is brought out,
if, instead of "because," we render the Hebrew particle "when" they came
down to take their cattle, for the tenor of the context leads rather to
the conclusion that "the men of Gath" were the aggressors, who, making a
sudden foray on the Ephraimite flocks, killed the shepherds including
several of the sons of Ephraim. The calamity spread a deep gloom around
the tent of their aged father, and was the occasion of his receiving
visits of condolence from his distant relatives, according to the custom
of the East, which is remarkably exemplified in the history of Job ([Job
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011.md); compare [Joh
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019).md).
