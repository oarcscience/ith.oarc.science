### [Revelation Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md)

[Revelation 21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rev 21:1</span></span>

THE NEW HEAVEN AND EARTH: NEW JERUSALEM OUT OF HEAVEN. (Rev. 21:1-27)

the first--that is the former.

passed away--Greek, in A and B is "were departed" (Greek, "apeelthon,"
not as in English Version, "pareelthe").

was--Greek, "is," which graphically sets the thing before our eyes as
present.

no more sea--The sea is the type of perpetual unrest. Hence our Lord
rebukes it as an unruly hostile troubler of His people. It symbolized
the political tumults out of which "the beast" arose, [Rev
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#001.md). As the physical corresponds to
the spiritual and moral world, so the absence of sea, after the
metamorphosis of the earth by fire, answers to the unruffled state of
solid peace which shall then prevail. The sea, though severing lands
from one another, is now, by God's eliciting of good from evil, made the
medium of communication between countries through navigation. Then man
shall possess inherent powers which shall make the sea no longer
necessary, but an element which would detract from a perfect state. A
"river" and "water" are spoken of in [Rev
22:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#001.md), probably literal (that is,
with such changes of the natural properties of water, as correspond
analogically to man's own transfigured body), as well as symbolical. The
sea was once the element of the world's destruction, and is still the
source of death to thousands, whence after the millennium, at the
general judgment, it is specially said, "The sea gave up the dead . . .
in it." Then it shall cease to destroy, or disturb, being removed
altogether on account of its past destructions.

[Revelation 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rev 21:2</span></span>

And I John--"John" is omitted in A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and
ANDREAS; also the "I" in the Greek of these authorities is not emphatic.
The insertion of "I John" in the Greek would somewhat interfere with the
close connection which subsists between "the new heaven and earth," [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md), and the "new Jerusalem" in this
verse.

Jerusalem . . . out of heaven-- ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012.md); [Gal
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md), "Jerusalem which is above"; [Heb
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#010.md); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022.md); [Heb
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014).md). The descent of the new
Jerusalem out of heaven is plainly distinct from the earthly Jerusalem
in which Israel in the flesh shall dwell during the millennium, and
follows on the creation of the new heaven and earth. John in his Gospel
always writes \[Greek\] Hierosoluma of the old city; in the Apocalypse
always Hierousaleem of the heavenly city ([Rev
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012).md). Hierousaleem is a Hebrew name,
the original and holy appellation. Hierosoluma is the common Greek term,
used in a political sense. Paul observes the same distinction when
refuting Judaism ([Gal 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026.md); compare
[Gal 1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md); [Gal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md); [Heb
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md), though not so in the Epistles
to Romans and Corinthians \[BENGEL\].

bride--made up of the blessed citizens of "the holy city." There is no
longer merely a Paradise as in Eden (though there is that also, [Rev
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007).md), no longer a mere garden, but now
the city of God on earth, costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at
the same time the result of labor and pains such as had not to be
expended by man in dressing the primitive garden of Eden. "The lively
stones" were severally in time laboriously chiselled into shape, after
the pattern of "the Chief corner-stone," to prepare them for the place
which they shall everlastingly fill in the heavenly Jerusalem.

[Revelation 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rev 21:3</span></span>

out of heaven--so ANDREAS. But A and Vulgate read, "out of the throne."

the tabernacle--alluding to the tabernacle of God in the wilderness
(wherein many signs of His presence were given): of which this is the
antitype, having previously been in heaven: [Rev
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#019.md); [Rev
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#005.md), "the temple of the tabernacle of
the testimony in heaven"; also [Rev
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#006.md). Compare the contrast in [Heb
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#023.md), [Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md), between "the patterns" and "the
heavenly things themselves," between "the figures" and "the true." The
earnest of the true and heavenly tabernacle was afforded in the
Jerusalem temple described in Eze. 40:1-42:20, as about to be, namely,
during the millennium.

dwell with them--literally, "tabernacle with them"; the same Greek word
as is used of the divine Son "tabernacling among us." Then He was in the
weakness of the flesh: but at the new creation of heaven and earth He
shall tabernacle among us in the glory of His manifested Godhead ([Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004).md).

they--in Greek emphatic, "they" (in particular).

his people--Greek, "His peoples": "the nations of the saved" being all
peculiarly His, as Israel was designed to be. So A reads. But B,
Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read, "His people": singular.

God himself . . . with them--realizing fully His name Immanuel.

[Revelation 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rev 21:4</span></span>

all tears--Greek, "every tear."

no more death--Greek, "death shall be no more." Therefore it is not the
millennium, for in the latter there is death ([Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md); [Co1
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#026.md), [Co1
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md), "the last enemy . . . destroyed
is death," [Rev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md), after the
millennium).

sorrow--Greek, "mourning."

passed away--Greek, "departed," as in [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md).

[Revelation 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rev 21:5</span></span>

sat--Greek, "sitteth."

all things new--not recent, but changed from the old (Greek, "kaina,"
not "nea"). An earnest of this regeneration and transfiguration of
nature is given already in the regenerate soul.

unto me--so Coptic and ANDREAS. But A, B, Vulgate, and Syriac omit.

true and faithful--so ANDREAS. But A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic
transpose, "faithful and true" (literally, "genuine").

[Revelation 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rev 21:6</span></span>

It is done--the same Greek as in [Rev
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#017.md). "It is come to pass." So
Vulgate reads with English Version. But A reads, "They ('these words,'
[Rev 21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005).md) are come to pass." All is
as sure as if it actually had been fulfilled for it rests on the word of
the unchanging God. When the consummation shall be, God shall rejoice
over the work of His own hands, as at the completion of the first
creation God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very
good ([Gen 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031).md).

Alpha . . . Omega--Greek in A and B, "the Alpha . . . the Omega" ([Rev
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018).md).

give unto . . . athirst . . . water of life-- ([Rev
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#017.md); [Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md); [Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Joh
4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md); [Joh
7:37-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). This is added lest any
should despair of attaining to this exceeding weight of glory. In our
present state we may drink of the stream, then we shall drink at the
Fountain.

freely--Greek, "gratuitously": the same Greek as is translated, "(They
hated Me) without a cause," [Joh
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md). As gratuitous as was man's
hatred of God, so gratuitous is God's love to man: there was every cause
in Christ why man should love Him, yet man hated Him; there was every
cause in man why (humanly speaking) God should have hated man, yet God
loved man: the very reverse of what might be expected took place in both
cases. Even in heaven our drinking at the Fountain shall be God's
gratuitous gift.

[Revelation 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rev 21:7</span></span>

He that overcometh--another aspect of the believer's life: a conflict
with sin, Satan, and the world is needed. Thirsting for salvation is the
first beginning of, and continues for ever (in the sense of an appetite
and relish for divine joys) a characteristic of the believer. In a
different sense, the believer "shall never thirst."

inherit all things--A, B, Vulgate, and CYPRIAN read, "these things,"
namely, the blessings described in this whole passage. With "all
things," compare [Co1 3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021.md).

I will be his God--Greek, "I will be to him a God," that is, all that is
implied of blessing in the name "God."

he shall be my son--"He" is emphatic: He in particular and in a peculiar
sense, above others: Greek, "shall be to me a son," in fullest
realization of the promise made in type to Solomon, son of David, and
antitypically to the divine Son of David.

[Revelation 21:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rev 21:8</span></span>

the fearful--Greek, "the cowardly," who do not quit themselves like men
so as to "overcome" in the good fight; who have the spirit of slavish
"fear," not love, towards God; and who through fear of man are not bold
for God, or "draw back." Compare [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027.md); [Rev
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md).

unbelieving--Greek, "faithless."

abominable--who have drank of the harlot's "cup of abominations."

sorcerers--one of the characteristics of Antichrist's time.

all liars--Greek, "all the liars": or else "all who are liars"; compare
[Ti1 4:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md), where similarly lying and
dealings with spirits and demons, are joined together as features of
"the latter times."

second death-- [Rev 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014.md) :
"everlasting destruction," [Th2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md);
[Mar 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md), [Mar
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#046.md), [Mar
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048.md), "Where THEIR worm dieth not, and
the fire is not quenched."

[Revelation 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rev 21:9</span></span>

The same angel who had shown John Babylon the harlot, is appropriately
employed to show him in contrast new Jerusalem, the Bride ([Rev
17:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md). The angel so employed is the
one that had the last seven plagues, to show that the ultimate
blessedness of the Church is one end of the divine judgments on her
foes.

unto me--A, B, and Vulgate omit.

the Lamb's wife--in contrast to her who sat on many waters ([Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001).md), (that is, intrigued with many
peoples and nations of the world, instead of giving her undivided
affections, as the Bride does, to the Lamb.

[Revelation 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rev 21:10</span></span>

The words correspond to [Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md), to
heighten the contrast of the bride and harlot.

mountain--Compare [Eze 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze040.htm#002.md), where a
similar vision is given from a high mountain.

that great--omitted in A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and CYPRIAN.
Translate then, "the holy city Jerusalem."

descending--Even in the millennium the earth will not be a suitable
abode for transfigured saints, who therefore shall then reign in heaven
over the earth. But after the renewal of the earth at the close of the
millennium and judgment, they shall descend from heaven to dwell on an
earth assimilated to heaven itself. "From God" implies that "we (the
city) are God's workmanship."

[Revelation 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rev 21:11</span></span>

Having the glory of God--not merely the Shekinah-cloud, but God Himself
as her glory dwelling in the midst of her. Compare the type, the earthly
Jerusalem in the millennium ([Zac 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#005.md);
compare [Rev 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023), below.md).

her light--Greek, "light-giver": properly applied to the heavenly
luminaries which diffuse light. Compare Note, see on [Phi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015.md), the only other passage where it
occurs. The "and" before "her light' is omitted in A, B, and Vulgate.

even like--Greek, "as it were."

jasper--representing watery crystalline brightness.

[Revelation 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rev 21:12</span></span>

And--A and B omit. [Eze 48:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#030.md), has
a similar description, which implies that the millennial Jerusalem shall
have its exact antitype in the heavenly Jerusalem which shall descend on
the finally regenerated earth.

wall great and high--setting forth the security of the Church. Also, the
exclusion of the ungodly.

twelve angels--guards of the twelve gates: an additional emblem of
perfect security, while the gates being never shut ([Rev
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025).md) imply perfect liberty and
peace. Also, angels shall be the brethren of the heavenly citizens.

names of . . . twelve tribes--The inscription of the names on the gates
implies that none but the spiritual Israel, God's elect, shall enter the
heavenly city. As the millennium wherein literal Israel in the flesh
shall be the mother Church, is the antitype to the Old Testament earthly
theocracy in the Holy Land, so the heavenly new Jerusalem is the
consummation antitypical to the spiritual Israel, the elect Church of
Jews and Gentiles being now gathered out: as the spiritual Israel now is
an advance upon the previous literal and carnal Israel, so the heavenly
Jerusalem shall be much in advance of the millennial Jerusalem.

[Revelation 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rev 21:13</span></span>

On the north . . . on the south--A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read,
"And on the north and on the south." In Ezekiel, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan
(for which Manasseh is substituted in [Rev
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#006).md), are on the east ([Eze
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#032).md); Reuben, Judah, Levi, are on
the north ([Eze 48:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#031).md); Simeon,
Issachar, Zebulun, on the south ([Eze
48:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#033).md); Gad, Asher, Naphtali, on the
west ([Eze 48:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#034).md). In Numbers, Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun are on the east ([Num
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#003.md), [Num
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#005.md), [Num
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#007).md). Reuben, Simeon, Gad, on the
south ([Num 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#010.md), [Num
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#012.md), [Num
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#014).md). Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, on
the west ([Num 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018.md), [Num
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#020.md), [Num
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#022).md). Dan, Asher, Naphtali, on the
north ([Num 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#025.md), [Num
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#027.md), [Num
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#029).md).

[Revelation 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rev 21:14</span></span>

twelve foundations--Joshua, the type of Jesus, chose twelve men out of
the people, to carry twelve stones over the Jordan with them, as Jesus
chose twelve apostles to be the twelve foundations of the heavenly city,
of which He is Himself the Chief corner-stone. Peter is not the only
apostolic rock on whose preaching Christ builds His Church. Christ
Himself is the true foundation: the twelve are foundations only in
regard to their apostolic testimony concerning Him. Though Paul was an
apostle besides the twelve, yet the mystical number is retained, twelve
representing the Church, namely thirty the divine number, multiplied by
four, the world number.

in them the names, &c.--As architects often have their names inscribed
on their great works, so the names of the apostles shall be held in
everlasting remembrance. Vulgate reads, "in them." But A, B, Syriac,
Coptic, and ANDREAS read, "upon them." These authorities also insert
"twelve" before "names."

[Revelation 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rev 21:15</span></span>

had a golden reed--so Coptic. But A, B, Vulgate, and Syriac read, "had
(as) a measure, a golden reed." In [Rev
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#002.md) the non-measuring of the outer
courts of the temple implied its being given up to secular and heathen
desecration. So here, on the contrary, the city being measured implies
the entire consecration of every part, all things being brought up to
the most exact standard of God's holy requirements, and also God's
accurate guardianship henceforth of even the most minute parts of His
holy city from all evil.

[Revelation 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rev 21:16</span></span>

twelve thousand furlongs--literally, "to twelve thousand stadii": one
thousand furlongs being the space between the several twelve gates.
BENGEL makes the length of each side of the city to be twelve thousand
stadii. The stupendous height, length, and breadth being exactly alike,
imply its faultless symmetry, transcending in glory all our most glowing
conceptions.

[Revelation 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rev 21:17</span></span>

hundred . . . forty . . . four cubits--twelve times twelve: the
Church-number squared. The wall is far beneath the height of the city.

measure of a man, that is, of the angel--The ordinary measure used by
men is the measure here used by the angel, distinct from "the measure of
the sanctuary." Men shall then be equal to the angels.

[Revelation 21:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rev 21:18</span></span>

the building--"the structure" \[TREGELLES\], Greek, "endomeesis."

gold, like . . . clear glass--Ideal gold, transparent as no gold here is
\[ALFORD\]. Excellencies will be combined in the heavenly city which now
seem incompatible.

[Revelation 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rev 21:19</span></span>

And--so Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS. But A, B, and Vulgate omit. Compare
[Rev 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#014.md) with this verse; also [Isa
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md).

all manner of precious stones--Contrast [Rev
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#012.md) as to the harlot, Babylon. These
precious stones constituted the "foundations."

chalcedony--agate from Chalcedon: semi-opaque, sky-blue, with stripes of
other colors \[ALFORD\].

[Revelation 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rev 21:20</span></span>

sardonyx--a gem having the redness of the cornelian, and the whiteness
of the onyx.

sardius--(See on [Rev 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003).md).

chrysolite--described by PLINY as transparent and of a golden
brightness, like our topaz: different from our pale green crystallized
chrysolite.

beryl--of a sea-green color.

topaz--PLINY \[37.32\], makes it green and transparent, like our
chrysolite.

chrysoprasus--somewhat pale, and having the purple color of the amethyst
\[PLINY, 37, 20, 21\].

jacinth--The flashing violet brightness in the amethyst is diluted in
the jacinth \[PLINY, 37.41\].

[Revelation 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rev 21:21</span></span>

every several--Greek, "each one severally."

[Revelation 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rev 21:22</span></span>

no temple . . . God . . . the temple--As God now dwells in the spiritual
Church, His "temple" (Greek, "naos," "shrine"; [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md); [Co1
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019).md), so the Church when perfected
shall dwell in Him as her "temple" (naos: the same Greek). As the Church
was "His sanctuary," so He is to be their sanctuary. Means of grace
shall cease when the end of grace is come. Church ordinances shall give
place to the God of ordinances. Uninterrupted, immediate, direct,
communion with Him and the Lamb (compare [Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023).md), shall supersede intervening
ordinances.

[Revelation 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rev 21:23</span></span>

in it--so Vulgate. But A, B, and ANDREAS read, "(shine) on it," or
literally, "for her."

the light--Greek, "the lamp" ([Isa
60:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#019).md). The direct light of God and
the Lamb shall make the saints independent of God's creatures, the sun
and moon, for light.

[Revelation 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rev 21:24</span></span>

of them which are saved . . . in--A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, and ANDREAS
read "(the nations shall walk) by means of her light": omitting "of them
which are saved." Her brightness shall supply them with light.

the kings of the earth--who once had regard only to their glory, having
been converted, now in the new Jerusalem do bring their glory into it,
to lay it down at the feet of their God and Lord.

and honour--so B, Vulgate, and Syriac. But A omits the clause.

[Revelation 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rev 21:25</span></span>

not be shut . . . by day--therefore shall never be shut: for it shall
always be day. Gates are usually shut by night: but in it shall be no
night. There shall be continual free ingress into it, so as that all
which is blessed and glorious may continually be brought into it. So in
the millennial type.

All that was truly glorious and excellent in the earth and its converted
nations shall be gathered into it; and while all shall form one Bride,
there shall be various orders among the redeemed, analogous to the
divisions of nations on earth constituting the one great human family,
and to the various orders of angels.

anything that defileth--Greek, "koinoun." A and B read \[koinon,\]
"anything unclean."

in the Lamb's book of life--(See on [Rev
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md); [Rev
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#015).md). As all the filth of the old
Jerusalem was carried outside the walls and burnt there, so nothing
defiled shall enter the heavenly city, but be burnt outside (compare
[Rev 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015).md). It is striking that the
apostle of love, who shows us the glories of the heavenly city, is he
also who speaks most plainly of the terrors of hell. On [Rev
21:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#026.md), ALFORD writes a Note, rash
in speculation, about the heathen nations, above what is written, and
not at all required by the sacred text: compare Note, see on [Rev
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#026.md).
