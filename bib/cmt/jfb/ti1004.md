### [1 Timothy Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)

[1 Timothy 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 4:1</span></span>

PREDICTION OF A COMING DEPARTURE FROM THE FAITH: TIMOTHY'S DUTY AS TO
IT: GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO HIM. (1Ti. 4:1-16)

Now--Greek, "But." In contrast to the "mystery of godliness."

the Spirit--speaking by the prophets in the Church (whose prophecies
rested on those of the Old Testament, [Dan
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025); [Dan
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#023), &c.; [Dan
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#030), as also on those of Jesus in
the New Testament, [Mat 24:11-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#011)), and
also by Paul himself, [Th2 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003) (with
whom accord [Pe2 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003); [Jo1
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018); [Jde
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#018)).

expressly--"in plain words." This shows that he refers to prophecies of
the Spirit then lying before him.

in the latter times--in the times following upon the times in which he
is now writing. Not some remote future, but times immediately
subsequent, the beginnings of the apostasy being already discernible
([Act 20:29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029)): these are the
forerunners of "the last days" ([Ti2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#001)).

depart from the faith--The apostasy was to be within the Church, the
faithful one becoming the harlot. In [Th2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003) (written earlier), the apostasy of
the Jews from God (joining the heathen against Christianity) is the
groundwork on which the prophecy rises; whereas here, in the Pastoral
Epistles, the prophecy is connected with Gnostic errors, the seeds of
which had already been sown in the Church \[AUBERLEN\] ([Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)). Apollonius TyanÃ&brvbr;us, a
heretic, came to Ephesus in the lifetime of Timothy.

giving heed-- ([Ti1 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004); [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)).

seducing spirits--working in the heretical teachers. [Jo1
4:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002), [Jo1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#006), "the spirit of error," opposed to
"the spirit of truth," "the Spirit" which "speaketh" in the true
prophets against them.

doctrines of devils--literally "teachings of (that is suggested by)
demons." [Jam 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#015), "wisdom . . .
devilish"; [Co2 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#015), "Satan's
ministers."

[1 Timothy 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 4:2</span></span>

Rather translate, "Through (literally, 'in'; the element in which the
apostasy has place) the hypocrisy of lying speakers"; this expresses the
means through which "some shall (be led to) depart from the faith,"
namely, the reigned sanctity of the seducers (compare "deceivers," [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010)).

having their conscience seared--Greek, "having their own conscience,"
&c., that is, not only "speaking lies" to others, but also having their
own conscience seared. Professing to lead others to holiness, their own
conscience is all the while defiled. Bad consciences always have
recourse to hypocrisy. As faith and a good conscience are joined ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)); so hypocrisy (that is, unbelief,
[Mat 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#005), [Mat
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051); compare [Luk
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#046)) and a bad conscience here.
THEODORET explains like English Version, "seared," as implying their
extreme insensibility; the effect of cauterizing being to deaden
sensation. The Greek, however, primarily means "branded" with the
consciousness of crimes committed against their better knowledge and
conscience, like so many scars burnt in by a branding iron: Compare [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015); [Tit
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#011), "condemned of himself." They are
conscious of the brand within, and yet with a hypocritical show of
sanctity, they strive to seduce others. As "a seal" is used in a good
sense ([Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)), so "a brand" in a
bad sense. The image is taken from the branding of criminals.

[1 Timothy 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 4:3</span></span>

Sensuality leads to false spiritualism. Their own inward impurity is
reflected in their eyes in the world without them, and hence their
asceticism ([Tit 1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014))
\[WIESINGER\]. By a spurious spiritualism ([Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)), which made moral perfection
consist in abstinence from outward things, they pretended to attain to a
higher perfection. [Mat 19:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#010)
(compare [Co1 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008), [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026), [Co1
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#038)) gave a seeming handle to their
"forbidding marriage" (contrast [Ti1
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)); and the Old Testament
distinction as to clean and unclean, gave a pretext for teaching to
"abstain from meats" (compare [Col
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016), [Col
2:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020)). As these Judaizing Gnostics
combined the harlot or apostate Old Testament Church with the beast
([Rev 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003)), or Gnostic spiritualizing
anti-Christianity, so Rome's Judaizing elements ([Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)) shall ultimately be combined with
the open worldly-wise anti-Christianity of the false prophet or beast
([Ti1 6:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); [Col
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008); [Jo1
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001); [Rev
13:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#012)). Austerity gained for them a
show of sanctity while preaching false doctrine ([Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)). EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical
History, 4.29\] quotes from IRENÃ†US \[1.28\] a statement that
Saturninus, Marcion, and the Encratites preached abstinence from
marriage and animal meats. Paul prophetically warns against such
notions, the seeds of which already were being sown ([Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); [Ti2
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017)).

to be received--Greek, "to be partaken of."

of them--literally, (created and designed) "for them," Though all (even
the unbelieving, [Psa 104:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014); [Mat
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045)) are partakers in these foods
created by God, "they which believe" alone fulfil God's design in
creation by partaking of them with thanksgiving; as opposed to those who
abstain from them, or in partaking of them, do not do so with
thanksgiving. The unbelieving have not the designed use of such foods by
reason of their "conscience being defiled" ([Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)). The children of God alone
"inherit the earth"; for obedience is the necessary qualification (as it
was in the original grant of the earth to Adam), which they alone
possess.

and know the truth--explanatory and defining who are "they which
believe." Translate as Greek, "and have full knowledge of the truth"
(see on [Phi 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#009)). Thus he contradicts
the assumption of superior knowledge and higher moral perfection, put
forward by the heretics, on the ground of their abstinence from marriage
and meats. "The truth" stands in opposition to their "lies" ([Ti1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002)).

[1 Timothy 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 4:4</span></span>

Translate as Greek, "Because" (expressing a reason resting on an
objective fact; or, as here, a Scripture quotation)--"For" (a reason
resting on something subjective in the writer's mind).

every creature . . . good-- ([Gen
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031); [Rom
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014), [Rom
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020)). A refutation by anticipation
of the Gnostic opposition to creation: the seeds of which were now
lurking latently in the Church. Judaism ([Act
10:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#011); [Co1
10:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025)) was the starting-point of
the error as to meats: Oriental Gnosis added new elements. The old
Gnostic heresy is now almost extinct; but its remains in the celibacy of
Rome's priesthood, and in its fasts from animal meats, enjoined under
the penalty of mortal sin, remain.

if . . . with thanksgiving--Meats, though pure in themselves, become
impure by being received with an unthankful mind ([Rom
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015)).

[1 Timothy 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 4:5</span></span>

sanctified--"hallowed"; set apart as holy for the use of believing men:
separated from "the creature," which is under the bondage of vanity and
corruption ([Rom 8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019), &c.). Just as
in the Lord's Supper, the thanksgiving prayer sanctifies the elements,
separating them from their naturally alien position in relation to the
spiritual world, and transferring them to their true relation to the new
life. So in every use of the creature, thanksgiving prayer has the same
effect, and ought always to be used ([Co1
10:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#030)).

by the word of God and prayer--that is, "by means of intercessory
prayer" (so the Greek)--that is, consecratory prayer in behalf of "the
creature" or food--that prayer mainly consisting of "the word of God."
The Apostolic Constitutions \[7.49\], give this ancient grace, almost
wholly consisting of Scripture, "Blessed art thou, O Lord, who feedest
me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh: Fill our hearts with joy
and gladness, that we, having all sufficiency, may abound unto every
good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour, and
might, be to thee for ever. Amen." In the case of inspired men, "the
word of God" would refer to their inspired prayers ([Kg1
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#001)); but as Paul speaks in general,
including uninspired men's thanksgiving for meals, the "word of God"
more probably refers to the Scripture words used in thanksgiving
prayers.

[1 Timothy 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 4:6</span></span>

If thou put . . . in remembrance--rather as Greek, "If thou suggest to
(bring under the notice of) the brethren," &c.

these things--namely, the truths stated in [Ti1
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004), in opposition to the errors
foretold, [Ti1 4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001).

minister--"servant."

nourished up--The Greek is present, not past: "continually being
nourished in" ([Ti2 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005); [Ti2
3:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)).

the words of faith--rather, "the words of the faith" (compare [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)).

good doctrine--"the good teaching." Explanatory of "the faith," in
opposition to the "teachings of demons" (English Version, "doctrines of
devils," [Ti1 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)) which Timothy was
to counteract. Compare "sound doctrine" ([Ti1
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010); [Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003); [Tit
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009); [Tit
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001)).

whereunto thou hast attained--"the course of which thou hast followed";
hast followed along by tracing its course and accompanying it
\[ALFORD\]. Thou hast begun to follow up \[BENGEL\]. The same Greek
occurs, "thou hast fully known" ([Ti2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#010)), "having had perfect
understanding" ([Luk 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#003)). It is an
undesigned coincidence that the Greek verb is used only by Paul and
Paul's companion, Luke.

[1 Timothy 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 4:7</span></span>

refuse--reject, avoid, have nothing to do with ([Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023); [Tit
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010)).

old wives' fables--anile myths ([Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004), [Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009); [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014)). They are "profane," because
leading away from "godliness" or "piety" ([Ti1
1:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004); [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020); [Ti2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016); [Tit
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001)).

exercise thyself--literally, "exercise thyself" as one undergoing
training in a gymnasium. Let thy self-discipline be not in ascetical
exercises as the false teachers ([Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003), [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008); compare [Ti2
2:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022); [Heb
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014); [Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)), but with a view to godliness
or "piety" ([Ti1 6:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011)).

[1 Timothy 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 4:8</span></span>

profiteth little--Greek, "profiteth to (but) a small extent." Paul does
not deny that fasting and abstinence from conjugal intercourse for a
time, with a view to reaching the inward man through the outward, do
profit somewhat, [Act 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003); [Co1
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005), [Co1
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007); [Co1
9:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#026) (though in its degenerate
form, asceticism, dwelling solely on what is outward, [Ti1
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003), is not only not profitable but
injurious). Timothy seems to have had a leaning to such outward
self-discipline (compare [Ti1 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)).
Paul, therefore, while not disapproving of this in its due proportion
and place, shows the vast superiority of godliness or piety, as being
profitable not merely "to a small extent," but unto all things; for,
having its seat within, it extends thence to the whole outward life of a
man. Not unto one portion only of his being, but to every portion of it,
bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal \[ALFORD\]. "He who has piety
(which is 'profitable unto all things') wants nothing needed to his
well-being, even though he be without those helps which, 'to a small
extent,' bodily exercise furnishes" \[CALVIN\]. "Piety," which is the
end for which thou art to "exercise thyself" ([Ti1
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007)), is the essential thing: the
means are secondary.

having promise, &c.--Translate as Greek, "Having promise of life, that
which now is, and that which is to come." "Life" in its truest and best
sense now and hereafter ([Ti2 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001)).
Length of life now so far as it is really good for the believer; life in
its truest enjoyments and employments now, and life blessed and eternal
hereafter ([Mat 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033); [Mar
10:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#029)). "Now in this time" ([Psa
84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011); [Psa
112:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#001); [Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028); [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021), "all things are yours . . .
the world, life . . . things present, things to come"). Christianity,
which seems to aim only at our happiness hereafter, effectually promotes
it here ([Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006); [Pe2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003)). Compare Solomon's prayer and the
answer ([Kg1 3:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#007)).

[1 Timothy 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 4:9</span></span>

([Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015)). This verse (Greek),
"faithful is the saying, " &c. confirms the assertion as to the
"promise" attached to "godliness," [Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008), and forms a prefatory
introduction to [Ti1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010), which is
joined to [Ti1 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009) by "For." So [Ti2
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011). Godly men seem to suffer loss as
to this life: Paul hereby refutes the notion \[BENGEL\]. "God is the
Saviour specially of those that believe" ([Ti1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010)), both as to "the life that now
is," and also as to "the life which is to come" ([Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)).

[1 Timothy 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 4:10</span></span>

therefore--Greek, "with a view to this." The reason why "we both ('both'
is omitted in the oldest manuscripts) labor (endure hardship) and suffer
reproach (some oldest manuscripts read 'strive') is because we have
rested, and do rest our hope, on the living (and therefore, life-giving,
[Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)) God."

Saviour--even in this life ([Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)).

specially of those that believe--Their "labor and reproach" are not
inconsistent with their having from the living God, their Saviour, even
the present life ([Mar 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#030), "a
hundred fold now in this time . . . with persecutions"), much more the
life to come. If God is in a sense "Saviour" of unbelievers ([Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004), that is, is willing to be so
everlastingly, and is temporally here their Preserver and Benefactor),
much more of believers. He is the Saviour of all men potentially ([Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015)); of believers alone effectually.

[1 Timothy 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 4:11</span></span>

These truths, to the exclusion of those useless and even injurious
teachings ([Ti1 4:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001)), while weighing
well thyself, charge also upon others.

[1 Timothy 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 4:12</span></span>

Let no man despise thy youth--Act so as to be respected in spite of thy
youth ([Co1 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011); [Tit
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015)); compare "youthful" as to
Timothy ([Ti2 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022)). He was but a mere
youth when he joined Paul ([Act
16:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001)). Eleven years had elapsed
since then to the time subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment. He was,
therefore, still young; especially in comparison with Paul, whose place
he was filling; also in relation to elderly presbyters whom he should
"entreat as a father" ([Ti1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001)), and
generally in respect to his duties in rebuking, exhorting, and ordaining
([Ti1 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001)), which ordinarily accord
best with an elderly person ([Ti1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019)).

be thou an example--Greek, "become a pattern" ([Tit
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#007)); the true way of making men not
to despise (slight, or disregard) thy youth.

in word--in all that thou sayest in public and private.

conversation--that is, "behavior" the Old English sense of the word.

in charity . . . faith--the two cardinal principles of the Christian
([Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006)). The oldest manuscripts
omit, "in spirit."

in purity--simplicity of holy motive followed out in consistency of holy
action \[ALFORD\] ([Ti1 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022); [Co2
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#006); [Jam
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#017); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008); [Pe1
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022)).

[1 Timothy 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 4:13</span></span>

Till I come--when Timothy's commission would be superseded for the time
by the presence of the apostle himself ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003); [Ti1
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014)).

reading--especially in the public congregation. The practice of reading
Scripture was transferred from the Jewish synagogue to the Christian
Church ([Luk 4:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#016); [Act
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#015); [Act
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021); [Co2
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014)). The New Testament Gospel and
Epistles being recognized as inspired by those who had the gift of
discerning spirits, were from the first, according as they were written,
read along with the Old Testament in the Church ([Th1
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#021), [Th1
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#027); [Col
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016)), \[JUSTIN MARTYR, Apology,
1.67\]. I think that while public reading is the prominent thought, the
Spirit intended also to teach that Scripture reading in private should
be "the fountain of all wisdom from which pastors ought to draw whatever
they bring before their flock" \[ALFORD\].

exhortation--addressed to the feelings and will with a view to the
regulation of the conduct.

doctrine--Greek (ministerial), "teaching" or instruction. Addressed to
the understanding, so as to impart knowledge ([Ti1
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002); [Rom
12:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007)). Whether in public or private,
exhortation and instruction should be based on Scripture reading.

[1 Timothy 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 4:14</span></span>

Neglect not the gift--by letting it lie unused. In [Ti2
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006) the gift is represented as a spark
of the Spirit lying within him, and sure to smoulder by neglect, the
stirring up or keeping in lively exercise of which depends on the will
of him on whom it is bestowed ([Mat
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#018), [Mat
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#025), [Mat
25:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#027)). The charism or spiritual
gift, is that of the Spirit which qualified him for "the work of an
evangelist" ([Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011); [Ti2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005)), or perhaps the gift of
discerning spirits, specially needed in his function of ordaining, as
overseer \[BISHOP HINDS\].

given thee--by God ([Co1 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004), [Co1
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#006)).

by prophecy--that is, by the Holy Spirit, at his general ordination, or
else consecration, to the special see of Ephesus, speaking through the
prophets God's will to give him the graces needed to qualify him for his
work ([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Act
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001)).

with . . . laying on of . . . hands--So in Joshua's case ([Num
27:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#018); [Deu
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009)). The gift was connected with the
symbolical act of laying on hands. But the Greek "with" implies that the
presbyter's laying on hands was the mere accompaniment of the conferring
of the gift. "By" ([Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006)) implies
that Paul's laying on his hands was the actual instrument of its being
conferred.

of the presbytery--In [Ti2 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006) the
apostle mentions only his own laying on of hands. But there his aim is
to remind Timothy specially of the part he himself took in imparting to
him the gift. Here he mentions the fact, quite consistent with the
other, that the neighboring presbyters took part in the ordination or
consecration, he, however, taking the foremost part. Paul, though having
the general oversight of the elders everywhere, was an elder himself
([Pe1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001); [Jo2
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#001)). The Jewish council was composed
of the elders of the Church (the presbytery, [Luk
22:66](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#066); [Act
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#005)), and a presiding rabbi; so the
Christian Church was composed of apostles, elders, and a president ([Act
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016)). As the president of the
synagogue was of the same order as his presbyters, so the bishop was of
the same order as his presbyters. At the ordination of the president of
the synagogue there were always three presbyters present to lay on
hands, so the early Church canons required three bishops to be present
at the consecration of a bishop. As the president of the synagogue, so
the bishop of the Church alone could ordain, he acting as the
representative, and in the name of the whole presbytery \[VITRINGA\].
So, in the Anglican Church, the bishop ordains, the presbyters or
priests present joining with him in laying on hands.

[1 Timothy 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 4:15</span></span>

Meditate--Greek, "Meditate CAREFULLY upon" ([Psa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002); [Psa
119:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#015); compare "Isaac," [Gen
24:63](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#063)).

these things-- ([Ti1 4:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)). As food
would not nourish without digestion, which assimilates the food to the
substance of the body, so spiritual food, in order to benefit us, needs
to be appropriated by prayerful meditation.

give thyself wholly to--literally, "BE in these things"; let them
engross thee wholly; be wholly absorbed in them. Entire self-dedication,
as in other pursuits, so especially in religion, is the secret of
proficiency. There are changes as to all other studies, fashionable
to-day, out of fashion to-morrow; this study alone is never obsolete,
and when made the all-engrossing aim sanctifies all other studies. The
exercise of the ministry threatens the spirit of the ministry, unless it
be sustained within. The minister must be first his own scholar before
he can be another's teacher.

profiting--Greek, "progress" towards perfection in the Christian life,
and especially towards the fullest realization of the ideal of a
Christian minister ([Ti1 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012)).

may appear to all--not for thy glory, but for the winning of souls ([Mat
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016)).

[1 Timothy 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 4:16</span></span>

Take heed--Give heed ([Act 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#005)).

thyself, and . . . doctrine--"and unto thy teaching." The two requisites
of a good pastor: His teaching will be of no avail unless his own life
accord with it; and his own purity of life is not enough unless he be
diligent in teaching \[CALVIN\]. This verse is a summary of [Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012).

continue in them-- ([Ti2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014)).

in doing this--not "by doing this," as though he could save himself by
works.

thou shalt . . . save thyself, and them that hear thee-- ([Eze
33:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#009); [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020)). In performing faithfully his
duty to others, the minister is promoting his own salvation. Indeed he
cannot "give heed unto the teaching" of others, unless he be at the same
time "giving heed unto himself."
