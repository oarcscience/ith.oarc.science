### [Hebrews Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 1:1</span></span>

THE HIGHEST OF ALL REVELATIONS IS GIVEN US NOW IN THE SON OF GOD, WHO IS
GREATER THAN THE ANGELS, AND WHO, HAVING COMPLETED REDEMPTION, SITS
ENTHRONED AT GOD'S RIGHT HAND. ([Heb
1:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001).md)

at sundry times--Greek, "in many portions." All was not revealed to each
one prophet; but one received one portion of revelation, and another
another. To Noah the quarter of the world to which Messiah should belong
was revealed; to Abraham, the nation; to Jacob, the tribe; to David and
Isaiah, the family; to Micah, the town of nativity; to Daniel, the exact
time; to Malachi, the coming of His forerunner, and His second advent;
through Jonah, His burial and resurrection; through Isaiah and Hosea,
His resurrection. Each only knew in part; but when that which was
perfect came in Messiah, that which was in part was done away ([Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012).md).

in divers manners--for example, internal suggestions, audible voices,
the Urim and Thummim, dreams, and visions. "In one way He was seen by
Abraham, in another by Moses, in another by Elias, and in another by
Micah; Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel, beheld different forms"
\[THEODORET\]. (Compare [Num 12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006).md).
The Old Testament revelations were fragmentary in substance, and
manifold in form; the very multitude of prophets shows that they
prophesied only in part. In Christ, the revelation of God is full, not
in shifting hues of separated color, but Himself the pure light, uniting
in His one person the whole spectrum ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md).

spake--the expression usual for a Jew to employ in addressing Jews. So
Matthew, a Jew writing especially for Jews, quotes Scripture, not by the
formula, "It is written," but "said," &c.

in time past--From Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets, for
four hundred years, there had arisen no prophet, in order that the Son
might be the more an object of expectation \[BENGEL\]. As God (the
Father) is introduced as having spoken here; so God the Son, [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003.md); God the Holy Ghost, [Heb
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#007.md).

the fathers--the Jewish fathers. The Jews of former days ([Co1
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001).md).

by--Greek, "in." A mortal king speaks by his ambassador, not (as the
King of kings) in his ambassador. The Son is the last and highest
manifestation of God ([Mat 21:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#034.md), [Mat
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037).md); not merely a measure, as in
the prophets, but the fulness of the Spirit of God dwelling in Him
bodily ([Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md); [Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034.md); [Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009).md). Thus he answers the Jewish
objection drawn from their prophets. Jesus is the end of all prophecy
([Rev 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010).md), and of the law of Moses
([Joh 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md); [Joh
5:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046).md).

[Hebrews 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 1:2</span></span>

in these last days--In the oldest manuscripts the Greek is. "At the last
part of these days." The Rabbins divided the whole of time into "this
age," or "world," and "the age to come" ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005.md); [Heb
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#005).md). The days of Messiah were the
transition period or "last part of these days" (in contrast to "in times
past"), the close of the existing dispensation, and beginning of the
final dispensation of which Christ's second coming shall be the crowning
consummation.

by his Son--Greek, "IN (His) Son" ([Joh
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010).md). The true "Prophet" of God.
"His majesty is set forth: (1) Absolutely by the very name "Son," and by
three glorious predicates, "whom He hath appointed," "by whom He made
the worlds," "who sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
thus His course is described from the beginning of all things till he
reached the goal ([Heb 1:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)). (2.md)
Relatively, in comparison with the angels, [Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md); the confirmation of this follows,
and the very name "Son" is proved at [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md); the "heirship," [Heb
1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md); the "making the worlds," [Heb
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md); the "sitting at the right
hand" of God, [Heb 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)." His being
made heir follows His sonship, and preceded His making the worlds ([Pro
8:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md); [Eph
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011).md). As the first begotten, He is
heir of the universe ([Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md), which
He made instrumentally, [Heb 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003.md),
where "by the Word of God" answers to "by whom"' (the Son of God) here
([Joh 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003).md). Christ was "appointed" (in
God's eternal counsel) to creation as an office; and the universe so
created was assigned to Him as a kingdom. He is "heir of all things" by
right of creation, and especially by right of redemption. The promise to
Abraham that he should be heir of the world had its fulfilment, and will
have it still more fully, in Christ ([Rom
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md); [Gal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007).md).

worlds--the inferior and the superior worlds ([Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016).md). Literally, "ages" with all
things and persons belonging to them; the universe, including all space
and ages of time, and all material and spiritual existences. The Greek
implies, He not only appointed His Son heir of all things before
creation, but He also (better than "also He") made by Him the worlds.

[Hebrews 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 1:3</span></span>

Who being--by pre-existent and essential being.

brightness of his glory--Greek, the effulgence of His glory. "Light of
(from) light" \[Nicene Creed\]. "Who is so senseless as to doubt
concerning the eternal being of the Son? For when has one seen light
without effulgence?" \[ATHANASIUS, Against Arius, Orations, 2\]. "The
sun is never seen without effulgence, nor the Father without the Son"
\[THEOPHYLACT\]. It is because He is the brightness, &c., and because He
upholds, &c., that He sat down on the right hand, &c. It was a return to
His divine glory ([Joh 6:62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062.md); [Joh
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#005.md); compare Wisdom 7:25-26, where
similar things are said of wisdom).

express image--"impress." But veiled in the flesh.

The Sun of God in glory beams

Too bright for us to scan;

But we can face the light that streams

For the mild Son of man. ([Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).md)

of his person--Greek, "of His substantial essence"; "hypostasis."

upholding all things--Greek, "the universe." Compare [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), [Col
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#017.md), [Col
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020.md), which enumerates the three facts
in the same order as here.

by the word--Therefore the Son of God is a Person; for He has the word
\[BENGEL\]. His word is God's word ([Heb
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003).md).

of his power--"The word" is the utterance which comes from His (the
Son's) power, and gives expression to it.

by himself--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

purged--Greek, "made purification of . . . sins," namely, in His
atonement, which graciously covers the guilt of sin. "Our" is omitted in
the oldest manuscripts. Sin was the great uncleanness in God's sight, of
which He has effected the purgation by His sacrifice \[ALFORD\]. Our
nature, as guilt-laden, could not, without our great High Priest's blood
of atonement sprinkling the heavenly mercy seat, come into immediate
contact with God. EBRARD says, "The mediation between man and God, who
was present in the Most Holy Place, was revealed in three forms: (1) In
sacrifices (typical propitiations for guilt); (2) In the priesthood (the
agents of those sacrifices); (3) In the Levitical laws of purity
(Levitical purity being attained by sacrifice positively, by avoidance
of Levitical pollution negatively, the people being thus enabled to come
into the presence of God without dying, [Deu
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#026))" (Lev. 16:1-34.md).

sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high--fulfilling [Psa
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md). This sitting of the Son at
God's fight hand was by the act of the Father ([Heb
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#001.md); [Eph
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md); it is never used of His
pre-existing state co-equal with the Father, but always of His exalted
state as Son of man after His sufferings, and as Mediator for man in the
presence of God ([Rom 8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034).md): a
relation towards God and us about to come to an end when its object has
been accomplished ([Co1 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028).md).

[Hebrews 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 1:4</span></span>

Being made . . . better--by His exaltation by the Father ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013).md): in contrast to His being "made
lower than the angels" ([Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009).md).
"Better," that is, superior to. As "being" ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md) expresses His essential being so
"being made" ([Heb 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026).md) marks what He
became in His assumed manhood ([Phi
2:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006).md). Paul shows that His humbled
form (at which the Jews might stumble) is no objection to His divine
Messiahship. As the law was given by the ministration of angels and
Moses, it was inferior to the Gospel given by the divine Son, who both
is ([Heb 1:4-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md) as God, and has been
made, as the exalted Son of man ([Heb
2:5-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005).md), much better than the angels.
The manifestations of God by angels (and even by the angel of the
covenant) at different times in the Old Testament, did not bring man and
God into personal union, as the manifestation of God in human flesh
does.

by inheritance obtained--He always had the thing itself, namely,
Sonship; but He "obtained by inheritance," according to the promise of
the Father, the name "Son," whereby He is made known to men and angels.
He is "the Son of God" is a sense far exalted above that in which angels
are called "sons of God" ([Job 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006.md);
[Job 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#007).md). "The fulness of the glory
of the peculiar name "the Son of God," is unattainable by human speech
or thought. All appellations are but fragments of its glory beams united
in it as in a central sun, [Rev 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#012.md).
A name that no than knew but He Himself."

[Hebrews 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 1:5</span></span>

For--substantiating His having "obtained a more excellent name than the
angels."

unto which--A frequent argument in this Epistle is derived from the
silence of Scripture ([Heb 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md); [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016.md); [Heb
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#003.md), [Heb
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#014).md) \[BENGEL\].

this day have I begotten thee-- ([Psa
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md). Fulfilled at the resurrection of
Jesus, whereby the Father "declared," that is, made manifest His divine
Sonship, heretofore veiled by His humiliation ([Act
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033.md); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004).md). Christ has a fourfold right to
the title "Son of God"; (1) By generation, as begotten of God; (2) By
commission, as sent by God; (3) By resurrection, as "the first-begotten
of the dead" (compare [Luk 20:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#036.md); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005)); (4.md) By actual possession, as
heir of all \[BISHOP PEARSON\]. The Psalm here quoted applied primarily
in a less full sense to Solomon, of whom God promised by Nathan to
David. "I will be his father and he shall be my son." But as the whole
theocracy was of Messianic import, the triumph of David over Hadadezer
and neighboring kings (2Sa. 8:1-18; [Psa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#002.md), [Psa
2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009).md) is a type of God's ultimately
subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets (Hebrew, "anointed,"
[Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md) on His "holy hill of Zion,"
as King of the Jews and of the whole earth. the antitype to Solomon, son
of David. The "I" in Greek is emphatic; I the Everlasting Father have
begotten Thee this day, that is, on this day, the day of Thy being
manifested as My Son, "the first-begotten of the dead" ([Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018.md); [Rev
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#005).md). when Thou hast ransomed and
opened heaven to Thy people. He had been always Son, but now first was
manifested as such in His once humbled, now exalted manhood united to
His Godhead. ALFORD refers "this day" to the eternal generation of the
Son: the day in which the Son was begotten by the Father is an
everlasting to-day: there never was a yesterday or past time to Him, nor
a to-morrow or future time: "Nothing there is to come, and nothing past,
but an eternal NOW doth ever last" ([Pro
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#004.md); [Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md), [Joh
10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md); [Joh
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#028.md); [Joh
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#008).md). The communication of the divine
essence in its fulness, involves eternal generation; for the divine
essence has no beginning. But the context refers to a definite point of
time, namely, that of His having entered on the inheritance ([Heb
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#004).md). The "bringing the first-begotten
into the world" ([Heb 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md), is not
subsequent, as ALFORD thinks, to [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md), but anterior to it (compare [Act
2:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030).md).

[Hebrews 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 1:6</span></span>

And--Greek, "But." Not only this proves His superiority, BUT a more
decisive proof is [Psa 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md), which
shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect of His
being brought into the world (compare [Heb
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011.md); [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md) as man, in His incarnation,
nativity ([Luk 2:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009).md), temptation
([Mat 4:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010).md), resurrection ([Mat
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002).md), and future second advent in
glory, angels were designed by God to be subject to Him. Compare [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md), "seen of angels"; God
manifesting Messiah as one to be gazed at with adoring love by heavenly
intelligences ([Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md); [Th2
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#009.md); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022).md). The fullest realization of His
Lordship shall be at His second coming ([Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md); [Co1
15:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024.md); [Phi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009).md). "Worship Him all ye gods"
("gods," that is, exalted beings, as angels), refers to God; but it was
universally admitted among the Hebrews that God would dwell, in a
peculiar sense, in Messiah (so as to be in the Talmud phrase, "capable
of being pointed to with the finger"); and so what was said of God was
true of, and to be fulfilled in, Messiah. KIMCHI says that the
ninety-third through the hundred first Psalms contain in them the
mystery of Messiah. God ruled the theocracy in and through Him.

the world--subject to Christ ([Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005).md). As "the first-begotten" He has
the rights of primogeniture ([Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029).md); [Col
1:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md), [Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018).md). In [Deu
32:43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043.md), the Septuagint has, "Let all
the angels of God worship Him," words not now found in the Hebrew. This
passage of the Septuagint may have been in Paul's mind as to the form,
but the substance is taken from [Psa
97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007.md). The type David, in the [Psa
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md) (quoted in [Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005).md), is called "God's first-born,
higher than the kings of the earth"; so the antitypical first-begotten,
the son of David, is to be worshipped by all inferior lords, such as
angels ("gods," [Psa 97:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#007).md); for He is
"King of kings and Lord of lords" ([Rev
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#016).md). In the Greek, "again" is
transposed; but this does not oblige us, as ALFORD thinks, to translate,
"when He again shall have introduced," &c., namely, at Christ's second
coming; for there is no previous mention of a first bringing in; and
"again" is often used in quotations, not to be joined with the verb, but
parenthetically ("that I may again quote Scripture"). English Version is
correct (compare [Mat 5:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033.md); Greek,
[Joh 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#039).md).

[Hebrews 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 1:7</span></span>

of--The Greek is rather, "In reference TO the angels."

spirits--or "winds": Who employeth His angels as the winds, His
ministers as the lightnings; or, He maketh His angelic ministers the
directing powers of winds and flames, when these latter are required to
perform His will. "Commissions them to assume the agency or form of
flames for His purposes" \[ALFORD\]. English Version, "maketh His angels
spirits," means, He maketh them of a subtle, incorporeal nature, swift
as the wind. So [Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md), "a cherub
. . . the wings of the wind." [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md), "ministering spirits," favors
English Version here. As "spirits" implies the wind-like velocity and
subtle nature of the cherubim, so "flame of fire" expresses the burning
devotion and intense all-consuming zeal of the adoring seraphim (meaning
"burning), [Isa 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#001.md). The translation,
"maketh winds His messengers, and a flame of fire His ministers (!)," is
plainly wrong. In the [Psa 104:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md),
the subject in each clause comes first, and the attribute predicated of
it second; so the Greek article here marks "angels" and "ministers" as
the subjects, and "winds" and "flame of fire," predicates, Schemoth
Rabba says, "God is called God of Zebaoth (the heavenly hosts), because
He does what He pleases with His angels. When He pleases, He makes them
to sit ([Jdg 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011).md); at other times to
stand ([Isa 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002).md); at times to resemble
women ([Zac 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#009).md); at other times to
resemble men ([Gen 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#002).md); at times He
makes them 'spirits'; at times, fire." "Maketh" implies that, however
exalted, they are but creatures, whereas the Son is the Creator ([Heb
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010).md): not begotten from everlasting,
nor to be worshipped, as the Son ([Rev
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#007.md); [Rev
22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#008).md).

[Hebrews 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 1:8</span></span>

O God--the Greek has the article to mark emphasis ([Psa
45:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md).

for ever . . . righteousness--Everlasting duration and righteousness go
together ([Psa 45:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#002.md); [Psa
89:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#014).md).

a sceptre of righteousness--literally, "a rod of rectitude," or
"straightforwardness." The oldest manuscripts prefix "and" (compare [Est
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/est004.htm#011).md).

[Hebrews 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 1:9</span></span>

iniquity--"unnrighteousness." Some oldest manuscripts read,
"lawlessness."

therefore--because God loves righteousness and hates iniquity.

God . . . thy God--JEROME, AUGUSTINE, and others translate [Psa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), "O God, Thy God, hath anointed
thee," whereby Christ is addressed as God. This is probably the true
translation of the Hebrew there, and also of the Greek of Hebrews here;
for it is likely the Son is addressed, "O God," as in [Heb
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#008.md). The anointing here meant is not
that at His baptism, when He solemnly entered on His ministry for us;
but that with the "oil of gladness," or "exulting joy" (which denotes a
triumph, and follows as the consequence of His manifested love of
righteousness and hatred of iniquity), wherewith, after His triumphant
completion of His work, He has been anointed by the Father above His
fellows (not only above us, His fellow men, the adopted members of God's
family, whom "He is not ashamed to call His brethren," but above the
angels, fellow partakers in part with Him, though infinitely His
inferiors, in the glories, holiness, and joys of heaven; "sons of God,"
and angel "messengers," though subordinate to the divine
Angel--"Messenger of the covenant"). Thus He is antitype to Solomon,
"chosen of all David's many sons to sit upon the throne of the kingdom
of the Lord over Israel," even as His father David was chosen before all
the house of his father's sons. The image is drawn from the custom of
anointing guests at feasts ([Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005).md); or rather of anointing kings:
not until His ascension did He assume the kingdom as Son of man. A
fuller accomplishment is yet to be, when He shall be VISIBLY the
anointed King over the whole earth (set by the Father) on His holy hill
of Zion, [Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md). So David, His type, was first
anointed at Bethlehem ([Sa1 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#013.md);
[Psa 89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020).md); and yet again at Hebron,
first over Judah ([Sa2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2002.htm#004).md), then over
all Israel ([Sa2 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#003).md); not till the
death of Saul did he enter on his actual kingdom; as it was not till
after Christ's death that the Father set Him at His right hand far above
all principalities ([Eph 1:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020).md). The
forty-fifth Psalm in its first meaning was addressed to Solomon; but the
Holy Spirit inspired the writer to use language which in its fulness can
only apply to the antitypical Solomon, the true Royal Head of the
theocracy.

[Hebrews 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 1:10</span></span>

And--In another passage ([Psa
102:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025).md) He says.

in the beginning--English Version, [Psa
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md), "of old": Hebrew, "before,"
"aforetime." The Septuagint, "in the beginning" (as in [Gen
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#001).md) answers by contrast to the end
implied in "They shall perish," &c. The Greek order here (not in the
Septuagint) is, "Thou in the beginning, O Lord," which throws the "Lord"
into emphasis. "Christ is preached even in passages where many might
contend that the Father was principally intended" \[BENGEL\].

laid the foundation of--"firmly founded" is included in the idea of the
Greek.

heavens--plural: not merely one, but manifold, and including various
orders of heavenly intelligences ([Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010).md).

works of thine hands--the heavens, as a woven veil or curtain spread
out.

[Hebrews 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 1:11</span></span>

They--The earth and the heavens in their present state and form "shall
perish" ([Heb 12:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013).md). "Perish" does not mean
annihilation; just as it did not mean so in the case of "the world that
being overflowed with water, perished" under Noah ([Pe2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#006).md). The covenant of the possession
of the earth was renewed with Noah and his seed on the renovated earth.
So it shall be after the perishing by fire ([Pe2
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#012).md).

remainest--through (so the Greek) all changes.

as . . . a garment-- ([Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006).md).

[Hebrews 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 1:12</span></span>

vesture--Greek, "an enwrapping cloak."

fold them up--So the Septuagint, [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md); but the Hebrew, "change them."
The Spirit, by Paul, treats the Hebrew of the Old Testament, with
independence of handling, presenting the divine truth in various
aspects; sometimes as here sanctioning the Septuagint (compare [Isa
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md); [Rev
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#014).md); sometimes the Hebrew; sometimes
varying from both.

changed--as one lays aside a garment to put on another.

thou art the same-- ([Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004.md); [Mal
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#006).md). The same in nature, therefore in
covenant faithfulness to Thy people.

shall not fail--Hebrew, "shall not end." Israel, in the Babylonian
captivity, in the hundred second Psalm, casts her hopes of deliverance
on Messiah, the unchanging covenant God of Israel.

[Hebrews 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 1:13</span></span>

Quotation from [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md). The image
is taken from the custom of conquerors putting the feet on the necks of
the conquered ([Jos 10:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#024).md).

[Hebrews 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 1:14</span></span>

ministering spirits--referring to [Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007.md), "spirits . . . ministers." They
are incorporeal spirits, as God is, but ministering to Him as inferiors.

sent forth--present participle: "being sent forth" continually, as their
regular service in all ages.

to minister--Greek, "unto (that is, 'for') ministry."

for them--Greek, "on account of the." Angels are sent forth on
ministrations to God and Christ, not primarily to men, though for the
good of "those who are about to inherit salvation" (so the Greek): the
elect, who believe, or shall believe, for whom all things, angels
included, work together for good ([Rom
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028).md). Angels' ministrations are not
properly rendered to men, since the latter have no power of commanding
them, though their ministrations to God are often directed to the good
of men. So the superiority of the Son of God to angels is shown. They
"all," how ever various their ranks, "minister"; He is ministered to.
They "stand" ([Luk 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#019).md) before God,
or are "sent forth" to execute the divine commands on behalf of them
whom He pleases to save; He "sits on the right hand of the Majesty on
high" ([Heb 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md), [Heb
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#013).md). He rules; they serve.
