### [Job Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)

[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">job 7:1</span></span>

JOB EXCUSES HIS DESIRE FOR DEATH. (Job 7:1-21)

appointed time--better, "a warfare," hard conflict with evil (so in [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002); [Dan
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#001)). Translate it "appointed time"
([Job 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#014)). Job reverts to the sad
picture of man, however great, which he had drawn ([Job
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014)), and details in this chapter the
miseries which his friends will see, if, according to his request ([Job
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#028)), they will look on him. Even the
Christian soldier, "warring a good warfare," rejoices when it is
completed ([Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti2
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#003); [Ti2
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007)).

[Job 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 7:2</span></span>

earnestly desireth--Hebrew, "pants for the \[evening\] shadow."
Easterners measure time by the length of their shadow. If the servant
longs for the evening when his wages are paid, why may not Job long for
the close of his hard service, when he shall enter on his "reward?" This
proves that Job did not, as many maintain, regard the grave as a mere
sleep.

[Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 7:3</span></span>

--Months of comfortless misfortune.

I am made to possess--literally, "to be heir to." Irony. "To be heir
to," is usually a matter of joy; but here it is the entail of an
involuntary and dismal inheritance.

Months--for days, to express its long duration.

Appointed--literally, "they have numbered to me"; marking well the
unavoidable doom assigned to him.

[Job 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 7:4</span></span>

Literally, "When shall be the flight of the night?" \[GESENIUS\].
UMBREIT, not so well, "The night is long extended"; literally, "measured
out" (so Margin).

[Job 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 7:5</span></span>

In elephantiasis maggots are bred in the sores ([Act
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#023); [Isa
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#011)).

clods of dust--rather, a crust of dried filth and accumulated corruption
([Job 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007)).

my skin is broken and . . . loathsome--rather, comes together so as to
heal up, and again breaks out with running matter \[GESENIUS\]. More
simply the Hebrew is, "My skin rests (for a time) and (again) melts
away" ([Psa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#007)).

[Job 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 7:6</span></span>

([Isa 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012)). Every day like the
weaver's shuttle leaves a thread behind; and each shall wear, as he
weaves. But Job's thought is that his days must swiftly be cut off as a
web;

without hope--namely, of a recovery and renewal of life ([Job
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#019); [Ch1
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#015)).

[Job 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 7:7</span></span>

Address to God.

Wind--a picture of evanescence ([Psa
78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039)).

shall no more see--rather, "shall no more return to see good." This
change from the different wish in [Job
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017), &c., is most true to nature. He
is now in a softer mood; a beam from former days of prosperity falling
upon memory and the thought of the unseen world, where one is seen no
more ([Job 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008)), drew from him an
expression of regret at leaving this world of light ([Ecc
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#007)); so Hezekiah ([Isa
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#011)). Grace rises above nature ([Co2
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#008)).

[Job 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 7:8</span></span>

The eye of him who beholds me (present, not past), that is, in the very
act of beholding me, seeth me no more.

Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not--He disappears, even while God is
looking upon him. Job cannot survive the gaze of Jehovah ([Psa
104:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032); [Rev
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011)). Not, "Thine eyes seek me and I
am not to be found"; for God's eye penetrates even to the unseen world
([Psa 139:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#008)). UMBREIT unnaturally
takes "thine" to refer to one of the three friends.

[Job 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 7:9</span></span>

([Sa2 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#023)).

the grave--the Sheol, or place of departed spirits, not disproving Job's
belief in the resurrection. It merely means, "He shall come up no more"
in the present order of things.

[Job 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 7:10</span></span>

([Psa 103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)). The Oriental keenly
loves his dwelling. In Arabian elegies the desertion of abodes by their
occupants is often a theme of sorrow. Grace overcomes this also ([Luk
18:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#029); [Act
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034)).

[Job 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 7:11</span></span>

Therefore, as such is my hard lot, I will at least have the melancholy
satisfaction of venting my sorrow in words. The Hebrew opening words,
"Therefore I, at all events," express self-elevation \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 7:12</span></span>

Why dost thou deny me the comfort of care-assuaging sleep? Why scarest
thou me with frightful dreams?

Am I a sea--regarded in Old Testament poetry as a violent rebel against
God, the Lord of nature, who therefore curbs his violence ([Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022)).

or a whale--or some other sea monster ([Isa
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001)), that Thou needest thus to watch
and curb me? The Egyptians watched the crocodile most carefully to
prevent its doing mischief.

[Job 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 7:14</span></span>

The frightful dreams resulting from elephantiasis he attributes to God;
the common belief assigned all night visions to God.

[Job 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 7:15</span></span>

UMBREIT translates, "So that I could wish to strangle myself--dead by my
own hands." He softens this idea of Job's harboring the thought of
suicide, by representing it as entertained only in agonizing dreams, and
immediately repudiated with horror in [Job
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#016), "Yet that (self-strangling) I
loathe." This is forcible and graphic. Perhaps the meaning is simply,
"My soul chooses (even) strangling (or any violent death) rather than my
life," literally, "my bones" ([Psa
35:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#010)); that is, rather than the
wasted and diseased skeleton, left to him. In this view, "I loathe it"
([Job 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#016)) refers to his life.

[Job 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 7:16</span></span>

Let me alone--that is, cease to afflict me for the few and vain days
still left to me.

[Job 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 7:17</span></span>

([Psa 8:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004); [Psa
144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003)). Job means, "What is man that
thou shouldst make him \[of so much importance\], and that thou shouldst
expend such attention \[or, heart-thought\] upon him" as to make him the
subject of so severe trials? Job ought rather to have reasoned from
God's condescending so far to notice man as to try him, that there must
be a wise and loving purpose in trial. David uses the same words, in
their right application, to express wonder that God should do so much as
He does for insignificant man. Christians who know God manifest in the
man Christ Jesus may use them still more.

[Job 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">job 7:18</span></span>

With each new day ([Psa 73:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#014)). It is
rather God's mercies, not our trials, that are new every morning ([Lam
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#023)). The idea is that of a shepherd
taking count of his flock every morning, to see if all are there
\[COCCEIUS\].

[Job 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">job 7:19</span></span>

How long (like a jealous keeper) wilt thou never take thine eyes off (so
the Hebrew for "depart from") me? Nor let me alone for a brief respite
(literally, "so long as I take to swallow my spittle"), an Arabic
proverb, like our, "till I draw my breath."

[Job 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">job 7:20</span></span>

I have sinned--Yet what sin can I do against ("to," [Job
35:6](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#006)) thee (of such a nature that thou
shouldst jealously watch and deprive me of all strength, as if thou
didst fear me)? Yet thou art one who hast men ever in view, ever
watchest them--O thou Watcher ([Job
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#012); [Dan
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#014)) of men. Job had borne with
patience his trials, as sent by God ([Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021); [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010)); only his reason cannot
reconcile the ceaseless continuance of his mental and bodily pains with
his ideas of the divine nature.

set me as a mark--Wherefore dost thou make me thy point of attack? that
is, ever assail me with new pains? \[UMBREIT\] ([Lam
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#012)).

[Job 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">job 7:21</span></span>

for now--very soon.

in the morning--not the resurrection; for then Job will be found. It is
a figure, from one seeking a sick man in the morning, and finding he has
died in the night. So Job implies that, if God does not help him at
once, it will be too late, for he will be gone. The reason why God does
not give an immediate sense of pardon to awakened sinners is that they
think they have a claim on God for it.
