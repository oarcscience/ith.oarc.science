### [Ezekiel Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 17:2</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE TWO GREAT EAGLES, AND THE CROPPING OF THE CEDAR OF
LEBANON. JUDAH IS TO BE JUDGED FOR REVOLTING FROM BABYLON, WHICH HAD SET
UP ZEDEKIAH INSTEAD OF JEHOIACHIN, TO EGYPT; GOD HIMSELF, AS THE RIVAL
OF THE BABYLONIAN KING, IS TO PLANT THE GOSPEL CEDAR OF MESSIAH. (Eze.
17:1-24)

riddle--a continued allegory, expressed enigmatically, requiring more
than common acumen and serious thought. The Hebrew is derived from a
root, "sharp," that is, calculated to stimulate attention and whet the
intellect. Distinct from "fable," in that it teaches not fiction, but
fact. Not like the ordinary riddle, designed to puzzle, but to instruct.
The "riddle" is here identical with the "parable," only that the former
refers to the obscurity, the latter to the likeness of the figure to the
thing compared.

[Ezekiel 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 17:3</span></span>

eagle--the king of birds. The literal Hebrew is, "the great eagle." The
symbol of the Assyrian supreme god, Nisroch; so applied to "the great
king" of Babylon, his vicegerent on earth ([Jer
48:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#040); [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022)). His "wings" are his great
forces. Such symbols were familiar to the Jews, who saw them portrayed
on the great buildings of Babylon; such as are now seen in the Assyrian
remains.

long-winged--implying the wide extent of his empire.

full of feathers--when they have been renewed after moulting; and so in
the full freshness of renovated youth ([Psa
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005); [Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031)). Answering to the many peoples
which, as tributaries, constituted the strength of Babylon:

divers colours--the golden eagle, marked with star-like spots, supposed
to be the largest of eagles \[BOCHART\]. Answering to the variety of
languages, habits, and costumes of the peoples subject to Babylon.

came unto Lebanon--continuing the metaphor: as the eagle frequents
mountains, not cities. The temple at Jerusalem was called "Lebanon" by
the Jews \[EUSEBIUS\], because its woodwork was wholly of cedars of
Lebanon. "The mountain of the Lord's house" ([Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)). Jerusalem, however, is chiefly
meant, the chief seat of civil honor, as Lebanon was of external
elevation.

took the highest branch--King Jeconiah, then but eighteen years old, and
many of the chiefs and people with him ([Kg2
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#008), [Kg2
24:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)). The Hebrew for "highest
branch" is, properly, the fleece-like tuft at the top of the tree. (So
in [Eze 31:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#003)). The cedar, as a tall
tree, is the symbol of kingly elevation (compare [Dan
4:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 17:4</span></span>

land of traffic . . . merchants--Babylon ([Kg2
24:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#015)), famous for its transport
traffic on the Tigris and Euphrates. Also, by its connection with the
Persian Gulf, it carried on much commerce with India.

[Ezekiel 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 17:5</span></span>

seed of the land--not a foreign production, but one native in the
region; a son of the soil, not a foreigner: Zedekiah, uncle of
Jehoiachin, of David's family.

in a fruitful field--literally, a "field of seed"; that is, fit for
propagating and continuing the seed of the royal family.

as a willow--derived from a Hebrew root, "to overflow," from its
fondness for water ([Isa 44:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#004)). Judea
was "a land of brooks of water and fountains" ([Deu
8:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#007); compare [Joh
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#023)).

[Ezekiel 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 17:6</span></span>

vine of low stature--not now, as before, a stately "cedar"; the kingdom
of Judah was to be prosperous, but not elevated.

branches turned toward him--expressing the fealty of Zedekiah as a
vassal looking up to Nebuchadnezzar, to whom Judah owed its peace and
very existence as a separate state. The "branches" mean his sons and the
other princes and nobles.

The roots . . . under him--The stability of Judah depended on Babylon.
The repetition "branches" and "springs" is in order to mark the
ingratitude of Zedekiah, who, not content with moderate prosperity,
revolted from him to whom he had sworn allegiance.

[Ezekiel 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 17:7</span></span>

another . . . eagle--the king of Egypt ([Eze
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015)). The "long-winged" of [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003) is omitted, as Egypt had not such
a wide empire and large armies as Babylon.

vine . . . bend . . . roots towards him--literally, "thirsted after him
with its roots"; expressing the longings after Egypt in the Jewish
heart. Zedekiah sought the alliance of Egypt, as though by it he could
throw off his dependence on Babylon ([Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007), [Kg2
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020); [Ch2
36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013); [Jer
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#005), [Jer
37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007)).

water it by . . . furrows of . . . plantation--that is, in the garden
beds (Judea) wherein (the vine) it was planted. Rather, "by" or "out of
the furrows." It refers to the waters of Egypt, the Nile being made to
water the fields by means of small canals or "furrows"; these waters are
the figure of the auxiliary forces wherewith Egypt tried to help Judah.
See the same figure, [Isa 8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007). But see
on [Eze 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010), "furrows where it
grew."

[Ezekiel 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 17:8</span></span>

It was planted in a good soil--It was not want of the necessaries of
life, nor oppression on the port of Nebuchadnezzar, which caused
Zedekiah to revolt: it was gratuitous ambition, pride, and ingratitude.

[Ezekiel 17:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 17:9</span></span>

Shall it prosper?--Could it be that gratuitous treason should prosper?
God will not allow it. "It," that is, the vine.

he . . . pull up--that is, the first eagle, or Nebuchadnezzar.

in all . . . leaves of her spring--that is, all its springing
(sprouting) leaves.

without great power or many--It shall not need all the forces of Babylon
to destroy it; a small division of the army will suffice because God
will deliver it into Nebuchadnezzar's hand ([Jer
37:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#010)).

[Ezekiel 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 17:10</span></span>

being planted--that is, "though planted."

east wind--The east wind was noxious to vegetation in Palestine; a fit
emblem of Babylon, which came from the northeast.

wither in . . . furrows where it grew--Zedekiah was taken at Jericho, on
Jewish soil ([Jer 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#008)). "It shall
wither, although it has furrows from which it expects continual
waterings" \[CALVIN\], ([Eze 19:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#012);
[Hos 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015)).

[Ezekiel 17:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 17:12</span></span>

Know ye not--He upbraided them with moral, leading to intellectual,
stupidity.

hath taken the king--Jeconiah or Jehoiachin ([Kg2
24:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#011), [Kg2
24:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012)).

[Ezekiel 17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 17:13</span></span>

the king's seed--Zedekiah, Jeconiah's uncle.

taken . . . oath of him--swearing fealty as a vassal to Nebuchadnezzar
([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013)).

also taken the mighty--as hostages for the fulfilment of the covenant;
whom, therefore, Zedekiah exposed to death by his treason.

[Ezekiel 17:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 17:14</span></span>

That the kingdom might be base--that is, low as to national elevation by
being Nebuchadnezzar's dependent; but, at the same time, safe and
prosperous, if faithful to the "oath." Nebuchadnezzar dealt sincerely
and openly in proposing conditions, and these moderate ones; therefore
Zedekiah's treachery was the baser and was a counterpart to their
treachery towards God.

[Ezekiel 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 17:15</span></span>

he rebelled--God permitted this because of His wrath against Jerusalem
([Kg2 24:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#020)).

horses--in which Egypt abounded and which were forbidden to Israel to
seek from Egypt, or indeed to "multiply" at all ([Deu
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#016); [Isa
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#001), [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003); compare [Isa
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#009)). DIODORUS SICULUS \[1.45\] says
that the whole region from Thebes to Memphis was filled with royal
stalls, so that twenty thousand chariots with two horses in each could
be furnished for war.

Shall he prosper?--The third time this question is asked, with an
indignant denial understood ([Eze
17:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#009)). Even the heathen believed
that breakers of an oath would not "escape" punishment.

[Ezekiel 17:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 17:16</span></span>

in the place where the king dwelleth--righteous retribution. He brought
on himself in the worst form the evil which, in a mild form, he had
sought to deliver himself from by perjured treachery, namely, vassalage
([Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013); [Jer
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#005); [Jer
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003); [Jer
52:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#011)).

[Ezekiel 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 17:17</span></span>

Pharaoh--Pharaoh-hophra ([Jer 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#007);
[Jer 44:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#030)), the successor of Necho
([Kg2 23:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#029)).

Neither . . . make for him--literally, "effect (anything) with him,"
that is, be of any avail to Zedekiah. Pharaoh did not act in concert
with him, for he was himself compelled to retire to Egypt.

by casting up mounts, &c.--So far from Pharaoh doing so for Jerusalem,
this was what Nebuchadnezzar did against it ([Jer
52:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004)). CALVIN MAURER, &c., refer it to
Nebuchadnezzar, "when Nebuchadnezzar shall cast up mounts."

[Ezekiel 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eze 17:18</span></span>

given his hand--in ratification of the oath ([Kg2
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015); [Ezr
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#019)), and also in token of
subjection to Nebuchadnezzar ([Ch1
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#024), Margin; [Ch2
30:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#008), Margin; [Lam
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 17:19</span></span>

mine oath--The "covenant" being sworn in God's name was really His
covenant; a new instance in relation to man of the treacherous spirit
which had been so often betrayed in relation to God. God Himself must
therefore avenge the violation of His covenant "on the head" of the
perjurer (compare [Psa 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016)).

[Ezekiel 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 17:20</span></span>

my net-- ([Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013); [Eze
32:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#003)). God entraps him as he had tried
to entrap others ([Psa 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015)). This was
spoken at least upwards of three years before the fall of Jerusalem
(compare [Eze 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#001), with [Eze
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#001)).

[Ezekiel 17:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 17:21</span></span>

all his fugitives--the soldiers that accompany him in his flight.

[Ezekiel 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 17:22</span></span>

When the state of Israel shall seem past recovery, Messiah, Jehovah
Himself, will unexpectedly appear on the scene as Redeemer of His people
([Isa 63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005)).

I . . . also--God opposes Himself to Nebuchadnezzar: "He took of the
seed of the land and planted it ([Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003), [Eze
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#005)), so will I, but with better
success than he had. The branch he plucked (Zedekiah) and planted,
flourished but for a time, to perish at last; I will plant a scion of
the same tree, the house of David, to whom the kingdom belongs by an
everlasting covenant, and it shall be the shelter of the whole world,
and shall be for ever."

branch--the peculiar title of Messiah ([Zac
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008); [Zac
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012); [Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001); [Isa
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005); [Jer
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015)).

a tender one--Zerubbabel never reigned as a universal ([Eze
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023)) king, nor could the great
things mentioned here be said of him, except as a type of Messiah.
Messiah alone can be meant: originally "a tender plant and root out of a
dry ground" ([Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)); the beginning
of His kingdom being humble, His reputed parents of lowly rank, though
King David's lineal representatives; yet, even then, God here calls Him,
in respect to His everlasting purpose, "the highest . . . of the high"
([Psa 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027)).

I . . . will plant it upon an high mountain--Zion; destined to be the
moral center and eminence of grace and glory shining forth to the world,
out-topping all mundane elevation. The kingdom, typically begun at the
return from Babylon, and the rebuilding of the temple, fully began with
Christ's appearing, and shall have its highest manifestation at His
reappearing to reign on Zion, and thence over the whole earth ([Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006), [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008); [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002); [Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017)).

[Ezekiel 17:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 17:23</span></span>

under it . . . all fowl--the Gospel "mustard tree," small at first, but
at length receiving all under its covert ([Mat
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#032)); the antithesis to Antichrist,
symbolized by Assyria, of which the same is said ([Eze
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#006)), and Babylon ([Dan
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#012)). Antichrist assumes in mimicry
the universal power really belonging to Christ.

[Ezekiel 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 17:24</span></span>

I . . . brought down the high--the very attribute given to God by the
virgin mother of Him, under whom this was to be accomplished.

high . . . low tree--that is, princes elevated . . . lowered. All the
empires of the world, represented by Babylon, once flourishing
("green"), shall be brought low before the once depressed ("dry"), but
then exalted, kingdom of Messiah and His people, the head of whom shall
be Israel ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044)).

Vindication of God's moral government as to His retributive
righteousness from the Jewish imputation of injustice, as if they were
suffering, not for their own sin, but for that of their fathers. As in
the seventeenth chapter he foretold Messiah's happy reign in Jerusalem,
so now he warns them that its blessings can be theirs only upon their
individually turning to righteousness.
