### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">kg2 14:3</span></span>

AMAZIAH'S GOOD REIGN OVER JUDAH. ([Kg2
14:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001).md)

He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David
his father--The beginning of his reign was excellent, for he acted the
part of a constitutional king, according to the law of God, yet not with
perfect sincerity of heart (compare [Ch2
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#002).md). As in the case of his father
Joash, the early promise was belied by the devious course he personally
followed in later life (see [Ch2
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014).md), as well as by the public
irregularities he tolerated in the kingdom.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">kg2 14:5</span></span>

as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand--It was an act of
justice no less than of filial piety to avenge the murder of his father.
But it is evident that the two assassins must have possessed
considerable weight and influence, as the king was obliged to retain
them in his service, and durst not, for fear of their friends and
supporters, institute proceedings against them until his power had been
fully consolidated.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 14:6</span></span>

But the children of the murderers he slew not--This moderation, inspired
by the Mosaic law ([Deu 24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016).md),
displays the good character of this prince; for the course thus pursued
toward the families of the regicides was directly contrary to the
prevailing customs of antiquity, according to which all connected with
the criminals were doomed to unsparing destruction.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">kg2 14:7</span></span>

HE SMITES EDOM. ([Kg2 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#007).md)

He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand--In the reign of
Joram the Edomites had revolted (see [Kg2
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#020).md). But Amaziah, determined to
reduce them to their former subjection, formed a hostile expedition
against them, in which he routed their army and made himself master of
their capital.

the valley of salt--that part of the Ghor which comprises the salt and
sandy plain to the south of the Dead Sea.

Selah--literally, "the rock"; generally thought to be Petra.

Joktheel--that is, "given" or "conquered by God." See the history of
this conquest more fully detailed ([Ch2
25:6-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#006).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 14:8</span></span>

JOASH DEFEATS HIM. ([Kg2 14:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#008).md)

Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu,
king of Israel--This bold and haughty challenge, which was most probably
stimulated by a desire of satisfaction for the outrages perpetrated by
the discharged auxiliaries of Israel ([Ch2
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#013).md) on the towns that lay in their
way home, as well as by revenge for the massacre of his ancestors by
Jehu (2Ki. 9:1-37) sprang, there is little doubt, from pride and
self-confidence, inspired by his victory over the Edomites.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">kg2 14:9</span></span>

Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah--People in the East very
often express their sentiments in a parabolic form, especially when they
intend to convey unwelcome truths or a contemptuous sneer. This was the
design of the admonitory fable related by Joash in his reply. The
thistle, a low shrub, might be chosen to represent Amaziah, a petty
prince; the cedar, the powerful sovereign of Israel, and the wild beast
that trampled down the thistle the overwhelming army with which Israel
could desolate Judah. But, perhaps, without making so minute an
application, the parable may be explained generally, as describing in a
striking manner the effects of pride and ambition, towering far beyond
their natural sphere, and sure to fall with a sudden and ruinous crash.
The moral of the fable is contained in [Kg2
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#010.md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">kg2 14:11</span></span>

But Amaziah would not hear--The sarcastic tenor of this reply incited
the king of Judah the more; for, being in a state of judicial blindness
and infatuation ([Ch2 25:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#020).md), he was
immovably determined on war. But the superior energy of Joash surprised
him ere he had completed his military preparations. Pouring a large army
into the territory of Judah, he encountered Amaziah in a pitched battle,
routed his army, and took him prisoner. Then having marched to Jerusalem
\[[Kg2 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md)\], he not only demolished
part of the city walls, but plundered the treasures of the palace and
temple. Taking hostages to prevent any further molestation from Judah,
he terminated the war. Without leaving a garrison in Jerusalem, he
returned to his capital with all convenient speed, his presence and all
his forces being required to repel the troublesome incursions of the
Syrians.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 14:19</span></span>

HE IS SLAIN BY A CONSPIRACY. ([Kg2
14:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#017).md)

they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem--Amaziah's apostasy
([Ch2 25:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2025.htm#027).md) was followed by a general
maladministration, especially the disastrous issue of the war with
Israel. The ruinous condition of Jerusalem, the plunder of the temple,
and the loss of their children who were taken as hostages \[[Kg2
14:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#013.md)\], lost him the respect and
attachment not of the grandees only, but of his subjects generally, who
were in rebellion. The king fled in terror to Lachish, a frontier town
of the Philistines, where, however, he was traced and murdered. His
friends had his corpse brought without any pomp or ceremony, in a
chariot to Jerusalem, where he was interred among his royal ancestors.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">kg2 14:21</span></span>

AZARIAH SUCCEEDS HIM. ([Kg2 14:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#021).md)

all the people of Judah took Azariah--or Uzziah ([Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030.md); [Ch2
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#001).md). The popular opposition had been
personally directed against Amaziah as the author of their calamities,
but it was not extended to his family or heir.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 14:22</span></span>

He built Elath--fortified that seaport. It had revolted with the rest of
Edom, but was now recovered by Uzziah. His father, who did not complete
the conquest of Edom, had left him that work to do.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">kg2 14:23</span></span>

JEROBOAM'S WICKED REIGN OVER ISRAEL. ([Kg2
14:23-29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023).md)

Jeroboam, the son of Joash king of Israel--This was Jeroboam II who, on
regaining the lost territory, raised the kingdom to great political
power ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md), but adhered to the
favorite religious policy of the Israelitish sovereigns ([Kg2
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#024).md). While God granted him so great
a measure of national prosperity and eminence, the reason is expressly
stated ([Kg2 14:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#026).md) to be that the
purposes of the divine covenant forbade as yet the overthrow of the
kingdom of the ten tribes (see [Kg2
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#023).md).
