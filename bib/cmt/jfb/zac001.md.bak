### [Zechariah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

[Zechariah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zac 1:1</span></span>

INTRODUCTORY EXHORTATION TO REPENTANCE. THE VISION. The man among the
myrtles: Comforting explanation by the angel, an encouragement to the
Jews to build the city and temple: The four horns and four artificers.
(Zec. 1:1-17)

See Introduction.

[Zechariah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zac 1:2</span></span>

God fulfilled His threats against your fathers; beware, then, lest by
disregarding His voice by me, as they did in the case of former
prophets, ye suffer like them. The special object Zechariah aims at is
that they should awake from their selfish negligence to obey God's
command to rebuild His temple ([Hag
1:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004).md).

sore displeased--Hebrew, "displeased with a displeasure," that is,
vehemently, with no common displeasure, exhibited in the destruction of
the Jews' city and in their captivity.

[Zechariah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zac 1:3</span></span>

saith the Lord of hosts--a phrase frequent in Haggai and Zechariah,
implying God's boundless resources and universal power, so as to inspire
the Jews with confidence to work.

Turn ye unto me . . . and I will turn--that is, and then, as the sure
consequence, "I will turn unto you" ([Mal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#007.md); [Jam
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md); compare also [Jer
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md); [Eze
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md); [Mic
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019).md). Though God hath brought you
back from captivity, yet this state will not last long unless ye are
really converted. God has heavier scourges ready, and has begun to give
symptoms of displeasure \[CALVIN\]. ([Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006).md).

[Zechariah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zac 1:4</span></span>

Be ye not as your fathers--The Jews boasted of their fathers; but he
shows that their fathers were refractory, and that ancient example and
long usage will not justify disobedience ([Ch2
36:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#015).md).

the former prophets--those who lived before the captivity. It aggravated
their guilt that, not only had they the law, but they had been often
called to repent by God's prophets.

[Zechariah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zac 1:5</span></span>

Your fathers . . . and the prophets, do they live for ever?--In contrast
to "My words" ([Zac 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006).md), which
"endure for ever" ([Pe1 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025).md). "Your
fathers have perished, as was foretold; and their fate ought to warn
you. But you may say, The prophets too are dead. I grant it, but still
My words do not die: though dead, their prophetical words from Me,
fulfilled against your fathers, are not dead with them. Beware, then,
lest ye share their fate."

[Zechariah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zac 1:6</span></span>

statutes--My determined purposes to punish for sin.

which I commanded my servants--namely, to announce to your fathers.

did they not take hold--that is, overtake, as a foe overtakes one
fleeing.

they returned--Turning from their former self-satisfaction, they
recognized their punishment as that which God's prophets had foretold.

thought to do--that is, decreed to do. Compare with this verse [Lam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#017.md).

our ways--evil ways ([Jer 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md); [Jer
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#010.md); [Jer
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#002).md).

[Zechariah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zac 1:7</span></span>

The general plan of the nine following visions (Zec. 1:8-6:15) is first
to present the symbol; then, on a question being put, to subjoin the
interpretation. Though the visions are distinct, they form one grand
whole, presented in one night to the prophet's mind, two or three months
after the prophet's first commission ([Zac
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001).md).

Sebat--the eleventh month of the Jewish year, from the new moon in
February to the new moon in March. The term is Chaldee, meaning a
"shoot," namely, the month when trees begin to shoot or bud.

[Zechariah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zac 1:8</span></span>

by night--The Jews begin their day with sunset; therefore the night
which preceded the twenty-fourth day of the month is meant ([Zac
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#007).md).

a man--Jehovah, the second person of the Trinity, manifested in man's
form, an earnest of the incarnation; called the "angel of Jehovah" ([Zac
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011).md), "Jehovah the angel of the
covenant" ([Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md); compare [Gen
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#007.md) with [Zac
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md); [Gen
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#011.md) with [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md); [Exo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#002.md) with [Zac
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004).md). Being at once divine and human,
He must be God and man in one person.

riding--implying swiftness in executing God's will in His providence;
hastening to help His people.

red horse--the color that represents bloodshed: implying vengeance to be
inflicted on the foes of Israel (compare [Kg2
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#022.md); [Isa
63:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md); [Rev
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#004).md); also fiery zeal.

among the myrtle trees--symbol of the Jewish Church: not a stately
cedar, but a lowly, though fragrant, myrtle. It was its depressed state
that caused the Jews to despond; this vision is designed to cheer them
with better hopes. The uncreated angel of Jehovah's presence standing
(as His abiding place, [Psa 132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014).md)
among them, is a guarantee for her safety, lowly though she now be.

in the bottom--in a low place or bottom of a river; alluding to Babylon
near the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, the scene of Judah's captivity.
The myrtle delights in low places and the banks of waters \[PEMBELLUS\].
MAURER translates, from a different root, "in a shady place."

red horses--that is, horsemen mounted on red horses; [Zac
1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md), confirm this view.

speckled . . . white--The "white" implies triumph and victory for Judah;
"speckled" (from a root "to intertwine"), a combination of the two
colors white and red (bay \[MOORE\]), implies a state of things mixed,
partly prosperous, partly otherwise \[HENDERSON\]; or, the connection of
the wrath (answering to the "red") about to fall on the Jews' foes, and
triumph (answering to the "white") to the Jews themselves in God's
arrangements for His people \[MOORE\]. Some angels ("the red horses")
exercised offices of vengeance; others ("the white"), those of joy;
others ("the speckled"), those of a mixed character (compare [Zac
6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#002).md). God has ministers of every
kind for promoting the interests of His Church.

[Zechariah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zac 1:9</span></span>

the angel that talked with me--not the "man upon the red horse," as is
evident from [Zac 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md), where he (the
Divine Angel) is distinguished from the "angel that talked with me" (the
phrase used of him, [Zac 1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md); [Zac
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#003.md); [Zac
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md), [Zac
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#004.md); [Zac
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md), [Zac
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#010.md); [Zac
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#004).md), that is, the interpreting angel.
The Hebrew for "with me," or, "in me" ([Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008).md), implies internal, intimate
communication \[JEROME\].

show thee--reveal to thy mental vision.

[Zechariah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zac 1:10</span></span>

answered--The "angel of the covenant" here gives the reply instead of
the interpreting angel, to imply that all communications through the
interpreting angel come from Him as their source.

Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth--If "Satan walks to
and fro in the earth" (implying restless activity) on errands of
mischief to God's people ([Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007).md),
the Lord sends other angels to "walk to and fro" with unceasing activity
everywhere to counterwork Satan's designs, and to defend His people
([Psa 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md); [Psa
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md); [Psa
103:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#020.md); [Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014).md).

[Zechariah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zac 1:11</span></span>

The attendant angels report to the Lord of angels, "the earth . . . is
at rest." The flourishing state of the heathen "earth," while Judah was
desolate and its temple not yet restored, is the powerful plea in the
Divine Angel's intercession with God the Father in [Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md). When Judah was depressed to the
lowest point, and the heathen elated to the highest, it was time for
Jehovah to work for His people.

sitteth still--dwells surely.

[Zechariah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zac 1:12</span></span>

Not only does Messiah stand among His people (the "myrtles," [Zac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#008).md), but intercedes for them with the
Father ("Lord," or "Jehovah of hosts") effectively ([Zac
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md); [Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025).md). Compare [Psa
102:13-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md); [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md), as to Judah's restoration in
answer to prayer.

answered and said--said in continuation of the discourse: proceeded to
say.

how long--Messiah's people pray similarly to their Head. [Rev
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#010.md), "How long," &c. Heretofore it
was vain to pray, but now that the divinely appointed "threescore and
ten years" ([Jer 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md); [Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010).md) are elapsed, it is time to pray
to Thee for the fulfilment of Thy promise, seeing that Thy grace is not
yet fully manifested, nor Thy promise fulfilled. God's promises are not
to make us slothful, but to quicken our prayers. HENDERSON, dating the
seventy years from the destruction of Jerusalem (588 B.C.), supposes two
years of the seventy had yet to run (520 B.C.).

[Zechariah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zac 1:13</span></span>

the Lord--JEHOVAH, called "the angel of the Lord (Jehovah)" ([Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012).md).

good words and comfortable words--literally, "words, consolations." The
subject of these consolatory words is stated in [Zac
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md), &c.; the promise of full
re-establishment, [Jer 29:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md)
(compare [Isa 57:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#018.md); [Hos
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md).

[Zechariah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zac 1:14</span></span>

Cry--Proclaim so as to be heard clearly by all ([Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md); [Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001).md).

I am jealous for Jerusalem--As a husband jealous for his wife, wronged
by others, so Jehovah is for Judah, who has been injured wantonly by the
heathen ([Zac 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#002.md); [Num
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#011.md), [Num
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013.md); [Kg1
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010.md); [Joe
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#018).md).

[Zechariah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zac 1:15</span></span>

very sore displeased with the heathen--in contrast with "I was but a
little displeased" with My people. God's displeasure with His people is
temporary and for their chastening; with the heathen oppressors, it is
final and fatal ([Jer 30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011).md). God's
instruments for chastising His people, when He has done with them, He
casts into the fire.

are at ease--carnally secure. A stronger phrase than "is at rest" ([Zac
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011).md). They are "at ease," but as I am
"sore displeased" with them, their ease is accursed. Judah is in
"affliction," but as I love her and am jealous for her, she has every
reason to be encouraged in prosecuting the temple work.

helped forward the affliction--afflicted My people more than I desired.
The heathen sought the utter extinction of Judah to gratify their own
ambition and revenge ([Isa 47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006.md); [Eze
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003.md), [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006.md); [Oba
1:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#010).md).

[Zechariah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zac 1:16</span></span>

I am returned--whereas in anger I had before withdrawn from her ([Hos
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#015).md).

with mercies--not merely of one kind, nor once only, but repeated
mercies.

my house shall be built--which at this time (the second year of Darius,
[Zac 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001).md) had only its foundations
laid ([Hag 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#018).md). It was not completed
till the sixth year of Darius ([Ezr
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#015).md).

line-- ([Job 38:5](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#005).md). The measuring-line
for building, not hastily, but with measured regularity. Not only the
temple, but Jerusalem also was to be rebuilt ([Neh
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh002.htm#003.md), &c.; compare [Zac
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#001).md). Also, as to the future temple
and city, [Eze 41:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze041.htm#003.md); Eze. 42:1-44:31;
[Eze 45:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#006.md).

[Zechariah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zac 1:17</span></span>

yet--though heretofore lying in abject prostration.

My cities--not only Jerusalem, but the subordinate cities of Judah. God
claims them all as peculiarly His, and therefore will restore them.

through prosperity . . . spread abroad--or overflow; metaphor from an
overflowing vessel or fountain (compare [Pro
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#016).md) \[PEMBELLUS\]. Abundance of
fruits of the earth, corn and wine, and a large increase of citizens,
are meant; also spiritual prosperity.

comfort Zion-- ([Isa 40:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md); [Isa
51:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#003).md).

choose-- ([Zac 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md); [Zac
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002.md); [Isa
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#001).md). Here meaning, "show by acts of
loving-kindness that He has chosen." His immutable choice from
everlasting is the fountain whence flow all such particular acts of
love.

[Zechariah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zac 1:18</span></span>

SECOND VISION. The power of the Jews foes shall be dissipated. ([Zac
1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018).md)

four horns--To a pastoral people like the Jews the horns of the
strongest in the herd naturally suggested a symbol of power and pride of
conscious strength: hence the ruling powers of the world ([Rev
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#003.md), [Rev
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#012).md). The number four in Zechariah's
time referred to the four cardinal points of the horizon. Wherever God's
people turned, there were foes to encounter ([Neh
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007).md); the Assyrian, Chaldean, and
Samaritan on the north; Egypt and Arabia on the south; Philistia on the
west; Ammon and Moab on the east. But the Spirit in the prophet looked
farther; namely, to the four world powers, the only ones which were, or
are, to rise till the kingdom of Messiah, the fifth, overthrows and
absorbs all others in its universal dominion. Babylon and Medo-Persia
alone had as yet risen, but soon GrÃ&brvbr;co-Macedonia was to succeed
(as [Zac 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#013) foretells.md), and Rome the
fourth and last, was to follow (Dan. 2:1-49; Dan. 7:1-28). The fact that
the repairing of the evils caused to Judah and Israel by all four
kingdoms is spoken of here, proves that the exhaustive fulfilment is yet
future, and only the earnest of it given in the overthrow of the two
world powers which up to Zechariah's time had "scattered" Judah ([Jer
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md); [Eze
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#010.md), [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012).md). That only two of the four had
as yet risen, is an argument having no weight with us, as we believe
God's Spirit in the prophets regards the future as present; we therefore
are not to be led by Rationalists who on such grounds deny the reference
here and in [Zac 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#001.md) to the four world
kingdoms.

[Zechariah 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">zac 1:19</span></span>

Judah, Israel--Though some of the ten tribes of Israel returned with
Judah from Babylon, the full return of the former, as of the latter, is
here foretold and must be yet future.

[Zechariah 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">zac 1:20</span></span>

four carpenters--or "artificers." The several instrumentalities
employed, or to be employed, in crushing the "Gentile" powers which
"scattered" Judah, are hereby referred to. For every one of the four
horns there was a cleaving "artificer" to beat it down. For every enemy
of God's people, God has provided a counteracting power adequate to
destroy it.

[Zechariah 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">zac 1:21</span></span>

These are the horns--rather, Those, namely, the horns being
distinguished from the "carpenters," or destroying workmen ("skilful to
destroy," [Exo 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#031).md), intended in the
"these" of the question.

no man . . . lift up his head--so depressed were they with a heavy
weight of evils ([Job 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015).md).

to fray--to strike terror into them ([Eze
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009).md).

lifted up . . . horn--in the haughtiness of conscious strength ([Psa
75:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#004).md) tyrannizing over Judah ([Eze
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#021).md).

The city shall be fully restored and enlarged ([Zac
2:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#002).md). Recall of the exiles ([Zac
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006).md). Jehovah will protect His
people and make their foes a spoil unto them ([Zac
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008).md). The nations shall be converted
to Jehovah, as the result of His dwelling manifestly amidst His people
([Zac 2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010).md).
