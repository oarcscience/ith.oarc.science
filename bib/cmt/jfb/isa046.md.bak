### [Isaiah Chapter 46](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 46:1</span></span>

BABYLON'S IDOLS COULD NOT SAVE THEMSELVES, MUCH LESS HER. BUT GOD CAN
AND WILL SAVE ISRAEL: CYRUS IS HIS INSTRUMENT. ([Isa
46:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md)

Bel--the same as the PhÅ“nician Baal, that is, lord, the chief god of
Babylon; to it was dedicated the celebrated tower of Babylon, in the
center of one of the two parts into which the city was divided, the
palace being in the center of the other. Identical with the sun,
worshipped on turrets, housetops, and other high places, so as to be
nearer the heavenly hosts (Saba) ([Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md); [Jer
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md). GESENIUS identifies Bel with the
planet Jupiter, which, with the planet Venus (under the name Astarte or
Astaroth), was worshipped in the East as the god of fortune, the most
propitious star to be born under (see on [Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md). According to the Apocryphal
book, Bel and the Dragon, Bel was cast down by Cyrus.

boweth . . . stoopeth--falleth prostrate ([Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md); [Sa1
5:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#003.md); [Psa
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#008).md).

Nebo--the planet Mercury or Hermes, in astrology. The scribe of heaven,
answering to the Egyptian Anubis. The extensive worship of it is shown
by the many proper names compounded of it: Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuzar-adan,
Nabonassar, &c.

were upon--that is, were a burden (supplied from the following clause)
upon. It was customary to transport the gods of the vanquished to the
land of the conquerors, who thought thereby the more effectually to keep
down the subject people ([Sa1 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#001.md),
&c.; [Jer 48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md); [Jer
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#003.md); [Dan
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#008).md).

carriages--in the Old English sense of the things carried, the images
borne by you: the lading ([Act 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015).md),
"carriages," not the vehicles, but the baggage. Or, the images which
used to be carried by you formerly in your solemn processions
\[MAURER\].

were heavy loaden--rather, are put as a load on the beasts of burden
\[MAURER\]. HORSLEY translates, "They who should have been your carriers
(as Jehovah is to His people, [Isa
46:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003).md) are become burdens" (see on
[Isa 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 46:2</span></span>

deliver--from the enemies' hands.

burden--their images laid on the beasts ([Isa
46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md).

themselves--the gods, here also distinguished from their images.

[Isaiah 46:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 46:3</span></span>

in contrast to what precedes: Babylon's idols, so far from bearing its
people safely are themselves borne off, a burden to the laden beast; but
Jehovah bears His people in safety even from the womb to old age ([Isa
63:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#009.md); [Deu
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md); [Psa
71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006.md), [Psa
71:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#018).md). God compares Himself to a
nurse tenderly carrying a child; contrast Moses' language ([Num
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 46:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 46:4</span></span>

old age--As "your"--"you"--"you," are not in the Hebrew, the sentiment
is more general than English Version, though of course it includes the
Jews from the infancy to the more advanced age of their history ([Isa
47:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#006).md).

I am he--that is the same ([Psa
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md); [Joh
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#024.md); [Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008).md).

I will bear . . . carry--Not only do I not need to be borne and carried
Myself, as the idols ([Isa 46:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 46:5</span></span>

([Isa 40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018.md), [Isa
40:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#025).md).

[Isaiah 46:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 46:6</span></span>

([Isa 40:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#019.md); [Isa
41:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#007)..md) They lavish gold out of their
purses and spare no expense for their idol. Their profuseness shames the
niggardliness of professors who worship God with what cost them nothing.
Sin is always a costly service.

[Isaiah 46:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 46:7</span></span>

cry . . . can . . . not . . . save-- ([Isa
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020.md), with which contrast [Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 46:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 46:8</span></span>

show yourselves men--Renounce the childishness of idolatry as shown in
what precedes ([Co1 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md); [Co1
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#013.md); [Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014).md). In order to be manly we must be
godly; for man was made "in the image of God," and only rises to his
true dignity when joined to God; virtue is derived from the Latin vir,
"a man."

bring . . . to mind--rather, "lay it to heart."

transgressors--addressed to the idolaters among the Jews.

[Isaiah 46:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 46:9</span></span>

former--namely, proofs of the sole Godship of Jehovah, from predictions
fulfilled, and interpositions of God in behalf of Israel ([Isa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 46:10</span></span>

([Isa 45:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#021.md); [Isa
41:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#022.md); [Isa
44:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#026).md).

yet--not in the Hebrew. Translate, "What had not been done" \[HORSLEY\].

do all my pleasure-- ([Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010.md); [Rom
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 46:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 46:11</span></span>

ravenous bird--Cyrus so called on account of the rapidity of his marches
from the distant regions of Persia to pounce on his prey (see on [Isa
41:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#002.md); [Isa
41:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#025.md); [Jer
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#022.md); [Eze
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#003).md). The standard of Cyrus, too, was
a golden eagle on a spear (see the heathen historian, XENOPHON, 7, where
almost the same word is used, aetos, as here, ayit).

executeth my counsel-- ([Isa 44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md);
[Isa 45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md). Babylon represents,
mystically, the apostate faction: the destruction of its idols
symbolizes the future general extirpation of all idolatry and unbelief.

purposed . . . also do it-- ([Isa
43:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 46:12</span></span>

stout-hearted--stubborn in resisting God ([Psa
76:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#005.md); [Act
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

far from righteousness-- ([Isa 59:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#009.md);
[Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 46:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 46:13</span></span>

near--antithetical to "far" ([Isa
46:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#012.md); [Isa
51:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#005.md); [Isa
56:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#001.md); [Isa
61:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md); [Rom
10:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006).md).

righteousness--answering to "salvation" in the parallel clause;
therefore it means here, "my righteous deliverance"; righteous, because
proving the truth of God's promises, and so contrived as to not
compromise, but vindicate, His righteousness ([Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Rom
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026).md).

Zion . . . my glory--rather, "I will give salvation in Zion; to Israel
(I will give) my glory" \[HORSLEY\]. ([Isa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#011.md); [Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007.md); [Luk
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032).md).
