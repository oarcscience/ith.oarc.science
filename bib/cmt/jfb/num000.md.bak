NUMBERS. This book is so called because it contains an account of the
enumeration and arrangement of the Israelites. The early part of it,
from the first through the tenth chapters, appears to be a supplement to
Leviticus, being occupied with relating the appointment of the Levites
to the sacred offices. The journal of the march through the wilderness
is then given as far as [Num 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020.md);
after which the early incidents of the invasion are narrated. One direct
quotation only from this book ([Num
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#005).md) is made in the New Testament
([Ti2 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019).md); but indirect references
to it by the later sacred writers are very numerous.
