### [Nahum Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

[Nahum](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_000">nah 0:0</span></span>

NAHUM means "consolation" and "vengeance"; symbolizing the "consolation"
in the book for God's people, and the "vengeance" coming on their
enemies. In the first chapter the two themes alternate; but as the
prophet advances, vengeance on the capital of the Assyrian foe is the
predominant topic. He is called "the Elkoshite" ([Nah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001)), from Elkosh, or Elkesi, a
village of Galilee, pointed out to JEROME \[Preface in Nahum\] as a
place of note among the Jews, having traces of ancient buildings. The
name Capernaum, that is, "village of Nahum," seems to take its name from
Nahum having resided in it, though born in Elkosh in the neighborhood.
There is another Elkosh east of the Tigris, and north of Mosul, believed
by Jewish pilgrims to be the birthplace and burial place of the prophet.
But the book of Nahum in its allusions shows a particularity of
acquaintance with Palestine ([Nah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004)), and only a more general
knowledge as to Nineveh ([Nah 2:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#004);
[Nah 3:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#002)).

His graphic description of Sennacherib and his army ([Nah
1:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009)) makes it not unlikely that he
was in or near Jerusalem at the time: hence the number of phrases
corresponding to those of Isaiah (compare [Nah
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008), with [Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008); [Isa
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023); [Nah
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010), with [Isa
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#001); [Isa
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#003); [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015), with [Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)). The prophecy in [Nah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014) probably refers to the murder of
Sennacherib twenty years after his return from Palestine ([Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)). The date of his prophecies,
thus, seems to be about the former years of Hezekiah. So JEROME thinks.
He plainly writes while the Assyrian power was yet unbroken ([Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012); [Nah
2:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#011) [Nah
3:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015)). The correspondence between
the sentiments of Nahum and those of Isaiah and Hezekiah, as recorded in
Second Kings and Isaiah, proves the likelihood of Nahum's prophecies
belonging to the time when Sennacherib was demanding the surrender of
Jerusalem, and had not yet raised the siege (compare [Nah
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002), &c., with [Kg2
19:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#014); [Nah
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007), with [Kg2
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#022); [Kg2
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#019), [Kg2
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#031); [Ch2
32:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#007); [Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009), [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011), with [Kg2
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022), [Kg2
19:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#027); [Nah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014), with [Kg2
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#006); [Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015); [Nah
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001), with [Kg2
19:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032); [Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013), with [Kg2
19:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#022)). The historical data in the
book itself are the humiliation of Israel and Judah by Assyria ([Nah
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#002)); the invasion of Judah ([Nah
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009), [Nah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#011)); and the conquest of No-ammon,
or Thebes, in Upper Egypt ([Nah
3:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008)). Tiglath-pileser and
Shalmaneser had carried away Israel. The Jews were harassed by the
Syrians, and impoverished by Ahaz' payments to Tiglath-pileser (2Ch.
28:1-27; [Isa 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009)). Sargon,
Shalmaneser's successor, after the reduction of PhÅ“nicia by the latter,
fearing lest Egypt should join Palestine against him, undertook an
expedition to Africa ([Isa 20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)),
and took Thebes; the latter fact we know only from Nahum, but the
success of the expedition in general is corroborated in [Isa
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001). Sennacherib, Sargon's
successor, made the last Assyrian attempt against Judea, ending in the
destruction of his army in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah (713-710
B.C.). As Nahum refers to this in part prophetically, in part as matter
of history ([Nah 1:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009); [Nah
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#013)), he must have lived about
720-714 B.C., that is, almost a hundred years before the event foretold,
namely, the overthrow of Nineveh by the joint forces of Cyaxares and
Nabopolassar in the reign of Chyniladanus, 625 or 603 B.C.

The prophecy is remarkable for its unity of aim. Nahum's object was to
inspire his countrymen, the Jews, with the assurance that, however
alarming their position might seem, exposed to the attacks of the mighty
Assyrian, who had already carried away the ten tribes, yet that not only
should the Assyrian (Sennacherib) fail in his attack on Jerusalem, but
Nineveh, his own capital, be taken and his empire overthrown; and this,
not by an arbitrary exercise of Jehovah's power, but for the iniquities
of the city and its people. His position in the canon is seventh of the
minor prophets in both the Hebrew and Greek arrangement. He is seventh
in point of date.

His style is clear, elegant, and forcible. Its most striking
characteristic is the power of representing several phases of an idea in
the briefest sentences, as in the majestic description of God in the
commencement, the conquest of Nineveh, and the destruction of No-ammon
\[EICHORN\]. DE WETTE calls attention to his variety of manner in
presenting ideas, as marking great poetic talent. "Here there is
something sonorous in his language there something murmuring; with both
these alternates something that is soft, delicate, and melting, as the
subject demands." Excepting two alleged Assyrian words ([Nah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#017)), English Version, "crowned," or
princes, and English Version, "captains," or satraps (used by [Jer
51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027)), the language is pure. These
two, doubtless, came to be known in Judea from the intercourse with
Assyria in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.
