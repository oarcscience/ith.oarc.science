### [Isaiah Chapter 65](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 65:1</span></span>

GOD'S REPLY IN JUSTIFICATION OF HIS DEALINGS WITH ISRAEL. (Isa. 65:1-25)

I am sought--Hebrew, "I have granted access unto Me to them," &c. (so
[Eze 14:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md), "Should I be inquired of";
[Eph 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#018).md).

found--[Rom 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020.md) renders this, "I was
made manifest." As an instance of the sentiment in the clause, "I am
sought," &c., see [Joh 12:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#021.md); of the
sentiment in this clause, [Act 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md).
Compare as to the Gentile converts, [Eph
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md).

Behold me-- ([Isa 45:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#022).md).

nation . . . not called by my name--that is, the Gentiles. God retorts
in their own words ([Isa 63:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#019).md) that
their plea as being exclusively "called by His name" will not avail, for
God's gospel invitation is not so exclusive ([Rom
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md); [Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 65:2</span></span>

spread out . . . hands--inviting them earnestly ([Pro
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024).md).

all . . . day--continually, late and early ([Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013).md).

rebellious people--Israel, whose rebellion was the occasion of God's
turning to the Gentiles ([Rom
11:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

way . . . not good--that is, the very reverse of good, very bad ([Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031).md).

[Isaiah 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 65:3</span></span>

continually--answering to "all the day" ([Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002).md). God was continually inviting
them, and they continually offending Him ([Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md).

to my face--They made no attempt to hide their sin ([Isa
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#009).md). Compare "before Me" ([Exo
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003).md).

in gardens--(See on [Isa 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029.md); [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017.md); [Lev
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#005).md).

altars of brick--Hebrew, "bricks." God had commanded His altars to be of
unhewn stone ([Exo 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#025).md). This was in
order to separate them, even in external respects, from idolaters; also,
as all chiselling was forbidden, they could not inscribe superstitious
symbols on them as the heathen did. Bricks were more easily so inscribed
than stone; hence their use for the cuneiform inscriptions at Babylon,
and also for idolatrous altars. Some, not so well, have supposed that
the "bricks" here mean the flat brick-paved roofs of houses on which
they sacrificed to the sun, &c. ([Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 65:4</span></span>

remain among . . . graves--namely, for purposes of necromancy, as if to
hold converse with the dead ([Isa
8:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#019.md); compare [Mar
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003).md); or, for the sake of
purifications, usually performed at night among sepulchres, to appease
the manes \[MAURER\].

monuments--Hebrew, "pass the night in hidden recesses," either the
idol's inmost shrines ("consecrated precincts") \[HORSLEY\], where they
used to sleep, in order to have divine communications in dreams
\[JEROME\]; or better, on account of the parallel "graves," sepulchral
caves \[MAURER\].

eat swine's flesh--To eat it at all was contrary to God's law ([Lev
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#007).md), but it much increased their
guilt that they ate it in idolatrous sacrifices (compare [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017)). VARRO (On Agriculture, 2.4.md)
says that swine were first used in sacrifices; the Latins sacrificed a
pig to Ceres; it was also offered on occasion of treaties and marriages.

broth--so called from the "pieces" (Margin) or fragments of bread over
which the broth was poured \[GESENIUS\]; such broth, made of swine's
flesh, offered in sacrifice, was thought to be especially acceptable to
the idol and was used in magic rites. Or, "fragments (pieces) of
abominable foods," &c. This fourth clause explains more fully the third,
as the second does the first \[MAURER\].

is in--rather, literally, "is their vessels," that is, constitute their
vessels' contents. The Jews, in our Lord's days, and ever since the
return from Babylon, have been free from idolatry; still the imagery
from idolatrous abominations, as being the sin most loathsome in God's
eyes and that most prevalent in Isaiah's time, is employed to describe
the foul sin of Israel in all ages, culminating in their killing
Messiah, and still rejecting Him.

[Isaiah 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 65:5</span></span>

([Mat 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#011.md); [Luk
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#030.md); [Luk
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011.md); [Jde
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#019).md). Applicable to the hypocritical
self-justifiers of our Lord's time.

smoke--alluding to the smoke of their self-righteous sacrifices; the
fire of God's wrath was kindled at the sight, and exhibited itself in
the smoke that breathed forth from His nostrils; in Hebrew the nose is
the seat of anger; and the nostrils distended in wrath, as it were,
breathe forth smoke \[ROSENMULLER\] ([Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 65:6</span></span>

written before me--"it is decreed by Me," namely, what follows ([Job
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#026).md), \[MAURER\]; or, their guilt is
recorded before Me (compare [Dan 7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md);
[Rev 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012.md); [Mal
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#016).md).

into . . . bosom-- ([Psa 79:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#012.md); [Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018.md); [Luk
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038).md). The Orientals used the loose
fold of the garment falling on "the bosom" or lap, as a receptacle for
carrying things. The sense thus is: I will repay their sin so abundantly
that the hand will not be able to receive it; it will need the spacious
fold on the bosom to contain it \[ROSENMULLER\]. Rather it is, "I will
repay it to the very person from whom it has emanated." Compare "God did
render the evil of the men of Shechem upon their heads" ([Jdg
9:57](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#057.md); [Psa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#016).md) \[GESENIUS\].

[Isaiah 65:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 65:7</span></span>

Their sin had been accumulating from age to age until God at last repaid
it in full.

mountains-- ([Isa 57:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#007.md); [Eze
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md); [Eze
20:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#027.md); [Hos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md).

their--"Your" had preceded. From speaking to, He speaks of them; this
implies growing alienation from them and greater distance.

work--the full recompense of their work (so [Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 65:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 65:8</span></span>

new wine--as if some grapes having good wine-producing juice in them, be
found in a cluster which the vinedresser was about to throw away as bad,
and one saith, &c.

blessing--that is, good wine-producing juice (compare [Jdg
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#013.md); [Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014).md).

so--God will spare the godly "remnant," while the ungodly mass of the
nation shall be destroyed ([Isa 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md);
[Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013.md); [Isa
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md); [Isa
11:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011).md).

my servants--the godly remnant. But HORSLEY, "for the sake of my
servant, Messiah."

[Isaiah 65:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 65:9</span></span>

seed--"the holy seed" ([Isa 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#013).md), a
posterity from Jacob, designed to repossess the Holy Land, forfeited by
the sin of the former Jews.

my mountains--Jerusalem and the rest of Judea, peculiarly God's (compare
[Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009.md); [Isa
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032).md).

it--the Holy Land.

elect-- ([Isa 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md), [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 65:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 65:10</span></span>

Sharon--(See on [Isa 33:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#009.md); [Isa
35:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002).md).

Achor--meaning "trouble"; a valley near Jericho, so called from the
trouble caused to Israel by Achan's sin ([Jos
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#024).md). "The valley of Achor,"
proverbial for whatever caused calamity, shall become proverbial joy and
prosperity ([Hos 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015).md).

[Isaiah 65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 65:11</span></span>

holy mountain--Moriah, on which the temple was.

troop--rather "Gad," the Babylonian god of fortune, the planet Jupiter,
answering to Baal or Bel; the Arabs called it "the Greater Good
Fortune"; and the planet Venus answering to Meni, "the Lesser Good
Fortune" \[GESENIUS, KIMCHI, &c.\]. Tables were laid out for their idols
with all kinds of viands, and a cup containing a mixture of wine and
honey, in Egypt especially, on the last day of the year \[JEROME\].

drink offering--rather, "mixed drink."

number--rather, "Meni"; as goddess of fortune she was thought to number
the fates of men. VITRINGA understands Gad to be the sun; Meni the moon,
or Ashtaroth or Astarte ([Kg1 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033).md).

[Isaiah 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 65:12</span></span>

number--"doom" you. Alluding to the "number," as Meni ([Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011).md) means. Retribution in kind, the
punishment answering to the sin (compare [Ch2
36:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014).md).

I called, ye . . . not answer--"I called," though "none had called" upon
Me ([Isa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007).md); yet even then none
"answered" ([Pro 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#024).md). Contrast with
this God and His people's mutual fellowship in prayer ([Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024).md).

[Isaiah 65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 65:13</span></span>

eat--enjoy all blessings from me ([Sol
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#001).md).

hungry-- ([Amo 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#006.md); [Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011).md). This may refer to the siege of
Jerusalem under Titus, when 1,100,000 are said to have perished by
famine; thus [Isa 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md) will refer to
God's people without distinction of Jew and Gentile receiving "another
name," namely, that of Christians \[HOUBIGANT\]. A further fulfilment
may still remain, just before the creation of the "new heavens and
earth," as the context, [Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md),
implies.

[Isaiah 65:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 65:14</span></span>

howl-- ([Isa 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#002.md); [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 65:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 65:15</span></span>

curse--The name of "Jew" has been for long a formula of execration
(compare [Jer 29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022).md); if one wishes to
curse another, he can utter nothing worse than this, "God make thee what
the Jew is!" Contrast the formula ([Gen
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020).md) \[MAURER\].

my chosen--the elect Church, gathered from Jews and Gentiles, called by
"another name," Christians ([Act
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026).md). However (see on [Isa
65:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013).md), as "My chosen," or "elect," in
[Isa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003.md), refers to the "seed of
Jacob," the believing Jews, hereafter about to possess their land ([Isa
65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019.md), [Isa
65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022).md), are ultimately meant by "My
chosen," as contrasted with the unbelieving Jews ("ye"). These elect
Jews shall be called by "another," or a new name, that is, shall no
longer be "forsaken" of God for unbelief, but shall be His "delight" and
"married" to Him ([Isa 62:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#002.md), [Isa
62:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#004).md).

thee--unbelieving Israel. Isaiah here speaks of God, whereas in the
preceding sentences God Himself spake. This change of persons marks
without design how completely the prophet realized God with him and in
him, so that he passes, without formally announcing it, from God's words
to his own, and vice versa, both alike being from God.

[Isaiah 65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 65:16</span></span>

That he--rather, "he who," &c.

blesseth, &c.-- ([Psa 72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md); [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md).

God of truth--very God, as opposed to false gods; Hebrew, Amen: the very
name of Messiah ([Co2 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md); [Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014).md), faithful to His promises ([Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md); [Joh
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#032).md). Real, substantial, spiritual,
eternal, as opposed to the shadowy types of the law.

sweareth, &c.--God alone shall be appealed to as God ([Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018.md); [Deu
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md); [Psa
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011).md).

troubles--that is, sins, provocations \[LOWTH\]. Rather, calamities
caused by your sins; so far from these visiting you again, the very
remembrance of them is "hid from Mine eyes" by the magnitude of the
blessings I will confer on you ([Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017), &c..md). \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 65:17</span></span>

As Caleb inherited the same land which his feet trod on ([Deu
1:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#036.md); [Jos
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#009).md), so Messiah and His saints shall
inherit the renovated earth which once they trod while defiled by the
enemy ([Isa 34:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#004.md); [Isa
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#016.md); [Isa
66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md); [Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027.md); [Psa
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md); [Psa
37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); [Heb
12:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md) [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md).

not be remembered--See on [Isa 65:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#016.md),
note on "troubles"; the words here answer to "the former . . .
forgotten," &c. The former sorrows of the earth, under the fall, shall
be so far from recurring, that their very remembrance shall be
obliterated by the many mercies I will bestow on the new earth (Rev.
21:4-27).

[Isaiah 65:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 65:18</span></span>

rejoice for ever . . . Jerusalem-- ([Isa
51:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#011).md). "Everlasting joy . . . Zion."
Spiritually ([Th1 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 65:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 65:19</span></span>

([Isa 62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005).md).

weeping . . . no more-- ([Isa 25:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007.md);
[Isa 35:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010.md); [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017.md); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004).md), primarily, foretold of
Jerusalem; secondarily, of all the redeemed.

[Isaiah 65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 65:20</span></span>

The longevity of men in the first age of the world shall be enjoyed
again.

thence--from that time forward.

infant of days--that is, an infant who shall only complete a few days;
short-lived.

filled . . . days--None shall die without attaining a full old age.

child . . . die . . . hundred years--that is "he that dieth an hundred
years old shall die a mere child" \[LOWTH\].

sinner . . . hundred . . . be accursed--"The sinner that dieth at an
hundred years shall be deemed accursed," that is, his death at so early
an age, which in those days the hundredth year will be regarded, just as
if it were mere childhood, shall be deemed the effect of God's special
visitation in wrath \[ROSENMULLER\]. This passage proves that the better
age to come on earth, though much superior to the present will not be a
perfect state; sin and death shall have place in it (compare [Rev
20:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007).md), but much less frequently than
now.

[Isaiah 65:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 65:21</span></span>

(See on [Isa 62:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#008.md); [Amo
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 65:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 65:22</span></span>

They shall not experience the curse pronounced ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md); [Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030).md).

tree--among the most long-lived of objects in nature. They shall live as
long as the trees they "plant" (compare [Isa
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md), end of verse; [Psa
92:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#012).md).

enjoy--Hebrew, "consume," "wear out"; they shall live to enjoy the last
of it ([Isa 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 65:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">isa 65:23</span></span>

bring forth for trouble--literally, "for terror," that is, "They shall
not bring forth children for a sudden death" ([Lev
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md); [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).md).

seed . . . blessed-- ([Isa 61:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#009).md).

offspring with them-- ([Hos 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012).md).
"Their offspring shall be with themselves" \[MAURER\]; not "brought
forth" only to be cut off by "sudden death" (see the parallel clause).

Contrast [Isa 64:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#007.md), "none . . .
calleth," &c.; and see on [Isa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012.md),
"I called, ye did not answer." MAURER translates, "They shall hardly
(literally, "not yet") call, when (literally, "and") I will answer; they
shall be still speaking, when I will hear" ([Psa
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005.md); [Dan
9:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 65:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 65:25</span></span>

(See on [Isa 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006).md).

and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock--(See on [Isa
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#007).md).

and dust--rather, "but dust," &c. The curse shall remain on the serpent
\[HORSLEY\], ([Gen 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014.md); [Mic
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#017).md). "To lick the dust" is
figurative of the utter and perpetual degradation of Satan and his
emissaries ([Isa 49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md); [Psa
72:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#009).md). Satan fell self-tempted;
therefore no atonement was contrived for him, as there was for man, who
fell by his temptation ([Jde 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006.md); [Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044).md). From his peculiar connection
with the earth and man, it has been conjectured that the exciting cause
of his rebellion was God's declaration that human nature was to be
raised into union with the Godhead; this was "the truth" concerning the
person of the Son of God which "he abode not in"; it galled his pride
that a lower race was to be raised to that which he had aspired to ([Ti1
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006).md). How exultingly he might say,
when man fell through him, "God would raise manhood into union with
Himself; I have brought it down below the beasts by sin!" At that very
moment and spot he was told that the seed of the abhorred race, man,
should bruise his head ([Jo1 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008).md). He
was raised up for this, to show forth God's glory ([Exo
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016.md); [Rom
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017).md). In his unfallen state he may
have been God's vicegerent over the earth and the animal kingdom before
man: this will account for his assuming the form of a serpent ([Gen
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#001).md). Man succeeded to that office
([Gen 2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019).md), but forfeited it by
sin, whence Satan became "prince of this world"; Jesus Christ supplants
the usurper, and as "Son of man" regains the lost inheritance ([Psa
8:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#004).md). The steps in Satan's overthrow
are these: he is cast out, first, from heaven ([Rev
12:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#007).md) on earth; next, he is bound a
thousand years ([Rev 20:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#002).md); finally,
he is cast into the lake of fire for ever ([Rev
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md).

the serpent's meat--(See on [Isa
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#008).md).

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain--(See on [Isa
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#009).md).

This closing chapter is the summary of Isaiah's prophecies as to the
last days, hence the similarity of its sentiments with what went before.
