### [1 John Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)

[1 John 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jo1 1:1</span></span>

THE WRITER'S AUTHORITY AS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE GOSPEL FACTS, HAVING
SEEN, HEARD, AND HANDLED HIM WHO WAS FROM THE BEGINNING: HIS OBJECT IN
WRITING: HIS MESSAGE. IF WE WOULD HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM, WE MUST WALK
IN LIGHT, AS HE IS LIGHT. ([Jo1
1:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001))

Instead of a formal, John adopts a virtual address (compare [Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)). To wish joy to the reader was
the ancient customary address. The sentence begun in [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001) is broken off by the parenthetic
[Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), and is resumed at [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003) with the repetition of some words
from [Jo1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001).

That which was--not "began to be," but was essentially (Greek, "een,"
not "egeneto") before He was manifested ([Jo1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)); answering to "Him that is from
the beginning" ([Jo1 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#013)); so John's
Gospel, [Joh 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001), "In the beginning
was the Word." [Pro 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#023), "I was set
up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was."

we--apostles.

heard . . . seen . . . looked upon . . . handled--a series rising in
gradation. Seeing is a more convincing proof than hearing of; handling,
than even seeing. "Have heard . . . have seen" (perfect tenses), as a
possession still abiding with us; but in Greek (not as English Version
"have," but simply) "looked upon" (not perfect tense, as of a continuing
thing, but aorist, past time) while Christ the incarnate Word was still
with us. "Seen," namely, His glory, as revealed in the Transfiguration
and in His miracles; and His passion and death in a real body of flesh
and blood. "Looked upon" as a wondrous spectacle steadfastly, deeply,
contemplatively; so the Greek. Appropriate to John's contemplative
character.

hands . . . handled--Thomas and the other disciples on distinct
occasions after the resurrection. John himself had leaned on Jesus'
breast at the last supper. Contrast the wisest of the heathen feeling
after (the same Greek as here; groping after WITH THE HANDS") if haply
they might find God (see [Act 17:27](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#027)).
This proves against Socinians he is here speaking of the personal
incarnate Word, not of Christ's teaching from the beginning of His
official life.

of--"concerning"; following "heard." "Heard" is the verb most applying
to the purpose of the Epistle, namely the truth which John had heard
concerning the Word of life, that is, (Christ) the Word who is the life.
"Heard," namely, from Christ Himself, including all Christ's teachings
about Himself. Therefore he puts "of," or "concerning," before "the word
of life," which is inapplicable to any of the verbs except "heard"; also
"heard" is the only one of the verbs which he resumes at [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005).

[1 John 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jo1 1:2</span></span>

the life--Jesus, "the Word of life."

was manifested--who had previously been "with the Father."

show--Translate as in [Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003),
"declare" (compare [Jo1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)). Declare
is the general term; write is the particular ([Jo1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)).

that eternal life--Greek, "the life which is eternal." As the Epistle
begins, so it ends with "eternal life," which we shall ever enjoy with,
and in, Him who is "the life eternal."

which--Greek, "the which." the before-mentioned ([Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)) life which was with the Father
"from the beginning" (compare [Joh
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)). This proves the distinctness of
the First and Second Persons in the one Godhead.

[1 John 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jo1 1:3</span></span>

That which we have seen and heard--resumed from [Jo1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001), wherein the sentence, being
interrupted by [Jo1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002), parenthesis,
was left incomplete.

declare we unto you--Oldest manuscripts add also; unto you also who have
not seen or heard Him.

that ye also may have fellowship with us--that ye also who have not
seen, may have the fellowship with us which we who have seen enjoy; what
that fellowship consists in he proceeds to state, "Our fellowship is
with the Father and with His Son." Faith realizes what we have not seen
as spiritually visible; not till by faith we too have seen, do we know
all the excellency of the true Solomon. He Himself is ours; He in us and
we in Him. We are "partakers of the divine nature." We know God only by
having fellowship with Him; He may thus be known, but not comprehended.
The repetition of "with" before the "Son," distinguishes the persons,
while the fellowship or communion with both Father and Son, implies
their unity. It is not added "and with the Holy Ghost"; for it is by the
Holy Ghost or Spirit of the Father and Son in us, that we are enabled to
have fellowship with the Father and Son (compare [Jo1
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#024)). Believers enjoy the fellowship
OF, but not WITH, the Holy Ghost. "Through Christ God closes up the
chasm that separated Him from the human race, and imparts Himself to
them in the communion of the divine life" \[NEANDER\].

[1 John 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jo1 1:4</span></span>

these things--and none other, namely, this whole Epistle.

write we unto you--Some oldest manuscripts omit "unto you," and
emphasize "we." Thus the antithesis is between "we" (apostles and
eye-witnesses) and "your." We write thus that your joy may be full.
Other oldest manuscripts and versions read "OUR joy," namely, that our
joy may be filled full by bringing you also into fellowship with the
Father and Son. (Compare [Joh 4:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#036),
end; [Phi 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#002), "Fulfil ye my joy,"
[Phi 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016); [Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001); [Jo2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#008)). It is possible that "your" may
be a correction of transcribers to make this verse harmonize with [Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011); [Joh
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#024); however, as John often repeats
favorite phrases, he may do so here, so "your" may be from himself. So
[Jo2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#012), "your" in oldest
manuscripts. The authority of manuscripts and versions on both sides
here is almost evenly balanced. Christ Himself is the source, object,
and center of His people's joy (compare [Jo1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003), end); it is in fellowship with
Him that we have joy, the fruit of faith.

[1 John 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jo1 1:5</span></span>

First division of the body of the Epistle (compare Introduction).

declare--Greek, "announce"; report in turn; a different Greek word from
[Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003). As the Son announced the
message heard from the Father as His apostle, so the Son's apostles
announce what they have heard from the Son. John nowhere uses the term
"Gospel"; but the witness or testimony, the word, the truth, and here
the message.

God is light--What light is in the natural world, that God, the source
of even material light, is in the spiritual, the fountain of wisdom,
purity, beauty, joy, and glory. As all material life and growth depends
on light, so all spiritual life and growth depends on GOD. As God here,
so Christ, in [Jo1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008), is called "the
true light."

no darkness at all--strong negation; Greek, "No, not even one speck of
darkness"; no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death. John
heard this from Christ, not only in express words, but in His acted
words, namely, His is whole manifestation in the flesh as "the
brightness of the Father's glory." Christ Himself was the embodiment of
"the message," representing fully in all His sayings, doings, and
sufferings, Him who is LIGHT.

[1 John 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jo1 1:6</span></span>

say--profess.

have fellowship with him-- ([Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)).
The essence of the Christian life.

walk--in inward and outward action, whithersoever we turn ourselves
\[BENGEL\].

in darkness--Greek, "in the darkness"; opposed to "the light" (compare
[Jo1 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008), [Jo1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#011)).

lie-- ([Jo1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004)).

do not--in practice, whatever we say.

the truth-- ([Eph 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#021); [Joh
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#021)).

[1 John 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jo1 1:7</span></span>

Compare [Eph 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008), [Eph
5:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011). "WE WALK"; "God is
(essentially in His very nature as 'the light,' [Jo1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005)) in the light." WALKING in the
light, the element in which God Himself is, constitutes the test of
fellowship with Him. Christ, like us, walked in the light ([Jo1
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#006)). ALFORD notices, Walking in the
light as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God, but an
identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential
element of God's eternal being.

we have fellowship one with another--and of course with God (to be
understood from [Jo1 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006)). Without
having fellowship with God there can be no true and Christian fellowship
one with another (compare [Jo1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#003)).

and--as the result of "walking in the light, as He is in the light."

the blood of Jesus . . . cleanseth us from all sin--daily contracted
through the sinful weakness of the flesh, and the power of Satan and the
world. He is speaking not of justification through His blood once for
all, but of the present sanctification ("cleanseth" is present tense)
which the believer, walking in the light and having fellowship with God
and the saints, enjoys as His privilege. Compare [Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010), Greek, "He that has been
bathed, needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit."
Compare [Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009), "cleanse us from all
unrighteousness," a further step besides "forgiving us our sins."
Christ's blood is the cleansing mean, whereby gradually, being already
justified and in fellowship with God, we become clean from all sin which
would mar our fellowship with God. Faith applies the cleansing,
purifying blood. Some oldest manuscripts omit "Christ"; others retain
it.

[1 John 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jo1 1:8</span></span>

The confession of sins is a necessary consequence of "walking in the
light" ([Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)). "If thou shalt
confess thyself a sinner, the truth is in thee; for the truth is itself
light. Not yet has thy life become perfectly light, as sins are still in
thee, but yet thou hast already begun to be illuminated, because there
is in thee confession of sins" \[AUGUSTINE\].

that we have no sin--"HAVE," not "have had," must refer not to the past
sinful life while unconverted, but to the present state wherein
believers have sin even still. Observe, "sin" is in the singular;
"(confess our) sins" ([Jo1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009)) in the
plural. Sin refers to the corruption of the old man still present in us,
and the stain created by the actual sins flowing from that old nature in
us. To confess our need of cleansing from present sin is essential to
"walking in the light"; so far is the presence of some sin incompatible
with our in the main "walking in light." But the believer hates,
confesses, and longs to be delivered from all sin, which is darkness.
"They who defend their sins, will see in the great day whether their
sins can defend them."

deceive ourselves--We cannot deceive God; we only make ourselves to err
from the right path.

the truth-- ([Jo1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004)). True faith.
"The truth respecting God's holiness and our sinfulness, which is the
very first spark of light in us, has no place in us" \[ALFORD\].

[1 John 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jo1 1:9</span></span>

confess--with the lips, speaking from a contrite heart; involving also
confession to our fellow men of offenses committed against them.

he--God.

faithful--to His own promises; "true" to His word.

just--Not merely the mercy, but the justice or righteousness of God is
set forth in the redemption of the penitent believer in Christ. God's
promises of mercy, to which He is faithful, are in accordance with His
justice.

to--Greek, "in order that." His forgiving us our sins and cleansing us,
&c., is in furtherance of the ends of His eternal faithfulness and
justice.

forgive--remitting the guilt.

cleanse--purify from all filthiness, so that henceforth we more and more
become free from the presence of sin through the Spirit of
sanctification (compare [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014); and
above, see on [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007)).

unrighteousness--offensive to Him who "is just" or righteous; called
"sin," [Jo1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007), because "sin is the
transgression of the law," and the law is the expression of God's
righteousness, so that sin is unrighteousness.

[1 John 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jo1 1:10</span></span>

Parallel to [Jo1 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008).

we have not sinned--referring to the commission of actual sins, even
after regeneration and conversion; whereas in [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008), "we have no sin," refers to the
present GUILT remaining (until cleansed) from the actual sins committed,
and to the SIN of our corrupt old nature still adhering to us. The
perfect "have . . . sinned" brings down the commission of sins to the
present time, not merely sins committed before, but since, conversion.

we make him a liar--a gradation; [Jo1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#006), "we lie"; [Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008), "we deceive ourselves"; worst of
all, "we make Him a liar," by denying His word that all men are sinners
(compare [Jo1 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010)).

his word is not in us--"His word," which is "the truth" ([Jo1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#008)), accuses us truly; by denying it
we drive it from our hearts (compare [Joh
5:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#038)). Our rejection of "His word" in
respect to our being sinners, implies as the consequence our rejection
of His word and will revealed in the law and Gospel as a whole; for
these throughout rest on the fact that we have sinned, and have sin.
