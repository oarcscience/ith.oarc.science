### [Psalms Chapter 37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 37:1</span></span>

A composed and uniform trust in God and a constant course of integrity
are urged in view of the blessedness of the truly pious, contrasted in
various aspects with the final ruin of the wicked. Thus the wisdom and
justice of God's providence are vindicated, and its seeming
inequalities, which excite the cavils of the wicked and the distrust of
the pious, are explained. David's personal history abundantly
illustrates the Psalm. (Psa. 37:1-40)

The general sentiment of the whole Psalm is expressed. The righteous
need not be vexed by the prosperity of the wicked; for it is transient,
and their destiny undesirable.

[Psalms 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 37:3</span></span>

Trust--sure of safety.

shalt thou dwell--or, "dwell thou"; repose quietly.

verily . . . fed--or, "feed on truth," God's promise ([Psa
36:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#005.md); compare [Hos
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 37:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 37:4</span></span>

desires-- ([Psa 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#005.md); [Psa
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#002).md), what is lawful and right,
really good ([Psa 84:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 37:5</span></span>

Commit thy way-- ([Pro 16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003).md).
Works--what you have to do and cannot set forth as a burden.

trust . . . in him--literally, "on Him." He will do what you cannot
(compare [Psa 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008.md); [Psa
31:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#006).md). He will not suffer your
character to remain under suspicion.

[Psalms 37:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 37:7</span></span>

Rest in--literally, "Be silent to the Lord."

and wait--Be submissive--avoid petulance and murmurings, anger and rash
doing.

[Psalms 37:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 37:9</span></span>

Two reasons: The prosperity of the wicked is short; and the pious, by
humble trust, will secure all covenant blessing, denoted here by
"inherit the earth" (compare [Psa
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#013).md).

[Psalms 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 37:10</span></span>

shall not be--literally, "is not"--is not to be found.

[Psalms 37:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 37:11</span></span>

peace--includes prosperity.

[Psalms 37:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 37:12</span></span>

gnasheth . . . teeth--in beastly rage.

[Psalms 37:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 37:13</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#004).md).

seeth--knows certainly.

his day--of punishment, long delayed, shall yet come ([Heb
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037).md).

[Psalms 37:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 37:14</span></span>

sword, and . . . bow--for any instruments of violence.

slay--literally, "slaughter" ([Sa1
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#011).md).

poor and needy--God's people ([Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017.md); [Psa
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005).md). The punishment of the wicked as
drawn on themselves--often mentioned (compare [Psa
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md); [Psa
35:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 37:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 37:16</span></span>

riches--literally, "noise and tumult," as incidental to much wealth
(compare [Psa 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006).md). Thus the contrast
with the "little" of one man is more vivid.

[Psalms 37:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 37:17</span></span>

Even the members of the body needed to hold weapons are destroyed.

[Psalms 37:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 37:18</span></span>

God, who knows His people's changes, provides against evil and supplies
all their need.

[Psalms 37:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 37:20</span></span>

While the wicked, however mighty, are destroyed, and that utterly, as
smoke which vanishes and leaves no trace.

[Psalms 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 37:21</span></span>

payeth not--not able; having grown poor (compare [Deu
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#007).md). Ability of the one and
inability of the other do not exclude moral dispositions. God's blessing
or cursing makes the difference.

[Psalms 37:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 37:22</span></span>

cut off--opposed to "inherit the earth" (compare [Lev
7:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#020).md).

[Psalms 37:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 37:23</span></span>

steps--way, or, "course of life"; as ordered by God, failures will not
be permanent.

[Psalms 37:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 37:26</span></span>

his seed is blessed--literally, "for a blessing" ([Gen
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002.md); [Psa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#006).md). This position is still true as
the rule of God's economy ([Ti1 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md);
[Ti1 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 37:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 37:27</span></span>

The exhortation is sustained by the assurance of God's essential
rectitude in that providential government which provides perpetual
blessings for the good, and perpetual misery for the wicked.

[Psalms 37:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 37:30</span></span>

The righteous described as to the elements of character, thought, word,
and action.

[Psalms 37:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 37:31</span></span>

steps--or, "goings"--for conduct which is unwavering ([Psa
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036).md).

[Psalms 37:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">psa 37:32</span></span>

The devices of the wicked against the good fail because God acquits
them.

[Psalms 37:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">psa 37:34</span></span>

On the contrary, the good are not only blessed, but made to see the ruin
of their foes.

[Psalms 37:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 37:35</span></span>

of which a picture is given, under the figure of a flourishing tree
(compare Margin), which soon withers.

[Psalms 37:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 37:36</span></span>

he was not--(Compare [Psa 37:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 37:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 37:37</span></span>

By "the end" is meant reward ([Pro
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md); [Pro
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#014).md), or expectation of success, as
in [Psa 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038.md), which describes the end
of the wicked in contrast, and that is cut off (compare [Psa
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017).md).

[Psalms 37:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 37:38</span></span>

together--at once; entirely ([Psa
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 37:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 37:39</span></span>

strength-- ([Psa 27:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001.md); [Psa
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008).md).

trouble--straits ([Psa 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#009.md); [Psa
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001).md). In trust and quietness is the
salvation of the pious from all foes and all their devices.
