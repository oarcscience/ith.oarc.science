### [Deuteronomy Chapter 34](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 34:1</span></span>

MOSES FROM MOUNT NEBO VIEWS THE LAND. ([Deu
34:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001).md)

Moses went up from the plains of Moab--This chapter appears from
internal evidence to have been written subsequently to the death of
Moses, and it probably formed, at one time, an introduction to the Book
of Joshua.

unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah--literally, the head or
summit of the Pisgah; that is, the height (compare [Num
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014.md); [Deu
3:17-27](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017.md); [Deu
4:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049).md). The general name given to the
whole mountain range east of Jordan, was Abarim (compare [Deu
32:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#049).md), and the peak to which Moses
ascended was dedicated to the heathen Nebo, as Balaam's standing place
had been consecrated to Peor. Some modern travellers have fixed on Jebel
Attarus, a high mountain south of the Jabbok (Zurka), as the Nebo of
this passage \[BURCKHARDT, SEETZEN, &c.\]. But it is situated too far
north for a height which, being described as "over against Jericho,"
must be looked for above the last stage of the Jordan.

the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead--That pastoral region was
discernible at the northern extremity of the mountain line on which he
stood, till it ended, far beyond his sight in Dan. Westward, there were
on the horizon, the distant hills of "all Naphtali." Coming nearer, was
"the land of Ephraim and Manasseh." Immediately opposite was "all the
land of Judah," a title at first restricted to the portion of this
tribe, beyond which were "the utmost sea" (the Mediterranean) and the
Desert of the "South." These were the four great marks of the future
inheritance of his people, on which the narrative fixes our attention.
Immediately below him was "the circle" of the plain of Jericho, with its
oasis of palm trees; and far away on his left, the last inhabited spot
before the great desert "Zoar." The foreground of the picture alone was
clearly discernible. There was no miraculous power of vision imparted to
Moses. That he should see all that is described is what any man could
do, if he attained sufficient elevation. The atmosphere of the climate
is so subtle and free from vapor that the sight is carried to a distance
of which the beholder, who judges from the more dense air of Europe, can
form no idea \[VERE MONRO\]. But between him and that "good land," the
deep valley of the Jordan intervened; "he was not to go over thither."

[Deuteronomy 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">deu 34:5</span></span>

Moses . . . died--After having governed the Israelites forty years.

[Deuteronomy 34:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 34:6</span></span>

he buried him--or, "he was buried in a valley," that is, a ravine or
gorge of the Pisgah. Some think that he entered a cave and there died,
being, according to an ancient tradition of Jews and Christians, buried
by angels ([Jde 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#009.md); [Num
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020).md).

no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day--This concealment seems to
have been owing to a special and wise arrangement of Providence, to
prevent its being ranked among "holy places," and made the resort of
superstitious pilgrims or idolatrous veneration, in after ages.

[Deuteronomy 34:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">deu 34:8</span></span>

wept for Moses . . . thirty days--Seven days was the usual period of
mourning, but for persons in high rank or official eminence, it was
extended to thirty ([Gen 50:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#003.md); [Num
20:29](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#029).md).

[Deuteronomy 34:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 34:9</span></span>

Joshua . . . was full of the spirit of wisdom--He was appointed to a
peculiar and extraordinary office. He was not the successor of Moses,
for he was not a prophet or civil ruler, but the general or leader,
called to head the people in the war of invasion and the subsequent
allocation of the tribes.

[Deuteronomy 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">deu 34:10</span></span>

there arose not a prophet since--In whatever light we view this
extraordinary man, the eulogy pronounced in these inspired words will
appear just. No Hebrew prophet or ruler equalled him in character or
official dignity, or in knowledge of God's will and opportunities of
announcing it.
