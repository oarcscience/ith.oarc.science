### [Ezekiel Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 18:2</span></span>

THE PARABLE OF THE SOUR GRAPES REPROVED. (Eze. 18:1-32)

fathers . . . eaten sour grapes, . . . children's teeth . . . set on
edge--Their unbelieving calumnies on God's justice had become so common
as to have assumed a proverbial form. The sin of Adam in eating the
forbidden fruit, visited on his posterity, seems to have suggested the
peculiar form; noticed also by Jeremiah ([Jer
31:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#029).md); and explained in [Lam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md), "Our fathers have sinned, and are
not; and we have borne their iniquities." They mean by "the children,"
themselves, as though they were innocent, whereas they were far from
being so. The partial reformation effected since Manasseh's wicked
reign, especially among the exiles at Chebar, was their ground for
thinking so; but the improvement was only superficial and only fostered
their self-righteous spirit, which sought anywhere but in themselves the
cause of their calamities; just as the modern Jews attribute their
present dispersion, not to their own sins, but to those of their
forefathers. It is a universal mark of corrupt nature to lay the blame,
which belongs to ourselves, on others and to arraign the justice of God.
Compare [Gen 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#012.md), where Adam
transfers the blame of his sin to Eve, and even to God, "The woman whom
thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."

[Ezekiel 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 18:3</span></span>

ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb--because I will
let it be seen by the whole world in the very fact that you are not
righteous, as ye fancy yourselves, but wicked, and that you suffer only
the just penalty of your guilt; while the elect righteous remnant alone
escapes.

[Ezekiel 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 18:4</span></span>

all souls are mine--Therefore I can deal with all, being My own
creation, as I please ([Jer 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#006).md). As
the Creator of all alike I can have no reason, but the principle of
equity, according to men's works, to make any difference, so as to
punish some, and to save others ([Gen
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#025).md). "The soul that sinneth it
shall die." The curse descending from father to son assumes guilt shared
in by the son; there is a natural tendency in the child to follow the
sin of his father, and so he shares in the father's punishment: hence
the principles of God's government, involved in [Exo
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md) and [Jer
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md), are justified. The sons,
therefore (as the Jews here), cannot complain of being unjustly
afflicted by God ([Lam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007).md); for they
filled up the guilt of their fathers ([Mat
23:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#032.md), [Mat
23:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#034).md). The same God who
"recompenses the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their
children," is immediately after set forth as "giving to every man
according to his ways" ([Jer 32:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018).md)
which "visited the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation" (where the explanation is added, "of them
that hate me," that is, the children hating God, as well as their
fathers: the former being too likely to follow their parents, sin going
down with cumulative force from parent to child), we find ([Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016).md), "the fathers shall not be put
to death for the children, neither the children for the fathers: every
man shall be put to death for his own sin." The inherited guilt of sin
in infants ([Rom 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014).md) is an awful
fact, but one met by the atonement of Christ; but it is of adults that
he speaks here. Whatever penalties fall on communities for connection
with sins of their fathers, individual adults who repent shall escape
([Kg2 23:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#025).md). This was no new
thing, as some misinterpret the passage here; it had been always God's
principle to punish only the guilty, and not also the innocent, for the
sins of their fathers. God does not here change the principle of His
administration, but is merely about to manifest it so personally to each
that the Jews should no longer throw on God and on their fathers the
blame which was their own.

soul that sinneth, it shall die--and it alone ([Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023).md); not also the innocent.

[Ezekiel 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 18:5</span></span>

Here begins the illustration of God's impartiality in a series of
supposed cases. The first case is given in [Eze
18:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md), the just man. The excellencies
are selected in reference to the prevailing sins of the age, from which
such a one stood aloof; hence arises the omission of some features of
righteousness, which, under different circumstances, would have been
desirable to be enumerated. Each age has its own besetting temptations,
and the just man will be distinguished by his guarding against the
peculiar defilements, inward and outward, of his age.

just . . . lawful . . . right--the duties of the second table of the
law, which flow from the fear of God. Piety is the root of all charity;
to render to each his own, as well to our neighbor, as to God.

[Ezekiel 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 18:6</span></span>

not eaten upon . . . mountains--the high places, where altars were
reared. A double sin: sacrificing elsewhere than at the temple, where
only God sanctioned sacrifice ([Deu
12:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#013).md); and this to idols instead
of to Jehovah. "Eaten" refers to the feasts which were connected with
the sacrifices (see [Exo 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md); [Deu
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#038.md); [Jdg
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#027.md); [Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004.md), [Co1
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#010.md); [Co1
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#007).md).

lifted . . . eyes to--namely, in adoration ([Psa
121:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#001).md). The superstitious are compared
to harlots; their eyes go eagerly after spiritual lusts. The righteous
man not merely refrains from the act, but from the glance of spiritual
lust ([Job 31:1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001.md); [Mat
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028).md).

idols of . . . Israel--not merely those of the Gentiles, but even those
of Israel. The fashions of his countrymen could not lead him astray.

defiled . . . neighbour's wife--Not only does he shrink from spiritual,
but also from carnal, adultery (compare [Co1
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018).md).

neither . . . menstruous woman--Leprosy and elephantiasis were said to
be the fruit of such a connection \[JEROME\]. Chastity is to be observed
even towards one's own wife ([Lev
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#019.md); [Lev
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 18:7</span></span>

restored . . . pledge--that which the poor debtor absolutely needed; as
his raiment, which the creditor was bound to restore before sunset ([Exo
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#026).md), and his millstone, which
was needed for preparing his food ([Deu
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#006.md), [Deu
24:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#010).md).

bread to . . . hungry . . . covered . . . naked-- ([Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md); [Mat
25:35-36](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035).md). After duties of justice
come those of benevolence. It is not enough to refrain from doing a
wrong to our neighbor, we must also do him good. The bread owned by a
man, though "his," is given to him, not to keep to himself, but to
impart to the needy.

[Ezekiel 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 18:8</span></span>

usury--literally, "biting." The law forbade the Jew to take interest
from brethren but permitted him to do so from a foreigner ([Exo
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#025.md); [Deu
23:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#019.md); [Neh
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#007.md); [Psa
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#005).md). The letter of the law was
restricted to the Jewish polity, and is not binding now; and indeed the
principle of taking interest was even then sanctioned, by its being
allowed in the case of a foreigner. The spirit of the law still binds
us, that we are not to take advantage of our neighbor's necessities to
enrich ourselves, but be satisfied with moderate, or even no, interest,
in the case of the needy.

increase--in the case of other kinds of wealth; as "usury" refers to
money ([Lev 25:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#036).md).

withdrawn . . . hand, &c.--Where he has the opportunity and might find a
plausible plea for promoting his own gain at the cost of a wrong to his
neighbor, he keeps back his hand from what selfishness prompts.

judgment--justice.

[Ezekiel 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 18:9</span></span>

truly--with integrity.

surely live--literally, "live in life." Prosper in this life, but still
more in the life to come ([Pro 3:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#001.md);
[Amo 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004).md).

[Ezekiel 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 18:10</span></span>

The second case is that of an impious son of a pious father. His pious
parentage, so far from excusing, aggravates his guilt.

robber--or literally, "a breaker," namely, through all constraints of
right.

doeth the like to any one--The Hebrew and the parallel ([Eze
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#018).md) require us to translate rather,
"doeth to his brother any of these things," namely, the things which
follow in [Eze 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#011.md), &c. \[MAURER\].

[Ezekiel 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 18:11</span></span>

those duties--which his father did ([Eze
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#005.md), [Eze
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009).md).

[Ezekiel 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 18:12</span></span>

oppressed the poor--an aggravation to his oppressions, that they were
practised against the poor; whereas in [Eze
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#007.md) the expression is simply
"oppressed any."

abomination--singular number referring to the particular one mentioned
at the end of [Eze 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#006.md).

[Ezekiel 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 18:13</span></span>

shall he . . . live?--because of the merits of his father; answering, by
contrast, to "die for the iniquity of his father" ([Eze
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017).md).

his blood shall be upon him--The cause of his bloody death shall rest
with himself; God is not to blame, but is vindicated as just in
punishing him.

[Ezekiel 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 18:14</span></span>

The third case: a son who walks not in the steps of an unrighteous
father, but in the ways of God; for example, Josiah, the pious son of
guilty Amon; Hezekiah, of Ahaz (2Ki. 16:1-20; 18:1-37; 21:1-22:20).

seeth . . . and considereth--The same Hebrew stands for both verbs,
"seeth . . . yea, seeth." The repetition implies the attentive
observation needed, in order that the son may not be led astray by his
father's bad example; as sons generally are blind to parents sins, and
even imitate them as if they were virtues.

[Ezekiel 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 18:17</span></span>

taken off his hand from the poor--that is, abstained from oppressing the
poor, when he had the opportunity of doing so with impunity.The
different sense of the phrase in [Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049.md), in reference to relieving the
poor, seems to have suggested the reading followed by FAIRBAIRN, but not
sanctioned by the Hebrew, "hath not turned his hand from," &c. But [Eze
20:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#022.md) uses the phrase in a somewhat
similar sense to English Version here, abstained from hurting.

[Ezekiel 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 18:19</span></span>

Here the Jews object to the prophet's word and in their objection seem
to seek a continuance of that very thing which they had originally made
a matter of complaint. Therefore translate, "Wherefore doth not the son
bear the iniquity of his father?" It now would seem a consolation to
them to think the son might suffer for his father's misdeeds; for it
would soothe their self-love to regard themselves as innocent sufferers
for the guilt of others and would justify them in their present course
of life, which they did not choose to abandon for a better. In reply,
Ezekiel reiterates the truth of each being dealt with according to his
own merits \[FAIRBAIRN\]. But GROTIUS supports English Version, wherein
the Jews contradict the prophet, "Why (sayest thou so) doth not the son
(often, as in our case, though innocent) bear (that is, suffer for) the
iniquity of their father?" Ezekiel replies, It is not as you say, but as
I in the name of God say: "When the son hath done," &c. English Version
is simpler than that of FAIRBAIRN.

[Ezekiel 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 18:20</span></span>

son shall not bear . . . iniquity of . . . father-- ([Deu
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#016.md); [Kg2
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#006).md).

righteousness . . . wickedness--that is, the reward for righteousness .
. . the punishment of wickedness. "Righteousness" is not used as if any
were absolutely righteous; but, of such as have it imputed to them for
Christ's sake, though not under the Old Testament themselves
understanding the ground on which they were regarded as righteous, but
sincerely seeking after it in the way of God's appointment, so far as
they then understood this way.

[Ezekiel 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 18:21</span></span>

Two last cases, showing the equity of God: (1) The penitent sinner is
dealt with according to his new obedience, not according to his former
sins. (2) The righteous man who turns from righteousness to sin shall be
punished for the latter, and his former righteousness will be of no
avail to him.

he shall surely live--Despair drives men into hardened recklessness; God
therefore allures men to repentance by holding out hope \[CALVIN\].

To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard,

Wrapt in his crimes, against the storm prepared,

But when the milder beams of mercy play,

He melts, and throws the cumbrous cloak away.

Hitherto the cases had been of a change from bad to good, or vice versa,
in one generation compared with another. Here it is such a change in one
and the same individual. This, as practically affecting the persons here
addressed, is properly put last. So far from God laying on men the
penalty of others' sins, He will not even punish them for their own, if
they turn from sin to righteousness; but if they turn from righteousness
to sin, they must expect in justice that their former goodness will not
atone for subsequent sin ([Heb
10:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md); [Pe2
2:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#020).md). The exile in Babylon gave a
season for repentance of those sins which would have brought death on
the perpetrator in Judea while the law could be enforced; so it prepared
the way for the Gospel \[GROTIUS\].

[Ezekiel 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 18:22</span></span>

in his righteousness . . . he shah live--in it, not for it, as if that
atoned for his former sins; but "in his righteousness" he shall live, as
the evidence of his being already in favor with God through the merit of
Messiah, who was to come. The Gospel clears up for us many such passages
([Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md), which were dimly
understood at the time, while men, however, had light enough for
salvation.

[Ezekiel 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 18:23</span></span>

([Ti1 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md); [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md). If men perish, it is because
they will not come to the Lord for salvation; not that the Lord is not
willing to save them ([Joh 5:40](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#040).md). They
trample on not merely justice, but mercy; what farther hope can there be
for them, when even mercy is against them? ([Heb
10:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md).

[Ezekiel 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 18:24</span></span>

righteous--one apparently such; as in [Mat
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013.md), "I came not to call the
righteous," &c., that is, those who fancy themselves righteous. Those
alone are true saints who by the grace of God persevere ([Mat
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#013.md); [Co1
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012.md); [Joh
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028).md).

turneth away from . . . righteousness--an utter apostasy; not like the
exceptional offenses of the godly through infirmity or heedlessness,
which they afterwards mourn over and repent of.

not be mentioned--not be taken into account so as to save them.

his trespass--utter apostasy.

[Ezekiel 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 18:25</span></span>

Their plea for saying, "The way of the Lord is not equal," was that God
treated different classes in a different way. But it was really their
way that was unequal, since living in sin they expected to be dealt with
as if they were righteous. God's way was invariably to deal with
different men according to their deserts.

[Ezekiel 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 18:26</span></span>

The two last instances repeated in inverse order. God's emphatic
statement of His principle of government needs no further proof than the
simple statement of it.

in them--in the actual sins, which are the manifestations of the
principle of "iniquity," mentioned just before.

[Ezekiel 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 18:27</span></span>

he shall save his soul--that is, he shall have it saved upon his
repentance.

[Ezekiel 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 18:28</span></span>

considereth--the first step to repentance; for the ungodly do not
consider either God or themselves ([Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md); [Psa
119:59-60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#059.md); [Luk
15:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#017).md).

[Ezekiel 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 18:29</span></span>

Though God's justice is so plainly manifested, sinners still object to
it because they do not wish to see it ([Mic
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#007.md); [Mat
11:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 18:30</span></span>

As God is to judge them "according to their ways" ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md), their only hope is to "repent";
and this is a sure hope, for God takes no delight in judging them in
wrath, but graciously desires their salvation on repentance.

I will judge you--Though ye cavil, it is a sufficient answer that I,
your Judge, declare it so, and will judge you according to My will; and
then your cavils must end.

Repent--inward conversion ([Rev 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#005).md).
In the Hebrew there is a play of like sounds, "Turn ye and return."

turn yourselves, &c.--the outward fruits of repentance. Not as the
Margin, "turn others"; for the parallel clause ([Eze
18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031).md) is, "cast away from you all
your transgressions." Perhaps, however, the omission of the object after
the verb in the Hebrew implies that both are included: Turn alike
yourselves and all whom you can influence.

from all . . . transgressions--not as if believers are perfect; but they
sincerely aim at perfection, so as to be habitually and wilfully on
terms with no sin ([Jo1 3:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#006).md):

your ruin--literally, "your snare," entangling you in ruin.

[Ezekiel 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 18:31</span></span>

Cast away from you--for the cause of your evil rests with yourselves;
your sole way of escape is to be reconciled to God ([Eph
4:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022).md).

make you a new heart--This shows, not what men can do, but what they
ought to do: what God requires of us. God alone can make us a new heart
([Eze 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
36:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026).md). The command to do what men
cannot themselves do is designed to drive them (instead of laying the
blame, as the Jews did, elsewhere rather than on themselves) to feel
their own helplessness, and to seek God's Holy Spirit ([Psa
51:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#011).md). Thus the outward
exhortation is, as it were, the organ or instrument which God uses for
conferring grace. So we may say with AUGUSTINE, "Give what thou
requirest, and (then) require what thou wilt." Our strength (which is
weakness in itself) shall suffice for whatever He exacts, if only He
gives the supply \[CALVIN\].

spirit--the understanding: as the "heart" means the will and affections.
The root must be changed before the fruit can be good.

why will ye die--bring on your own selves your ruin. God's decrees are
secret to us; it is enough for us that He invites all, and will reject
none that seek Him.

([Lam 3:33](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#033.md); [Pe2
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009).md). God is "slow to anger";
punishment is "His strange work" ([Isa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#021).md).

There is a tacit antithesis between this lamentation and that of the
Jews for their own miseries, into the causes of which, however, they did
not inquire.
