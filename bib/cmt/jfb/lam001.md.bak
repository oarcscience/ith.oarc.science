Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Lamentations Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

[Lamentations 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lam 1:1</span></span>

(Lam. 1:1-22)

how is she . . . widow! she that was great, &c.--English Version is
according to the accents. But the members of each sentence are better
balanced in antithesis, thus, "how is she that was great among the
nations become as a widow! (how) she who was princess among the
provinces (that is, she who ruled over the surrounding provinces from
the Nile to the Euphrates, [Gen 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018.md);
[Kg1 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#021.md); [Ch2
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#026.md); [Ezr
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#020).md) become tributary!" \[MAURER\].

sit--on the ground; the posture of mourners ([Lam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010.md); [Ezr
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#003).md). The coin struck on the taking of
Jerusalem by Titus, representing Judea as a female sitting solitary
under a palm tree, with the inscription, JudÃ&brvbr;a Capta, singularly
corresponds to the image here; the language therefore must be
prophetical of her state subsequent to Titus, as well as referring
retrospectively to her Babylonian captivity.

[Lamentations 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lam 1:2</span></span>

in the night--even in the night, the period of rest and oblivion of
griefs ([Job 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#003).md).

lovers . . . friends--the heathen states allied to Judah, and their
idols. The idols whom she "loved" ([Jer
2:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020).md) could not comfort her. Her
former allies would not: nay, some "treacherously" joined her enemies
against her ([Kg2 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#002.md), [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007.md); [Psa
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007).md).

[Lamentations 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lam 1:3</span></span>

([Jer 52:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#027).md).

because of great servitude--that is, in a state "of great servitude,"
endured from the Chaldeans. "Because" is made by VATABLUS indicative of
the cause of her captivity; namely, her having "afflicted" and unjustly
brought into "servitude" the manumitted bond-servants ([Jer
34:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#008).md). MAURER explains it, "Judah
has left her land (not literally 'gone into captivity') because of the
yoke imposed on it by Nebuchadnezzar."

no rest-- ([Deu 28:64-65](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064).md).

overtook her between . . . straits--image from robbers, who in the East
intercept travellers at the narrow passes in hilly regions.

[Lamentations 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lam 1:4</span></span>

feasts--the passover, pentecost (or the feast of weeks), and the feast
of tabernacles.

gates--once the place of concourse.

[Lamentations 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lam 1:5</span></span>

the chief--rule her ([Deu 28:43-44](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#043).md).

adversaries . . . prosper; for the Lord--All the foes' attempts would
have failed, had not God delivered His people into their hands ([Jer
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#015).md).

[Lamentations 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">lam 1:6</span></span>

beauty . . . departed--her temple, throne, and priesthood.

harts that find no pasture--an animal timid and fleet, especially when
seeking and not able to "find pasture."

[Lamentations 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">lam 1:7</span></span>

remembered--rather, "remembers," now, in her afflicted state. In the
days of her prosperity she did not appreciate, as she ought, the favors
of God to her. Now, awakening out of her past lethargy, she feels from
what high privileges she has fallen.

when her people fell, &c.--that is, after which days of prosperity "her
people fell."

mock at her sabbaths--The heathen used to mock at the Jews' Sabbath, as
showing their idleness, and term them Sabbatarians \[MARTIAL, 4.4\].
Now, said they ironically, ye may keep a continuous Sabbath. So God
appointed the length of the captivity (seventy years) to be exactly that
of the sum of the Sabbaths in the four hundred ninety years in which the
land was denied its Sabbaths ([Lev
26:33-35](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033).md). MAURER translates it
"ruin." But English Version better expresses the point of their
"mocking," namely, their involuntary "Sabbaths," that is, the cessation
of all national movements. A fourth line is added in this stanza,
whereas in all the others there are but three. So in [Lam
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019.md).

[Lamentations 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">lam 1:8</span></span>

([Kg1 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#046).md).

is removed--as a woman separated from the congregation of God for legal
impurity, which is a type of moral impurity. So [Lam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md); [Lev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002.md); [Lev
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev015.htm#019.md), &c.

her nakedness--They have treated her as contumeliously as courtesans
from whom their clothes are stripped.

turneth backward--as modest women do from shame, that is, she is cast
down from all hope of restoration \[CALVIN\].

[Lamentations 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">lam 1:9</span></span>

Continuation of the image in [Lam 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md).
Her ignominy and misery cannot be concealed but are apparent to all, as
if a woman were suffering under such a flow as to reach the end of her
skirts.

remembereth not . . . last end-- ([Deu
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#029.md); [Isa
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007).md). She forgot how fatal must be
the end of her iniquity. Or, as the words following imply: She, in
despair, cannot lift herself up to lay hold of God's promises as to her
"latter end" \[CALVIN\].

wonderfully--Hebrew, "wonders," that is, with amazing dejection.

O Lord, behold--Judah here breaks in, speaking for herself.

for the enemy hath magnified himself--What might seem ground for
despair, the elated insulting of the enemy, is rather ground for good
hope.

[Lamentations 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lam 1:10</span></span>

for--surely she hath seen, &c.

heathen . . . command . . . not enter . . . congregation--for instance,
the Ammonites and Moabites ([Deu 23:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#003.md);
[Neh 13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#001).md). If the heathen, as such,
were not allowed to enter the sanctuary for worship, much less were they
allowed to enter in order to rob and destroy.

[Lamentations 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">lam 1:11</span></span>

([Jer 37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md); [Jer
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#009.md); [Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md).

given . . . pleasant things for meat-- ([Kg2
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#025.md); [Job
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#004).md).

relieve . . . soul--literally, "to cause the soul or life to return."

for I am become vile--Her sins and consequent sorrows are made the plea
in craving God's mercy. Compare the like plea in [Psa
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#011.md).

[Lamentations 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">lam 1:12</span></span>

The pathetic appeal of Jerusalem, not only to her neighbors, but even to
the strangers "passing by," as her sorrow is such as should excite the
compassion even of those unconnected with her. She here prefigures
Christ, whom the language is prophetically made to suit, more than
Jerusalem. Compare Israel, that is, Messiah, [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003.md). Compare with "pass by," [Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039.md); [Mar
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#029.md). As to Jerusalem, [Dan
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#012.md). M AURER, from the Arabic idiom,
translates, "do not go off on your way," that is, stop, whoever ye are
that pass by. English Version is simpler.

[Lamentations 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lam 1:13</span></span>

bones--a fire which not only consumes the skin and flesh, but penetrates
even to my "bones" (that is, my vital powers).

prevaileth against--not as ROSENMULLER, "He (Jehovah) hath broken them";
a sense not in the Hebrew.

net-- ([Eze 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013).md); image from hunting
wild beasts. He has so entangled me in His judgments that I cannot
escape.

turned me back--so that I cannot go forward and get free from His
meshes.

[Lamentations 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lam 1:14</span></span>

yoke . . . is bound by his hand-- ([Deu
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048).md). Metaphor from husbandmen, who,
after they have bound the yoke to the neck of oxen, hold the rein firmly
twisted round the hand. Thus the translation will be, "in His hand." Or
else, "the yoke of my transgressions" (that is, of punishment for my
transgressions) is held so fast fixed on me "by" God, that there is no
loosening of it; thus English Version, "by His hand."

wreathed--My sins are like the withes entwined about the neck to fasten
the yoke to.

into their hands, from whom--into the hands of those, from whom, &c.
MAURER translates, "before whom I am not able o stand."

[Lamentations 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">lam 1:15</span></span>

trodden, &c.--MAURER, from Syriac root, translates, "cast away"; so [Kg2
23:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#027.md). But [Psa
119:118](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#118.md), supports English Version.

in . . . midst of me--They fell not on the battlefield, but in the heart
of the city; a sign of the divine wrath.

assembly--the collected forces of Babylon; a very different "assembly"
from the solemn ones which once met at Jerusalem on the great feasts.
The Hebrew means, literally, such a solemn "assembly" or feast (compare
[Lam 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#022).md).

trodden . . . virgin . . . in a wine-press--hath forced her blood to
burst forth, as the red wine from the grapes trodden in the press ([Isa
63:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#003.md); [Rev
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#019.md); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015).md).

[Lamentations 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lam 1:16</span></span>

([Jer 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md); [Jer
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#017).md). Jerusalem is the speaker.

mine eye, mine eye--so [Lam 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#018.md), "our
end . . . our end"; repetition for emphasis.

[Lamentations 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">lam 1:17</span></span>

Like a woman in labor-throes ([Jer
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031).md).

menstruous woman--held unclean, and shunned by all; separated from her
husband and from the temple (compare [Lam
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#008.md); [Lev
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#019), &c..md).

[Lamentations 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lam 1:18</span></span>

The sure sign of repentance; justifying God, condemning herself ([Neh
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#033.md); [Psa
51:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004.md); [Dan
9:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#007).md).

his commandment--literally, "mouth"; His word in the mouth of the
prophets.

[Lamentations 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lam 1:19</span></span>

lovers-- ([Lam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#002.md); [Jer
30:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#014).md).

elders--in dignity, not merely age.

sought . . . meat--Their dignity did not exempt them from having to go
and seek bread ([Lam 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#011).md).

[Lamentations 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">lam 1:20</span></span>

bowels . . . troubled-- ([Job 30:27](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#027.md);
[Isa 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#011.md); [Jer
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020).md). Extreme mental distress
affects the bowels and the whole internal frame.

heart . . . turned-- ([Hos 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#008).md); is
agitated or fluttered.

abroad . . . sword . . . at home . . . as death-- ([Deu
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#025.md); [Eze
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#015).md). The "as" does not modify, but
intensifies. "Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home as it were death
itself" (personified), in the form of famine and pestilence ([Kg2
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#003.md); [Jer
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#018.md); [Jer
52:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006).md). So [Hab
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#005.md), "as death" \[MICHAELIS\].

[Lamentations 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">lam 1:21</span></span>

they are glad that thou hast done it--because they thought that
therefore Judah is irretrievably ruined ([Jer
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#003).md).

the day . . . called--(but) thou wilt bring on them the day of calamity
which thou hast announced, namely, by the prophets (Jer. 50:1-46; [Jer
48:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#027).md).

like . . . me--in calamities ([Psa
137:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008.md); [Jer
51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025), &c..md).

[Lamentations 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lam 1:22</span></span>

Such prayers against foes are lawful, if the foe be an enemy of God, and
if our concern be not for our own personal feeling, but for the glory of
God and the welfare of His people.

come before thee--so [Rev 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019.md),
"Babylon came in remembrance before God" (compare [Psa
109:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#015).md).
