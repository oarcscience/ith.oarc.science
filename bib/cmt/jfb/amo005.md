### [Amos Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)

[Amos 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">amo 5:1</span></span>

ELEGY OVER THE PROSTRATE KINGDOM: RENEWED EXHORTATIONS TO REPENTANCE:
GOD DECLARES THAT THE COMING DAY OF JUDGMENT SHALL BE TERRIBLE TO THE
SCORNERS WHO DESPISE IT: CEREMONIAL SERVICES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO HIM
WHERE TRUE PIETY EXISTS NOT: ISRAEL SHALL THEREFORE BE REMOVED FAR
EASTWARD. (Amos 5:1-27)

lamentation--an elegy for the destruction coming on you. Compare [Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002), "take up," namely, as a mournful
burden ([Eze 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001); [Eze
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#002)).

[Amos 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">amo 5:2</span></span>

virgin of Israel--the Israelite state heretofore unsubdued by
foreigners. Compare [Isa 23:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#012); [Jer
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#013); [Jer
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004), [Jer
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021); [Lam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#013); may be interpreted, Thou who
wast once the "virgin daughter of Zion." Rather, "virgin" as applied to
a state implies its beauty, and the delights on which it prides itself,
its luxuries, power, and wealth \[CALVIN\].

no more rise--in the existing order of things: in the Messianic
dispensation it is to rise again, according to many prophecies. Compare
[Kg2 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#023); [Kg2
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#007), for the restricted sense of "no
more."

forsaken upon her land--or, "prostrated upon," &c. (compare [Eze
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005); [Eze
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#004)) \[MAURER\].

[Amos 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">amo 5:3</span></span>

went out by a thousand--that is, "the city from which there used to go
out a thousand" equipped for war. "City" is put for "the inhabitants of
the city," as in [Amo 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#008).

shall leave . . . hundred--shall have only a hundred left, the rest
being destroyed by sword and pestilence ([Deu
28:62](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#062)).

[Amos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">amo 5:4</span></span>

Seek ye me, and ye shall live--literally, "Seek . . . Me, and live." The
second imperative expresses the certainty of "life" (escape from
judgment) resulting from obedience to the precept in the first
imperative. If they perish, it is their own fault; God would forgive, if
they would repent ([Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003), [Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)).

[Amos 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">amo 5:5</span></span>

seek not Beth-el--that is, the calves at Beth-el.

Gilgal--(See on [Amo 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004)).

Beer-sheba--in Judah on the southern frontier towards Edom. Once "the
well of the oath" by Jehovah, ratifying Abraham's covenant with
Abimelech, and the scene of his calling on "the Lord, the everlasting
God" ([Gen 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#031), [Gen
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#033)), now a stronghold of idolatry
([Amo 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#014)).

Gilgal shall surely go into captivity--a play on similar sounds in the
Hebrew, Gilgal, galoh, yigleh: "Gilgal (the place of rolling) shall
rolling be rolled away."

Beth-el shall come to naught--Beth-el (that is, the "house of God"),
called because of its vain idols Beth-aven (that is, "the house of
vanity," or "naught," [Hos 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015); [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005), [Hos
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008)), shall indeed "come to naught."

[Amos 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">amo 5:6</span></span>

break out like fire--bursting through everything in His way. God is "a
consuming fire" ([Deu 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024); [Isa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#017); [Lam
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#003)).

the house of Joseph--the kingdom of Israel, of which the tribe of
Ephraim, Joseph's son, was the chief tribe (compare [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016)).

none to quench it in Beth-el--that is, none in Beth-el to quench it;
none of the Beth-el idols on which Israel so depended, able to remove
the divine judgments.

[Amos 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">amo 5:7</span></span>

turn judgment to wormwood--that is, pervert it to most bitter wrong. As
justice is sweet, so injustice is bitter to the injured. "Wormwood" is
from a Hebrew root, to "execrate," on account of its noxious and bitter
qualities.

leave on righteousness in . . . earth--MAURER translates, "cast
righteousness to the ground," as in [Isa
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#002); [Dan
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#012).

[Amos 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">amo 5:8</span></span>

the seven stars--literally, the heap or cluster of seven larger stars
and others smaller ([Job 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#009); [Job
38:31](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#031)). The former whole passage seems
to have been in Amos mind. He names the stars well known to shepherds
(to which class Amos belonged), Orion as the precursor of the tempests
which are here threatened, and the Pleiades as ushering in spring.

shadow of death--Hebraism for the densest darkness.

calleth for the waters of the sea--both to send deluges in judgment, and
the ordinary rain in mercy ([Kg1
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044)).

[Amos 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">amo 5:9</span></span>

strengtheneth the spoiled--literally, "spoil" or "devastation": hence
the "person spoiled." WINER, MAURER, and the best modern critics
translate, "maketh devastation (or destruction) suddenly to arise,"
literally, "maketh it to gleam forth like the dawn." Ancient versions
support English Version. The Hebrew is elsewhere used, to make, to
shine, to make glad: and as English Version here ([Psa
39:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#013)), "recover strength."

the spoiled shall come--"devastation," or "destruction shall come upon"
\[MAURER\]. English Version expresses that, strong as Israel fancies
herself after the successes of Jeroboam II ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025)), even the weakest can be made
by God to prevail against the strong.

[Amos 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">amo 5:10</span></span>

him that rebuketh in the gate--the judge who condemns their iniquity in
the place of judgment ([Isa 29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021)).

abhor him that speaketh uprightly--the prophet telling them the
unwelcome truth: answering in the parallelism to the judge, "that
rebuketh in the gate" (compare [Kg1
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#008); [Pro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#008); [Pro
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#001); [Jer
36:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#023)).

[Amos 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">amo 5:11</span></span>

burdens of wheat--burdensome taxes levied in kind from the wheat of the
needy, to pamper the lusts of the great \[HENDERSON\]. Or wheat advanced
in time of scarcity, and exacted again at a burdensome interest \[RABBI
SALOMON\].

built houses . . . but not dwell in them . . . vineyards, . . . but not
drink wine of them--according to the original prophecy of Moses ([Deu
28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030), [Deu
28:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#038)). The converse shall be true
in restored Israel ([Amo 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014); [Isa
65:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#021)).

[Amos 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">amo 5:12</span></span>

they afflict . . . they take--rather, "(ye) who afflict . . . take."

bribe--literally, a price with which one who has an unjust cause ransoms
himself from your sentence ([Sa1 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#003),
Margin; [Pro 6:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#035)).

turn aside the poor in the gate--refuse them their right in the place of
justice ([Amo 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007); [Isa
29:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#021)).

[Amos 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">amo 5:13</span></span>

the prudent--the spiritually wise.

shall keep silence--not mere silence of tongue, but the prudent shall
keep himself quiet from taking part in any public or private affairs
which he can avoid: as it is "an evil time," and one in which all law is
set at naught. [Eph 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016) refers to
this. Instead of impatiently agitating against irremediable evils, the
godly wise will not cast pearls before swine, who would trample these,
and rend the offerers ([Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006)), but
will patiently wait for God's time of deliverance in silent submission
([Psa 39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009)).

[Amos 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">amo 5:14</span></span>

and so--on condition of your "seeking good."

shall be with you, as ye have spoken--as ye have boasted; namely, that
God is with you, and that you are His people ([Mic
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#011)).

[Amos 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">amo 5:15</span></span>

Hate . . . evil . . . love . . . good-- ([Isa
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016); [Rom
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#009)).

judgment in the gate--justice in the place where causes are tried.

it may be that the Lord . . . will be gracious--so, "peradventure" ([Exo
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#030)). Not that men are to come to
God with an uncertainty whether or no He will be gracious: the
expression merely implies the difficulty in the way, because of the want
of true repentance on man's part, so as to stimulate the zealous
earnestness of believers in seeking God (compare [Gen
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002); [Joe
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014); [Act
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022)).

the remnant of Joseph--(see [Amo 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#006)).
Israel (represented by "Ephraim," the leading tribe, and descendant of
Joseph) was, as compared to what it once was, now but a remnant, Hazael
of Syria having smitten all the coasts from Jordan eastward, Gilead and
Bashan, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh ([Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032)) \[HENDERSON\]. Rather, "the
remnant of Israel that shall have been left after the wicked have been
destroyed" \[MAURER\].

[Amos 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">amo 5:16</span></span>

Therefore--resumed from [Amo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013). God
foresees they will not obey the exhortation ([Amo
5:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#014)), but will persevere in the
unrighteousness stigmatized ([Amo 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#007),
[Amo 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010), [Amo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#012)).

the Lord--JEHOVAH.

the God of hosts, the Lord--an accumulation of titles, of which His
lordship over all things is the climax, to mark that from His judgment
there is no appeal.

streets . . . highways--the broad open spaces and the narrow streets
common in the East.

call the husbandman to mourning--The citizens shall call the
inexperienced husbandmen to act the part usually performed by
professional mourners, as there will not be enough of the latter for the
universal mourning which prevails.

such as are skilful of lamentation--professional mourners hired to lead
off the lamentations for the deceased; alluded to in [Ecc
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#005); generally women ([Jer
9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#017)).

[Amos 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">amo 5:17</span></span>

in all vineyards . . . wailing--where usually songs of joy were heard.

pass through thee--taking vengeance ([Exo
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#012), [Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023); [Nah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#012)). "Pass over" and "pass by," on
the contrary, are used of God's forgiving ([Exo
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023); [Mic
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018); compare [Amo
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#008)).

[Amos 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">amo 5:18</span></span>

Woe unto you who do not scruple to say in irony, "We desire that the day
of the Lord would come," that is, "Woe to you who treat it as if it were
a mere dream of the prophets" ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019); [Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015); [Eze
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022)).

to what end is it for you!--Amos taking their ironical words in earnest:
for God often takes the blasphemer at his own word, in righteous
retribution making the scoffer's jest a terrible reality against
himself. Ye have but little reason to desire the day of the Lord; for it
will be to you calamity, and not joy.

[Amos 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">amo 5:19</span></span>

As if a man did flee . . . a lion, and a bear met him--Trying to escape
one calamity, he falls into another. This perhaps implies that in [Amo
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018) their ironical desire for the day
of the Lord was as if it would be an escape from existing calamities.
The coming of the day of the Lord would be good news to us, if true: for
we have served God (that is, the golden calves). So do hypocrites
flatter themselves as to death and judgment, as if these would be a
relief from existing ills of life. The lion may from generosity spare
the prostrate, but the bear spares none (compare [Job
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#024); [Isa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018)).

leaned . . . on the wall--on the side wall of the house, to support
himself from falling. Snakes often hid themselves in fissures in a wall.
Those not reformed by God's judgments will be pursued by them: if they
escape one, another is ready to seize them.

[Amos 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">amo 5:21</span></span>

I hate, I despise--The two verbs joined without a conjunction express
God's strong abhorrence.

your feast days--yours; not Mine; I do not acknowledge them: unlike
those in Judah, yours are of human, not divine institution.

I will not smell--that is, I will take no delight in the sacrifices
offered ([Gen 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021); [Lev
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031)).

in your solemn assemblies--literally, "days of restraint." [Isa
1:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010) is parallel. Isaiah is fuller;
Amos, more condensed. Amos condemns Israel not only on the ground of
their thinking to satisfy God by sacrifices without obedience (the
charge brought by Isaiah against the Jews), but also because even their
external ritual was a mere corruption, and unsanctioned by God.

[Amos 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">amo 5:22</span></span>

meat offerings--flour, &c. Unbloody offerings.

peace offerings--offerings for obtaining from God peace and prosperity.
Hebrew, "thank offerings."

[Amos 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">amo 5:23</span></span>

Take . . . away from me--literally, "Take away, from upon Me"; the idea
being that of a burden pressing upon the bearer. So [Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014), "They are a trouble unto Me
(literally, 'a burden upon Me'): I am weary to bear them."

the noise of thy songs--The hymns and instrumental music on sacred
occasions are to Me nothing but a disagreeable noise.

I will not hear--Isaiah substitutes "prayers" ([Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)) for the "songs" and "melody"
here; but, like Amos, closes with "I will not hear."

[Amos 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">amo 5:24</span></span>

judgment--justice.

run down--literally, "roll," that is, flow abundantly ([Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018)). Without the desire to fulfil
righteousness in the offerer, the sacrifice is hateful to God ([Sa1
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022); [Psa
66:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#018); [Hos
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006); [Mic
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#008)).

[Amos 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">amo 5:25</span></span>

Have ye offered? &c.--Yes: ye have. "But (all the time with strange
inconsistency) ye have borne (aloft in solemn pomp) the tabernacle (that
is, the portable shrine, or model tabernacle: small enough not to be
detected by Moses; compare [Act 19:24](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024))
of your Molech" (that idol is "your" god; I am not, though ye go through
the form of presenting offerings to Me). The question, "Have ye," is not
a denial (for they did offer in the wilderness to Jehovah sacrifices of
the cattle which they took with them in their nomad life there, [Exo
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#004); Num. 7:1-89; [Num
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#001), &c.), but a strong affirmation
(compare [Sa1 2:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#027); [Jer
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#020); [Eze
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#004)). The sin of Israel in Amos' time
is the very sin of their forefathers, mocking God with worship, while at
the same time worshipping idols (compare [Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039)). It was clandestine in Moses'
time, else he would have put it down; he was aware generally of their
unfaithfulness, though not knowing the particulars ([Deu
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#021), [Deu
31:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#027)).

Molech . . . Chiun--"Molech" means "king" answering to Mars \[BENGEL\];
the Sun \[JABLONSKI\]; Saturn, the same as "Chiun" \[MAURER\]. The
Septuagint translates "Chiun" into Remphan, as Stephen quotes it ([Act
7:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042)). The same god often had
different names. Molech is the Ammonite name; Chiun, the Arabic and
Persian name, written also Chevan. In an Arabic lexicon Chiun means
"austere"; so astrologers represented Saturn as a planet baleful in his
influence. Hence the PhÅ“nicians offered human sacrifices to him,
children especially; so idolatrous Israel also. Rimmon was the Syrian
name ([Kg2 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#018)); pronounced as
Remvan, or "Remphan," just as Chiun was also Chevan. Molech had the form
of a king; Chevan, or Chiun, of a star \[GROTIUS\]. Remphan was the
Egyptian name for Saturn: hence the Septuagint translator of Amos gave
the Egyptian name for the Hebrew, being an Egyptian. \[HODIUS II, De
Bibliorum Textibus Originalibus. 4.115\]. The same as the Nile, of which
the Egyptians made the star Saturn the representative \[HARENBERG\].
BENGEL considers Remphan or Rephan akin to Teraphim and Remphis, the
name of a king of Egypt. The Hebrews became infected with Sabeanism, the
oldest form of idolatry, the worship of the Saba or starry hosts, in
their stay in the Arabian desert, where Job notices its prevalence ([Job
31:26](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#026)); in opposition, in [Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027), Jehovah declares Himself "the
God of hosts."

the star of your god--R. ISAAC CARO says all the astrologers represented
Saturn as the star of Israel. Probably there was a figure of a star on
the head of the image of the idol, to represent the planet Saturn; hence
"images" correspond to "star" in the parallel clause. A star in
hieroglyphics represents God ([Num
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#017)). "Images" are either a Hebraism
for "image," or refer to the many images made to represent Chiun.

[Amos 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">amo 5:27</span></span>

beyond Damascus--In [Act 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043) it is
"beyond Babylon," which includes beyond Damascus. In Amos time, Damascus
was the object of Israel's fear because of the Syrian wars. Babylon was
not yet named as the place of their captivity. Stephen supplies this
name. Their place of exile was in fact, as he states, "beyond Babylon,"
in Halah and Habor by the river Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes
([Kg2 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#006); compare here [Amo
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#005); [Amo
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003); [Amo
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#014)). The road to Assyria lay through
"Damascus." It is therefore specified, that not merely shall they be
carried captives to Damascus, as they had been by Syrian kings ([Kg2
10:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032); [Kg2
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#007)), but, beyond that, to a region
whence a return was not so possible as from Damascus. They were led
captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go captive
among idolaters. Compare [Kg2 15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029);
[Kg2 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009); [Isa
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#004), whence it appears Tiglath-pileser

3:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#001)).
