### [1 Thessalonians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

[1 Thessalonians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">th1 3:1</span></span>

PROOF OF HIS DESIRE AFTER THEM IN HIS HAVING SENT TIMOTHY: HIS JOY AT
THE TIDINGS BROUGHT BACK CONCERNING THEIR FAITH AND CHARITY: PRAYERS FOR
THEM. ([Th1 3:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001))

Wherefore--because of our earnest love to you ([Th1
2:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)).

forbear--"endure" the suspense. The Greek is literally applied to a
watertight vessel. When we could no longer contain ourselves in our
yearning desire for you.

left at Athens alone--See my Introduction. This implies that he sent
Timothy from Athens, whither the latter had followed him. However, the
"we" favors ALFORD'S view that the determination to send Timothy was
formed during the hasty consultation of Paul, Silas, and Timothy,
previous to his departure from Berea, and that then he with them
"resolved" to be "left alone" at Athens, when he should arrive there:
Timothy and Silas not accompanying him, but remaining at Berea. Thus the
"I," [Th1 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005), will express that the
act of sending Timothy, when he arrived at Athens, was Paul's, while the
determination that Paul should be left alone at Athens, was that of the
brethren as well as himself, at Berea, whence he uses, [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001), "we." The non-mention of Silas at
Athens implies that he did not follow Paul to Athens as was at first
intended; but Timothy did. Thus the history, [Act
17:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014), accords with the Epistle.
The word "left behind" (Greek) implies that Timothy had been with him at
Athens. It was an act of self-denial for their sakes that Paul deprived
himself of the presence of Timothy at Athens, which would have been so
cheering to him in the midst of philosophic cavillers; but from love to
the Thessalonians, he is well content to be left all "alone" in the
great city.

[1 Thessalonians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">th1 3:2</span></span>

minister of God and our fellow labourer--Some oldest manuscripts read,
"fellow workman with God"; others, "minister of God." The former is
probably genuine, as copyists probably altered it to the latter to avoid
the bold phrase, which, however, is sanctioned by [Co1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009); [Co2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001). The English Version reading is
not well supported, and is plainly compounded out of the two other
readings. Paul calls Timothy "our brother" here; but in [Co1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017), "my son." He speaks thus highly
of one so lately ordained, both to impress the Thessalonians with a high
respect for the delegate sent to them, and to encourage Timothy, who
seems to have been of a timid character ([Ti1
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012); [Ti1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)). "Gospel ministers do the work
of God with Him, for Him, and under Him" \[EDMUNDS\].

establish--Greek, "confirm." In [Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003), GOD is said to "stablish": He is
the true establisher: ministers are His "instruments."

concerning--Greek, "in behalf of," that is, for the furtherance of your
faith. The Greek for "comfort" includes also the idea, "exhort." The
Thessalonians in their trials needed both ([Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003); compare [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">th1 3:3</span></span>

moved--"shaken," "disturbed." The Greek is literally said of dogs
wagging the tail in fawning on one. Therefore TITTMANN explains it,
"That no man should, amidst his calamities, be allured by the flattering
hope of a more pleasant life to abandon his duty." So ELSNER and BENGEL,
"cajoled out of his faith." In afflictions, relatives and opponents
combine with the ease-loving heart itself in flatteries, which it needs
strong faith to overcome.

yourselves know--We always candidly told you so ([Th1
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#004); [Act
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)). None but a religion from God
would have held out such a trying prospect to those who should embrace
it, and yet succeed in winning converts.

we--Christians.

appointed thereunto--by God's counsel ([Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">th1 3:4</span></span>

that we should suffer--Greek, "that we are about (we are sure) to
suffer" according to the appointment of God ([Th1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003)).

even as--"even (exactly) as it both came to pass and ye know"; ye know
both that it came to pass, and that we foretold it (compare [Joh
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#019)). The correspondence of the
event to the prediction powerfully confirms faith: "Forewarned,
forearmed" \[EDMUNDS\]. The repetition of "ye know," so frequently, is
designed as an argument, that being forewarned of coming affliction,
they should be less readily "moved" by it.

[1 Thessalonians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">th1 3:5</span></span>

For this cause--Because I know of your "tribulation" having actually
begun ([Th1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#004)).

when I--Greek, "when I also (as well as Timothy, who, Paul delicately
implies, was equally anxious respecting them, compare "we," [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)), could no longer contain myself
(endure the suspense)."

I sent--Paul was the actual sender; hence the "I" here: Paul, Silas, and
Timothy himself had agreed on the mission already, before Paul went to
Athens: hence the "we," (see on [Th1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001)).

to know--to learn the state of your faith, whether it stood the trial
([Col 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008)).

lest . . . have tempted . . . and . . . be--The indicative is used in
the former sentence, the subjunctive in the latter. Translate therefore,
"To know . . . whether haply the tempter have tempted you (the
indicative implying that he supposed such was the case), and lest (in
that case) our labor may prove to be in vain" (compare [Gal
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#011)). Our labor in preaching would in
that case be vain, so far as ye are concerned, but not as concerns us in
so far as we have sincerely labored ([Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004); [Co1
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#008)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">th1 3:6</span></span>

Join "now" with "come"; "But Timotheus having just now come from you
unto us" \[ALFORD\]. Thus it appears (compare [Act
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)) Paul is writing from Corinth.

your faith and charity-- ([Th1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#003);
compare [Th2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#003), whence it seems
their faith subsequently increased still more). Faith was the solid
foundation: charity the cement which held together the superstructure of
their practice on that foundation. In that charity was included their
"good (kindly) remembrance" of their teachers.

desiring greatly--Greek, "having a yearning desire for."

we also--The desires of loving friends for one another's presence are
reciprocal.

[1 Thessalonians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">th1 3:7</span></span>

over you--in respect to you.

in--in the midst of: notwithstanding "all our distress (Greek,
'necessity') and affliction," namely, external trials at Corinth, whence
Paul writes (compare [Th1 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006), with
[Act 18:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">th1 3:8</span></span>

now--as the case is; seeing ye stand fast.

we live--we flourish. It revives us in our affliction to hear of your
steadfastness ([Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)).

if--implying that the vivid joy which the missionaries "now" feel, will
continue if the Thessalonians continue steadfast. They still needed
exhortation, [Th1 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010); therefore he
subjoins the conditional clause, "if ye," &c. ([Phi
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">th1 3:9</span></span>

For what thanks--what sufficient thanks?

render . . . again--in return for His goodness ([Psa
116:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012)).

for you--"concerning you."

for all the joy--on account of all the joy. It was "comfort," [Th1
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#007), now it is more, namely, joy.

for your sakes--on your account.

before our God--It is a joy which will bear God's searching eye: a joy
as in the presence of God, not self-seeking, but disinterested, sincere,
and spiritual (compare [Th1 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#020); [Joh
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#011)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">th1 3:10</span></span>

Night and day--(See on [Th1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009)).
Night is the season for the saint's holiest meditations and prayers
([Ti2 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003)).

praying--connected with, "we joy"; we joy while we pray; or else as
ALFORD, What thanks can we render to God while we pray? The Greek
implies a beseeching request.

exceedingly--literally, "more than exceeding abundantly" (compare [Eph
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#020)).

that which is lacking--Even the Thessalonians had points in which they
needed improvement \[BENGEL\], ([Luk
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#005)). Their doctrinal views as to the
nearness of Christ's coming, and as to the state of those who had fallen
asleep, and their practice in some points, needed correction ([Th1
4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#001)). Paul's method was to begin by
commending what was praiseworthy, and then to correct what was amiss; a
good pattern to all admonishers of others.

[1 Thessalonians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">th1 3:11</span></span>

Translate, "May God Himself, even our Father (there being but one
article in the Greek, requires this translation, 'He who is at once God
and our Father'), direct," &c. The "Himself" stands in contrast with
"we" ([Th1 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018)); we desired to come
but could not through Satan's hindrance; but if God Himself direct our
way (as we pray), none can hinder Him ([Th2
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016)). It is a remarkable proof of
the unity of the Father and Son, that in the Greek here, and in [Th2
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016), the verb is singular,
implying that the subject, the Father and Son, are but one in essential
Being, not in mere unity of will. Almost all the chapters in both
Epistles to the Thessalonians are sealed, each with its own prayer ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Th2
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#011); [Th2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#016); [Th2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005), [Th2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#016)) \[BENGEL\]. Paul does not think
the prosperous issue of a journey an unfit subject for prayer ([Rom
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010); [Rom
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#032)) \[EDMUNDS\]. His prayer, though
the answer was deferred, in about five years afterwards was fulfilled in
his return to Macedonia.

[1 Thessalonians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">th1 3:12</span></span>

The "you" in the Greek is emphatically put first; "But" (so the Greek
for "and") what concerns "YOU," whether we come or not, "may the Lord
make you to increase and abound in love," &c. The Greek for "increase"
has a more positive force; that for "abound" a more comparative force,
"make you full (supplying 'that which is lacking,' [Th1
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010)) and even abound." "The Lord" may
here be the Holy Spirit; so the Three Persons of the Trinity will be
appealed to (compare [Th1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013)), as in
[Th2 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#005). So the Holy Ghost is called
"the Lord" ([Co2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017)). "Love" is the
fruit of the Spirit ([Gal 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022)), and
His office is "to stablish in holiness" ([Th1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002)).

[1 Thessalonians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">th1 3:13</span></span>

your hearts--which are naturally the spring and seat of unholiness.

before God, even our Father--rather, "before Him who is at once God and
our Father." Before not merely men, but Him who will not be deceived by
the mere show of holiness, that is, may your holiness be such as will
stand His searching scrutiny.

coming--Greek, "presence," or "arrival."

with all his saints--including both the holy angels and the holy elect
of men ([Th1 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014); [Dan
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031); [Th2
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)). The saints are "His" ([Act
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013)). We must have "holiness" if we
are to be numbered with His holy ones or "saints." On "unblameable,"
compare [Rev 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#005). This verse (compare
[Th1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012)) shows that "love" is the
spring of true "holiness" ([Mat
5:44-48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044); [Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010); [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)). God is He who really
"stablishes"; Timothy and other ministers are but instruments ([Th1
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002)) in "stablishing."
