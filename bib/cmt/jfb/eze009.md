### [Ezekiel Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eze 9:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PRECEDING VISION: THE SEALING OF THE FAITHFUL. ([Eze
9:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001).md)

cried--contrasted with their "cry" for mercy ([Eze
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#018).md) is the "cry" here for vengeance,
showing how vain was the former.

them that have charge--literally, officers; so "officers" ([Isa
60:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#017).md), having the city in charge, not
to guard, but to punish it. The angels who as "watchers" fulfil God's
judgments ([Dan 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013.md), [Dan
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#017.md), [Dan
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#023.md); [Dan
10:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020).md); the "princes" ([Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003).md) of Nebuchadnezzar's army were
under their guidance.

draw near--in the Hebrew intensive, "to draw near quickly."

[Ezekiel 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 9:2</span></span>

clothed with linen-- ([Dan 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md); [Dan
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006).md). His clothing marked his
office as distinct from that of the six officers of vengeance; "linen"
characterized the high priest ([Lev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#004).md); emblematic of purity. The same
garment is assigned to the angel of the Lord (for whom Michael is but
another name) by the contemporary prophet Daniel ([Dan
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md); [Dan
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#006).md). Therefore the intercessory
High Priest in heaven must be meant ([Zac
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#012).md). The six with Him are His
subordinates; therefore He is said to be "among them," literally, "in
the midst of them," as their recognized Lord ([Heb
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#006).md). He appears as a "man," implying
His incarnation; as "one" (compare [Ti1
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005).md). Salvation is peculiarly assigned
to Him, and so He bears the "inkhorn" in order to "mark" His elect ([Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md); compare [Exo
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#007.md); [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md); [Rev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004.md); [Rev
13:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md); [Rev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004).md), and to write their names in His
book of life ([Rev 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#008).md). As Oriental
scribes suspend their inkhorn at their side in the present day, and as a
"scribe of the host is found in Assyrian inscriptions accompanying the
host" to number the heads of the slain, so He stands ready for the work
before Him. "The higher gate" was probably where now the gate of
Damascus is. The six with Him make up the sacred and perfect number,
seven ([Zac 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md); [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006).md). The executors of judgment on the
wicked, in Scripture teaching, are good, not bad, angels; the bad have
permitted to them the trial of the pious ([Job
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007).md). The judgment is executed by Him
([Eze 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002.md), [Eze
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#007.md); [Joh
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#022.md), [Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027).md) through the six ([Mat
13:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#041.md); [Mat
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031).md); so beautifully does the Old
Testament harmonize with the New Testament. The seven come "from the way
of the north"; for it was there the idolatries were seen, and from the
same quarter must proceed the judgment (Babylon lying northeast of
Judea). So [Mat 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#028.md).

stood--the attitude of waiting reverently for Jehovah's commands.

brazen altar--the altar of burnt offerings, not the altar of incense,
which was of gold. They "stood" there to imply reverent obedience; for
there God gave His answers to prayer \[CALVIN\]; also as being about to
slay victims to God's justice, they stand where sacrifices are usually
slain \[GROTIUS\], ([Eze 39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017.md); [Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Jer
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003.md); [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010).md).

[Ezekiel 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 9:3</span></span>

glory of . . . God--which had heretofore, as a bright cloud, rested on
the mercy seat between the cherubim in the holy of holies ([Sa2
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md); [Psa
80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001).md); its departure was the presage
of the temple being given up to ruin; its going from the inner sanctuary
to the threshold without, towards the officers standing at the altar
outside, was in order to give them the commission of vengeance.

[Ezekiel 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 9:4</span></span>

midst of . . . city . . . midst of Jerusalem--This twofold designation
marks more emphatically the scene of the divine judgments.

a mark--literally, the Hebrew letter Tau, the last in the alphabet, used
as a mark ("my sign," [Job 31:35](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#035.md),
Margin); literally, Tau; originally written in the form of a cross,
which TERTULLIAN explains as referring to the badge and only means of
salvation, the cross of Christ. But nowhere in Scripture are the words
which are now employed as names of letters used to denote the letters
themselves or their figures \[VITRINGA\]. The noun here is cognate to
the verb, "mark a mark." So in [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md) no particular mark is specified.
We seal what we wish to guard securely. When all things else on earth
are confounded, God will secure His people from the common ruin. God
gives the first charge as to their safety before He orders the
punishment of the rest ([Psa 31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md);
[Isa 26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020).md). So in the case of Lot
and Sodom ([Gen 19:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#022).md); also the
Egyptian first-born were not slain till Israel had time to sprinkle the
blood-mark, ensuring their safety (compare [Rev
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md); [Amo
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#009).md). So the early Christians had
Pella provided as a refuge for them, before the destruction of
Jerusalem.

upon the foreheads--the most conspicuous part of the person, to imply
how their safety would be manifested to all (compare [Jer
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011.md); [Jer
39:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011).md). It was customary thus to
mark worshippers ([Rev 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#016.md); [Rev
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#001.md), [Rev
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#009).md) and servants. So the Church of
England marks the forehead with the sign of the cross in baptizing. At
the exodus the mark was on the houses, for then it was families; here,
it is on the foreheads, for it is individuals whose safety is
guaranteed.

sigh and . . . cry--similarly sounding verbs in Hebrew, as in English
Version, expressing the prolonged sound of their grief. "Sigh" implies
their inward grief ("groanings which cannot be uttered," [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026).md); "cry," the outward expression
of it. So Lot ([Pe2 2:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007).md). Tenderness
should characterize the man of God, not harsh sternness in opposing the
ungodly ([Psa 119:53](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#053.md), [Psa
119:136](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#136.md); [Jer
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md); [Co2
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#021).md); at the same time zeal for the
honor of God ([Psa 69:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019).md).

[Ezekiel 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 9:5</span></span>

the others--the six officers of judgment ([Eze
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002).md).

[Ezekiel 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 9:6</span></span>

come not near any . . . upon whom . . . mark-- ([Rev
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#004).md). It may be objected that Daniel,
Jeremiah, and others were carried away, whereas many of the vilest were
left in the land. But God does not promise believers exemption from all
suffering, but only from what will prove really and lastingly hurtful to
them. His sparing the ungodly turns to their destruction and leaves them
without excuse \[CALVIN\]. However, the prophecy waits a fuller and
final fulfilment, for [Rev 7:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#003.md), in
ages long after Babylon, foretells, as still future, the same sealing of
a remnant (one hundred forty-four thousand) of Israel previous to the
final outpouring of wrath on the rest of the nation; the correspondence
is exact; the same pouring of fire from the altar follows the marking of
the remnant in both (compare [Rev 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#005.md),
with [Eze 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#002).md). So [Zac
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md); [Zac
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002.md), distinguish the remnant from the
rest of Israel.

begin at . . . sanctuary--For in it the greatest abominations had been
committed; it had lost the reality of consecration by the blood of
victims sacrificed to idols; it must, therefore, lose its semblance by
the dead bodies of the slain idolaters ([Eze
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007).md). God's heaviest wrath falls on
those who have sinned against the highest privileges; these are made to
feel it first ([Pe1 4:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017).md). He hates
sin most in those nearest to Him; for example, the priests, &c.

ancient men--the seventy elders.

[Ezekiel 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 9:8</span></span>

I was left--literally "there was left I." So universal seemed the
slaughter that Ezekiel thought himself the only one left \[CALVIN\]. He
was the only one left of the priests "in the sanctuary."

fell upon my face--to intercede for his countrymen (so [Num
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#022).md).

all the residue--a plea drawn from God's covenant promise to save the
elect remnant.

[Ezekiel 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 9:9</span></span>

exceeding--literally, "very, very"; doubled.

perverseness--"apostasy" \[GROTIUS\]; or, "wresting aside of justice."

Lord . . . forsaken . . . earth . . . seeth not--The order is reversed
from [Eze 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012.md). There they speak of
His neglect of His people in their misery; here they go farther and deny
His providence ([Psa 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#011).md), so that
they may sin fearlessly. God, in answer to Ezekiel's question ([Eze
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008).md), leaves the difficulty unsolved;
He merely vindicates His justice by showing it did not exceed their sin:
He would have us humbly acquiesce in His judgments, and wait and trust.

[Ezekiel 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 9:10</span></span>

mine eye--to show them their mistake in saying, "The Lord seeth not."

recompense their way upon their head-- ([Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md). Retribution in kind.

[Ezekiel 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 9:11</span></span>

I have done as thou hast commanded--The characteristic of Messiah ([Joh
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#004).md). So the angels ([Psa
103:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#021).md); and the apostles report their
fulfilment of their orders ([Mar
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#030).md).
