### [Jeremiah Chapter 16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 16:2</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS PROPHECY. (Jer. 16:1-21)

in this place--in Judea. The direction to remain single was (whether
literally obeyed, or only in prophetic vision) to symbolize the coming
calamities of the Jews ([Eze 24:15-27](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#015))
as so severe that the single state would be then (contrary to the
ordinary course of things) preferable to the married (compare [Co1
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008), [Co1
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#026), [Co1
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#029); [Mat
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#019); [Luk
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#029)).

[Jeremiah 16:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 16:4</span></span>

grievous deaths--rather, "deadly diseases" ([Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002)).

not . . . lamented--so many shall be the slain ([Jer
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#018)).

dung-- ([Psa 83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010)).

[Jeremiah 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 16:5</span></span>

([Eze 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017), [Eze
24:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#022)).

house of mourning-- ([Mar 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#038)).
Margin, "mourning-feast"; such feasts were usual at funerals. The Hebrew
means, in [Amo 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007), the cry of joy at
a banquet; here, and [Lam 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#019), the
cry of sorrow.

[Jeremiah 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 16:6</span></span>

cut themselves--indicating extravagant grief ([Jer
41:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005); [Jer
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005)), prohibited by the law ([Lev
19:28](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#028)).

bald-- ([Jer 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029); [Isa
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 16:7</span></span>

tear themselves--rather, "break bread," namely, that eaten at the
funeral-feast ([Deu 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#014); [Job
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011); [Eze
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#017); [Hos
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#004)). "Bread" is to be supplied, as in
[Lam 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004); compare "take" (food) ([Gen
42:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#033)).

give . . . cup of consolation . . . for . . . father--It was the
Oriental custom for friends to send viands and wine (the "cup of
consolation") to console relatives in mourning-feasts, for example, to
children upon the death of a "father" or "mother."

[Jeremiah 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 16:8</span></span>

house of feasting--joyous: as distinguished from mourning-feasts. Have
no more to do with this people whether in mourning or joyous feasts.

[Jeremiah 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 16:9</span></span>

([Jer 7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034); [Jer
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010); [Eze
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze026.htm#013)).

[Jeremiah 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 16:10</span></span>

([Deu 29:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024); [Kg1
9:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 16:11</span></span>

([Jer 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#019); [Jer
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#022); [Jer
22:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008)).

[Jeremiah 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 16:12</span></span>

ye--emphatic: so far from avoiding your fathers' bad example, ye have
done worse ([Jer 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#026); [Kg1
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#009)).

imagination--rather, "stubborn perversity."

that they may not hearken--rather, connected with "ye"; "ye have walked
. . . so as not to hearken to Me."

[Jeremiah 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 16:13</span></span>

serve other gods--That which was their sin in their own land was their
punishment in exile. Retribution in kind. They voluntarily forsook God
for idols at home; they were not allowed to serve God, if they wished
it, in captivity ([Dan 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#012); [Dan
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#007)).

day and night--irony. You may there serve idols, which ye are so mad
after, even to satiety, and without intermission.

[Jeremiah 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 16:14</span></span>

Therefore--So severe shall be the Jews' bondage that their deliverance
from it shall be a greater benefit than that out of Egypt. The
consolation is incidental here; the prominent thought is the severity of
their punishment, so great that their rescue from it will be greater
than that from Egypt \[CALVIN\]; so the context, [Jer
16:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#013), [Jer
16:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017), proves ([Jer
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007); [Isa
43:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#018)).

[Jeremiah 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 16:15</span></span>

the north--Chaldea. But while the return from Babylon is primarily
meant, the return hereafter is the full and final accomplishment
contemplated, as "from all the lands" proves. "Israel" was not, save in
a very limited sense, "gathered from all the lands" at the return from
Babylon (see on [Jer 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006); [Jer
30:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#003); [Jer
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#015)).

[Jeremiah 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 16:16</span></span>

send for--translate, "I will send many"; "I will give the commission to
many" ([Ch2 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#007)).

fishers . . . hunters--successive invaders of Judea ([Amo
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#002); [Hab
1:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#014)). So "net" ([Eze
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#013)). As to "hunters," see [Gen
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#009); [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002). The Chaldees were famous in
hunting, as the Egyptians, the other enemy of Judea, were in fishing.
"Fishers" expresses the ease of their victory over the Jews as that of
the angler over fishes; "hunters," the keenness of their pursuit of them
into every cave and nook. It is remarkable, the same image is used in a
good sense of the Jews' restoration, implying that just as their enemies
were employed by God to take them in hand for destruction, so the same
shall be employed for their restoration ([Eze
47:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eze047.htm#009)). So spiritually, those once
enemies by nature (fishermen many of them literally) were employed by
God to be heralds of salvation, "catching men" for life ([Mat
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#019); [Luk
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010); [Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041); [Act
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004)); compare here [Jer
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019), "the Gentiles shall come unto
thee" ([Co2 12:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jer 16:17</span></span>

([Jer 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#019); [Pro
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#021); [Pro
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#003)).

their iniquity--the cause of God's judgments on them.

[Jeremiah 16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jer 16:18</span></span>

first . . . double--HORSLEY translates, "I will recompense . . . once
and again"; literally, "the first time repeated": alluding to the two
captivities--the Babylonian and the Roman. MAURER, "I will recompense
their former iniquities (those long ago committed by their fathers) and
their (own) repeated sins" ([Jer
16:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011)). English Version gives a
good sense, "First (before 'I bring them again into their land'), I will
doubly (that is, fully and amply, [Jer
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#018); [Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002)) recompense."

carcasses--not sweet-smelling sacrifices acceptable to God, but
"carcasses" offered to idols, an offensive odor to God: human victims
([Jer 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#005); [Eze
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#020)), and unclean animals ([Isa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004); [Isa
66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017)). MAURER explains it, "the
carcasses" of the idols: their images void of sense and life, Compare
[Jer 16:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019). [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030) favors this.

[Jeremiah 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jer 16:19</span></span>

The result of God's judgments on the Jews will be that both the Jews
when restored, and the Gentiles who have witnessed those judgments,
shall renounce idolatry for the worship of Jehovah. Fulfilled partly at
the return from Babylon, after which the Jews entirely renounced idols,
and many proselytes were gathered in from the Gentiles, but not to be
realized in its fulness till the final restoration of Israel (Isa.
2:1-17).

[Jeremiah 16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 16:20</span></span>

indignant protest of Jeremiah against idols.

and they (are) no gods-- ([Jer 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011);
[Isa 37:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#019); [Gal
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#008)). "They" refers to the idols. A
man (a creature himself) making God is a contradiction in terms. Vulgate
takes "they" thus: "Shall man make gods, though men themselves are not
gods?"

[Jeremiah 16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jer 16:21</span></span>

Therefore--In order that all may be turned from idols to Jehovah, He
will now give awful proof of His divine power in the judgments He will
inflict.

this once--If the punishments I have heretofore inflicted have not been
severe enough to teach them.

my name . . . Lord--Jehovah ([Psa
83:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#018)): God's incommunicable name, to
apply which to idols would be blasphemy. Keeping His threats and
promises ([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003)).

The the Septuagint omits the first four verses, but other Greek versions
have them.
