### [Genesis Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 17:1</span></span>

RENEWAL OF THE COVENANT. (Gen. 17:1-27)

Abram . . . ninety years old and nine--thirteen years after the birth of
Ishmael \[[Gen 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#016.md)\]. During that
interval he had enjoyed the comforts of communion with God but had been
favored with no special revelation as formerly, probably on account of
his hasty and blameable marriage with Hagar.

the Lord appeared--some visible manifestation of the divine presence,
probably the Shekinah or radiant glory of overpowering effulgence.

I am the Almighty God--the name by which He made Himself known to the
patriarchs ([Exo 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo006.htm#003).md), designed to
convey the sense of "all-sufficient" ([Psa
16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Psa
73:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025).md).

walk . . . and . . . perfect--upright, or sincere ([Psa
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#006).md) in heart, speech, and behavior.

[Genesis 17:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gen 17:3</span></span>

Abram fell on his face--the attitude of profoundest reverence assumed by
Eastern people. It consists in the prostrate body resting on the hands
and knees, with the face bent till the forehead touches the ground. It
is an expression of conscious humility and profound reverence.

[Genesis 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 17:4</span></span>

my covenant is with thee--Renewed mention is made of it as the
foundation of the communication that follows. It is the covenant of
grace made with all who believe in the Saviour.

[Genesis 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gen 17:5</span></span>

but thy name shall be Abraham--In Eastern countries a change of name is
an advertisement of some new circumstance in the history, rank, or
religion of the individual who bears it. The change is made variously,
by the old name being entirely dropped for the new, or by conjoining the
new with the old; or sometimes only a few letters are inserted, so that
the altered form may express the difference in the owner's state or
prospects. It is surprising how soon a new name is known and its import
spread through the country. In dealing with Abraham and Sarai, God was
pleased to adapt His procedure to the ideas and customs of the country
and age. Instead of Abram, "a high father," he was to be called Abraham,
"father of a multitude of nations" (see [Rev
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#017).md).

[Genesis 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gen 17:8</span></span>

I will give unto thee . . . the land--It had been previously promised to
Abraham and his posterity ([Gen
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018).md). Here it is promised as an
"everlasting possession," and was, therefore, a type of heaven, "the
better country" ([Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md).

[Genesis 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gen 17:10</span></span>

Every man child among you shall be circumcised--This was the sign in the
Old Testament Church as baptism is in the New, and hence the covenant is
called "covenant of circumcision" ([Act
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md); [Rom
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011).md). The terms of the covenant were
these: on the one hand Abraham and his seed were to observe the right of
circumcision; and on the other, God promised, in the event of such
observance, to give them Canaan for a perpetual possession, to be a God
to him and his posterity, and that in him and his seed all nations
should be blessed.

[Genesis 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gen 17:15</span></span>

As for Sarai . . . I will . . . give thee a son also of her--God's
purposes are gradually made known. A son had been long ago promised to
Abraham. Now, at length, for the first time he is informed that it was
to be a child of Sarai.

[Genesis 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 17:17</span></span>

Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed--It was not the sneer of
unbelief, but a smile of delight at the improbability of the event ([Rom
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020).md).

[Genesis 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gen 17:18</span></span>

O that Ishmael might live before thee--natural solicitude of a parent.
But God's thoughts are not as man's thoughts \[[Isa
55:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#008.md)\].

[Genesis 17:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">gen 17:19</span></span>

The blessings of the covenant are reserved for Isaac, but common
blessings were abundantly promised to Ishmael; and though the visible
Church did not descend from his family, yet personally he might, and it
is to be hoped did, enjoy its benefits.
