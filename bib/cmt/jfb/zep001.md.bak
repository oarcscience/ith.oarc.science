### [Zephaniah Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md)

[Zephaniah 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">zep 1:1</span></span>

GOD'S SEVERE JUDGMENT ON JUDAH FOR ITS IDOLATRY AND NEGLECT OF HIM: THE
RAPID APPROACH OF THE JUDGMENT, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE. (Zep.
1:1-18)

days of Josiah--Had their idolatries been under former kings, they might
have said, Our kings have forced us to this and that. But under Josiah,
who did all in his power to reform them, they have no such excuse.

son of Amon--the idolater, whose bad practices the Jews clung to, rather
than the good example of Josiah, his son; so incorrigible were they in
sin.

Judah--Israel's ten tribes had gone into captivity before this.

[Zephaniah 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">zep 1:2</span></span>

utterly consume--from a root to "sweep away," or "scrape off utterly."
See [Jer 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#013.md), Margin, and here.

from off the land--of Judah.

[Zephaniah 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">zep 1:3</span></span>

Enumeration in detail of the "all things" ([Zep
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#002.md); compare [Jer
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#010.md); [Hos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003).md).

the stumbling-blocks--idols which cause Judah to offend or stumble ([Eze
14:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#003.md), [Eze
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#007).md).

with the wicked--The idols and their worshippers shall be involved in a
common destruction.

[Zephaniah 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">zep 1:4</span></span>

stretch out mine hand--indicating some remarkable and unusual work of
vengeance ([Isa 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md); [Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md), [Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), [Isa
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021).md).

Judah--including Benjamin. These two tribes are to suffer, which thought
themselves perpetually secure, because they escaped the captivity in
which the ten tribes were involved.

Jerusalem--the fountainhead of the evil. God begins with His sanctuary
([Eze 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006).md), and those who are nigh Him
([Lev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003).md).

the remnant of Baal--the remains of Baal worship, which as yet Josiah
was unable utterly to eradicate in remote places. Baal was the
PhÅ“nician tutelary god. From the time of the Judges ([Jdg
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#013).md), Israel had fallen into this
idolatry; and Manasseh lately had set up this idol within Jehovah's
temple itself ([Kg2 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003.md), [Kg2
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#005.md), [Kg2
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#007).md). Josiah began his reformation in
the twelfth year of his reign ([Ch2
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md), [Ch2
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#008).md), and in the eighteenth had as
far as possible completed it.

Chemarims--idol priests, who had not reached the age of puberty; meaning
"ministers of the gods" \[SERVIUS on Ã†neid, 11\], the same name as the
Tyrian Camilli, r and l being interchangeable (compare [Hos
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#005), Margin.md). Josiah is expressly
said ([Kg2 23:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005), Margin.md) to have "put
down the Chemarim." The Hebrew root means "black" (from the black
garments which they wore or the marks which they branded on their
foreheads); or "zealous," from their idolatrous fanaticism. The very
"name," as well as themselves, shall be forgotten.

the priests--of Jehovah, of Aaronic descent, who ought to have used all
their power to eradicate, but who secretly abetted, idolatry (compare
[Zep 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md); Eze. 8:1-18; [Eze
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#026.md); [Eze
44:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#010).md). From the priests Zephaniah
passes to the people.

[Zephaniah 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">zep 1:5</span></span>

worship the host of heaven--Saba: whence, in contrast to Sabeanism,
Jehovah is called Lord of Sabaoth.

upon the housetops--which were flat ([Kg2
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#005.md), [Kg2
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#012.md); [Jer
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md); [Jer
32:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#029).md).

swear by the Lord--rather, "swear to JEHOVAH" ([Ch2
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#014).md); solemnly dedicating themselves
to Him (compare [Isa 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015).md).

and--"and yet (with strange inconsistency, [Kg1
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md); [Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039.md); [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024).md) swear by Malcham," that is,
"their king" \[MAURER\]: the same as Molech (see on [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025).md), and "Milcom the god of . . .
Ammon" ([Kg1 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#033).md). If Satan have
half the heart, he will have all; if the Lord have but half offered to
Him, He will have none.

[Zephaniah 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">zep 1:6</span></span>

This verse describes more comprehensively those guilty of defection from
Jehovah in any way ([Jer 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013.md), [Jer
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#017).md).

[Zephaniah 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">zep 1:7</span></span>

Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord-- ([Hab
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#020).md). Let the earth be silent at His
approach \[MAURER\]. Or, "Thou whosoever hast been wont to speak against
God, as if He had no care about earthly affairs, cease thy murmurs and
self-justifications; submit thyself to God, and repent in time"
\[CALVIN\].

Lord . . . prepared a sacrifice--namely, a slaughter of the guilty Jews,
the victims due to His justice ([Isa
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006.md); [Jer
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#010.md); [Eze
39:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#017).md).

bid his guests--literally, "sanctified His called ones" (compare [Isa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#003).md). It enhances the bitterness of
the judgment that the heathen Chaldeans should be sanctified, or
consecrated as it were, by God as His priests, and be called to eat the
flesh of the elect people; as on feast days the priests used to feast
among themselves on the remains of the sacrifices \[CALVIN\]. English
Version takes it not of the priests, but the guests bidden, who also had
to "sanctify" or purify themselves before coming to the sacrificial
feast ([Sa1 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#013.md), [Sa1
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#022.md); [Sa1
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#005).md). Nebuchadnezzar was bidden to
come to take vengeance on guilty Jerusalem ([Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009).md).

[Zephaniah 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">zep 1:8</span></span>

the princes--who ought to have been an example of good to others, but
were ringleaders in all evil.

the king's children--fulfilled on Zedekiah's children ([Jer
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006).md); and previously, on Jehoahaz and
Eliakim, the sons of Josiah ([Kg2
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#031.md), [Kg2
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#036.md); [Ch2
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#006.md); compare also [Kg2
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#018.md); [Kg2
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#013).md). Huldah the prophetess ([Kg2
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#020).md) intimated that which Zephaniah
now more expressly foretells.

all such as are clothed with strange apparel--the princes or courtiers
who attired themselves in costly garments, imported from abroad; partly
for the sake of luxury, and partly to ingratiate themselves with foreign
great nations whose costume as well as their idolatries they imitated,
\[CALVIN\]; whereas in costume, as in other respects, God would have
them to be separate from the nations. GROTIUS refers the "strange
apparel" to garments forbidden by the law, for example, men's garments
worn by women, and vice versa, a heathen usage in the worship of Mars
and Venus ([Deu 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005).md).

[Zephaniah 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">zep 1:9</span></span>

those that leap on the threshold--the servants of the princes, who,
after having gotten prey (like hounds) for their masters, leap
exultingly on their masters' thresholds; or, on the thresholds of the
houses which they break into \[CALVIN\]. JEROME explains it of those who
walk up the steps into the sanctuary with haughtiness. ROSENMULLER
translates, "Leap over the threshold"; namely, in imitation of the
Philistine custom of not treading on the threshold, which arose from the
head and hands of Dragon being broken off on the threshold before the
ark ([Sa1 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1005.htm#005).md). Compare [Isa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#006.md), "thy people . . . are soothsayers
like the Philistines." CALVIN'S view agrees best with the latter clause
of the verse.

fill . . . masters' houses with violence, &c.--that is, with goods
obtained with violence, &c.

[Zephaniah 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">zep 1:10</span></span>

fish gate-- ([Ch2 33:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#014.md); [Neh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#003.md); [Neh
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/neh012.htm#039).md). Situated on the east of the
lower city, north of the sheep gate \[MAURER\]: near the stronghold of
David in Milo, between Zion and the lower city, towards the west
\[JEROME\]. This verse describes the state of the city when it was
besieged by Nebuchadnezzar. It was through the fish gate that he entered
the city. It received its name from the fish market which was near it.
Through it passed those who used to bring fish from the lake of Tiberias
and Jordan. It answers to what is now called the Damascus gate
\[HENDERSON\].

the second--namely, the gate which was second in dignity \[CALVIN\]. Or,
the second or lower part of the city. Appropriately, the fish gate, or
extreme end of the lower part of the city, first resounds with the cries
of the citizens as the foe approaches; then, as he advances further,
that part of the city itself, namely, its inner part; lastly, when the
foe is actually come and has burst in, the hills, the higher ones,
especially Zion and Moriah, on which the upper city and temple were
founded \[MAURER\]. The second, or lower city, answers to Akra, north of
Zion, and separated from it by the valley of TyropÅ“on running down to
the pool of Siloam \[HENDERSON\]. The Hebrew is translated "college,"
[Kg2 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#014.md); so VATABLUS would
translate here.

hills--not here those outside, but those within the walls: Zion, Moriah,
and Ophel.

[Zephaniah 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">zep 1:11</span></span>

Maktesh--rather, "the mortar," a name applied to the valley of Siloam
from its hollow shape \[JEROME\]. The valley between Zion and Mount
Olivet, at the eastern extremity of Mount Moriah, where the merchants
dwelt. [Zac 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#021.md), "The Canaanite,"
namely, merchant \[Chaldee Version\]. The TyropÅ“on (that is,
cheese-makers') valley below Mount Akra \[ROSENMULLER\]. Better
Jerusalem itself, so called as lying in the midst of hills ([Isa
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#001.md); [Jer
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#013).md) and as doomed to be the scene
of its people being destroyed as corn or drugs are pounded in a mortar
([Pro 27:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro027.htm#022).md) \[MAURER\]. Compare the
similar image of a "pot" ([Eze 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md),
[Eze 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#006).md). The reason for the
destruction is subjoined, namely, its merchant people's greediness of
gain.

all the merchant people--literally, the "Canaanite people": irony: all
the merchant people of Jerusalem are very Canaanites in greed for gain
and in idolatries (see on [Hos 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#007).md).

all . . . that bear silver--loading themselves with that which will
prove but a burden ([Hab 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006).md).

[Zephaniah 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">zep 1:12</span></span>

search . . . with candles--or lamps; so as to leave no dark corner in it
wherein sin can escape the punishment, of which the Chaldeans are My
instruments (compare [Zep 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#013.md); [Luk
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#008).md).

settled on their lees--"hardened" or crusted; image from the crust
formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed ([Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011).md). The effect of wealthy
undisturbed ease ("lees") on the ungodly is hardening: they become
stupidly secure (compare [Psa 55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019.md);
[Amo 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001).md).

Lord will not do good . . . evil--They deny that God regards human
affairs, or renders good to the good; or evil to the evil, but that all
things go haphazard ([Psa 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004.md); [Mal
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#017).md).

[Zephaniah 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">zep 1:13</span></span>

Therefore their goods shall become a booty, &c.--Fulfilling the prophecy
in [Deu 28:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#030.md), [Deu
28:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#039.md) (compare [Amo
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#011).md).

[Zephaniah 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">zep 1:14</span></span>

voice of . . . day of . . . Lord--that is, Jehovah ushering in that day
with a roar of vengeance against the guilty ([Jer
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md); [Amo
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#002).md). They who will not now heed ([Zep
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#012).md) His voice by His prophets, must
heed it when uttered by the avenging foe.

mighty . . . shall cry . . . bitterly--in hopeless despair; the might on
which Jerusalem now prides itself, shall then fail utterly.

[Zephaniah 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">zep 1:15</span></span>

wasteness . . . desolation--The Hebrew terms by their similarity of
sounds, Shoah, Umeshoah, express the dreary monotony of desolation (see
on [Nah 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#010).md).

[Zephaniah 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">zep 1:16</span></span>

the trumpet--namely, of the besieging enemy ([Amo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#002).md).

alarm--the war shout \[MAURER\].

towers--literally "angles"; for city walls used not to be built in a
direct line, but with sinuous curves and angles, so that besiegers
advancing might be assailed not only in front, but on both sides, caught
as it were in a cul-de-sac; towers were built especially at the angles.
So TACITUS describes the walls of Jerusalem \[Histories, 5.11.7\].

[Zephaniah 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">zep 1:17</span></span>

like blind men--unable to see whither to turn themselves so as to find
an escape from existing evils.

flesh--Hebrew, "bread"; so the Arabic term for "bread" is used for
"flesh" ([Mat 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026).md).

[Zephaniah 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">zep 1:18</span></span>

Neither . . . silver nor . . . gold shall . . . deliver them, &c.--
([Pro 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#004).md).

fire of his jealousy-- ([Eze 38:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze038.htm#019).md);
His wrath jealous for His honor consuming the guilty like fire.

make even a speedy riddance of all--rather, a "consummation" (complete
destruction: "full end," [Jer 46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028.md);
[Eze 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013).md) "altogether sudden"
\[MAURER\]. "A consumption, and that a sudden one" \[CALVIN\].
