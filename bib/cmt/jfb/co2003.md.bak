### [2 Corinthians Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md)

[2 Corinthians 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">co2 3:1</span></span>

THE SOLE COMMENDATION HE NEEDS TO PROVE GOD'S SANCTION OF HIS MINISTRY
HE HAS IN HIS CORINTHIAN CONVERTS: HIS MINISTRY EXCELS THE MOSAIC, AS
THE GOSPEL OF LIFE AND LIBERTY EXCELS THE LAW OF CONDEMNATION. (2Co.
3:1-18)

Are we beginning again to recommend ourselves ([Co2
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012).md) (as some of them might say he
had done in his first Epistle; or, a reproof to "some" who had begun
doing so)!

commendation--recommendation. (Compare [Co2
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#018).md). The "some" refers to
particular persons of the "many" ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017).md) teachers who opposed him, and
who came to Corinth with letters of recommendation from other churches;
and when leaving that city obtained similar letters from the Corinthians
to other churches. The thirteenth canon of the Council of Chalcedon
(A.D. 451) ordained that "clergymen coming to a city where they were
unknown, should not be allowed to officiate without letters commendatory
from their own bishop." The history ([Act
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027).md) confirms the existence of the
custom here alluded to in the Epistle: "When Apollos was disposed to
pass into Achaia \[Corinth\], the brethren \[of Ephesus\] wrote,
exhorting the disciples to receive him." This was about two years before
the Epistle,and is probably one of the instances to which Paul refers,
as many at Corinth boasted of their being followers of Apollos ([Co1
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#012).md).

[2 Corinthians 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">co2 3:2</span></span>

our epistle--of recommendation.

in our hearts--not letters borne merely in the hands. Your conversion
through my instrumentality, and your faith which is "known of all men"
by widespread report ([Co1 1:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#004).md), and
which is written by memory and affection on my inmost heart and is borne
about wherever I go, is my letter of recommendation ([Co1
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#002).md).

known and read--words akin in root, sound, and sense (so [Co2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013).md). "Ye are known to be my converts
by general knowledge: then ye are known more particularly by your
reflecting my doctrine in your Christian life." The handwriting is first
"known," then the Epistle is "read" \[GROTIUS\] ([Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002.md); [Co1
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025).md). There is not so powerful a
sermon in the world, as a consistent Christian life. The eye of the
world takes in more than the ear. Christians' lives are the only
religious books the world reads. IGNATIUS \[Epistle to the Ephesians,
10\] writes, "Give unbelievers the chance of believing through you.
Consider yourselves employed by God; your lives the form of language in
which He addresses them. Be mild when they are angry, humble when they
are haughty; to their blasphemy oppose prayer without ceasing; to their
inconsistency, a steadfast adherence to your faith."

[2 Corinthians 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">co2 3:3</span></span>

declared--The letter is written so legibly that it can be "read by all
men" ([Co2 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002).md). Translate, "Being
manifestly shown to be an Epistle of Christ"; a letter coming manifestly
from Christ, and "ministered by us," that is, carried about and
presented by us as its (ministering) bearers to those (the world) for
whom it is intended: Christ is the Writer and the Recommender, ye are
the letter recommending us.

written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God--Paul was
the ministering pen or other instrument of writing, as well as the
ministering bearer and presenter of the letter. "Not with ink" stands in
contrast to the letters of commendation which "some" at Corinth ([Co2
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001).md) used. "Ink" is also used here to
include all outward materials for writing, such as the Sinaitic tables
of stone were. These, however, were not written with ink, but "graven"
by "the finger of God" ([Exo 31:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md);
[Exo 32:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#016).md). Christ's Epistle (His
believing members converted by Paul) is better still: it is written not
merely with the finger, but with the "Spirit of the living God"; it is
not the "ministration of death" as the law, but of the "living Spirit"
that "giveth life" ([Co2 3:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md).

not in--not on tables (tablets) of stone, as the ten commandments were
written ([Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007).md).

in fleshy tables of the heart--ALL the best manuscripts read, "On
\[your\] hearts \[which are\] tables of flesh." Once your hearts were
spiritually what the tables of the law were physically, tables of stone,
but God has "taken away the stony heart out of your flesh, given you a
heart of flesh" (fleshy, not fleshly, that is, carnal; hence it is
written, "out of your flesh" that is, your carnal nature), [Eze
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#019.md); [Eze
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#026.md). Compare [Co2
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#002.md), "As ye are our Epistle written in
our hearts," so Christ has in the first instance made you "His Epistle
written with the Spirit in (on) your hearts." I bear on my heart, as a
testimony to all men, that which Christ has by His Spirit written in
your heart \[ALFORD\]. (Compare [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md); [Pro
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#003.md); [Jer
31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031).md). This passage is quoted by
PALEY \[HorÃ&brvbr; PaulinÃ&brvbr;\] as illustrating one peculiarity of
Paul's style, namely, his going off at a word into a parenthetic
reflection: here it is on the word "Epistle." So "savor," [Co2
2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#014.md).

[2 Corinthians 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">co2 3:4</span></span>

And--Greek, "But." "Such confidence, however (namely, of our
'sufficiency,' [Co2 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md); [Co2
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md) --to which he reverts after the
parenthesis--as ministers of the New Testament, 'not hinting,' [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001).md), we have through Christ (not
through ourselves, compare [Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018).md)
toward God" (that is, in our relation to God and His work, the ministry
committed by Him to us, for which we must render an account to Him).
Confidence toward God is solid and real, as looking to Him for the
strength needed now, and also for the reward of grace to be given
hereafter. Compare [Act 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015.md), "hope
toward God." Human confidence is unreal in that it looks to man for its
help and its reward.

[2 Corinthians 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">co2 3:5</span></span>

The Greek is, "Not that we are (even yet after so long experience as
ministers) sufficient to think anything OF ourselves as (coming) FROM
ourselves; but our sufficiency is (derived) FROM God." "From" more
definitely refers to the source out of which a thing comes; "of" is more
general.

to think--Greek, to "reason out" or "devise"; to attain to sound
preaching by our reasonings \[THEODORET\]. The "we" refers here to
ministers ([Pe2 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021).md).

anything--even the least. We cannot expect too little from man, or too
much from God.

[2 Corinthians 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">co2 3:6</span></span>

able--rather, as the Greek is the same, corresponding to [Co2
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md), translate, "sufficient as
ministers" ([Eph 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#007.md); [Col
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023).md).

the new testament--"the new covenant" as contrasted with the Old
Testament or covenant ([Co1 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#025.md);
[Gal 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024).md). He reverts here again to
the contrast between the law on "tables of stone," and that "written by
the Spirit on fleshly tables of the heart" ([Co2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003).md).

not of the letter--joined with "ministers"; ministers not of the mere
literal precept, in which the old law, as then understood, consisted;
"but of the Spirit," that is, the spiritual holiness which lay under the
old law, and which the new covenant brings to light (Mat. 5:17-48) with
new motives added, and a new power of obedience imparted, namely, the
Holy Spirit ([Rom 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006).md). Even in
writing the letter of the New Testament, Paul and the other sacred
writers were ministers not of the letter, but of the spirit. No piety of
spirit could exempt a man from the yoke of the letter of each legal
ordinance under the Old Testament; for God had appointed this as the way
in which He chose a devout Jew to express his state of mind towards God.
Christianity, on the other hand, makes the spirit of our outward
observances everything, and the letter a secondary consideration ([Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024).md). Still the moral law of the ten
commandments, being written by the finger of God, is as obligatory now
as ever; but put more on the Gospel spirit of "love," than on the letter
of a servile obedience, and in a deeper and fuller spirituality (Mat.
5:17-48; [Rom 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009).md). No literal
precepts could fully comprehend the wide range of holiness which LOVE,
the work of the Holy Spirit, under the Gospel, suggests to the
believer's heart instinctively from the word understood in its deep
spirituality.

letter killeth--by bringing home the knowledge of guilt and its
punishment, death; [Co2 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md),
"ministration of death" ([Rom 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009).md).

spirit giveth life--The spirit of the Gospel when brought home to the
heart by the Holy Spirit, gives new spiritual life to a man ([Rom
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md), [Rom
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011).md). This "spirit of life" is for us
in Christ Jesus ([Rom 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#002.md), [Rom
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010).md), who dwells in the believer as a
"quickening" or "life-giving Spirit" ([Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045).md). Note, the spiritualism of
rationalists is very different. It would admit no "stereotyped
revelation," except so much as man's own inner instrument of revelation,
the conscience and reason, can approve of: thus making the conscience
judge of the written word, whereas the apostles make the written word
the judge of the conscience ([Act
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011.md); [Pe1
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#001).md). True spirituality rests on the
whole written word, applied to the soul by the Holy Spirit as the only
infallible interpreter of its far-reaching spirituality. The letter is
nothing without the spirit, in a subject essentially spiritual. The
spirit is nothing without the letter, in a record substantially
historical.

[2 Corinthians 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">co2 3:7</span></span>

the ministration of death--the legal dispensation, summed up in the
Decalogue, which denounces death against man for transgression.

written and engraven in stones--There is no "and" in the Greek. The
literal translation is, "The ministration of death in letters," of which
"engraven on stones" is an explanation. The preponderance of oldest
manuscripts is for the English Version reading. But one (perhaps the
oldest existing manuscript) has "in the letter," which refers to the
preceding words ([Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md), "the
letter killeth," and this seems the probable reading. Even if we read as
English Version, "The ministration of death (written) in letters,"
alludes to the literal precepts of the law as only bringing us the
knowledge of sin and "death," in contrast to "the Spirit" in the Gospel
bringing us "life" ([Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006).md). The
opposition between "the letters" and "the Spirit" ([Co2
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008).md) confirms this. This explains why
the phrase in Greek should be "in letters," instead of the ordinary one
which English Version has substituted, "written and."

was glorious--literally, "was made (invested) in glory," glory was the
atmosphere with which it was encompassed.

could not steadfastly behold--literally, "fix their eyes on." [Exo
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md), "The skin of his face shone;
and they were AFRAID to come nigh him." "Could not," therefore means
here, "for FEAR." The "glory of Moses' countenance" on Sinai passed away
when the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the
dispensation which he represented ([Co2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011).md), as contrasted with the
permanency of the Christian dispensation ([Co2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011).md).

[2 Corinthians 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">co2 3:8</span></span>

be rather glorious--literally, "be rather (that is, still more,
invested) in glory." "Shall be," that is, shall be found to be in part
now, but fully when the glory of Christ and His saints shall be
revealed.

[2 Corinthians 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">co2 3:9</span></span>

ministration of condemnation--the law regarded in the "letter" which
"killeth" ([Co2 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md); [Rom
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009).md). The oldest existing
manuscript seems to read as English Version. But most of the almost
contemporary manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, read, "If to the
ministration of condemnation there be glory."

the ministration of righteousness--the Gospel, which especially reveals
the righteousness of God ([Rom 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017).md),
and imputes righteousness to men through faith in Christ ([Rom
3:21-28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#021.md); [Rom
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), [Rom
4:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#022).md), and imparts righteousness by
the Spirit ([Rom 8:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001).md).

exceed--"abound."

[2 Corinthians 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">co2 3:10</span></span>

For even the ministration of condemnation, the law, [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md) (which has been glorified at Sinai
in Moses' person), has now (English Version translates less fitly, "was
made . . . had") lost its glory in this respect by reason of the
surpassing glory (of the Gospel): as the light of the stars and moon
fades in the presence of the sun.

[2 Corinthians 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">co2 3:11</span></span>

was glorious--literally, "was with glory"; or "marked by glory."

that which remaineth--abideth ([Rev
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#006).md). Not "the ministry," but the
Spirit, and His accompaniments, life and righteousness.

is glorious--literally, "is in glory." The Greek "with" or "by" is
appropriately applied to that of which the glory was transient. "In" to
that of which the glory is permanent. The contrast of the Old and New
Testaments proves that Paul's chief opponents at Corinth were Judaizers.

[2 Corinthians 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">co2 3:12</span></span>

such hope--of the future glory, which shall result from the ministration
of the Gospel ([Co2 3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008).md).

plainness of speech--openness; without reserve ([Co2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md); [Co2
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#002).md).

[2 Corinthians 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">co2 3:13</span></span>

We use no disguise, "as Moses put a veil over his face, that the
children of Israel might not look steadfastly upon the end of that which
was to be done away" \[ELLICOTT and others\]. The view of [Exo
34:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md), according to the Septuagint
is adopted by Paul, that Moses in going in to speak to God removed the
veil till he came out and had spoken to the people; and then when he had
done speaking, he put on the veil that they might not look on the end,
or the fading, of that transitory glory. The veil was the symbol of
concealment, put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that God's
revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment
\[ALFORD\]. But ALFORD'S view does not accord with [Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md); the Israelites "could not look
steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance."
Plainly Moses' veil was put on because of their not having been able to
"look steadfastly at him." Paul here ([Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013).md) passes from the literal fact to
the truth symbolized by it, the blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the
ultimate end of the law: stating that Moses put on the veil that they
might not look steadfastly at (Christ, [Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004)) the end of that (law.md) which
(like Moses' glory) is done away. Not that Moses had this purpose; but
often God attributes to His prophets the purpose which He has Himself.
Because the Jews would not see, God judicially gave them up so as not to
see. The glory of Moses' face is antitypically Christ s glory shining
behind the veil of legal ordinances. The veil which has been taken off
to the believer is left on to the unbelieving Jew, so that he should not
see ([Isa 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010.md); [Act
28:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#026).md). He stops short at the
letter of the law, not seeing the end of it. The evangelical glory of
the law, like the shining of Moses' face, cannot be borne by a carnal
people, and therefore remains veiled to them until the Spirit comes to
take away the veil ([Co2 3:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014).md)
\[CAMERON\].

[2 Corinthians 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">co2 3:14</span></span>

Parenthetical: Of Christians in general. He resumes the subject of the
ministry, [Co2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md).

minds--Greek, "mental perceptions"; "understandings."

blinded--rather, "hardened." The opposite to "looking steadfastly at the
end" of the law ([Co2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013).md). The veil
on Moses' face is further typical of the veil that is on their hearts.

untaken away . . . which veil--rather, "the same veil . . . remaineth
untaken away \[literally, not unveiled\], so that they do not see THAT
it (not the veil as English Version, but 'THE OLD TESTAMENT,' or
covenant of legal ordinances) is done away ([Co2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007.md), [Co2
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#011.md), [Co2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013).md) in Christ" or, as BENGEL,
"Because it is done away in Christ," that is, it is not done away save
in Christ: the veil therefore remains untaken away from them, because
they will not come to Christ, who does away, with the law as a mere
letter. If they once saw that the law is done away in Him, the veil
would be no longer on their hearts in reading it publicly in their
synagogues (so "reading" means, [Act
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021).md). I prefer the former.

[2 Corinthians 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">co2 3:15</span></span>

the veil is--rather, "a veil lieth upon their heart" (their
understanding, affected by the corrupt will, [Joh
8:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#043.md); [Co1
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014).md). The Tallith was worn in the
synagogue by every worshipper, and to this veil hanging over the breast
there may be an indirect allusion here (see on [Co1
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#004).md): the apostle making it symbolize
the spiritual veil on their heart.

[2 Corinthians 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">co2 3:16</span></span>

Moses took off the veil on entering into the presence of the Lord. So as
to the Israelites whom Moses represents, "whensoever their heart (it)
turns (not as English Version, 'shall turn') to the Lord, the veil is
(by the very fact; not as English Version, 'shall be') taken away." [Exo
34:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#034.md) is the allusion; not [Exo
34:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md), as ALFORD thinks. Whenever
the Israelites turn to the Lord, who is the Spirit of the law, the veil
is taken off their hearts in the presence of the Lord: as the literal
veil was taken off by Moses in going before God: no longer resting on
the dead letter, the veil, they by the Spirit commune with God and with
the inner spirit of the Mosaic covenant (which answers to the glory of
Moses' face unveiled in God's presence).

[2 Corinthians 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">co2 3:17</span></span>

the Lord--Christ ([Co2 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md), [Co2
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016.md); [Co2
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005).md).

is that Spirit--is THE Spirit, namely, that Spirit spoken of in [Co2
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006.md), and here resumed after the
parenthesis ([Co2 3:7-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#007).md): Christ is
the Spirit and "end" of the Old Testament, who giveth life to it,
whereas "the letter killeth" ([Co1
15:45](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#045.md); [Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010), end.md).

where the Spirit of the Lord is--in a man's "heart" ([Co2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md); [Rom
8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009).md).

there is liberty-- ([Joh 8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036).md).
"There," and there only. Such cease to be slaves to the letter, which
they were while the veil was on their heart. They are free to serve God
in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus ([Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003).md): they have no longer the spirit
of bondage, but of free sonship ([Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md); [Gal
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#007).md). "Liberty" is opposed to the
letter (of the legal ordinances), and to the veil, the badge of slavery:
also to the fear which the Israelites felt in beholding Moses' glory
unveiled ([Exo 34:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md); [Jo1
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#018).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">co2 3:18</span></span>

But we all--Christians, as contrasted with the Jews who have a veil on
their hearts, answering to Moses' veil on his face. He does not resume
reference to ministers till [Co2 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md).

with open face--Translate, "with unveiled face" (the veil being removed
at conversion): contrasted with "hid" ([Co2
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003).md).

as in a glass--in a mirror, namely, the Gospel which reflects the glory
of God and Christ ([Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md); [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Jam
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md), [Jam
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#025).md).

are changed into the same image--namely, the image of Christ's glory,
spiritually now ([Rom 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md); [Jo1
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md); an earnest of the bodily change
hereafter ([Phi 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021).md). However many
they be, believers all reflect the same image of Christ more or less: a
proof of the truth of Christianity.

from glory to glory--from one degree of glory to another. As Moses' face
caught a reflection of God's glory from being in His presence, so
believers are changed into His image by beholding Him.

even as, &c.--Just such a transformation "as" was to be expected from
"the Lord the Spirit" (not as English Version, "the Spirit of the Lord")
\[ALFORD\] ([Co2 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017).md): "who receives
of the things of Christ, and shows them to us" ([Joh
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014.md); [Rom
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010).md). (Compare as to hereafter,
[Psa 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004).md).
