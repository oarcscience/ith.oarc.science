### [Joshua Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001)

[Joshua 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jos 15:1</span></span>

BORDERS OF THE LOT OF JUDAH. ([Jos
15:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001))

This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah--In what
manner the lot was drawn on this occasion the sacred historian does not
say; but it is probable that the method adopted was similar to that
described in [Jos 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#010). Though the
general survey of the country had not been completed, some rough draft
or delineation of the first conquered part must have been made, and
satisfactory evidence obtained that it was large enough to furnish three
cantons, before all the tribes cast lots for them; and they fell to
Judah, Ephraim, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The lot of Judah came
first, in token of the pre-eminence of that tribe over all the others;
and its destined superiority thus received the visible sanction of God.
The territory, assigned to it as a possession, was large and extensive,
being bounded on the south by the wilderness of Zin, and the southern
extremity of the Salt Sea ([Num
34:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#003)); on the east, by that sea,
extending to the point where it receives the waters of the Jordan; on
the north, by a line drawn nearly parallel to Jerusalem, across the
country, from the northern extremity of the Salt Sea to the southern
limits of the Philistine territory, and to the Mediterranean; and on the
west this sea was its boundary, as far as Sihor (Wady El-Arish).

[Joshua 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jos 15:2</span></span>

the bay--Hebrew, "tongue." It pushes its waters out in this form to a
great distance \[ROBINSON\].

[Joshua 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jos 15:3</span></span>

Maaleh-akrabbim--Hebrew, "the ascent of scorpions"; a pass in the "bald
mountain" (see on [Jos 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017)),
probably much infested by these venomous reptiles.

[Joshua 15:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jos 15:5</span></span>

the end--that is, the mouth of the Jordan.

[Joshua 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jos 15:6</span></span>

Beth-hogla--now Ain Hajla, a fine spring of clear and sweet water, at
the northern extremity of the Dead Sea, about two miles from the Jordan
\[ROBINSON\].

Beth-arabah--"the house," or "place of solitude," in the desert of Judah
([Jos 15:61](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061)).

stone of Bohan the son of Reuben--the sepulchral monument of a Reubenite
leader, who had been distinguished for his bravery, and had fallen in
the Canaanite war.

[Joshua 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jos 15:7</span></span>

Achor--(see on [Jos 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#026)).

Adummim--a rising ground in the wilderness of Jericho, on the south of
the little brook that flowed near Jericho ([Jos
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001)).

En-shemesh--"the fountain of the sun"; "either the present well of the
apostle, below Bethany, on the road to Jericho, or the fountain near to
St. Saba" \[ROBINSON\].

En-rogel--"the fuller's fountain," on the southeast of Jerusalem, below
the spot where the valleys of Jehoshaphat and Hinnom unite.

[Joshua 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jos 15:13</span></span>

CALEB'S PORTION AND CONQUEST. ([Jos
15:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#013))

unto Caleb he gave a part among the children of Judah--(See on [Jos
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos014.htm#006)).

[Joshua 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jos 15:14</span></span>

drove thence the three sons of Anak--rather three chiefs of the Anakim
race. This exploit is recorded to the honor of Caleb, as the success of
it was the reward of his trust in God.

[Joshua 15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jos 15:15</span></span>

Debir--"oracle." Its former name, Kirjath-sepher, signifies "city of the
book," being probably a place where public registers were kept.

[Joshua 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jos 15:16</span></span>

OTHNIEL, FOR HIS VALOR, HAS ACHSAH TO WIFE. ([Jos
15:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016))

He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher--This offer was made as an incentive to
youthful bravery (see on [Sa1 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025));
and the prize was won by Othniel, Caleb's younger brother ([Jdg
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#013); [Jdg
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#009)). This was the occasion of drawing
out the latent energies of him who was destined to be the first judge in
Israel.

[Joshua 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">jos 15:18</span></span>

as she came unto him--that is, when about to remove from her father's to
her husband's house. She suddenly alighted from her travelling
equipage--a mark of respect to her father, and a sign of making some
request. She had urged Othniel to broach the matter, but he not wishing
to do what appeared like evincing a grasping disposition, she resolved
herself to speak out. Taking advantage of the parting scene when a
parent's heart was likely to be tender, she begged (as her marriage
portion consisted of a field which, having a southern exposure, was
comparatively an arid and barren waste) he would add the adjoining one,
which abounded in excellent springs. The request being reasonable, it
was granted; and the story conveys this important lesson in religion,
that if earthly parents are ready to bestow on their children that which
is good, much more will our heavenly Father give every necessary
blessing to them who ask Him.

[Joshua 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jos 15:21</span></span>

CITIES OF JUDAH. (Jos. 15:21-63)

the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah--There is
given a list of cities within the tribal territory of Judah, arranged in
four divisions, corresponding to the districts of which it
consisted--the cities in the southern part ([Jos
15:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#021)), those in the lowlands ([Jos
15:33-47](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#033)), those in the highlands
([Jos 15:48-60](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#048)), and those in the
desert ([Jos 15:61-62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#061)). One gets the
best idea of the relative situation of these cities by looking at the
map.
