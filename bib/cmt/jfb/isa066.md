Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Isaiah Chapter 66](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 66:1</span></span>

THE HUMBLE COMFORTED, THE UNGODLY CONDEMNED, AT THE LORD'S APPEARING:
JERUSALEM MADE A JOY ON EARTH. (Isa. 66:1-24)

heaven . . . throne . . . where is . . . house . . . ye build--The same
sentiment is expressed, as a precautionary proviso for the majesty of
God in deigning to own any earthly temple as His, as if He could be
circumscribed by space ([Kg1 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027).md) in
inaugurating the temple of stone; next, as to the temple of the Holy
Ghost ([Act 7:48-49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048).md); lastly here, as
to "the tabernacle of God with men" ([Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Eze
43:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#004.md), [Eze
43:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#007.md); [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003).md).

where--rather, "what is this house that ye are building, &c.--what place
is this for My rest?" \[VITRINGA\].

[Isaiah 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 66:2</span></span>

have been--namely, made by Me. Or, absolutely, were things made; and
therefore belong to Me, the Creator \[JEROME\].

look--have regard.

poor--humble ([Isa 57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015).md).

trembleth at . . . word-- ([Kg2 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#011.md),
[Kg2 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#019.md); [Ezr
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#004).md). The spiritual temple of the
heart, though not superseding the outward place of worship, is God's
favorite dwelling ([Joh 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023).md). In the
final state in heaven there shall be "no temple," but "the Lord God"
Himself ([Rev 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 66:3</span></span>

God loathes even the sacrifices of the wicked ([Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md); [Pro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008.md); [Pro
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#009).md).

is as if--LOWTH not so well omits these words: "He that killeth an ox
(presently after) murders a man" (as in [Eze
23:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#039).md). But the omission in the Hebrew
of "is as if"--increases the force of the comparison. Human victims were
often offered by the heathen.

dog's neck--an abomination according to the Jewish law ([Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018).md); perhaps made so, because dogs
were venerated in Egypt. He does not honor this abomination by using the
word "sacrifice," but uses the degrading term, "cut off a dog's neck"
([Exo 13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md); [Exo
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#020).md). Dogs as unclean are associated
with swine ([Mat 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#006.md); [Pe2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#022).md).

oblation--unbloody: in antithesis to "swine's blood" ([Isa
65:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#004).md).

burneth--Hebrew, "he who offereth as a memorial oblation" ([Lev
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#002).md).

they have chosen--opposed to the two first clauses of [Isa
66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md) : "as they have chosen their own
ways, &c., so I will choose their delusions.

[Isaiah 66:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 66:4</span></span>

delusions-- ([Th2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011).md), answering to
"their own ways" ([Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md); so [Pro
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md). However, the Hebrew means
rather "vexations," "calamities," which also the parallelism to "fears"
requires; "choose their calamities" means, "choose the calamities which
they thought to escape by their own ways."

their fears--the things they feared, to avert which their idolatrous
"abominations" ([Isa 66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003).md) were
practised.

I called . . . none . . . answer--(See on [Isa
65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012.md); [Isa
65:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#024.md); [Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013).md).

did . . . chose--not only did the evil deed, but did it deliberately as
a matter of choice ([Rom 1:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032).md). "They
chose that in which I delighted not"; therefore, "I will choose" that in
which they delight not, the "calamities" and "fears" which they were
most anxious to avert.

before mine eyes--(See on [Isa 65:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 66:5</span></span>

tremble at . . . word--the same persons as in [Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md), the believing few among the
Jews.

cast you out for my name's sake--excommunicate, as if too polluted to
worship with them ([Isa 65:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#005).md). So in
Christ's first sojourn on earth ([Mat
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022.md); [Joh
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md), [Joh
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#034.md); [Joh
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md); [Joh
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021).md). So it shall be again in the
last times, when the believing shall be few ([Luk
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#008).md).

Let the Lord be glorified--the mocking challenge of the persecutors, as
if their violence towards you was from zeal for God. "Let the Lord show
Himself glorious," namely, by manifesting Himself in your behalf; as the
parallelism to, "He shall appear to your joy," requires (as in [Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); compare [Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md); [Isa
57:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#004).md). So again Christ on the cross
([Mat 27:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042).md).

appear to your joy--giving you "joy" instead of your "rebuke" ([Isa
25:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008).md).

[Isaiah 66:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 66:6</span></span>

God, from Jerusalem and His "temple," shall take vengeance on the enemy
([Eze 43:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#001.md); [Zac
12:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md); [Zac
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#003.md), [Zac
14:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#019).md). The abrupt language of this
verse marks the suddenness with which God destroys the hostile Gentile
host outside: as [Isa 66:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005.md) refers to
the confounding of the unbelieving Jews.

voice of noise--that is, the Lord's loud-sounding voice ([Psa
68:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#033.md); [Psa
29:3-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#003.md); [Th1
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 66:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 66:7</span></span>

she--Zion.

Before . . . travailed . . . brought forth--The accession of numbers,
and of prosperity to her, shall be sudden beyond all expectation and
unattended with painful effort ([Isa
54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md), [Isa
54:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#004).md). Contrast with this case of
the future Jewish Church the travail-pains of the Christian Church in
bringing forth "a man child" ([Rev
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#002.md), [Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005).md). A man child's birth is in the
East a matter of special joy, while that of a female is not so;
therefore, it here means the manly sons of the restored Jewish Church,
the singular being used collectively for the plural: or the many sons
being regarded as one under Messiah, who shall then be manifested as
their one representative Head.

[Isaiah 66:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 66:8</span></span>

earth--rather, to suit the parallelism, "is a country (put for the
people in it) brought forth in one day?" \[LOWTH\]. In English Version
it means, The earth brings forth its productions gradually, not in one
day ([Mar 4:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#028).md).

at once--In this case, contrary to the usual growth of the nations by
degrees, Israel starts into maturity at once.

for--rather, "is a nation born at once, that Zion has, so soon as she
travailed, brought forth?" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 66:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 66:9</span></span>

cause to bring forth, and shut--rather, "Shall I who beget, restrain the
birth?" \[LOWTH\], ([Isa 37:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#003.md); [Hos
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#013).md); that is, Shall I who have
begun, not finish My work of restoring Israel? ([Sa1
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012.md); [Rom
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md); [Phi
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006).md).

shut--(compare [Rev 3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 66:10</span></span>

love . . . mourn for her-- ([Psa
102:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#014.md), [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md); [Psa
122:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 66:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 66:11</span></span>

suck-- ([Isa 60:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#005.md), [Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016.md); [Isa
61:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#006.md); [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023).md).

abundance--Hebrew, "the ray-like flow of her opulence," that is, with
the milk spouting out from her full breasts (answering to the parallel,
"breast of her consolations") in ray-like streams \[GESENIUS\].

[Isaiah 66:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 66:12</span></span>

extend--I will turn peace (prosperity) upon her, like a river turned in
its course \[GESENIUS\]. Or, "I will spread peace over her as an
overflowing river" \[BARNES\], ([Isa
48:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#018).md).

flowing stream--as the Nile by its overflow fertilizes the whole of
Egypt.

borne upon . . . sides--(See on [Isa
60:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#004).md).

her . . . her--If "ye" refers to the Jews, translate, "ye shall be borne
upon their sides . . . their knees," namely, those of the Gentiles, as
in [Isa 49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022.md); and as "suck" ([Isa
60:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#016).md) refers to the Jews sucking the
Gentile wealth. However, English Version gives a good sense: The Jews,
and all who love Jehovah ([Isa 66:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#010).md),
"shall suck, and be borne" by her as a mother.

[Isaiah 66:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 66:13</span></span>

mother-- ([Isa 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015).md).

comforteth-- ([Isa 40:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 66:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 66:14</span></span>

bones--which once were "dried up" by the "fire" of God's wrath ([Lam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#013).md), shall live again ([Pro
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#008.md); [Pro
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#030.md); [Eze
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001), &c..md).

flourish . . . herb-- ([Rom 11:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015).md).

known toward--manifested in behalf of.

[Isaiah 66:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 66:15</span></span>

([Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md); [Psa
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#003.md); [Hab
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#005.md); [Th2
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#008.md); [Pe2
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#007).md).

chariots . . . whirlwind-- ([Jer
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013).md).

render--as the Hebrew elsewhere ([Job
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#013.md); [Psa
78:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#038).md) means to "allay" or "stay
wrath." MAURER translates it so here: He stays His anger with nothing
but fury," &c.; nothing short of pouring out all His fiery fury will
satisfy His wrath.

fury--"burning heat" \[LOWTH\], to which the parallel, "flames of fire,"
answers.

[Isaiah 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 66:16</span></span>

Rather, "With fire will Jehovah judge, and with His sword (He will
judge) all flesh." The parallelism and collocation of the Hebrew words
favor this ([Isa 65:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#012).md).

all flesh--that is, all who are the objects of His wrath. The godly
shall be hidden by the Lord in a place of safety away from the scene of
judgment ([Isa 26:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md); [Psa
31:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#020.md); [Th1
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 66:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 66:17</span></span>

in . . . gardens--Hebrew and the Septuagint rather require, "for
(entering into) gardens," namely, to sacrifice there \[MAURER\].

behind one tree--rather, "following one," that is, some idol or other,
which, from contempt, he does not name \[MAURER\]. VITRINGA, &c., think
the Hebrew for "one," Ahhadh, to be the name of the god; called Adad
(meaning One) in Syria (compare [Act
17:23](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023).md). The idol's power was
represented by inclined rays, as of the sun shining on the earth.
GESENIUS translates, "following one," namely, Hierophant ("priest"), who
led the rest in performing the sacred rites.

in . . . midst--namely, of the garden (see on [Isa
65:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#003).md).

mouse--legally unclean ([Lev 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#029).md)
because it was an idol to the heathen (see on [Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md); [Sa1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004).md). Translate, "the field mouse," or
"dormouse" \[BOCHART\]. The Pharisees with their self-righteous
purifications, and all mere formalists, are included in the same
condemnation, described in language taken from the idolatries prevalent
in Isaiah's times.

[Isaiah 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 66:18</span></span>

know--not in the Hebrew. Rather, understand the words by aposiopesis; it
is usual in threats to leave the persons threatened to supply the hiatus
from their own fears, owing to conscious guilt: "For I . . . their works
and thoughts," &c.; namely, will punish \[MAURER\].

it shall come--the time is come that I will, &c. \[MAURER\].

gather . . . nations--against Jerusalem, where the ungodly Jews shall
perish; and then the Lord at last shall fight for Jerusalem against
those nations: and the survivors ([Isa
66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019).md) shall "see God's glory" ([Zac
12:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#008.md); [Zac
14:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md), [Zac
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009).md).

tongues--which have been many owing to sin, being confounded at Babel,
but which shall again be one in Christ ([Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md); [Zep
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009.md); [Rev
7:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#009).md).

[Isaiah 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 66:19</span></span>

sign--a banner on a high place, to indicate the place of meeting for the
dispersed Jewish exiles, preparatory to their return to their land ([Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md); [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010).md).

those that escape of them--the Gentile survivors spared by God (see on
[Isa 66:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018.md); [Zac
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md). [Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007.md); and [Zac
14:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016.md) represent it, not that the
Jews go as missionaries to the Gentiles, but that the Gentiles come up
to Jerusalem to learn the Lord's ways there.

Tarshish--Tartessus in Spain, in the west.

Pul--east and north of Africa: probably the same as Philoe, an island in
the Nile, called by the Egyptians Pilak, that is, the border country,
being between Egypt and Ethiopia \[BOCHART\].

Lud--the Libyans of Africa ([Gen
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#013).md), Ludim being son of Mizraim
(Egypt): an Ethiopian people famous as bowmen ([Jer
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#009).md): employed as mercenaries by Tyre
and Egypt ([Eze 27:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#010.md); [Eze
30:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#005).md).

Tubal--Tibarenians, in Asia Minor, south of the Caucasus, between the
Black Sea and Araxes. Or, the Iberians \[JOSEPHUS\]. Italy \[JEROME\].

Javan--the Greeks; called Ionians, including all the descendants of
Javan, both in Greece and in Asia Minor ([Gen
10:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002).md).

my glory . . . Gentiles-- ([Mal 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011).md).

[Isaiah 66:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 66:20</span></span>

they--the Gentiles ([Isa 66:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#019).md).

bring . . . your brethren--the Jews, back to the Holy Land ([Isa
49:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#022).md). It cannot mean the mere
entrance of the Jews into the Christian Church; for such an entrance
would be by faith, not upon "horses, litters, and mules" \[HOUBIGANT\].
"Offering" is metaphorical, as in [Rom
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md).

horses--not much used by the Jews. The Gentiles are here represented as
using their modes of conveyance to "bring" the Jews to Jerusalem.

chariots--as these are not found in Oriental caravans, translate,
"vehicles," namely, borne, not drawn on wheels.

litters--covered sedans for the rich.

upon swift beasts--dromedaries: from Hebrew root, "to dance," from their
bounding motion, often accelerated by music \[BOCHART\]. Panniers were
thrown across the dromedaries' back for poorer women \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 66:21</span></span>

of them--the Gentiles.

priests . . . Levites--for spiritual worship: enjoying the direct access
to God which was formerly enjoyed by the ministers of the temple alone
([Pe1 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009.md); [Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 66:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 66:22</span></span>

([Isa 65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017.md); [Pe2
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013.md); [Rev
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 66:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#023.md)

Literally, "As often as the new moon (shall be) in its own new moon,"
that is, every month ([Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md).

sabbath--which is therefore perpetually obligatory on earth.

all flesh-- ([Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002.md); [Psa
72:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#011).md).

before me--at Jerusalem ([Jer
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016).md).

[Isaiah 66:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#024.md)

go forth, and look--as the Israelites looked at the carcasses of the
Egyptians destroyed at the Red Sea ([Exo
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#030.md); compare [Isa
26:14-19](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#014.md); [Psa
58:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#010.md); [Psa
49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md); [Mal
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001).md).

carcasses, &c.-- ([Isa 66:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#016).md), those
slain by the Lord in the last great battle near Jerusalem ([Zac
12:2-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#002.md); [Zac
14:2-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002).md); type of the final destruction
of all sinners.

worm . . . not die-- ([Mar 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md), [Mar
9:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#046.md), [Mar
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048).md). Image of hell, from bodies left
unburied in the valley of Hinnom (whence comes Gehenna, or "hell"),
south of Jerusalem, where a perpetual fire was kept to consume the
refuse thrown there ([Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033).md). It
shall not be inconsistent with true love for the godly to look with
satisfaction on God's vengeance on the wicked ([Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010).md). May God bless this Commentary,
and especially its solemn close, to His glory, and to the edification of
the writer and the readers of it, for Jesus' sake!
