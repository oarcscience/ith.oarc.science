### [4 Kings (2 Kings) Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">kg2 4:1</span></span>

ELISHA AUGMENTS THE WIDOW'S OIL. ([Kg2
4:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001).md)

there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets--They were allowed to marry as well as the priests and Levites.
Her husband, not enjoying the lucrative profits of business, had nothing
but a professional income, which, in that irreligious age, would be
precarious and very scanty, so that he was not in a condition to provide
for his family.

the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen--By the
enactment of the law, a creditor was entitled to claim the person and
children of the insolvent debtor, and compel them to serve him as
bondmen till the year of jubilee should set them free.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">kg2 4:2</span></span>

a pot--or cruet of oil. This comprising her whole stock of domestic
utensils, he directs her to borrow empty vessels not a few; then,
secluding herself with her children, \[the widow\] was to pour oil from
her cruse into the borrowed vessels, and, selling the oil, discharge the
debt, and then maintain herself and family with the remainder.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">kg2 4:6</span></span>

the oil stayed--that is, ceased to multiply; the benevolent object for
which the miracle had been wrought having been accomplished.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">kg2 4:8</span></span>

PROMISES A SON TO THE SHUNAMMITE. ([Kg2
4:8-17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#008).md)

Elisha passed to Shunem--now Sulam, in the plain of Esdraelon, at the
southwestern base of Little Hermon. The prophet, in his journey, was
often entertained here by one of its pious and opulent inhabitants.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">kg2 4:10</span></span>

Let us make a little chamber--not build, but prepare it. She meant a
room in the oleah, the porch, or gateway ([Sa2
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md); [Kg1
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#019).md), attached to the front of the
house, leading into the court and inner apartments. The front of the
house, excepting the door, is a dead wall, and hence this room is called
a chamber in the wall. It is usually appropriated to the use of
strangers, or lodgers for a night, and, from its seclusion, convenient
for study or retirement.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">kg2 4:13</span></span>

what is to be done for thee?--Wishing to testify his gratitude for the
hospitable attentions of this family, he announced to her the birth of a
son "about this time next year." The interest and importance of such an
intelligence can only be estimated by considering that Oriental women,
and Jewish in particular, connect ideas of disgrace with barrenness, and
cherish a more ardent desire for children than women in any other part
of the world ([Gen 18:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">kg2 4:19</span></span>

RAISES HER DEAD SON. (2Ki. 4:18-37)

My head, my head!--The cries of the boy, the part affected, and the
season of the year, make it probable that he had been overtaken by a
stroke of the sun. Pain, stupor, and inflammatory fever are the symptoms
of the disease, which is often fatal.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">kg2 4:22</span></span>

she called unto her husband--Her heroic concealment of the death from
her husband is not the least interesting feature of the story.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">kg2 4:24</span></span>

Drive, and go forward--It is usual for women to ride on asses,
accompanied by a servant, who walks behind and drives the beast with his
stick, goading the animal at the speed required by his mistress. The
Shunammite had to ride a journey of five or six hours to the top of
Carmel.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">kg2 4:26</span></span>

And she answered, It is well--Her answer was purposely brief and vague
to Gehazi, for she reserved a full disclosure of her loss for the ear of
the prophet himself. She had met Gehazi at the foot of the hill, and she
stopped not in her ascent till she had disburdened her heavy-laden
spirit at Elisha's feet. The violent paroxysm of grief into which she
fell on approaching him, appeared to Gehazi an act of disrespect to his
master; he was preparing to remove her when the prophet's observant eye
perceived that she was overwhelmed with some unknown cause of distress.
How great is a mother's love! how wondrous are the works of Providence!
The Shunammite had not sought a son from the prophet--her child was, in
every respect, the free gift of God. Was she then allowed to rejoice in
the possession for a little, only to be pierced with sorrow by seeing
the corpse of the cherished boy? Perish, doubt and unbelief! This event
happened that "the works of God should be made manifest" in His prophet,
"and for the glory of God."

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">kg2 4:29</span></span>

take my staff . . . and lay . . . upon the face of the child--The staff
was probably an official rod of a certain form and size. Necromancers
used to send their staff with orders to the messengers to let it come in
contact with nothing by the way that might dissipate or destroy the
virtue imparted to it. Some have thought that Elisha himself entertained
similar ideas, and was under an impression that the actual application
of his staff would serve as well as the touch of his hand. But this is
an imputation dishonorable to the character of the prophet. He wished to
teach the Shunammite, who obviously placed too great dependence upon
him, a memorable lesson to look to God. By sending his servant forward
to lay his staff on the child, he raised \[the Shunammite's\]
expectations, but, at the same time, taught her that his own help was
unavailing--"there was neither voice, nor hearing." The command, to
salute no man by the way, showed the urgency of the mission, not simply
as requiring the avoidance of the tedious and unnecessary greetings so
common in the East ([Luk 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001).md), but
the exercise of faith and prayer. The act of Gehazi was allowed to fail,
in order to free the Shunammite, and the people of Israel at large, of
the superstitious notion of supposing a miraculous virtue resided in any
person, or in any rod, and to prove that it was only through earnest
prayer and faith in the power of God and for His glory that this and
every miracle was to be performed.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">kg2 4:34</span></span>

lay upon the child, &c.--(see [Kg1
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#021.md); [Act
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#010).md). Although this contact with a
dead body would communicate ceremonial uncleanness, yet, in performing
the great moral duties of piety and benevolence, positive laws were
sometimes dispensed with, particularly by the prophets.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">kg2 4:35</span></span>

the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes--These were
the first acts of restored respiration, and they are described as
successive steps. Miracles were for the most part performed
instantaneously; but sometimes, also, they were advanced progressively
towards completion ([Kg1 18:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#044.md);
[Mar 8:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#024).md).

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">kg2 4:38</span></span>

PURIFIES DEADLY POTTAGE. ([Kg2
4:38-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#038).md)

there was a dearth in the land--(see on [Kg2
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#001).md).

the sons of the prophets were sitting before him--When receiving
instruction, the scholars sat under their masters. This refers to their
being domiciled under the same roof (compare [Kg2
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#001).md).

Set on the great pot--As it is most likely that the Jewish would
resemble the Egyptian "great pot," it is seen by the monumental
paintings to have been a large goblet, with two long legs, which stood
over the fire on the floor. The seethed pottage consisted of meat cut
into small pieces, mixed with rice or meal and vegetables.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">kg2 4:39</span></span>

went out into the field to gather herbs--Wild herbs are very extensively
used by the people in the East, even by those who possess their own
vegetable gardens. The fields are daily searched for mallow, asparagus,
and other wild plants.

wild vine--literally, "the vine of the field," supposed to be the
colocynth, a cucumber, which, in its leaves, tendrils, and fruit, bears
a strong resemblance to the wild vine. The "gourds," or fruit, are of
the color and size of an orange bitter to the taste, causing colic, and
exciting the nerves, eaten freely they would occasion such a derangement
of the stomach and bowels as to be followed by death. The meal which
Elisha poured into the pot was a symbolic sign that the noxious quality
of the herbs was removed.

lap full--The hyke, or large cloak, is thrown loosely over the left
shoulder and fastened under the right arm, so as to form a lap or apron.

[4 Kings (2 Kings) 4:43](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">kg2 4:43</span></span>

SATISFIES A HUNDRED MEN WITH TWENTY LOAVES. ([Kg2
4:42-44](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#042).md)

They shall eat, and shall leave thereof--This was not a miracle of
Elisha, but only a prediction of one by the word of the Lord. Thus it
differed widely from those of Christ ([Mat
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#037.md); [Mar
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#008.md); [Luk
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#017.md); [Joh
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#012).md).
