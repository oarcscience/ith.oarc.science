<p>
<p>Jerusalem . . . city of truth--that is, faithful to her God, who is the God of truth (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#021">Isa 1:21</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#026">Isa 1:26</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017">Joh 17:17</A>). Never yet fully fulfilled, therefore still to be so. 
<p>
<p>the mountain of the Lord-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2-3</A>). 
<p>
<p>holy mountain-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#023">Jer 31:23</A>).

The promise of long life was esteemed one of the greatest blessings in the Jewish theocracy with its temporal rewards of obedience (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012">Exo 20:12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#040">Deu 4:40</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_006">zac 8:6</A></FONT></span></p>However impossible these things just promised by Me seem to you, they are not so with God. The "remnant" that had returned from the captivity, beholding the city desolate and the walls and houses in ruins, could hardly believe what God promised. The expression "remnant" glances at their ingratitude in rating so low God's power, though they had experienced it so "marvellously" displayed in their restoration. A great source of unbelief is, men "limit" God's power by their own (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019">Psa 78:19-20</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041">Psa 78:41</A>). 
<p>
<p>these days--"of small things" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010">Zac 4:10</A>), when such great things promised seemed incredible. MAURER, after JEROME, translates, "in those days"; that is, if the thing which I promised to do in those days, seems "marvellous," &amp;c.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#007">Zechariah 8:7</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_007">zac 8:7</A></FONT></span></p>save my people from . . . east . . . west--that is, from every region (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#001">Psa 50:1</A>; the "West" is literally, "the going down of the sun") to which they are scattered; they are now found especially in countries west of Jerusalem. The dispersion under Nebuchadnezzar was only to the east, namely, to Babylonia. The restoration, including a spiritual return to God (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#008">Zac 8:8</A>), here foretold, must therefore be still future (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011">Isa 11:11-12</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#005">Isa 43:5-6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#021">Eze 37:21</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#014">Amo 9:14-15</A>; also <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009">Zac 13:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022">Jer 30:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#001">Jer 31:1</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033">Jer 31:33</A>).

<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009">Zechariah 8:9</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_009">zac 8:9</A></FONT></span></p>All adversities formerly attended them when neglecting to build the temple: but now God promises all blessings, as an encouragement to energy in the work. 
<p>
<p>hands . . . strong--be of courageous mind (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#021">Sa2 16:21</A>), not merely in building, but in general, as having such bright prospects (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013">Zac 8:13</A>, &amp;c.). 
<p>
<p>these days--the time that had elapsed between the prophet's having spoken "these words" and the time (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010">Zac 8:10</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015">Hag 2:15-19</A>) when they set about in earnest restoring the temple. 
<p>
<p>the prophets--Haggai and Zechariah himself (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001">Ezr 5:1-2</A>). The same prophets who promised prosperity at the foundation of the temple, now promised still greater blessings hereafter.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#010">Zechariah 8:10</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_010">zac 8:10</A></FONT></span></p>before these days--before the time in which ye again proceeded with the building of the temple (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009">Zac 8:9</A>), namely, at the time that the temple lay neglected. 
<p>
<p>no hire for man . . . beast--that is, no produce of the field to repay the labor of man and beast on it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006">Hag 1:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009">Hag 1:9-10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016">Hag 2:16</A>). 
<p>
<p>neither . . . peace to him that went out or came in-- (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#005">Ch2 15:5</A>). No one could in safety do his business at home or abroad, in the city or in the country, whether going or returning. 
<p>
<p>because of the affliction--so sorely pressed were they by the foe outside. MAURER translates, "Because of the foe" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001">Ezr 4:1</A>). 
<p>
<p>every one against . . . neighbour--There was internal discord, as well as foes from without.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#011">Zechariah 8:11</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_011">zac 8:11</A></FONT></span></p>"But now that the temple has been built, I will not do as I had formerly done to those who returned from Babylon" [JEROME]. Henceforth I will bless you.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#012">Zechariah 8:12</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_012">zac 8:12</A></FONT></span></p>seed . . . prosperous--that is, shall not fair to yield abundantly (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#021">Hos 2:21-22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#019">Hag 2:19</A>). Contrast with this verse <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006">Hag 1:6</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#009">Hag 1:9-11</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#016">Hag 2:16</A>. 
<p>
<p>dew--especially beneficial in hot countries where rain is rare.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#013">Zechariah 8:13</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_013">zac 8:13</A></FONT></span></p>a curse--As the heathen have made you another name for "a curse," wishing to their foes as bad a lot as yours (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009">Jer 24:9</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018">Jer 29:18</A>); so your name shall be a formula of blessing, so that men shall say to their friend, May thy lot be as happy as that of Judah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#020">Gen 48:20</A>). Including also the idea of the Jews being a source of blessing to the Gentile nations (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007">Mic 5:7</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#020">Zep 3:20</A>). The distinct mention of "Judah" and "Israel" proves that the prophecy has not yet had its full accomplishment, as Israel (the ten tribes) has never yet been restored, though individuals of Israel returned with Judah.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#014">Zechariah 8:14</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_014">zac 8:14</A></FONT></span></p>I thought--I determined. 
<p>
<p>you--that is, your fathers, with whom ye are one; the Jewish Church of all ages being regarded as an organic whole (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#005">Hag 2:5</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#031">Mat 23:31-32</A>). 
<p>
<p>repented not--I changed not My purpose, because they changed not their mind (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016">Ch2 36:16</A>). With the froward God shows Himself froward (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026">Psa 18:26</A>). If the threatened punishment has been so unchangeably inflicted, much more will God surely give the promised blessing, which is so much more consonant to His nature (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028">Jer 31:28</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016">Zechariah 8:16</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_016">zac 8:16</A></FONT></span></p>The promised blessings are connected with obedience. God's covenanted grace will lead those truly blessed by it to holiness, not licentiousness. 
<p>
<p>truth to . . . neighbour--not that the truth should not be spoken to foreigners too; but He makes it an aggravation of their sin, that they spared not even their brethren. Besides, and above all outward ordinances (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003">Zac 7:3</A>), God requires truth and justice. 
<p>
<p>judgment of . . . peace--Equitable decisions tend to allay feuds and produce peace. 
<p>
<p>gates--the place where courts of judicature in the East were held.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017">Zechariah 8:17</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_017">zac 8:17</A></FONT></span></p>all these . . . I hate--therefore ye too ought to hate them. Religion consists in conformity to God's nature, that we should love what God loves and hate what God hates.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#018">Zechariah 8:18</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_018">zac 8:18</A></FONT></span></p>The prophet answers the query (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003">Zac 7:3</A>) as to the fast in the fifth month, by a reply applying to all their fasts: these are to be turned into days of rejoicing. So Jesus replied to His disciples when similarly consulting Him as to why fasting was not imposed by Him, as it was by John the Baptist. When the Sun of righteousness shines, tears are dried up (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015">Mat 9:15</A>). So hereafter (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#010">Isa 35:10</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#019">Zechariah 8:19</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">zac 8:19</A></FONT></span></p>fast of . . . fourth month--On the fourth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign, on the ninth day, Jerusalem was taken (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#002">Jer 39:2</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#006">Jer 52:6-7</A>). It was therefore made a fast day. 
<p>
<p>fifth . . . seventh--(See on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#003">Zac 7:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#005">Zac 7:5</A>). 
<p>
<p>tenth--On the tenth month and tenth day, in the ninth year of Zedekiah, the siege began (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#004">Jer 52:4</A>). 
<p>
<p>therefore love the truth--or, "only love." English Version is better. God's blessing covenanted to Israel is not made to depend on Israel's goodness: but Israel's goodness should follow as the consequence of God's gracious promises (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#016">Zac 8:16-17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#009">Zac 7:9-10</A>). God will bless, but not those who harden themselves in sin.
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#020">Zechariah 8:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">zac 8:20</A></FONT></span></p>(<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002">Mic 4:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord of hosts--a preface needed to assure the Jews, now disheartened by the perils surrounding them, and by the humble aspect of the temple. "Unlikely as what follows may seem to you, Jehovah of hosts, boundless in resources, saith it, therefore it shall be so." Just before Christ's coming, a feeling grew up among the heathen of the unsatisfactoriness of their systems of religion and philosophy; this disposed them favorably towards the religion of the Jew, so that proselytes embraced the worship of Jehovah from various parts of Asia; these again were predisposed to embrace Christianity when it was preached to them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#009">Act 2:9-12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041">Act 2:41</A>). But the full accomplishment of the conversion of the Gentiles foretold here is reserved till "Jerusalem" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#022">Zac 8:22</A>) becomes the center of Christianized Jewry (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015">Rom 11:15</A>).

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_021">zac 8:21</A></FONT></span></p>Let us . . . I--manifesting zeal and love: converted themselves, they seek the conversion of others (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004">Sol 1:4</A>). To exhortation in general ("Let us go"), they add individual example ("I will go"). Or, the change from plural to singular implies that the general consent in religious earnestness leads each individual to decide for God. 
<p>
<p>go speedily--literally, "go, going"; implying intense earnestness. 
<p>
<p>pray--Hebrew, "entreat the face" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#002">Zac 7:2</A>); entreat His favor and grace.

<p>
<p>take hold of the skirt--a gesture of suppliant entreaty as to a superior. Compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#006">Isa 3:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001">Isa 4:1</A>, on a different occasion. The Gentiles shall eagerly seek to share the religious privileges of the Jew. The skirt with a fringe and blue ribbon upon it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#038">Num 15:38</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#012">Deu 22:12</A>) was a distinguishing badge of a Jew. 
<p>
<p>God is with you--the effect produced on unbelievers in entering the assemblies of the Church (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#025">Co1 14:25</A>). But primarily, that produced on the nations in witnessing the deliverance of the Jews by Cyrus. Finally, that to be produced on the nations by the future grand interposition of Messiah in behalf of His people.
