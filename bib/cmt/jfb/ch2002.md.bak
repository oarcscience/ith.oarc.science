### [2 Chronicles Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 2:1</span></span>

SOLOMON'S LABORERS FOR BUILDING THE TEMPLE. ([Ch2
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#001).md)

Solomon determined to build--The temple is the grand subject of this
narrative, while the palace--here and in other parts of this book--is
only incidentally noticed. The duty of building the temple was reserved
for Solomon before his birth. As soon as he became king, he addressed
himself to the work, and the historian, in proceeding to give an account
of the edifice, begins with relating the preliminary arrangements.

[2 Chronicles 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 2:3</span></span>

HIS MESSAGE TO HURAM FOR SKILFUL ARTIFICERS. ([Ch2
2:3-10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#003).md)

Solomon sent to Huram--The correspondence was probably conducted on both
sides in writing ([Ch2 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md); also see
on [Kg1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#008).md).

As thou didst deal with David my father--This would seem decisive of the
question whether the Huram then reigning in Tyre was David's friend (see
on [Kg1 5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#001).md). In opening the
business, Solomon grounded his request for Tyrian aid on two reasons: 1.
The temple he proposed to build must be a solid and permanent building
because the worship was to be continued in perpetuity; and therefore the
building materials must be of the most durable quality. 2. It must be a
magnificent structure because it was to be dedicated to the God who was
greater than all gods; and, therefore, as it might seem a presumptuous
idea to erect an edifice for a Being "whom the heaven and the heaven of
heavens do not contain," it was explained that Solomon's object was not
to build a house for Him to dwell in, but a temple in which His
worshippers might offer sacrifices to His honor. No language could be
more humble and appropriate than this. The pious strain of sentiment was
such as became a king of Israel.

[2 Chronicles 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 2:7</span></span>

Send me now therefore a man cunning to work--Masons and carpenters were
not asked for. Those whom David had obtained ([Ch1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#001).md) were probably still remaining in
Jerusalem, and had instructed others. But he required a master of works;
a person capable, like Bezaleel ([Exo
35:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#031).md), of superintending and
directing every department; for, as the division of labor was at that
time little known or observed, an overseer had to be possessed of very
versatile talents and experience. The things specified, in which he was
to be skilled, relate not to the building, but the furniture of the
temple. Iron, which could not be obtained in the wilderness when the
tabernacle was built, was now, through intercourse with the coast,
plentiful and much used. The cloths intended for curtains were, from the
crimson or scarlet-red and hyacinth colors named, evidently those
stuffs, for the manufacture and dyeing of which the Tyrians were so
famous. "The graving," probably, included embroidery of figures like
cherubim in needlework, as well as wood carving of pomegranates and
other ornaments.

[2 Chronicles 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ch2 2:8</span></span>

Send me . . . cedar trees, &c.--The cedar and cypress were valued as
being both rare and durable; the algum or almug trees (likewise a
foreign wood), though not found on Lebanon, are mentioned as being
procured through Huram (see on [Kg1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#011).md).

[2 Chronicles 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ch2 2:10</span></span>

behold, I will give to thy servants . . . beaten wheat--Wheat, stripped
of the husk, boiled, and saturated with butter, forms a frequent meal
with the laboring people in the East (compare [Kg1
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#011).md). There is no discrepancy between
that passage and this. The yearly supplies of wine and oil, mentioned in
the former, were intended for Huram's court in return for the cedars
sent him; while the articles of meat and drink specified here were for
the workmen on Lebanon.

[2 Chronicles 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ch2 2:11</span></span>

HURAM'S KIND ANSWER. ([Ch2 2:11-18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#011).md)

Because the Lord hath loved his people, &c.--This pious language creates
a presumption that Huram might have attained some knowledge of the true
religion from his long familiar intercourse with David. But the
presumption, however pleasing, may be delusive (see on [Kg1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#007).md).

[2 Chronicles 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 2:13</span></span>

I have sent a cunning man--(See on 1Ki. 7:13-51).

[2 Chronicles 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ch2 2:17</span></span>

Solomon numbered all the strangers, &c.--(See on [Kg1
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#013.md); [Kg1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018).md).
