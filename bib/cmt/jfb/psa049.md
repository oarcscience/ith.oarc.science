### [Psalms Chapter 49](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 49:1</span></span>

This Psalm instructs and consoles. It teaches that earthly advantages
are not reliable for permanent happiness, and that, however prosperous
worldly men may be for a time, their ultimate destiny is ruin, while the
pious are safe in God's care. (Psa. 49:1-20)

All are called to hear what interests all.

world--literally, "duration of life," the present time.

[Psalms 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 49:4</span></span>

incline--to hear attentively ([Psa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006.md); [Psa
31:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#002).md).

parable--In Hebrew and Greek "parable" and "proverb" are translations of
the same word. It denotes a comparison, or form of speech, which under
one image includes many, and is expressive of a general truth capable of
various illustrations. Hence it may be used for the illustration itself.
For the former sense, "proverb" (that is, one word for several) is the
usual English term, and for the latter, in which comparison is
prominent, "parable" (that is, one thing laid by another). The
distinction is not always observed, since here, and in [Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md); "proverb" would better express
the style of the composition (compare also [Pro
26:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#007.md), [Pro
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#009.md); [Hab
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#006.md); [Joh
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025.md), [Joh
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029).md). Such forms of speech are often
very figurative and also obscure (compare [Mat
13:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012).md). Hence the use of the
parallel word--

dark saying--or, "riddle" (compare [Eze
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#002).md).

open--is to explain.

upon the harp--the accompaniment for a lyric.

[Psalms 49:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 49:5</span></span>

iniquity--or, "calamity" ([Psa 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012).md).

of my heels--literally "my supplanters" ([Gen
27:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#036).md), or oppressors: "I am
surrounded by the evils they inflict."

[Psalms 49:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 49:6</span></span>

They are vainglorious.

[Psalms 49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 49:7</span></span>

yet unable to save themselves or others.

[Psalms 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 49:8</span></span>

it ceaseth for ever--that is, the ransom fails, the price is too
precious, costly.

[Psalms 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 49:9</span></span>

corruption--literally, "pit," or, "grave," thus showing that "soul" is
used for "life" \[[Psa 49:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)\].

[Psalms 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 49:10</span></span>

For he seeth--that is, corruption; then follows the illustration.

wise . . . fool-- ([Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md); [Pro
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#032.md); [Pro
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001).md).

likewise--alike altogether-- ([Psa
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#008).md) --die--all meet the same fate.

[Psalms 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 49:11</span></span>

Still infatuated and flattered with hopes of perpetuity, they call their
lands, or "celebrate their names on account of (their) lands."

[Psalms 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 49:12</span></span>

Contrasted with this vanity is their frailty. However honored, man

abideth not--literally, "lodgeth not," remains not till morning, but
suddenly perishes as (wild) beasts, whose lives are taken without
warning.

[Psalms 49:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 49:13</span></span>

Though their way is folly, others follow the same course of life.

[Psalms 49:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 49:14</span></span>

Like sheep--(compare [Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012).md)
unwittingly, they

are laid--or, "put," &c.

death shall feed on--or, better, "shall rule"

them--as a shepherd (compare "feed," [Psa
28:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#009), Margin.md).

have dominion over--or, "subdue"

them in the morning--suddenly, or in their turn.

their beauty--literally, "form" or shape.

shall consume--literally, "is for the consumption," that is, of the
grave.

from their dwelling--literally, "from their home (they go) to it," that
is, the grave.

[Psalms 49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 49:15</span></span>

The pious, delivered from "the power of the grave."

power--literally, "the hand," of death, are taken under God's care.

[Psalms 49:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 49:16</span></span>

applies this instruction. Be not anxious ([Psa
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001), &c..md), since death cuts off the
prosperous wicked whom you dread.

[Psalms 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 49:18</span></span>

Though . . . lived, &c.--literally, "For in his life he blessed his
soul," or, "himself" ([Luk 12:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#019.md), [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025).md); yet ([Psa
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#019).md); he has had his portion.

men will praise . . . thyself--Flatterers enhance the rich fool's
self-complacency; the form of address to him strengthens the emphasis of
the sentiment.

[Psalms 49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 49:20</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012).md). The folly is
more distinctly expressed by "understandeth not," substituted for
"abideth not."
