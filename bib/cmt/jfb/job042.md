### [Job Chapter 42](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#001)

[Job 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">job 42:2</span></span>

JOB'S PENITENT REPLY. ([Job 42:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#001))

In the first clause he owns God to be omnipotent over nature, as
contrasted with his own feebleness, which God had proved ([Job
40:15](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#015); [Job
41:34](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#034)); in the second, that God is
supremely just (which, in order to be governor of the world, He must
needs be) in all His dealings, as contrasted with his own vileness ([Job
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006)), and incompetence to deal with
the wicked as a just judge ([Job
40:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008)).

thought--"purpose," as in [Job 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#011);
but it is usually applied to evil devices ([Job
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#027); [Psa
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002)): the ambiguous word is
designedly chosen to express that, while to Job's finite view, God's
plans seem bad, to the All-wise One they continue unhindered in their
development, and will at last be seen to be as good as they are
infinitely wise. No evil can emanate from the Parent of good ([Jam
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013), [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)); but it is His prerogative to
overrule evil to good.

[Job 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">job 42:3</span></span>

I am the man! Job in God's own words ([Job
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002)) expresses his deep and humble
penitence. God's word concerning our guilt should be engraven on our
hearts and form the groundwork of our confession. Most men in confessing
sin palliate rather than confess. Job in omitting "by words" ([Job
38:2](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002)), goes even further than God's
accusation. Not merely my words, but my whole thoughts and ways were
"without knowledge."

too wonderful--I rashly denied that Thou hast any fixed plan in
governing human affairs, merely because Thy plan was "too wonderful" for
my comprehension.

[Job 42:4](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">job 42:4</span></span>

When I said, "Hear," &c., Job's demand ([Job
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#022)) convicted him of being "without
knowledge." God alone could speak thus to Job, not Job to God: therefore
he quotes again God's words as the groundwork of retracting his own
foolish words.

[Job 42:5](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">job 42:5</span></span>

hearing of the ear-- ([Psa 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044),
Margin). Hearing and seeing are often in antithesis ([Job
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#011); [Psa
18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008)).

seeth--not God's face ([Exo 33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020)),
but His presence in the veil of a dark cloud ([Job
38:1](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#001)). Job implies also that, besides
this literal seeing, he now saw spiritually what he had indistinctly
taken on hearsay before God's infinite wisdom. He "now" proves this; he
had seen in a literal sense before, at the beginning of God's speech,
but he had not seen spiritually till "now" at its close.

[Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">job 42:6</span></span>

myself--rather "I abhor," and retract the rash speeches I made against
thee ([Job 42:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#003)) \[UMBREIT\].

[Job 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">job 42:7</span></span>

EPILOGUE, in prose. ([Job 42:7-17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#007))

to Eliphaz--because he was the foremost of the three friends; their
speeches were but the echo of his.

right--literally, "well-grounded," sure and true. Their spirit towards
Job was unkindly, and to justify themselves in their unkindliness they
used false arguments ([Job 13:7](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007));
(namely, that calamities always prove peculiar guilt); therefore, though
it was "for God" they spake thus falsely, God "reproves" them, as Job
said He would ([Job 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#010)).

as . . . Job hath--Job had spoken rightly in relation to them and their
argument, denying their theory, and the fact which they alleged, that he
was peculiarly guilty and a hypocrite; but wrongly in relation to God,
when he fell into the opposite extreme of almost denying all guilt. This
extreme he has now repented of, and therefore God speaks of him as now
altogether "right."

[Job 42:8](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">job 42:8</span></span>

seven--(See Introduction). The number offered by the Gentile prophet
([Num 23:1](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#001)). Job plainly lived before
the legal priesthood, &c. The patriarchs acted as priests for their
families; and sometimes as praying mediators ([Gen
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#017)), thus foreshadowing the true
Mediator ([Ti1 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005)), but sacrifice
accompanies and is the groundwork on which the mediation rests.

him--rather, "His person \[face\] only" (see on [Job
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#030)). The "person," must be first
accepted, before God can accept his offering and work ([Gen
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004)); that can be only through Jesus
Christ.

folly--impiety ([Job 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022); [Job
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#010)).

[Job 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">job 42:9</span></span>

The forgiving spirit of Job foreshadows the love of Jesus Christ and of
Christians to enemies ([Mat 5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044); [Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034); [Act
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060); [Act
16:24](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#024), [Act
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#028), [Act
16:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#030)).

[Job 42:10](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">job 42:10</span></span>

turned . . . captivity--proverbial for restored, or amply indemnified
him for all he had lost ([Eze 16:53](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#053);
[Psa 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007); [Hos
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011)). Thus the future vindication of
man, body and soul, against Satan ([Job
1:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#009)), at the resurrection ([Job
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#025)), has its earnest and
adumbration in the temporal vindication of Job at last by Jehovah in
person.

twice--so to the afflicted literal and spiritual Jerusalem ([Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002); [Isa
60:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#007); [Isa
61:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#007); [Zac
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#012)). As in Job's case, so in that of
Jesus Christ, the glorious recompense follows the "intercession" for
enemies ([Isa 53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012)).

[Job 42:11](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">job 42:11</span></span>

It was Job's complaint in his misery that his "brethren," were
"estranged" from him ([Job 19:13](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#013));
these now return with the return of his prosperity ([Pro
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#020); [Pro
19:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#006)); the true friend loveth at all
times ([Pro 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#017); [Pro
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#024)). "Swallow friends leave in the
winter and return with the spring" \[HENRY\].

eat bread--in token of friendship ([Psa
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#009)).

piece of money--Presents are usual in visiting a man of rank in the
East, especially after a calamity ([Ch2
32:23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2032.htm#023)). Hebrew, kesita. MAGEE
translates "a lamb" (the medium of exchange then before money was used),
as it is in Margin of [Gen 33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019); [Jos
24:32](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#032). But it is from the Arabic
kasat, "weighed out" \[UMBREIT\], not coined; so [Gen
42:35](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#035); [Gen
33:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen033.htm#019); compare with [Gen
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#015), makes it likely it was equal to
four shekels; Hebrew kashat, "pure," namely, metal. The term, instead of
the usual "shekel," &c., is a mark of antiquity.

earring--whether for the nose or ear ([Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004); [Isa
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#021)). Much of the gold in the East,
in the absence of banks, is in the shape of ornaments.

[Job 42:12](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">job 42:12</span></span>

Probably by degrees, not all at once.

[Job 42:13](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">job 42:13</span></span>

The same number as before, [Job 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002);
perhaps by a second wife; in [Job
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#017) his wife is last mentioned.

[Job 42:14](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">job 42:14</span></span>

Names significant of his restored prosperity ([Gen
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#025); [Gen
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#029)).

Jemima--"daylight," after his "night" of calamity; but MAURER, "a dove."

Kezia--"cassia," an aromatic herb ([Psa
45:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#008)), instead of his offensive breath
and ulcers.

Keren-happuch--"horn of stibium," a paint with which females dyed their
eyelids; in contrast to his "horn defiled in the dust" ([Job
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#015)). The names also imply the
beauty of his daughters.

[Job 42:15](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">job 42:15</span></span>

inheritance among . . . brethren--An unusual favor in the East to
daughters, who, in the Jewish law, only inherited, if there were no sons
([Num 27:8](../../../bib/kjv/num027.htm#008)), a proof of wealth and
unanimity.

[Job 42:16](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">job 42:16</span></span>

The Septuagint makes Job live a hundred seventy years after his
calamity, and two hundred forty in all. This would make him seventy at
the time of his calamity, which added to a hundred forty in Hebrew text
makes up two hundred ten; a little more than the age (two hundred five)
of Terah, father of Abraham, perhaps his contemporary. Man's length of
life gradually shortened, till it reached threescore and ten in Moses'
time ([Psa 90:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#010)).

sons' sons--a proof of divine favor ([Gen
50:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#023); [Psa
128:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#006); [Pro
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#006)).

[Job 42:17](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">job 42:17</span></span>

full of days--fully sated and contented with all the happiness that life
could give him; realizing what Eliphaz had painted as the lot of the
godly ([Job 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026); [Psa
91:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#016); [Gen
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008); [Gen
35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029)). The Septuagint adds, "It is
written, that he will rise again with those whom the Lord will raise
up." Compare [Mat 27:52-53](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052), from which
it perhaps was derived spuriously.
