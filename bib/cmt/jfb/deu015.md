### [Deuteronomy Chapter 15](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

[Deuteronomy 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 15:1</span></span>

THE SEVENTH YEAR, A YEAR OF RELEASE FOR THE POOR. ([Deu
15:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001).md)

At the end of every seven years--during the last of the seven, that is,
the sabbatical year ([Exo 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md); [Exo
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#011.md); [Lev
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#004.md); [Jer
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">deu 15:2</span></span>

Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release
it--not by an absolute discharge of the debt, but by passing over that
year without exacting payment. The relief was temporary and peculiar to
that year during which there was a total suspension of agricultural
labor.

he shall not exact it . . . of his brother--that is, an Israelite, so
called in opposition to a stranger or foreigner.

because it is called the Lord's release--The reason for acquitting a
debtor at that particular period proceeded from obedience to the
command, and a regard for the honor, of God; an acknowledgment of
holding their property of Him, and gratitude for His kindness.

[Deuteronomy 15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 15:3</span></span>

Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again--Admission to all the
religious privileges of the Israelites was freely granted to heathen
proselytes, though this spiritual incorporation did not always imply an
equal participation of civil rights and privileges ([Lev
25:44](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#044.md); [Jer
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014.md); compare [Ch1
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#002.md); [Ch2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#017).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">deu 15:4</span></span>

Save when there shall be no poor man among you--Apparently a qualifying
clause added to limit the application of the foregoing statement \[[Deu
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#003.md)\]; so that "the brother" to be
released pointed to a poor borrower, whereas it is implied that if he
were rich, the restoration of the loan might be demanded even during
that year. But the words may properly be rendered (as on the Margin) to
the end, in order that there may be no poor among you--that is, that
none be reduced to inconvenient straits and poverty by unseasonable
exaction of debts at a time when there was no labor and no produce, and
that all may enjoy comfort and prosperity, which will be the case
through the special blessing of God on the land, provided they are
obedient.

[Deuteronomy 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">deu 15:7</span></span>

If there be among you a poor man . . . thou shalt not harden thine
heart--Lest the foregoing law should prevent the Israelites lending to
the poor, Moses here admonishes them against so mean and selfish a
spirit and exhorts them to give in a liberal spirit of charity and
kindness, which will secure the divine blessing ([Rom
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md); [Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">deu 15:11</span></span>

For the poor shall never cease out of the land--Although every Israelite
on the conquest of Canaan became the owner of property, yet in the
providence of God who foresaw the event, it was permitted, partly as a
punishment of disobedience and partly for the exercise of benevolent and
charitable feelings, that "the poor should never cease out of the land."

[Deuteronomy 15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">deu 15:12</span></span>

HEBREW SERVANTS' FREEDOM. ([Deu
15:12-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012).md)

if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto
thee--The last extremity of an insolvent debtor, when his house or land
was not sufficient to cancel his debt, was to be sold as a slave with
his family ([Lev 25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md); [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001.md); [Neh
5:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#001.md); [Job
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#009.md); [Mat
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#025).md). The term of servitude could
not last beyond six years. They obtained their freedom either after six
years from the time of their sale or before the end of the seventh year.
At the year of jubilee, such slaves were emancipated even if their six
years of service were not completed \[see on [Lev
25:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#039.md)\].

[Deuteronomy 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">deu 15:13</span></span>

thou shalt not let him go away empty--A seasonable and wise provision
for enabling a poor unfortunate to regain his original status in
society, and the motive urged for his kindness and humanity to the
Hebrew slave was the remembrance that the whole nation was once a
degraded and persecuted band of helots in Egypt. Thus, kindness towards
their slaves, unparalleled elsewhere in those days, was inculcated by
the Mosaic law; and in all their conduct towards persons in that reduced
condition, leniency and gentleness were enforced by an appeal which no
Israelite could resist.

[Deuteronomy 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">deu 15:16</span></span>

if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee--If they declined to
avail themselves of the privilege of release and chose to remain with
their master, then by a peculiar form of ceremony they became a party to
the transaction, voluntarily sold themselves to their employer, and
continued in his service till death.

[Deuteronomy 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">deu 15:18</span></span>

he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee--that is, he is
entitled to double wages because his service was more advantageous to
you, being both without wages and for a length of time, whereas hired
servants were engaged yearly ([Lev
25:53](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#053).md), or at most for three years
([Isa 16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014).md).

[Deuteronomy 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 15:19</span></span>

All the firstling males of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify
unto the Lord thy God--\[See on [Exo
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002.md)\]; see [Exo
22:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#030).md).

thou shalt do not work with the firstling of thy bullock--that is, the
second firstlings (see [Deu 12:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#017.md);
[Deu 14:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#023).md).
