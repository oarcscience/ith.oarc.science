### [Isaiah Chapter 52](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 52:1</span></span>

FIRST THROUGH THIRTEEN VERSES CONNECTED WITH FIFTY-FIRST CHAPTER. (Isa.
52:1-15)

strength--as thy adornment; answering to "beautiful garments" in the
parallel clause. Arouse thyself from dejection and assume confidence.

the holy city-- ([Neh 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#001.md); [Rev
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#002).md).

no more . . . unclean-- ([Isa 35:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#008.md);
[Isa 60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021.md); [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017.md); [Rev
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#027).md). A prophecy never yet
fulfilled.

uncircumcised--spiritually ([Eze 44:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#009.md);
[Act 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051).md).

[Isaiah 52:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 52:2</span></span>

from the dust--the seat of mourners ([Job
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012).md).

arise, and sit--namely, in a more dignified place: on a divan or a
throne \[LOWTH\], after having shaken off the dust gathered up by the
flowing dress when seated on the ground; or simply, "Arise, and sit
erect" \[MAURER\].

bands of . . . neck--the yoke of thy captivity.

[Isaiah 52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 52:3</span></span>

As you became your foes' servants, without their paying any price for
you ([Jer 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013).md), so they shall
release you without demanding any price or reward ([Isa
45:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#013).md), (where Cyrus is represented as
doing so: a type of their final restoration gratuitously in like
manner). So the spiritual Israel, "sold under sin," gratuitously ([Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md), shall be redeemed also
gratuitously ([Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 52:4</span></span>

My people--Jacob and his sons.

went down--Judea was an elevated country compared with Egypt.

sojourn--They went there to stay only till the famine in Canaan should
have ceased.

Assyrian--Sennacherib. Remember how I delivered you from Egypt and the
Assyrian; what, then, is to prevent Me from delivering you out of
Babylon (and the mystical Babylon and the Antichrist in the last days)?

without cause--answering to "for naught" in [Isa
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md); it was an act of gratuitous
oppression in the present case, as in that case.

[Isaiah 52:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 52:5</span></span>

what have I here--that is, what am I called on to do? The fact "that My
people is taken away (into captivity; [Isa
49:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#024).md) for naught" (by gratuitous
oppression, [Isa 52:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#004.md); also [Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003.md), and see on [Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003).md) demands My interposition.

they that rule--or "tyrannize," namely, Babylon, literal and mystical.

make . . . to howl--or, raise a cry of exultation over them \[MAURER\].

blasphemed--namely, in Babylon: God's reason for delivering His people,
not their goodness, but for the sake of His holy name ([Eze
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#009.md), [Eze
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 52:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 52:6</span></span>

shall know in that day--when Christ shall reveal Himself to Israel
sensibly; the only means whereby their obstinate unbelief shall be
overcome ([Psa 102:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#016.md); [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md).

[Isaiah 52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 52:7</span></span>

beautiful . . . feet--that is, The advent of such a herald seen on the
distant "mountains" (see on [Isa 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#009.md);
[Isa 41:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#027.md); [Isa
25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006.md); [Sol
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#017).md) running in haste with the
long-expected good tidings, is most grateful to the desolated city ([Nah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015).md).

good tidings--only partially applying to the return from Babylon. Fully,
and antitypically, the Gospel ([Luk
2:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010).md), "beginning at Jerusalem"
([Luk 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#017).md), "the city of the great
King" ([Mat 5:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#035).md), where Messiah
shall, at the final restoration of Israel, "reign" as peculiarly Zion's
God ("Thy God reigneth"; compare [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md).

[Isaiah 52:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 52:8</span></span>

watchmen--set on towers separated by intervals to give the earliest
notice of the approach of any messenger with tidings (compare [Isa
21:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#006).md). The Hebrew is more forcible
than English Version, "The voice of thy watchmen" (exclamatory as in
[Sol 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#008).md). "They lift up their voice!
together they sing."

eye to eye--that is, close at hand, and so clearly \[GESENIUS\]; [Num
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014.md), "face to face"; [Num
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#008.md), "mouth to mouth." Compare [Co1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md); [Rev
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004.md), of which Simeon's sight of the
Saviour was a prefiguration ([Luk
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#030).md). The watchmen, spiritually, are
ministers and others who pray for the peace of Jerusalem ([Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006).md),

bring again--that is, restore. Or else, "return to" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 52:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 52:9</span></span>

([Isa 14:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#007.md); [Isa
42:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#011).md).

redeemed--spiritually and nationally ([Isa
48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020).md).

[Isaiah 52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 52:10</span></span>

made bare . . . arm--metaphor from warriors who bare their arm for
battle ([Eze 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#007).md).

all . . . earth . . . see . . . salvation of . . . God--The deliverance
wrought by God for Israel will cause all nations to acknowledge the Lord
([Isa 66:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#018).md). The partial
fulfilment ([Luk 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006).md) is a forerunner
of the future complete fulfilment.

[Isaiah 52:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 52:11</span></span>

([Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Zac
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#006).md). Long residence in Babylon made
many loath to leave it: so as to mystical Babylon ([Rev
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004).md).

ye . . . that bear . . . vessels of the Lord--the priests and Levites,
whose office it was to carry the vessels of the temple ([Jer
27:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#018).md). Nebuchadnezzar had carried
them to Babylon ([Ch2 36:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#018).md). Cyrus
restored them ([Ezr 1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007).md).

be . . . clean--by separating yourselves wholly from Babylonian
idolaters, mystical and literal.

[Isaiah 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 52:12</span></span>

not . . . with haste--as when ye left Egypt ([Exo
12:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#033.md), [Exo
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#039.md); [Deu
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#003.md); compare Note, see on [Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016).md). Ye shall have time to cleanse
yourselves and make deliberate preparation for departure.

Lord--Jehovah, as your Leader in front ([Isa
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#003.md); [Exo
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013).md).

rereward--literally, "gather up," that is, to bring up the rear of your
host. The transition is frequent from the glory of Messiah in His advent
to reign, to His humiliation in His advent to suffer. Indeed, so are
both advents accounted one, that He is not said, in His second coming,
to be about to return, but to come.

[Isaiah 52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 52:13</span></span>

Here the fifty-third chapter ought to begin, and the fifty-second
chapter end with [Isa 52:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#012.md). This
section, from here to end of the fifty-third chapter settles the
controversy with the Jews, if Messiah be the person meant; and with
infidels, if written by Isaiah, or at any time before Christ. The
correspondence with the life and death of Jesus Christ is so minute,
that it could not have resulted from conjecture or accident. An impostor
could not have shaped the course of events so as to have made his
character and life appear to be a fulfilment of it. The writing is,
moreover, declaredly prophetic. The quotations of it in the New
Testament show: (1) that it was, before the time of Jesus, a recognized
part of the Old Testament; (2) that it refers to Messiah ([Mat
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#017.md); [Mar
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#028.md); [Luk
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037.md); [Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038.md); [Act
8:28-35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028.md); [Rom
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016.md); [Pe1
2:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021).md). The indirect allusions to it
still more clearly prove the Messianic interpretation; so universal was
that interpretation, that it is simply referred to in connection with
the atoning virtue of His death, without being formally quoted ([Mar
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#012.md); [Rom
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md); [Co1
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003.md); [Co2
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021.md); [Pe1
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019.md); [Pe1
2:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021.md); [Jo1
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005).md). The genuineness of the passage
is certain; for the Jews would not have forged it, since it is opposed
to their notion of Messiah, as a triumphant temporal prince. The
Christians could not have forged it; for the Jews, the enemies of
Christianity, are "our librarians" \[PALEY\]. The Jews try to evade its
force by the figment of two Messiahs, one a suffering Messiah (Ben
Joseph), the other a triumphant Messiah (Ben David). HILLEL maintained
that Messiah has already come in the person of Hezekiah. BUXTORF states
that many of the modern Rabbins believe that He has been come a good
while, but will not manifest Himself because of the sins of the Jews.
But the ancient Jews, as the Chaldee paraphrast, Jonathan, refer it to
Messiah; so the Medrasch Tauchuma (a commentary on the Pentateuch); also
Rabbi Moses Haddarschan (see HENGSTENBERG, Christology of the Old
Testament). Some explain it of the Jewish people, either in the
Babylonish exile, or in their present sufferings and dispersion. Others,
the pious portion of the nation taken collectively, whose sufferings
made a vicarious satisfaction for the ungodly. Others, Isaiah, or
Jeremiah \[GESENIUS\], the prophets collectively. But an individual is
plainly described: he suffers voluntarily, innocently, patiently, and as
the efficient cause of the righteousness of His people, which holds good
of none other but Messiah ([Isa
53:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md), [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md), [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); contrast [Jer
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007.md); [Jer
15:10-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#010.md); [Psa
137:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008).md). [Isa
53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md) can hold good of none other. The
objection that the sufferings ([Isa
53:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001).md) referred to are represented
as past, the glorification alone as future ([Isa
52:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); [Isa
53:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011).md) arises from not seeing that
the prophet takes his stand in the midst of the scenes which he
describes as future. The greater nearness of the first advent, and the
interval between it and the second, are implied by the use of the past
tense as to the first, the future as to the second.

Behold--awakening attention to the striking picture of Messiah that
follows (compare [Joh 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#005.md), [Joh
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#014).md).

my servant--Messiah ([Isa 42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001).md).

deal prudently--rather, "prosper" \[GESENIUS\] as the parallel clause
favors ([Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). Or, uniting both
meanings, "shall reign well" \[HENGSTENBERG\]. This verse sets forth in
the beginning the ultimate issue of His sufferings, the description of
which follows: the conclusion ([Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md) corresponds; the section ([Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013.md); [Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012).md) begins as it ends with His
final glory.

extolled--elevated ([Mar 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md); [Eph
1:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md); [Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022).md).

[Isaiah 52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 52:14</span></span>

Summary of Messiah's history, which is set forth more in detail in the
fifty-third chapter. "Just as many were astonished (accompanied with
aversion, [Jer 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#016.md); [Jer
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008).md), &c.; his visage, &c.; so shall
He sprinkle," &c.; Israel in this answers to its antitype Messiah, now
"an astonishment and byword" ([Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037).md), hereafter about to be a
blessing and means of salvation to many nations ([Isa
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md); [Mic
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#007).md).

thee; his--Such changes of persons are common in Hebrew poetry.

marred--Hebrew, "disfigurement"; abstract for concrete; not only
disfigured, but disfigurement itself.

more than man--CASTALIO translates, "so that it was no longer that of a
man" (compare [Psa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006).md). The more
perfect we may suppose the "body prepared" ([Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md) for Him by God, the sadder by
contrast was the "marring" of His visage and form.

[Isaiah 52:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 52:15</span></span>

sprinkle many--GESENIUS, for the antithesis to "be astonished,"
translates, "shall cause . . . to exult." But the word universally in
the Old Testament means either to sprinkle with blood, as the high
priest makes an expiation ([Lev 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#006.md);
[Lev 16:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#018).md); or with water, to
purify ([Eze 36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md); compare as to the
Spirit, [Act 2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033).md), both appropriate
to Messiah ([Joh 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#008.md); [Heb
9:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md); [Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md); [Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md); [Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md). The antithesis is sufficient
without any forced rendering. Many were astonished; so many (not merely
men, but) nations shall be sprinkled. They were amazed at such an abject
person claiming to be Messiah; yet it is He who shall justify and
purify. Men were dumb with the amazement of scorn at one marred more
than the lowest of men, yet the highest: even kings ([Isa
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#007.md), [Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023).md) shall be dumb with awe and
veneration ("shut . . . mouths"; [Job
29:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/job029.htm#009.md); [Mic
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016).md).

that . . . not . . . told them--the reason why kings shall so venerate
them; the wonders of redemption, which had not been before told them,
shall then be announced to them, wonders such as they had never heard or
seen parallelled ([Isa 55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md); [Rom
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021.md); [Rom
16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md).

The speaker, according to HORSLEY, personates the repenting Jews in the
latter ages of the world coming over to the faith of the Redeemer; the
whole is their penitent confession. This view suits the context ([Isa
52:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007).md), which is not to be fully
realized until Israel is restored. However, primarily, it is the abrupt
exclamation of the prophet: "Who hath believed our report," that of
Isaiah and the other prophets, as to Messiah? The infidel's objection
from the unbelief of the Jews is anticipated and hereby answered: that
unbelief and the cause of it (Messiah's humiliation, whereas they looked
for One coming to reign) were foreseen and foretold.
