### [Deuteronomy Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001)

[Deuteronomy 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">deu 18:1</span></span>

THE LORD IS THE PRIESTS' AND THE LEVITES' INHERITANCE. ([Deu
18:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001))

The priests the Levites . . . shall eat the offerings--As the tribe of
Levi had no inheritance allotted them like the other tribes but were
wholly consecrated to the priestly office, their maintenance was to
arise from tithes, first-fruits, and certain portions of the oblations
presented on the altar, which God having by express appointment reserved
to Himself made over, after being offered, to His ministers.

[Deuteronomy 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">deu 18:3</span></span>

this shall be the priest's due from the people--All who offered
sacrifices of thanksgiving or peace offerings ([Lev
7:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#031)) were ordered to give the
breast and shoulder as perquisites to the priests. Here "the two cheeks"
or head and "the maw" or stomach, deemed anciently a great dainty, are
specified. But whether this is a new injunction, or a repetition of the
old with the supplement of more details, it is not easy to determine.

[Deuteronomy 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">deu 18:6</span></span>

if a Levite . . . come with all the desire of his mind--It appears that
the Levites served in rotation from the earliest times; but, from their
great numbers, it was only at infrequent intervals they could be called
into actual service. Should any Levite, however, under the influence of
eminent piety, resolve to devote himself wholly and continually to the
sacred duties of the sanctuary, he was allowed to realize his ardent
wishes; and as he was admitted to a share of the work, so also to a
share of the remuneration. Though he might have private property, that
was to form no ground for withholding or even diminishing his claim to
maintenance like the other ministering priests. The reason or principle
of the enactment is obvious ([Co1
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013)). At the same time, while every
facility was afforded for the admission of such a zealous and
self-denying officer, this admission was to be in an orderly manner: he
was to minister "as all his brethren"--that is, a Gershonite with
Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there might be no
derangement of the established courses.

[Deuteronomy 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">deu 18:9</span></span>

THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE NATIONS ARE TO BE AVOIDED. ([Deu
18:9-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#009))

thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations--(See
on [Lev 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021); [Lev
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#026); [Lev
19:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#031); [Lev
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#004)). In spite of this express
command, the people of Canaan, especially the Philistines, were a
constant snare and stumbling block to the Israelites, on account of
their divinations and superstitious practices.

[Deuteronomy 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">deu 18:15</span></span>

CHRIST THE PROPHET IS TO BE HEARD. ([Deu
18:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015))

The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet--The insertion of
this promise, in connection with the preceding prohibition, might
warrant the application (which some make of it) to that order of true
prophets whom God commissioned in unbroken succession to instruct, to
direct, and warn His people; and in this view the purport of it is,
"There is no need to consult with diviners and soothsayers, as I shall
afford you the benefit of divinely appointed prophets, for judging of
whose credentials a sure criterion is given" ([Deu
18:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#020)). But the prophet here
promised was pre-eminently the Messiah, for He alone was "like unto
Moses" (see on [Deu 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#010)) "in His
mediatorial character; in the peculiar excellence of His ministry; in
the number, variety, and magnitude of His miracles; in His close and
familiar communion with God; and in His being the author of a new
dispensation of religion." This prediction was fulfilled fifteen hundred
years afterwards and was expressly applied to Jesus Christ by Peter
([Act 3:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022)), and by Stephen ([Act
7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037)).

[Deuteronomy 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">deu 18:19</span></span>

whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my
name, I will require it of him--The direful consequences of unbelief in
Christ, and disregard of His mission, the Jewish people have been
experiencing during eighteen hundred years.
