### [Hebrews Chapter 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)

[Hebrews 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 2:1</span></span>

DANGER OF NEGLECTING SO GREAT SALVATION, FIRST SPOKEN BY CHRIST; TO
WHOM, NOT TO ANGELS, THE NEW DISPENSATION WAS SUBJECTED; THOUGH HE WAS
FOR A TIME HUMBLED BELOW THE ANGELS: THIS HUMILIATION TOOK PLACE BY
DIVINE NECESSITY FOR OUR SALVATION. (Heb. 2:1-18)

Therefore--Because Christ the Mediator of the new covenant is so far
([Heb 1:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005)) above all angels, the
mediators of the old covenant.

the more earnest--Greek, "the more abundantly."

heard--spoken by God ([Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)); and
by the Lord ([Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003)).

let them slip--literally "flow past them" ([Heb
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#001)).

[Hebrews 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 2:2</span></span>

(Compare [Heb 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003).) Argument a
fortiori.

spoken by angels--the Mosaic law spoken by the ministration of angels
([Deu 33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Psa
68:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#017); [Act
7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053); [Gal
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019)). When it is said, [Exo
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#001), "God spake," it is meant He
spake by angels as His mouthpiece, or at least angels repeating in
unison with His voice the words of the Decalogue; whereas the Gospel was
first spoken by the Lord alone.

was steadfast--Greek, "was made steadfast," or "confirmed": was enforced
by penalties on those violating it.

transgression--by doing evil; literally, overstepping its bounds: a
positive violation of it.

disobedience--by neglecting to do good: a negative violation of it.

recompense-- ([Deu 32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035)).

[Hebrews 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 2:3</span></span>

we--who have received the message of salvation so clearly delivered to
us (compare [Heb 12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)).

so great salvation--embodied in Jesus, whose very name means
"salvation," including not only deliverance from foes and from death,
and the grant of temporal blessings (which the law promised to the
obedient), but also grace of the Spirit, forgiveness of sins, and the
promise of heaven, glory, and eternal life ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)).

which--"inasmuch as it is a salvation which began," &c.

spoken by the Lord--as the instrument of proclaiming it. Not as the law,
spoken by the instrumentality of angels ([Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)). Both law and Gospel came from
God; the difference here referred to lay in the instrumentality by which
each respectively was promulgated (compare [Heb
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)). Angels recognize Him as "the
Lord" ([Mat 28:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006); [Luk
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011)).

confirmed unto us--not by penalties, as the law was confirmed, but by
spiritual gifts ([Heb 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)).

by them that heard him--(Compare [Luk
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002)). Though Paul had a special and
independent revelation of Christ ([Gal
1:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016), [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019)), yet he classes himself with
those Jews whom he addresses, "unto us"; for like them in many
particulars (for example, the agony in Gethsemane, [Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)), he was dependent for autoptic
information on the twelve apostles. So the discourses of Jesus, for
example, the Sermon on the Mount, and the first proclamation of the
Gospel kingdom by the Lord ([Mat
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#017)), he could only know by the
report of the Twelve: so the saying, "It is more blessed to give than to
receive" ([Act 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035)). Paul mentions
what they had heard, rather than what they had seen, conformably with
what he began with, [Heb 1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001), "spake
. . . spoken." Appropriately also in his Epistles to Gentiles, he dwells
on his independent call to the apostleship of the Gentiles; in his
Epistle to the Hebrews, he appeals to the apostles who had been long
with the Lord (compare [Act 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021); [Act
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041)): so in his sermon to the Jews
in Antioch of Pisidia ([Act 13:31](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#031));
and "he only appeals to the testimony of these apostles in a general
way, in order that he may bring the Hebrews to the Lord alone"
\[BENGEL\], not to become partisans of particular apostles, as Peter,
the apostle of the circumcision, and James, the bishop of Jerusalem.
This verse implies that the Hebrews of the churches of Palestine and
Syria (or those of them dispersed in Asia Minor \[BENGEL\], [Pe1
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001), or in Alexandria) were primarily
addressed in this Epistle; for of none so well could it be said, the
Gospel was confirmed to them by the immediate hearers of the Lord: the
past tense, "was confirmed," implies some little time had elapsed since
this testification by eye-witnesses.

[Hebrews 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 2:4</span></span>

them--rather, "God also \[as well as Christ, [Heb
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#003)\] bearing witness to it," &c.,
joining in attestation of it."

signs and wonders--performed by Christ and His apostles. "Signs" and
miracles, or other facts regarded as proofs of a divine mission;
"wonders" are miracles viewed as prodigies, causing astonishment ([Act
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022), [Act
2:33](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#033)); "powers" are miracles viewed as
evidences of superhuman power.

divers miracles--Greek, "varied (miraculous) powers" ([Co2
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#012)) granted to the apostles after
the ascension.

gifts, &c.--Greek, "distributions." The gift of the Holy Spirit was
given to Christ without measure ([Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)), but to us it is distributed in
various measures and operations ([Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003), [Rom
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006), &c.; [Co1
12:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)).

according to his own will--God's free and sovereign will, assigning one
gift of the Spirit to one, another to another ([Act
5:32](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#032); [Eph
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)).

[Hebrews 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 2:5</span></span>

For--confirming the assertion, [Heb
2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002), that the new covenant was
spoken by One higher than the mediators of the old covenant, namely,
angels. Translate in the Greek order, to bring out the proper emphasis,
"Not the angels hath He," &c.

the world to come--implying, He has subjected to angels the existing
world, the Old Testament dispensation (then still partly existing as to
its framework), [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002), the
political kingdom of the earth ([Dan
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#013); [Dan
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#013), [Dan
10:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#020); [Dan
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001)), and the natural elements ([Rev
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#011); [Rev
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#004)). and even individuals ([Mat
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#010)). "The world to come" is the new
dispensation brought in by Christ, beginning in grace here, to be
completed in glory hereafter. It is called "to come," or "about to be,"
as at the time of its being subjected to Christ by the divine decree, it
was as yet a thing of the future, and is still so to us, in respect to
its full consummation. In respect to the subjecting of all things to
Christ in fulfilment of [Psa 8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001),
the realization is still "to come." Regarded from the Old Testament
standpoint, which looks prophetically forward to the New Testament (and
the Jewish priesthood and Old Testament ritual were in force then when
Paul wrote, and continued till their forcible abrogation by the
destruction of Jerusalem), it is "the world to come"; Paul, as
addressing Jews, appropriately calls it so, according to their
conventional way of viewing it. We, like them, still pray, "Thy kingdom
come"; for its manifestation in glory is yet future. "This world" is
used in contrast to express the present fallen condition of the world
([Eph 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)). Believers belong not to
this present world course, but by faith rise in spirit to "the world to
come," making it a present, though internal. reality. Still, in the
present world, natural and social, angels are mediately rulers under God
in some sense: not so in the coming world: man in it, and the Son of
man, man's Head, are to be supreme. Hence greater reverence was paid to
angels by men in the Old Testament than is permitted in the New
Testament. For man's nature is exalted in Christ now, so that angels are
our "fellow servants" ([Rev 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#009)). In
their ministrations they stand on a different footing from that on which
they stood towards us in the Old Testament. We are "brethren" of Christ
in a nearness not enjoyed even by angels ([Heb
2:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010), [Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)).

[Hebrews 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 2:6</span></span>

But--It is not to angels the Gospel kingdom is subject, BUT . . .

one . . . testified--the usual way of quoting Scripture to readers
familiar with it. [Psa 8:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005) praises
Jehovah for exalting MAN, so as to subject all the works of God on earth
to him: this dignity having been lost by the first Adam, is realized
only in Christ the Son of man, the Representative Man and Head of our
redeemed race. Thus Paul proves that it is to MAN, not to angels, that
God has subjected the "world to come." In [Heb
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#006), MAN is spoken of in general
("him . . . him . . . his); then at [Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009), first JESUS is introduced as
fulfilling, as man, all the conditions of the prophecy, and passing
through death Himself; and so consequently bringing us men, His
"brethren," to "glory and honor."

What, &c.--How insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace!
(Compare [Psa 144:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#003)). The Hebrew,
"Enosh" and "Ben-Adam," express "man" and "Son of man" in his weakness:
"Son of man" is here used of any and every child of man: unlike,
seemingly, the lord of creation, such as he was originally (Gen.
1:1-2:25), and such as he is designed to be ([Psa
8:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#001)), and such as he actually is by
title and shall hereafter more fully be in the person of, and in union
with, Jesus, pre-eminently the Son of man ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)).

art mindful--as of one absent.

visitest--lookest after him, as one present.

[Hebrews 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 2:7</span></span>

a little--not as BENGEL, "a little time."

than the angels--Hebrew, "than God," "Elohim," that is, the abstract
qualities of God, such as angels possess in an inferior form; namely,
heavenly, spiritual, incorporeal natures. Man, in his original creation,
was set next beneath them. So the man Jesus, though Lord of angels, when
He emptied Himself of the externals of His Divinity (see on [Phi
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)), was in His human nature "a
little lower than the angels"; though this is not the primary reference
here, but man in general.

crownedst him with glory and honour--as the appointed kingly vicegerent
of God over this earth (Gen. 1:1-2:25).

and didst set him over the works of thy hands--omitted in some of the
oldest manuscripts; but read by others and by oldest versions: so [Psa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006), "Thou madest him to have dominion
over the works of thy hands."

[Hebrews 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 2:8</span></span>

([Co1 15:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#027).)

For in that--that is, "For in that" God saith in the eighth Psalm, "He
put the all things (so the Greek, the all things just mentioned) in
subjection under him (man), He left nothing . . . As no limitation
occurs in the sacred writing, the "all things" must include heavenly, as
well as earthly things (compare [Co1
3:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)).

But now--As things now are, we see not yet the all things put under man.

[Hebrews 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 2:9</span></span>

But--We see not man as yet exercising lordship over all things, "but
rather, Him who was made a little lower than the angels (compare [Luk
22:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#043)), we behold (by faith: a
different Greek verb from that for 'we see,' [Heb
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008), which expresses the impression
which our eyes passively receive from objects around us; whereas, 'we
behold,' or 'look at,' implies the direction and intention of one
deliberately regarding something which he tries to see: so [Heb
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#019); [Heb
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025), Greek), namely, Jesus, on
account of His suffering of death, crowned," &c. He is already crowned,
though unseen by us, save by faith; hereafter all things shall be
subjected to Him visibly and fully. The ground of His exaltation is "on
accoumt of His having suffered death" ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Phi
2:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)).

that he by the grace of God-- ([Tit
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004)). The reading of ORIGEN, "That He
without God" (laying aside His Divinity; or, for every being save God:
or perhaps alluding to His having been temporarily "forsaken," as the
Sin-bearer, by the Father on the cross), is not supported by the
manuscripts. The "that," &c., is connected with "crowned with glory,"
&c., thus: His exaltation after sufferings is the perfecting or
consummation of His work ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010))
for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual; with it, and
from it, flows the result that His tasting of death is available for (in
behalf of, for the good of) every man. He is crowned as the Head in
heaven of our common humanity, presenting His blood as the
all-prevailing plea for us. This coronation above makes His death
applicable for every individual man (observe the singular; not merely
"for all men"), [Heb 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014); [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024); [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002). "Taste death" implies His
personal experimental undergoing of death: death of the body, and death
(spiritually) of the soul, in His being forsaken of the Father. "As a
physician first tastes his medicines to encourage his sick patient to
take them, so Christ, when all men feared death, in order to persuade
them to be bold in meeting it, tasted it Himself, though He had no need"
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]. ([Heb 2:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)).

[Hebrews 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 2:10</span></span>

For--giving a reason why "the grace of God" required that Jesus "should
taste death."

it became him--The whole plan was (not only not derogatory to, but)
highly becoming God, though unbelief considers it a disgrace \[BENGEL\].
An answer to the Jews, and Hebrew Christians, whosoever, through
impatience at the delay in the promised advent of Christ's glory, were
in danger of apostasy, stumbling at Christ crucified. The Jerusalem
Christians especially were liable to this danger. This scheme of
redemption was altogether such a one as harmonizes with the love,
justice, and wisdom of God.

for whom--God the Father ([Rom 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036);
[Co1 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006); [Rev
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#011)). In [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016) the same is said of Christ.

all things--Greek, "the universe of things," "the all things." He uses
for "God," the periphrasis, "Him for whom . . . by whom are all things,"
to mark the becomingness of Christ's suffering as the way to His being
"perfected" as "Captain of our salvation," seeing that His is the way
that pleased Him whose will and whose glory are the end of all things,
and by whose operation all things exist.

in bringing--The Greek is past, "having brought as He did," namely, in
His electing purpose (compare "ye are sons," namely, in His purpose,
[Gal 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)), a purpose which is accomplished
in Jesus being "perfected through sufferings."

many-- ([Mat 20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028)). "The Church"
([Heb 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012)), "the general assembly"
([Heb 12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023)).

sons--no longer children as under the Old Testament law, but sons by
adoption.

unto glory--to share Christ's "glory" ([Heb
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009); compare [Heb
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#007); [Joh
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010), [Joh
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022), [Joh
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024); [Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021)). Sonship, holiness ([Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)), and glory, are inseparably
joined. "Suffering," "salvation," and "glory," in Paul's writings, often
go together ([Ti2 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#010)). Salvation
presupposes destruction, deliverance from which for us required Christ's
"sufferings."

to make . . . perfect--"to consummate"; to bring to consummated glory
through sufferings, as the appointed avenue to it. "He who suffers for
another, not only benefits him, but becomes himself the brighter and
more perfect" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. Bringing to the end of troubles, and to
the goal full of glory: a metaphor from the contests in the public
games. Compare "It is finished," [Luk
24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026); [Joh
19:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#030). I prefer, with CALVIN,
understanding, "to make perfect as a completed sacrifice": legal and
official, not moral, perfection is meant: "to consecrate" (so the same
Greek is translated [Heb 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#028); compare
Margin) by the finished expiation of His death, as our perfect High
Priest, and so our "Captain of salvation" ([Luk
13:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#032)). This agrees with [Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011), "He that sanctifieth," that is,
consecrates them by Himself being made a consecrated offering for them.
So [Heb 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014), [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029); [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019) : by the perfecting of His
consecration for them in His death, He perfects their consecration, and
so throws open access to glory ([Heb
10:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019); [Heb
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#009); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009) accord with this sense).

captain of, &c.--literally, Prince-leader: as Joshua, not Moses, led the
people into the Holy Land, so will our Joshua, or Jesus, lead us into
the heavenly inheritance ([Act 13:39](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#039)).
The same Greek is in [Heb 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002),
"Author of our faith." [Act 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015),
"Prince of life" ([Act 5:31](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#031)).
Preceding others by His example, as well as the originator of our
salvation.

[Hebrews 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 2:11</span></span>

he that sanctifieth--Christ who once for all consecrates His people to
God ([Jde 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001), bringing them nigh to
Him as the consequence) and everlasting glory, by having consecrated
Himself for them in His being made "perfect (as their expiatory
sacrifice) through sufferings" ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014), [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029); [Joh
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017), [Joh
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019)). God in His electing love, by
Christ's finished work, perfectly sanctifies them to God's service and
to heaven once for all: then they are progressively sanctified by the
transforming Spirit "Sanctification is glory working in embryo; glory is
sanctification come to the birth, and manifested" \[ALFORD\].

they who are sanctified--Greek, "they that are being sanctified"
(compare the use of "sanctified," [Co1
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#014)).

of one--Father, God: not in the sense wherein He is Father of all
beings, as angels; for these are excluded by the argument ([Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)); but as He is Father of His
spiritual human sons, Christ the Head and elder Brother, and His
believing people, the members of the body and family. Thus, this and the
following verses are meant to justify his having said, "many sons" ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)). "Of one" is not "of one father
Adam," or "Abraham," as BENGEL and others suppose. For the Saviour's
participation in the lowness of our humanity is not mentioned till [Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014), and then as a consequence of
what precedes. Moreover, "Sons of God" is, in Scripture usage, the
dignity obtained by our union with Christ; and our brotherhood with Him
flows from God being His and our Father. Christ's Sonship (by
generation) in relation to God is reflected in the sonship (by adoption)
of His brethren.

he is not ashamed--though being the Son of God, since they have now by
adoption obtained a like dignity, so that His majesty is not compromised
by brotherhood with them (compare [Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016)). It is a striking feature in
Christianity that it unites such amazing contrasts as "our brother and
our God" \[THOLUCK\]. "God makes of sons of men sons of God, because God
hath made of the Son of God the Son of man" \[ST. AUGUSTINE on Psalm

[Hebrews 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 2:12</span></span>

([Psa 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022).) Messiah declares the
name of the Father, not known fully as Christ's Father, and therefore
their Father, till after His crucifixion ([Joh
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)), among His brethren ("the
Church," that is, the congregation), that they in turn may praise Him
([Psa 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#023)). At [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022), which begins with Christ's cry,
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" and details minutely His
sorrows, passes from Christ's sufferings to His triumph, prefigured by
the same in the experience of David.

will I sing--as leader of the choir ([Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)).

[Hebrews 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 2:13</span></span>

I will put my trust in him--from the Septuagint, [Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017), which immediately precedes the
next quotation, "Behold, I and the children," &c. The only objection is
the following words, "and again," usually introduce a new quotation,
whereas these two are parts of one and the same passage. However, this
objection is not valid, as the two clauses express distinct ideas; "I
will put my trust in Him" expresses His filial confidence in God as His
Father, to whom He flees from His sufferings, and is not disappointed;
which His believing brethren imitate, trusting solely in the Father
through Christ, and not in their own merits. "Christ exhibited this
"trust," not for Himself, for He and the Father are one, but for His own
people" ([Heb 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)). Each fresh aid
given Him assured Him, as it does them, of aid for the future, until the
complete victory was obtained over death and hell [Phi
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016) \[BENGEL\].

Behold I and the children, &c.-- ([Isa
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018)). "Sons" ([Heb
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)), "brethren" ([Heb
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012)), and "children," imply His right
and property in them from everlasting. He speaks of them as "children"
of God, though not yet in being, yet considered as such in His purpose,
and presents them before God the Father, who has given Him them, to be
glorified with Himself. Isaiah (meaning "salvation of Jehovah")
typically represented Messiah, who is at once Father and Son, Isaiah and
Immanuel ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)). He expresses his
resolve to rely, he and his children, not like Ahaz and the Jews on the
Assyrian king, against the confederacy of Pekah of Israel, and Rezin of
Syria, but on Jehovah; and then foretells the deliverance of Judah by
God, in language which finds its antitypical full realization only in
the far greater deliverance wrought by Messiah. Christ, the antitypical
Prophet, similarly, instead of the human confidences of His age,
Himself, and with Him GOD THE FATHER'S children (who are therefore His
children, and so antitypical to Isaiah's children, though here regarded
as His "brethren," compare [Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006);
"Father" and "His seed," [Isa 53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010))
led by Him, trust wholly in God for salvation. The official words and
acts of all the prophets find their antitype in the Great Prophet ([Rev
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#010)), just as His kingly office is
antitypical to that of the theocratic kings; and His priestly office to
the types and rites of the Aaronic priesthood.

[Hebrews 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 2:14</span></span>

He who has thus been shown to be the "Captain (Greek, 'Leader') of
salvation" to the "many sons," by trusting and suffering like them, must
therefore become man like them, in order that His death may be
efficacious for them \[ALFORD\].

the children--before mentioned ([Heb
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013)); those existing in His eternal
purpose, though not in actual being.

are partakers of--literally, "have (in His purpose) been partakers" all
in common.

flesh and blood--Greek oldest manuscripts have "blood and flesh." The
inner and more important element, the blood, as the more immediate
vehicle of the soul, stands before the more palpable element, the flesh;
also, with reference to Christ's blood-shedding with a view to which He
entered into community with our corporeal life. "The life of the flesh
is in the blood; it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul"
([Lev 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011), [Lev
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#014)).

also--Greek, "in a somewhat similar manner"; not altogether in a like
manner. For He, unlike them, was conceived and born not in sin ([Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)). But mainly "in like manner";
not in mere semblance of a body, as the DocetÃ&brvbr; heretics taught.

took part of--participated in. The forfeited inheritance (according to
Jewish law) was ransomed by the nearest of kin; so Jesus became our
nearest of kin by His assumed humanity, in order to be our Redeemer.

that through death--which He could not have undergone as God but only by
becoming man. Not by Almighty power but by His death (so the Greek) He
overcame death. "Jesus suffering death overcame; Satan wielding death
succumbed" \[BENGEL\]. As David cut off the head of Goliath with the
giant's own sword wherewith the latter was wont to win his victories.
Coming to redeem mankind, Christ made Himself a sort of hook to destroy
the devil; for in Him there was His humanity to attract the devourer to
Him, His divinity to pierce him, apparent weakness to provoke, hidden
power to transfix the hungry ravisher. The Latin epigram says, Mors
mortis morti mortem nisi morte tu lisset, Ã†ternÃ&brvbr; vitÃ&brvbr;
janua clausa foret. "Had not death by death borne to death the death of
Death, the gate of eternal life would have been closed".

destroy--literally, "render powerless"; deprive of all power to hurt His
people. "That thou mightest still the enemy and avenger" ([Psa
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#002)). The same Greek verb is used in
[Ti2 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010), "abolished death." There is
no more death for believers. Christ plants in them an undying seed, the
germ of heavenly immortality, though believers have to pass through
natural death.

power--Satan is "strong" ([Mat 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#029)).

of death--implying that death itself is a power which, though originally
foreign to human nature, now reigns over it ([Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012); [Rom
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#009)). The power which death has Satan
wields. The author of sin is the author of its consequences. Compare
"power of the enemy" ([Luk 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019)).
Satan has acquired over man (by God's law, [Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017); [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023)) the power of death by man's sin,
death being the executioner of sin, and man being Satan's "lawful
captive." Jesus, by dying, has made the dying His own ([Rom
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009)), and has taken the prey from the
mighty. Death's power was manifest; he who wielded that power, lurking
beneath it, is here expressed, namely, Satan. Wisdom 2:24, "By the envy
of the devil, death entered into the world."

[Hebrews 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 2:15</span></span>

fear of death--even before they had experienced its actual power.

all their lifetime--Such a life can hardly be called life.

subject to bondage--literally, "subjects of bondage"; not merely liable
to it, but enthralled in it (compare [Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001)). Contrast with this bondage, the
glory of the "sons" ([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010)).
"Bondage" is defined by Aristotle, "The living not as one chooses";
"liberty," "the living as one chooses." Christ by delivering us from the
curse of God against our sin, has taken from death all that made it
formidable. Death, viewed apart from Christ, can only fill with horror,
if the sinner dares to think.

[Hebrews 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">heb 2:16</span></span>

For verily--Greek, "For as we all know"; "For as you will doubtless
grant." Paul probably alludes to [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008); [Jer
31:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032), Septuagint, from which all Jews
would know well that the fact here stated as to Messiah was what the
prophets had led them to expect.

took not on him, &c.--rather, "It is not angels that He is helping (the
present tense implies duration); but it is the seed of Abraham that He
is helping." The verb is literally, to help by taking one by the hand,
as in [Heb 8:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#009), "When I took them by
the hand," &c. Thus it answers to "succor," [Heb
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018), and "deliver," [Heb
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015). "Not angels," who have no flesh
and blood, but "the children," who have "flesh and blood," He takes hold
of to help by "Himself taking part of the same" ([Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)). Whatever effect Christ's work
may have on angels, He is not taking hold to help them by suffering in
their nature to deliver them from death, as in our case.

the seed of Abraham--He views Christ's redemption (in compliment to the
Hebrews whom he is addressing, and as enough for his present purpose)
with reference to Abraham's seed, the Jewish nation, primarily; not that
he excludes the Gentiles ([Heb 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#009),
"for every man"), who, when believers, are the seed of Abraham
spiritually (compare [Heb 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012); [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022), [Psa
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025), [Psa
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)), but direct reference to them
(such as is in [Rom 4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011), [Rom
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016); [Gal
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007), [Gal
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014), [Gal
3:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028)) would be out of place in his
present argument. It is the same argument for Jesus being the Christ
which Matthew, writing his Gospel for the Hebrews, uses, tracing the
genealogy of Jesus from Abraham, the father of the Jews, and the one to
whom the promises were given, on which the Jews especially prided
themselves (compare [Rom 9:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)).

[Hebrews 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">heb 2:17</span></span>

Wherefore--Greek, "Whence." Found in Paul's speech, [Act
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019).

in all things--which are incidental to manhood, the being born,
nourished, growing up, suffering. Sin is not, in the original
constitution of man, a necessary attendant of manhood, so He had no sin.

it behooved him--by moral necessity, considering what the justice and
love of God required of Him as Mediator (compare [Heb
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003)), the office which He had
voluntarily undertaken in order to "help" man ([Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)).

his brethren-- ([Heb 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011)); "the seed
of Abraham" ([Heb 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)), and so also
the spiritual seed, His elect out of all mankind.

be, &c.--rather as Greek, "that He might become High Priest"; He was
called so, when He was "made perfect by the things which He suffered"
([Heb 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#010); [Heb
5:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008)). He was actually made so, when
He entered within the veil, from which last flows His ever continuing
intercession as Priest for us. The death, as man, must first be, in
order that the bringing in of the blood into the heavenly Holy Place
might follow, in which consisted the expiation as High Priest.

merciful--to "the people" deserving wrath by "sins." Mercy is a prime
requisite in a priest, since his office is to help the wretched and
raise the fallen: such mercy is most likely to be found in one who has a
fellow-feeling with the afflicted, having been so once Himself ([Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)); not that the Son of God needed
to be taught by suffering to be merciful, but that in order to save us
He needed to take our manhood with all its sorrows, thereby qualifying
Himself, by experimental suffering with us, to be our sympathizing High
Priest, and assuring us of His entire fellow-feeling with us in every
sorrow. So in the main CALVIN remarks here.

faithful--true to God ([Heb 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)) and
to man ([Heb 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023)) in the mediatorial
office which He has undertaken.

high priest--which Moses was not, though "faithful" (Heb. 2:1-18).
Nowhere, except in [Psa 110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013), and in this Epistle, is Christ
expressly called a priest. In this Epistle alone His priesthood is
professedly discussed; whence it is evident how necessary is this book
of the New Testament. In [Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001),
and [Zac 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013), there is added mention
of the kingdom of Christ, which elsewhere is spoken of without the
priesthood, and that frequently. On the cross, whereon as Priest He
offered the sacrifice, He had the title "King" inscribed over Him
\[BENGEL\].

to make reconciliation for the sins--rather as Greek, "to propitiate (in
respect to) the sins"; "to expiate the sins." Strictly divine justice is
"propitiated"; but God's love is as much from everlasting as His
justice; therefore, lest Christ's sacrifice, or its typical forerunners,
the legal sacrifices, should be thought to be antecedent to God's grace
and love, neither are said in the Old or New Testament to have
propitiated God; otherwise Christ's sacrifices might have been thought
to have first induced God to love and pity man, instead of (as the fact
really is) His love having originated Christ's sacrifice, whereby divine
justice and divine love are harmonized. The sinner is brought by that
sacrifice into God's favor, which by sin he had forfeited; hence his
right prayer is, "God be propitiated (so the Greek) to me who am a
sinner" ([Luk 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)). Sins bring death
and "the fear of death" ([Heb 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#015)).
He had no sin Himself, and "made reconciliation for the iniquity" of all
others ([Dan 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)).

of the people--"the seed of Abraham" ([Heb
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#016)); the literal Israel first, and
then (in the design of God), through Israel, the believing Gentiles, the
spiritual Israel ([Pe1 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010)).

[Hebrews 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 2:18</span></span>

For--explanation of how His being made like His brethren in all things
has made Him a merciful and faithful High Priest for us ([Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)).

in that--rather as Greek, "wherein He suffered Himself; having been
tempted, He is able to succor them that are being tempted" in the same
temptation; and as "He was tempted (tried and afflicted) in all points,"
He is able (by the power of sympathy) to succor us in all possible
temptations and trials incidental to man ([Heb
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016); [Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002)). He is the antitypical Solomon,
having for every grain of Abraham's seed (which were to be as the sand
for number), "largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the
seashore" ([Kg1 4:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1004.htm#029)). "Not only as
God He knows our trials, but also as man He knows them by experimental
feeling."
