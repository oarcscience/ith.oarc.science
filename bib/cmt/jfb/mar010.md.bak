### [Mark Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)

[Mark 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">mar 10:32</span></span>

THIRD EXPLICIT AND STILL FULLER ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS APPROACHING
SUFFERINGS, DEATH, AND RESURRECTION--THE AMBITIOUS REQUEST OF JAMES AND
JOHN, AND THE REPLY. ( = [Mat
20:17-28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017.md); [Luk
18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031).md). ([Mar
10:32-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#032).md)

And they were in the way--on the road.

going up to Jerusalem--in Perea, and probably somewhere between Ephraim
and Jericho, on the farther side of the Jordan, and to the northeast of
Jerusalem.

and Jesus went before them--as GROTIUS says, in the style of an intrepid
Leader.

and they were amazed--or "struck with astonishment" at His courage in
advancing to certain death.

and as they followed, they were afraid--for their own safety. These
artless, lifelike touches--not only from an eye-witness, but one whom
the noble carriage of the Master struck with wonder and awe--are
peculiar to Mark, and give the second Gospel a charm all its own; making
us feel as if we ourselves were in the midst of the scenes it describes.
Well might the poet exclaim:

"The Saviour, what a noble flame

Was kindled in His breast,

When, hasting to Jerusalem,

He march'd before the rest!"

COWPER

And he took again the twelve--referring to His previous announcements on
this sad subject.

and began to tell them what things should happen unto him--"were going
to befall Him." The word expresses something already begun but not
brought to a head, rather than something wholly future.

[Mark 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">mar 10:33</span></span>

Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem--for the last time, and--"all
things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall
be accomplished" ([Luk 18:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031).md).

the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the
scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to
the Gentiles--This is the first express statement that the Gentiles
would combine with the Jews in His death; the two grand divisions of the
human race for whom He died thus taking part in crucifying the Lord of
Glory, as WEBSTER and WILKINSON observe.

[Mark 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">mar 10:34</span></span>

And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him,
and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again--Singularly
explicit as this announcement was, Luke ([Luk
18:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#034).md) says "they understood none of
these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the
things which were spoken." The meaning of the words they could be at no
loss to understand, but their import in relation to His Messianic
kingdom they could not penetrate; the whole prediction being right in
the teeth of their preconceived notions. That they should have clung so
tenaciously to the popular notion of an "unsuffering" Messiah, may
surprise us; but it gives inexpressible weight to their after-testimony
to a suffering and dying Saviour.

Ambitious Request of James and John--The Reply ([Mar
10:35-45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035).md).

[Mark 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">mar 10:35</span></span>

And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying--Matthew
([Mat 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#020).md) says their "mother came
to Him with her sons, worshipping Him and desiring," &c. (Compare [Mat
27:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#056.md), with [Mar
15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040).md). Salome was her name ([Mar
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001).md). We cannot be sure with which of
the parties the movement originated; but as our Lord, even in Matthew's
account, addresses Himself to James and John, taking no account of the
mother, it is likely the mother was merely set on by them. The thought
was doubtless suggested to her sons by the recent promise to the Twelve
of "thrones to sit on, when the Son of man should sit on the throne of
His glory" ([Mat 19:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028).md); but after the
reproof so lately given them ([Mar
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#033), &c..md) they get their mother to
speak for them.

Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire--thus cautiously approaching the subject.

[Mark 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">mar 10:36</span></span>

And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?--Though
well aware what was in their mind and their mother's, our Lord will have
the unseemly petition uttered before all.

[Mark 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">mar 10:37</span></span>

Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on
thy left hand, in thy glory--that is,Assign to us the two places of
highest honor in the coming kingdom. The semblance of a plea for so
presumptuous a request might possibly have been drawn from the fact that
one of the two usually leaned on the breast of Jesus, or sat next Him at
meals, while the other was one of the favored three.

[Mark 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">mar 10:38</span></span>

But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask--How gentle the reply
to such a request, preferred at such a time, after the sad announcement
just made!

can ye drink of the cup that I drink of?--To "drink of a cup" is in
Scripture a figure for getting one's fill either of good ([Psa
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md); [Psa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md); [Psa
116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013.md); [Jer
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#007).md) or of ill ([Psa
75:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md); [Joh
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#011.md); [Rev
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#010).md). Here it is the cup of
suffering.

and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with--(Compare for
the language, [Psa 42:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#007).md). The object
of this question seems to have been to try how far those two men were
capable of the dignity to which they aspired and this on the principle
that he who is able to suffer most for His sake will be the nearest to
Him in His kingdom.

[Mark 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">mar 10:39</span></span>

And they said unto him, We can--Here we see them owning their mother's
petition for them as their own; and doubtless they were perfectly
sincere in professing their willingness to follow their Master to any
suffering He might have to endure. As for James, he was the first of the
apostles who was honored, and showed himself able to be baptized with
his Master's baptism of blood ([Act
12:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#001).md); while John, after going
through all the persecutions to which the infant Church was exposed from
the Jews, and sharing in the struggles and sufferings occasioned by the
first triumphs of the Gospel among the Gentiles, lived to be the victim,
after all the rest had got to glory, of a bitter persecution in the
evening of his days, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus
Christ. Yes, they were dear believers and blessed men, in spite of this
unworthy ambition, and their Lord knew it; and perhaps the foresight of
what they would have to pass through, and the courageous testimony He
would yet receive from them, was the cause of that gentleness which we
cannot but wonder at in His reproof.

And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink
of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be
baptized--No doubt this prediction, when their sufferings at length came
upon them, cheered them with the assurance, not that they would sit on
His right and left hand--for of that thought they would be heartily
ashamed--but that "if they suffered with Him, they should be also
glorified together."

[Mark 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">mar 10:40</span></span>

But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand in not mine to give; but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared--"of My Father" ([Mat
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023).md). The supplement which our
translators have inserted is approved by some good interpreters, and the
proper sense of the word rendered "but" is certainly in favor of it. But
besides that it makes the statement too elliptical--leaving too many
words to be supplied--it seems to make our Lord repudiate the right to
assign to each of His people his place in the kingdom of glory; a thing
which He nowhere else does, but rather the contrary. It is true that He
says their place is "prepared for them by His Father." But that is true
of their admission to heaven at all; and yet from His great white throne
Jesus will Himself adjudicate the kingdom, and authoritatively invite
into it those on His right hand, calling them the "blessed of His
Father"; so little inconsistency is there between the eternal choice of
them by His Father, and that public adjudication of them, not only to
heaven in general, but each to his own position in it, which all
Scripture assigns to Christ. The true rendering, then, of this clause,
we take it, is this: "But to sit on My right hand and on My left hand is
not Mine to give, save to them for whom it is prepared." When therefore
He says, "It is not Mine to give," the meaning is, "I cannot give it as
a favor to whomsoever I please, or on a principle of favoritism; it
belongs exclusively to those for whom it is prepared," &c. And if this
be His meaning, it will be seen how far our Lord is from disclaiming the
right to assign to each his proper place in His Kingdom; that on the
contrary, He expressly asserts it, merely announcing that the principle
of distribution is quite different from what these petitioners supposed.
Our Lord, it will be observed, does not deny the petition of James and
John, or say they shall not occupy the place in His kingdom which they
now improperly sought:--for aught we know, that may be their true place.
All we are sure of is, that their asking it was displeasing to Him "to
whom all judgment is committed," and so was not fitted to gain their
object, but just the reverse. (See what is taught in [Luk
14:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#008).md). One at least of these
brethren, as ALFORD strikingly remarks, saw on the right and on the left
hand of their Lord, as He hung upon the tree, the crucified thieves; and
bitter indeed must have been the remembrance of this ambitious prayer at
that moment.

[Mark 10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">mar 10:41</span></span>

And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James
and John--or "were moved with indignation," as the same word is rendered
in [Mat 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#024.md). The expression "began
to be," which is of frequent occurrence in the Gospels, means that more
passed than is expressed, and that we have but the result. And can we
blame the ten for the indignation which they felt? Yet there was
probably a spice of the old spirit of rivalry in it, which in spite of
our Lord's recent lengthened, diversified, and most solemn warnings
against it, had not ceased to stir in their breasts.

[Mark 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">mar 10:42</span></span>

But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they
which are accounted to rule--are recognized or acknowledged as rulers.

over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them: and their great ones
exercise authority upon them--as superiors exercising an acknowledged
authority over inferiors.

[Mark 10:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">mar 10:43</span></span>

But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you,
shall be your minister--a subordinate servant.

[Mark 10:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">mar 10:44</span></span>

And whosoever of you will be the chiefest--or "first."

shall be--that is, "let him be, or "shall be he who is prepared to be."

servant of all--one in the lowest condition of service.

[Mark 10:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">mar 10:45</span></span>

For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister,
and to give his life a ransom for many--"instead of many," that is, "In
the kingdom about to be set up, this principle shall have no place. All
My servants shall there be equal; and the only greatness known to it
shall be the greatness of humility and devotedness to the service of
others. He that goes down the deepest in these services of self-denying
humility shall rise the highest and hold the chiefest place in that
kingdom; even as the Son of man, whose abasement and self-sacrifice for
others, transcending all, gives Him of right a place above all!" As "the
Word in the beginning with God," He was ministered unto; and as the
risen Redeemer in our nature He now is ministered unto, "angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto Him" ([Pe1
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#022).md); but not for this came He
hither. The Served of all came to be the Servant of all; and His last
act was the grandest Service ever beheld by the universe of God--"HE
GAVE HIS LIFE A RANSOM FOR MANY!", &c. Many" is here to be taken, not in
contrast with few or with all, but in opposition to one--the one Son of
man for the many sinners.
