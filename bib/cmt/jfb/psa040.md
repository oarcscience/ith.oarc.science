### [Psalms Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001)

[Psalms 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 40:1</span></span>

In this Psalm a celebration of God's deliverance is followed by a
profession of devotion to His service. Then follows a prayer for relief
from imminent dangers, involving the overthrow of enemies and the
rejoicing of sympathizing friends. In [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005), &c., Paul quotes [Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006) as the words of Christ,
offering Himself as a better sacrifice. Some suppose Paul thus
accommodated David's words to express Christ's sentiments. But the value
of his quotation would be thus destroyed, as it would have no force in
his argument, unless regarded by his readers as the original sense of
the passage in the Old Testament. Others suppose the Psalm describes
David's feelings in suffering and joy; but the language quoted by Paul,
in the sense given by him, could not apply to David in any of his
relations, for as a type the language is not adapted to describe any
event or condition of David's career, and as an individual representing
the pious generally, neither he nor they could properly use it (see on
[Psa 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007), below). The Psalm must be
taken then, as the sixteenth, to express the feelings of Christ's human
nature. The difficulties pertinent to this view will be considered as
they occur. (Psa. 40:1-17)

The figures for deep distress are illustrated in Jeremiah's history
([Jer 38:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006)). Patience and trust
manifested in distress, deliverance in answer to prayer, and the blessed
effect of it in eliciting praise from God's true worshippers, teach us
that Christ's suffering is our example, and His deliverance our
encouragement ([Heb 5:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007); [Heb
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#003); [Pe1
4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012)).

inclined--(the ear, [Psa 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#006)), as if
to catch the faintest sigh.

[Psalms 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003)

Blessed-- ([Psa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001); [Psa

turn aside--from true God and His law to falsehood in worship and
conduct.

[Psalms 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 40:5</span></span>

be reckoned up in order--(compare [Psa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003); [Psa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#014); [Isa
44:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#007)), too many to be set forth
regularly. This is but one instance of many. The use of the plural
accords with the union of Christ and His people. In suffering and
triumph, they are one with Him.

[Psalms 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 40:6</span></span>

In Paul's view this passage has more meaning than the mere expression of
grateful devotion to God's service. He represents Christ as declaring
that the sacrifices, whether vegetable or animal, general or special
expiatory offerings, would not avail to meet the demands of God's law,
and that He had come to render the required satisfaction, which he
states was effected by "the offering of the body of Christ" \[[Heb
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010)\], for that is the "will of God"
which Christ came to fulfil or do, in order to effect man's redemption.
We thus see that the contrast to the unsatisfactory character assigned
the Old Testament offerings in [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006) is found in the compliance with
God's law (compare [Psa 40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007)). Of
course, as Paul and other New Testament writers explain Christ's work,
it consisted in more than being made under the law or obeying its
precepts. It required an "obedience unto death" \[[Phi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)\], and that is the compliance here
chiefly intended, and which makes the contrast with [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006) clear.

mine ears hast thou opened--Whether allusion is made to the custom of
boring a servant's ear, in token of voluntary and perpetual enslavement
([Exo 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006)), or that the opening of
the ear, as in [Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008); [Isa
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005) (though by a different word in
Hebrew) denotes obedience by the common figure of hearing for obeying,
it is evident that the clause is designed to express a devotion to God's
will as avowed more fully in [Psa
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008), and already explained. Paul,
however, uses the words, "a body hast thou prepared me" \[[Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)\], which are found in the
Septuagint in the place of the words, "mine ears hast thou opened." He
does not lay any stress on this clause, and his argument is complete
without it. It is, perhaps, to be regarded rather as an interpretation
or free translation by the Septuagint, than either an addition or
attempt at verbal translation. The Septuagint translators may have had
reference to Christ's vicarious sufferings as taught in other
Scriptures, as in [Isa 53:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004); at all
events, the sense is substantially the same, as a body was essential to
the required obedience (compare [Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004); [Pe1
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024)).

[Psalms 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 40:7</span></span>

Then--in such case, without necessarily referring to order of time.

Lo, I come--I am prepared to do, &c.

in the volume of the book--roll of the book. Such rolls, resembling
maps, are still used in the synagogues.

written of me--or on me, prescribed to me ([Kg2
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013)). The first is the sense adopted
by Paul. In either case, the Pentateuch, or law of Moses, is meant, and
while it contains much respecting Christ directly, as [Gen
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015); [Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010); [Deu
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015), and, indirectly, in the
Levitical ritual, there is nowhere any allusion to David.

[Psalms 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 40:9</span></span>

I have preached--literally, "announced good tidings." Christ's
prophetical office is taught. He "preached" the great truths of God's
government of sinners.

[Psalms 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 40:11</span></span>

may be rendered as an assertion, that God will not withhold ([Psa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)).

[Psalms 40:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 40:12</span></span>

evils--inflicted by others.

iniquities--or penal afflictions, and sometimes calamities in the wide
sense. This meaning of the word is very common ([Psa
31:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#011); [Psa
38:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#004); compare [Gen
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013), Cain's punishment; [Gen
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#015), that of Sodom; [Sa1
28:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#010), of the witch of En-dor; also
[Sa2 16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012); [Job
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#029); [Isa
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011)). This meaning of the word is
also favored by the clause, "taken hold of me," which follows, which can
be said appropriately of sufferings, but not of sins (compare [Job
27:20](../../../bib/kjv/job027.htm#020); [Psa
69:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024)). Thus, the difficulties in
referring this Psalm to Christ, arising from the usual reading of this
verse, are removed. Of the terrible afflictions, or sufferings, alluded
to and endured for us, compare [Luk
22:39-44](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#039), and the narrative of the
scenes of Calvary.

my heart faileth me-- ([Mat 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#038)),
"My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death."

cannot look up--literally, "I cannot see," not denoting the depression
of conscious guilt, as [Luk 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013), but
exhaustion from suffering, as dimness of eyes (compare [Psa
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#007); [Psa
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#003); [Psa
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#010)). The whole context thus
sustains the sense assigned to iniquities.

[Psalms 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 40:13</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019)).

[Psalms 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 40:14</span></span>

The language is not necessarily imprecatory, but rather a confident
expectation ([Psa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011)), though the
former sense is not inconsistent with Christ's prayer for the
forgiveness of His murderers, inasmuch as their confusion and shame
might be the very means to prepare them for humbly seeking forgiveness
(compare [Act 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037)).

[Psalms 40:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 40:15</span></span>

for a reward--literally, "in consequence of."

Aha--(Compare [Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021), [Psa
35:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#025)).

[Psalms 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 40:16</span></span>

(Compare [Psa 35:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#027)).

love thy salvation--delight in its bestowal on others as well as
themselves.

[Psalms 40:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 40:17</span></span>

A summary of his condition and hopes.

thinketh upon--or provides for me. "He was heard," "when he had offered
up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, unto Him that
was able to save him from death" \[[Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007)\].
