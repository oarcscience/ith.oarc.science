### [Genesis Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

[Genesis 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gen 7:1</span></span>

ENTRANCE INTO THE ARK. (Gen. 7:1-24)

And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
ark--The ark was finished; and Noah now, in the spirit of implicit
faith, which had influenced his whole conduct, waited for directions
from God.

[Genesis 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gen 7:2</span></span>

Of every clean beast . . . fowls--Pairs of every species of animals,
except the tenants of the deep, were to be taken for the preservation of
their respective kinds. This was the general rule of admission, only
with regard to those animals which are styled "clean," three pairs were
to be taken, whether of beasts or birds; and the reason was that their
rapid multiplication was a matter of the highest importance, when the
earth should be renovated, for their utility either as articles of food
or as employed in the service of man. But what was the use of the
seventh? It was manifestly reserved for sacrifice; and so that both
during Noah's residence in the ark, and after his return to dry land,
provision was made for celebrating the rites of worship according to the
religion of fallen man. He did not, like many, leave religion behind. He
provided for it during his protracted voyage.

[Genesis 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gen 7:4</span></span>

For yet seven days--A week for a world to repent! What a solemn pause!
Did they laugh and ridicule his folly still? He whose eyes saw and whose
heart felt the full amount of human iniquity and perverseness has told
us of their reckless disregard ([Luk
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#027).md).

[Genesis 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gen 7:9</span></span>

There went in two and two--Doubtless they were led by a divine impulse.
The number would not be so large as at first sight one is apt to
imagine. It has been calculated that there are not more than three
hundred distinct species of beasts and birds, the immense varieties in
regard to form, size, and color being traceable to the influence of
climate and other circumstances.

[Genesis 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gen 7:16</span></span>

and the Lord shut him in--literally, "covered him round about." The
"shutting him in" intimated that Noah had become the special object of
divine care and protection, and that to those without the season of
grace was over ([Mat 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#010).md).

[Genesis 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gen 7:17</span></span>

the waters increased, and bare up the ark--It seems to have been raised
so gradually as to be scarcely perceptible to its occupants.

[Genesis 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">gen 7:20</span></span>

Fifteen cubits upward . . . and the mountains were covered--twenty-two
and a half feet above the summits of the highest hills. The language is
not consistent with the theory of a partial deluge.

[Genesis 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">gen 7:21</span></span>

all flesh died . . . fowl . . . cattle, and . . . creeping thing--It has
been a uniform principle in the divine procedure, when judgments were
abroad on the earth, to include every thing connected with the sinful
objects of His wrath ([Gen 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#025.md); [Exo
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#006).md). Besides, now that the human race
was reduced to one single family, it was necessary that the beasts
should be proportionally diminished, otherwise by their numbers they
would have acquired the ascendancy and overmastered the few that were to
repeople the world. Thus goodness was mingled with severity; the Lord
exercises judgment in wisdom and in wrath remembers mercy.

[Genesis 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">gen 7:24</span></span>

an hundred and fifty days--a period of five months. Though long before
that every living creature must have been drowned, such a lengthened
continuance of the flood was designed to manifest God's stern
displeasure at sin and sinners. Think of Noah during such a crisis. We
learn ([Eze 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014).md) that he was a man
who lived and breathed habitually in an atmosphere of devotion; and
having in the exercise of this high-toned faith made God his refuge, he
did not fear "though the waters roared and were troubled; though the
mountains shook with the swelling thereof" \[[Psa
46:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#003.md)\].
