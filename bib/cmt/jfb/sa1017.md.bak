### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 17:1</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES AND PHILISTINES BEING READY TO BATTLE. ([Sa1
17:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#001).md)

the Philistines gathered together their armies--twenty-seven years after
their overthrow at Michmash. Having now recovered their spirits and
strength, they sought an opportunity of wiping out the infamy of that
national disaster, as well as to regain their lost ascendency over
Israel.

Shocoh--now Shuweikeh, a town in the western plains of Judah ([Jos
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#035).md), nine Roman miles from
Eleutheropolis, toward Jerusalem \[ROBINSON\].

Azekah--a small place in the neighborhood.

Ephes-dammim--or, "Pas-dammim" ([Ch1
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch1011.htm#013).md), "the portion" or "effusion of
blood," situated between the other two.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 17:2</span></span>

valley of Elah--that is, "the Terebinth," now Wady Er-Sumt \[ROBINSON\].
Another valley somewhat to the north, now called Wady Beit Hanina, has
been fixed on by the tradition of ages.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">sa1 17:4</span></span>

GOLIATH CHALLENGES A COMBAT. ([Sa1
17:4-11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#004).md)

a champion--Hebrew, a "man between two"; that is, a person who, on the
part of his own people, undertook to determine the national quarrel by
engaging in single combat with a chosen warrior in the hostile army.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 17:5</span></span>

helmet of brass--The Philistine helmet had the appearance of a row of
feathers set in a tiara, or metal band, to which were attached scales of
the same material, for the defense of the neck and the sides of the face
\[OSBORN\].

a coat of mail--a kind of corslet, quilted with leather or plates of
metal, reaching only to the chest, and supported by shoulder straps,
leaving the shoulders and arms at full liberty.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 17:6</span></span>

greaves of brass--boots, terminating at the ankle, made in one plate of
metal, but round to the shape of the leg, and often lined with felt or
sponge. They were useful in guarding the legs, not only against the
spikes of the enemy, but in making way among thorns and briers.

a target of brass--a circular frame, carried at the back, suspended by a
long belt which crossed the breast from the shoulders to the loins.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">sa1 17:7</span></span>

staff of his spear--rather under five feet long, and capable of being
used as a javelin ([Sa1 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#010).md). It had
an iron head.

one bearing a shield--In consequence of their great size and weight, the
Oriental warrior had a trusty and skilful friend, whose office it was to
bear the large shield behind which he avoided the missile weapons of the
enemy. He was covered, cap-a-pie, with defensive armor, while he had
only two offensive weapons--a sword by his side and a spear in his hand.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 17:8</span></span>

I defy the armies of Israel . . .; give me a man, that we may fight
together--In cases of single combat, a warrior used to go out in front
of his party, and advancing towards the opposite ranks, challenge
someone to fight with him. If his formidable appearance, or great
reputation for physical strength and heroism, deterred any from
accepting the challenge, he used to parade himself within hearing of the
enemy's lines, specify in a loud, boastful, bravado style, defying them,
and pouring out torrents of abuse and insolence to provoke their
resentment.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 17:17</span></span>

DAVID ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE, AND SLAYS HIM. (1Sa. 17:12-58)

Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten
loaves--In those times campaigns seldom lasted above a few days at a
time. The soldiers were volunteers or militia, who were supplied with
provisions from time to time by their friends at home.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">sa1 17:18</span></span>

carry these ten cheeses to the captain--to enlist his kind attention.
Oriental cheeses are very small; and although they are frequently made
of so soft a consistence as to resemble curds, those which David carried
seem to have been fully formed, pressed, and sufficiently dried to admit
of their being carried.

take their pledge--Tokens of the soldiers' health and safety were sent
home in the convenient form of a lock of their hair, or piece of their
nail, or such like.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">sa1 17:20</span></span>

David left the sheep with a keeper--This is the only instance in which
the hired shepherd is distinguished from the master or one of his
family.

trench--some feeble attempt at a rampart. It appears (see Margin) to
have been formed by a line of carts or chariots, which, from the
earliest times, was the practice of nomad people.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">sa1 17:22</span></span>

left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage--to make his
way to the standard of Judah.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">sa1 17:25</span></span>

make his father's house free in Israel--His family should be exempted
from the impositions and services to which the general body of the
Israelites were subjected.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">sa1 17:34</span></span>

a lion, and a bear--There were two different rencontres, for those
animals prowl alone. The bear must have been a Syrian bear, which is
believed to be a distinct species, or perhaps a variety, of the brown
bear. The beard applies to the lion alone. Those feats seem to have been
performed with no weapons more effective than the rude staves and stones
of the field, or his shepherd's crook.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">sa1 17:37</span></span>

The Lord that delivered me--It would have been natural for a youth, and
especially an Oriental youth, to make a parade of his gallantry. But
David's piety sank all consideration of his own prowess and ascribed the
success of those achievements to the divine aid, which he felt assured
would not be withheld from him in a cause which so intimately concerned
the safety and honor of His people.

Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee--The pious language
of the modest but valiant youth impressed the monarch's heart. He felt
that it indicated the true military confidence for Israel, and,
therefore, made up his mind, without any demur, to sanction a combat on
which the fate of his kingdom depended, and with a champion supporting
his interests apparently so unequal to the task.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:38](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">sa1 17:38</span></span>

Saul armed David with his armour--The ancient Hebrews were particularly
attentive to the personal safety of their warriors, and hence Saul
equipped the youthful champion with his own defensive accoutrements,
which would be of the best style. It is probable that Saul's coat of
mail, or corslet, was a loose shirt, otherwise it could not have fitted
both a stripling and a man of the colossal stature of the king.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:40](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">sa1 17:40</span></span>

brook--wady.

bag--or scrip for containing his daily food.

sling--The sling consisted of a double rope with a thong, probably of
leather, to receive the stone. The slinger held a second stone in his
left hand. David chose five stones, as a reserve, in case the first
should fail. Shepherds in the East carry a sling and stones still, for
the purpose of driving away, or killing, the enemies that prowl about
the flock.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:42](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">sa1 17:42</span></span>

the Philistine said . . . said David to the Philistine--When the two
champions met, they generally made each of them a speech, and sometimes
recited some verses, filled with allusions and epithets of the most
opprobrious kind, hurling contempt and defiance at one another. This
kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab combatants still.
David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast to the usual
strain of these invectives. It was full of pious trust, and to God he
ascribed all the glory of the triumph he anticipated.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:49](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">sa1 17:49</span></span>

smote the Philistine in his forehead--At the opening for the eyes--that
was the only exposed part of his body.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:51](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">sa1 17:51</span></span>

cut off his head--not as an evidence of the giant's death, for his
slaughter had been effected in presence of the whole army, but as a
trophy to be borne to Saul. The heads of slain enemies are always
regarded in the East as the most welcome tokens of victory.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:52](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">sa1 17:52</span></span>

Shaaraim--(See [Jos 15:36](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#036).md).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:54](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">sa1 17:54</span></span>

tent--the sacred tabernacle. David dedicated the sword of Goliath as a
votive offering to the Lord.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 17:55](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">sa1 17:55</span></span>

Saul . . . said unto Abner . . . whose son is this youth?--A young man
is more spoken of in many Eastern countries by his father's name than
his own. The growth of the beard, and other changes on a now full-grown
youth, prevented the king from recognizing his former favorite minstrel
\[[Sa1 16:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#023.md)\].
