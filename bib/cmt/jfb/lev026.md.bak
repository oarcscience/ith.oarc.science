### [Leviticus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md)

[Leviticus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">lev 26:1</span></span>

OF IDOLATRY. ([Lev 26:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#001).md)

Ye shall make you no idols--Idolatry had been previously forbidden ([Exo
20:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#004).md), but the law was repeated here
with reference to some particular forms of it that were very prevalent
among the neighboring nations.

a standing image--that is, "upright pillar."

image of stone--that is, an obelisk, inscribed with hieroglyphical and
superstitious characters; the former denoting the common and smaller
pillars of the Syrians or Canaanites; the latter, pointing to the large
and elaborate obelisks which the Egyptians worshipped as guardian
divinities, or used as stones of adoration to stimulate religious
worship. The Israelites were enjoined to beware of them.

[Leviticus 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">lev 26:2</span></span>

Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary--Very frequently,
in this Book of the Law, the Sabbath and the sanctuary are mentioned as
antidotes to idolatry.

[Leviticus 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">lev 26:3</span></span>

A BLESSING TO THE OBEDIENT. ([Lev
26:3-13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#003).md)

If ye walk in my statutes--In that covenant into which God graciously
entered with the people of Israel, He promised to bestow upon them a
variety of blessings, so long as they continued obedient to Him as their
Almighty Ruler; and in their subsequent history that people found every
promise amply fulfilled, in the enjoyment of plenty, peace, a populous
country, and victory over all enemies.

[Leviticus 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">lev 26:4</span></span>

I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her
increase--Rain seldom fell in Judea except at two seasons--the former
rain at the end of autumn, the seedtime; and the latter rain in spring,
before the beginning of harvest ([Jer
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024).md).

[Leviticus 26:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">lev 26:5</span></span>

your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach
unto the sowing time, &c.--The barley harvest in Judea was about the
middle of April; the wheat harvest about six weeks after, or in the
beginning of June. After the harvest came the vintage, and fruit
gathering towards the latter end of July. Moses led the Hebrews to
believe that, provided they were faithful to God, there would be no idle
time between the harvest and vintage, so great would be the increase.
(See [Amo 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#013).md). This promise would be
very animating to a people who had come from a country where, for three
months, they were pent up without being able to walk abroad because the
fields were under water.

[Leviticus 26:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">lev 26:10</span></span>

ye shall eat old store--Their stock of old corn would be still
unexhausted and large when the next harvest brought a new supply.

[Leviticus 26:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">lev 26:13</span></span>

I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright--a
metaphorical expression to denote their emancipation from Egyptian
slavery.

[Leviticus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">lev 26:14</span></span>

A CURSE TO THE DISOBEDIENT. (Lev. 26:14-39)

But if ye will not hearken unto me, &c.--In proportion to the great and
manifold privileges bestowed upon the Israelites would be the extent of
their national criminality and the severity of their national
punishments if they disobeyed.

[Leviticus 26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">lev 26:16</span></span>

I will even appoint over you terror--the falling sickness \[PATRICK\].

consumption, and the burning ague--Some consider these as symptoms of
the same disease--consumption followed by the shivering, burning, and
sweating fits that are the usual concomitants of that malady. According
to the Septuagint, "ague" is "the jaundice," which disorders the eyes
and produces great depression of spirits. Others, however, consider the
word as referring to a scorching wind; no certain explanation can be
given.

[Leviticus 26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">lev 26:18</span></span>

if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you
seven times more--that is, with far more severe and protracted
calamities.

[Leviticus 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">lev 26:19</span></span>

I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass--No figures
could have been employed to convey a better idea of severe and
long-continued famine.

[Leviticus 26:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">lev 26:22</span></span>

I will also send wild beasts among you--This was one of the four
judgments threatened ([Eze 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#021.md); see
also [Kg2 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#004).md).

your highways shall be desolate--Trade and commerce will be
destroyed--freedom and safety will be gone--neither stranger nor native
will be found on the roads ([Isa
33:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#008).md). This is an exact picture of the
present state of the Holy Land, which has long lain in a state of
desolation, brought on by the sins of the ancient Jews.

[Leviticus 26:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">lev 26:26</span></span>

ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, &c.--The bread used in
families is usually baked by women, and at home. But sometimes also, in
times of scarcity, it is baked in public ovens for want of fuel; and the
scarcity predicted here would be so great, that one oven would be
sufficient to bake as much as ten women used in ordinary occasions to
provide for family use; and even this scanty portion of bread would be
distributed by weight ([Eze 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#016).md).

[Leviticus 26:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">lev 26:29</span></span>

ye shall eat the flesh of your sons--The revolting picture was actually
exhibited at the siege of Samaria, at the siege of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar ([Lam 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010).md), and at the
destruction of that city by the Romans. (See on [Deu
28:53](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#053).md).

[Leviticus 26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">lev 26:30</span></span>

I will destroy your high places--Consecrated enclosures on the tops of
mountains, or on little hillocks, raised for practising the rites of
idolatry.

cut down your images--According to some, those images were made in the
form of chariots ([Kg2 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011).md);
according to others, they were of a conical form, like small pyramids.
Reared in honor of the sun, they were usually placed on a very high
situation, to enable the worshippers to have a better view of the rising
sun. They were forbidden to the Israelites, and when set up, ordered to
be destroyed.

cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, &c.--Like the
statues of idols, which, when broken, lie neglected and contemned, the
Jews during the sieges and subsequent captivity often wanted the rites
of sepulture.

[Leviticus 26:31](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">lev 26:31</span></span>

I will make your cities waste--This destruction of its numerous and
flourishing cities, which was brought upon Judea through the sins of
Israel, took place by the forced removal of the people during, and long
after, the captivity. But it is realized to a far greater extent now.

bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour
of your sweet odours--the tabernacle and temple, as is evident from the
tenor of the subsequent clause, in which God announces that He will not
accept or regard their sacrifices.

[Leviticus 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">lev 26:33</span></span>

I will scatter you among the heathen, &c.--as was done when the elite of
the nation were removed into Assyria and placed in various parts of the
kingdom.

[Leviticus 26:34](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">lev 26:34</span></span>

Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate,
&c.--A long arrear of sabbatic years had accumulated through the avarice
and apostasy of the Israelites, who had deprived their land of its
appointed season of rest. The number of those sabbatic years seems to
have been seventy, as determined by the duration of the captivity. This
early prediction is very remarkable, considering that the usual policy
of the Assyrian conquerors was to send colonies to cultivate and inhabit
their newly acquired provinces.

[Leviticus 26:38](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">lev 26:38</span></span>

the land of your enemies shall eat you up, &c.--On the removal of the
ten tribes into captivity, they never returned, and all traces of them
were lost.

[Leviticus 26:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">lev 26:40</span></span>

If they shall confess their iniquity, &c.--This passage holds out the
gracious promise of divine forgiveness and favor on their repentance,
and their happy restoration to their land, in memory of the covenant
made with their fathers (Rom. 2:1-29).

[Leviticus 26:46](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">lev 26:46</span></span>

These are the statutes and judgments and laws--It has been thought by
some that the last chapter was originally placed after the twenty-fifth
\[ADAM CLARKE\], while others consider that the next chapter was added
as an appendix, in consequence of many people being influenced by the
promises and threats of the preceding one, to resolve that they would
dedicate themselves and their possessions to the service of God
\[CALMET\].
