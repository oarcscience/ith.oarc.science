### [Psalms Chapter 22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

[Psalms 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 22:1</span></span>

The obscure words Aijeleth Shahar in this title have various
explanations. Most interpreters agree in translating them by "hind of
the morning." But great difference exists as to the meaning of these
words. By some they are supposed (compare [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)) to be the name of the tune to
which the words of the Psalm were set; by others, the name of a musical
instrument. Perhaps the best view is to regard the phrase as
enigmatically expressive of the subject--the sufferer being likened to a
hind pursued by hunters in the early morning (literally, "the dawn of
day")--or that, while hind suggests the idea of a meek, innocent
sufferer, the addition of morning denotes relief obtained. The feelings
of a pious sufferer in sorrow and deliverance are vividly portrayed. He
earnestly pleads for divine aid on the ground of his relation to God,
whose past goodness to His people encourages hope, and then on account
of the imminent danger by which he is threatened. The language of
complaint is turned to that of rejoicing in the assured prospect of
relief from suffering and triumph over his enemies. The use of the words
of the first clause of [Psa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#001) by
our Saviour on the cross, and the quotation of [Psa
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018) by John ([Joh
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#024)), and of [Psa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022) by Paul ([Heb
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#012)), as fulfilled in His history,
clearly intimate the prophetical and Messianic purport of the Psalm. The
intensity of the grief, and the completeness and glory of the
deliverance and triumph, alike appear to be unsuitable representations
of the fortunes of any less personage. In a general and modified sense
(see on [Psa 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001)), the experience
here detailed may be adapted to the case of all Christians suffering
from spiritual foes, and delivered by divine aid, inasmuch as Christ in
His human nature was their head and representative. (Psa. 22:1-31)

A summary of the complaint. Desertion by God, when overwhelmed by
distress, is the climax of the sufferer's misery.

words of my roaring--shows that the complaint is expressed
intelligently, though the term "roaring" is figurative, taken from the
conduct of irrational creatures in pain.

[Psalms 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 22:2</span></span>

The long distress is evinced by--

am not silent--literally, "not silence to me," either meaning, I
continually cry; or, corresponding with "thou hearest not," or answerest
not, it may mean, there is no rest or quiet to me.

[Psalms 22:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 22:3</span></span>

Still he not only refrains from charging God foolishly, but evinces his
confidence in God by appealing to Him.

thou art holy--or possessed of all the attributes which encourage trust,
and the right object of the praises of the Church: hence the sufferer
need not despair.

[Psalms 22:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 22:4</span></span>

Past experience of God's people is a ground of trust. The mention of
"our fathers" does not destroy the applicability of the words as the
language of our Saviour's human nature.

[Psalms 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 22:6</span></span>

He who was despised and rejected of His own people, as a disgrace to the
nation, might well use these words of deep abasement, which express not
His real, but esteemed, value.

[Psalms 22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 22:7</span></span>

For the Jews used one of the gestures ([Mat
27:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039)) here mentioned, when taunting
Him on the cross, and ([Mat 27:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043))
reproached Him almost in the very, language of this passage.

shoot out--or, "open."

the lip--(Compare [Psa 35:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#021)).

[Psalms 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 22:8</span></span>

trusted on the Lord--literally, "rolled"--that is, his burden ([Psa
37:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#005); [Pro
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#003)) on the Lord. This is the
language of enemies sporting with his faith in the hour of his
desertion.

[Psalms 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 22:9</span></span>

Though ironically spoken, the exhortation to trust was well founded on
his previous experience of divine aid, the special illustration of which
is drawn from the period of helpless infancy.

didst make me hope--literally, "made me secure."

[Psalms 22:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 22:11</span></span>

From this statement of reasons for the appeal, he renews it, pleading
his double extremity, the nearness of trouble, and the absence of a
helper.

[Psalms 22:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 22:12</span></span>

His enemies, with the vigor of bulls and rapacity of lions, surround
him, eagerly seeking his ruin. The force of both figures is greater
without the use of any particle denoting comparison.

[Psalms 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 22:14</span></span>

Utter exhaustion and hopeless weakness, in these circumstances of
pressing danger, are set forth by the most expressive figures; the
solidity of the body is destroyed, and it becomes like water; the bones
are parted; the heart, the very seat of vitality, melts like wax; all
the juices of the system are dried up; the tongue can no longer perform
its office, but lies parched and stiffened (compare [Gen
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#004); [Sa2
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2014.htm#014); [Psa
58:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#008)). In this, God is regarded as the
ultimate source, and men as the instruments.

[Psalms 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 22:15</span></span>

the dust of death--of course, denotes the grave. We need not try to find
the exact counterpart of each item of the description in the particulars
of our Saviour's sufferings. Figurative language resembles pictures of
historical scenes, presenting substantial truth, under illustrations,
which, though not essential to the facts, are not inconsistent with
them. Were any portion of Christ's terrible sufferings specially
designed, it was doubtless that of the garden of Gethsemane.

[Psalms 22:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 22:16</span></span>

Evildoers are well described as dogs, which, in the East, herding
together, wild and rapacious, are justly objects of great abhorrence.
The last clause has been a subject of much discussion (involving
questions as to the genuineness of the Hebrew word translated "pierce)"
which cannot be made intelligible to the English reader. Though not
quoted in the New Testament, the remarkable aptness of the description
to the facts of the Saviour's history, together with difficulties
attending any other mode of explaining the clause in the Hebrew, justify
an adherence to the terms of our version and their obvious meaning.

[Psalms 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 22:17</span></span>

His emaciated frame, itself an item of his misery, is rendered more so
as the object of delighted contemplation to his enemies. The verbs,
"look" and "stare," often occur as suggestive of feelings of
satisfaction (compare [Psa 27:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#013); [Psa
54:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#007); [Psa
118:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#007)).

[Psalms 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 22:18</span></span>

This literally fulfilled prediction closes the sad picture of the
exposed and deserted sufferer.

[Psalms 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 22:19</span></span>

He now turns with unabated desire and trust to God, who, in His strength
and faithfulness, is contrasted with the urgent dangers described.

[Psalms 22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 22:20</span></span>

my soul--or self (compare [Psa 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#002);
[Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)).

my darling--literally, "my only one," or, "solitary one," as desolate
and afflicted ([Psa 25:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016); [Psa
35:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#017)).

[Psalms 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 22:21</span></span>

Deliverance pleaded in view of former help, when in the most imminent
danger, from the most powerful enemy, represented by the unicorn or wild
buffalo.

the lion's mouth--(Compare [Psa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#013)). The lion often used as a
figure representing violent enemies; the connecting of the mouth
intimates their rapacity.

[Psalms 22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 22:22</span></span>

He declares his purpose to celebrate God's gracious dealings and publish
His manifested perfections ("name," [Psa
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#011)), &c., and forthwith he invites
the pious (those who have a reverential fear of God) to unite in special
praise for a deliverance, illustrating God's kind regard for the lowly,
whom men neglect \[[Psa 22:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#024)\]. To
hide the face (or eyes) expresses a studied neglect of one's cause, and
refusal of aid or sympathy (compare [Psa
30:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#007); [Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)).

[Psalms 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 22:25</span></span>

My praise shall be of thee--or, perhaps better, "from thee," that is,
God gives grace to praise Him. With offering praise, he further evinces
his gratitude by promising the payment of his vows, in celebrating the
usual festival, as provided in the law ([Deu
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#018); [Deu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#011)), of which the pious or humble,
and they that seek the Lord (His true worshippers) shall partake
abundantly, and join him in praise \[[Psa
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)\]. In the enthusiasm produced by
his lively feelings, he addresses such in words, assuring them of God's
perpetual favor \[[Psa 22:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026)\]. The
dying of the heart denotes death ([Sa1
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#037)); so its living denotes life.

[Psalms 22:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 22:27</span></span>

His case illustrates God's righteous government. Beyond the existing
time and people, others shall be brought to acknowledge and worship God;
the fat ones, or the rich as well as the poor, the helpless who cannot
keep themselves alive, shall together unite in celebrating God's
delivering power, and transmit to unborn people the records of His
grace.

[Psalms 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 22:30</span></span>

it shall be accounted to the Lord for, &c.--or, "it shall be told of the
Lord to a generation." God's wonderful works shall be told from
generation to generation.

[Psalms 22:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 22:31</span></span>

that he hath done this--supply "it," or "this"--that is, what the Psalm
has unfolded.
