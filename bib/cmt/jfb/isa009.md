### [Isaiah Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 9:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER. ([Isa
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001).md)

Nevertheless, &c.--rather, "For darkness shall not (continually) be on
it (that is, the land) on which there is (now) distress" \[HENGSTENBERG
and MAURER\]. The "for" refers, not to the words immediately preceding,
but to the consolations in [Isa
8:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#009.md), [Isa
8:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md). Do not despair, for, &c.

when at the first, &c.--rather, "as the former time has brought contempt
on the land of Zebulun and Naphtali (namely, the deportation of their
inhabitants under Tiglath-pileser, [Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md), a little before the giving of
this prophecy); so shall the after-coming time bring honor to the way of
the sea (the district around the lake of Galilee), the land beyond (but
HENGSTENBERG, "by the side of") Jordan (Perea, east of Jordan, belonging
to Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh), the circle (but HENGSTENBERG,
"Galilee") (that is, region) of the "Gentiles" \[MAURER, HENGSTENBERG,
&c.\]. Galil in Hebrew is a "circle," "circuit," and from it came the
name Galilee. North of Naphtali, inhabited by a mixed race of Jews and
Gentiles of the bordering PhÅ“nician race ([Jdg
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#030.md); [Kg1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#011).md). Besides the recent deportation
by Tiglath-pileser, it had been sorely smitten by Ben-hadad of Syria,
two hundred years before ([Kg1 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1015.htm#020).md).
It was after the Assyrian deportation colonized with heathens, by
Esar-haddon ([Kg2 17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024).md). Hence arose
the contempt for it on the part of the southern Jews of purer blood
([Joh 1:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#046.md); [Joh
7:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#052).md). The same region which was so
darkened once, shall be among the first to receive Messiah's light ([Mat
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013.md), [Mat
4:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#015).md). It was in despised Galilee
that He first and most publicly exercised His ministry; from it were
most of His apostles. Foretold in [Deu
33:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#018.md); [Act
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#007.md); [Psa
68:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#027.md), Jerusalem, the theocratic
capital, might readily have known Messiah; to compensate less favored
Galilee, He ministered mostly there; Galilee's very debasement made it
feel its need of a Saviour, a feeling not known to the self-righteous
Jews ([Mat 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#013).md). It was appropriate,
too, that He who was both "the Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the
Glory of His people Israel," should minister chiefly on the border land
of Israel, near the Gentiles.

[Isaiah 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 9:2</span></span>

the people--the whole nation, Judah and Israel.

shadow of death--the darkest misery of captivity.

[Isaiah 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 9:3</span></span>

multiplied . . . nation--primarily, the rapid increase of Israelites
after the return from Babylon; more fully and exhaustively the rapid
spread of Christianity at first.

not increased the joy--By a slight change in the Hebrew, its (joy) is
substituted by some for not, because "not increased the joy" seems
opposite to what immediately follows, "the joy," &c. HENGSTENBERG,
retains not thus: "Whose joy thou hadst not increased," (that is, hadst
diminished). Others, "Hast thou not increased the joy?" The very
difficulty of the reading, not, makes it less likely to be an
interpolation. HORSLEY best explains it: The prophet sees in vision a
shifting scene, comprehending at one glance the history of the Christian
Church to remotest times--a land dark and thinly peopled--lit up by a
sudden light--filled with new inhabitants--then struggling with
difficulties, and again delivered by the utter and final overthrow of
their enemies. The influx of Gentile converts (represented here by
"Galilee of the Gentiles") soon was to be followed by the growth of
corruption, and the final rise of Antichrist, who is to be destroyed,
while God's people is delivered, as in the case of Gideon's victory over
Midian, not by man's prowess, but by the special interposition of God.

before thee--a phrase taken from sacrificial feasts; the tithe of
harvest was eaten before God ([Deu
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md); [Deu
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#026).md).

as men rejoice . . . divide . . . spoil--referring to the judgments on
the enemies of the Lord and His people, which usually accompany
revelations of His grace.

[Isaiah 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 9:4</span></span>

The occasion of the "joy," the deliverance not only of Ahaz and Judah
from the Assyrian tribute ([Kg2 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#008).md),
and of Israel's ten tribes from the oppressor ([Kg2
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019).md), but of the Jewish Christian
Church from its last great enemy.

hast--the past time for the future, in prophetic vision; it expresses
the certainty of the event.

yoke of his burden--the yoke with which he was burdened.

staff of . . . shoulder--the staff which strikes his shoulder
\[MAURER\]; or the wood, like a yoke, on the neck of slaves, the badge
of servitude \[ROSENMULLER\].

day of Midian-- ([Jdg 7:8-22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008).md). As
Gideon with a handful of men conquered the hosts of Midian, so Messiah
the "child" ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006).md) shall prove to
be the "Prince of peace," and the small Israel under Him shall overcome
the mighty hosts of Antichrist (compare [Mic
5:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002).md), containing the same contrast,
and alluding also to "the Assyrian," the then enemy of the Church, as
here in Isaiah, the type of the last great enemy. For further analogies
between Gideon's victory and the Gospel, compare [Co2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md), with [Jdg
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md). As the "dividing of the spoil"
([Isa 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#003).md) was followed by that which
was "not joy," the making of the idolatrous ephod ([Jdg
8:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#024).md), so the gospel victory was
soon followed by apostasy at the first, and shall be so again after the
millennial overthrow of Antichrist ([Rev
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#003.md), [Rev
20:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#007).md), previous to Satan's last doom
([Rev 20:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#010).md).

[Isaiah 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 9:5</span></span>

every battle, &c.--rather, "every greave of (the warrior who is) armed
with greaves in the din of battle, and the martial garment (or cloak,
called by the Latins sagum) rolled in blood, shall be for burning, (and)
fuel for fire" \[MAURER\]. All warlike accoutrements shall be destroyed,
as no longer required in the new era of peace ([Isa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#004.md); [Isa
11:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md); [Psa
46:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#009.md); [Eze
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#009.md); [Mic
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#005.md), [Mic
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#010.md); [Zac
9:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009).md). Compare [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001.md), as to the previous burning up of
the wicked.

[Isaiah 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 9:6</span></span>

For--the ground of these great expectations,

unto us--for the benefit of the Jews first, and then the Gentiles
(compare "unto you," [Luk 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011).md).

son . . . given-- ([Psa 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007).md). God's
gratuitous gift, on which man had no claim ([Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016.md); [Rom
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023).md).

government . . . upon . . . shoulder--The ensign of office used to be
worn on the shoulder, in token of sustaining the government ([Isa
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#022).md). Here the government on
Messiah's shoulder is in marked antithesis to the "yoke and staff" of
the oppressor on Israel's "shoulder" ([Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004).md). He shall receive the kingdom of
the earth from the Father, to vindicate it from the misrule of those to
whom it was entrusted to hold it for and under the Most High, but who
sought to hold it in defiance of His right; the Father asserts His right
by the Son, the "Heir of all things," who will hold it for Him ([Dan
7:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013).md).

name . . . called--His essential characteristics shall be.

Wonderful--(See on [Isa 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#018.md); [Jdg
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md), Margin; [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016).md).

Counsellor-- ([Psa 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md); [Rom
11:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md); [Co1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024.md); [Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003).md).

mighty God-- ([Isa 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md); [Psa
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#008.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).md) HORSLEY translates: "God the
mighty man." "Unto us . . . God" is equivalent to "Immanuel" ([Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014).md).

everlasting Father--This marks Him as "Wonderful," that He is "a child,"
yet the "everlasting Father" ([Joh
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md); [Joh
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#009).md). Earthly kings leave their
people after a short reign; He will reign over and bless them for ever
\[HENGSTENBERG\].

Prince of Peace--(See on [Isa 9:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#005.md);
[Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010.md); Shiloh, "The
Tranquillizer"). Finally ([Hos 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#018).md).
Even already He is "our peace" ([Luk
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014.md); [Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 9:7</span></span>

Of . . . increase . . . no end--His princely rule shall perpetually
increase and be unlimited ([Dan 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044).md).

throne of David-- ([Kg1 8:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#025.md); [Psa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006.md); [Psa
132:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#011.md); [Jer
3:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md) [Eze
34:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016.md), [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022.md); [Luk
1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032.md); [Act
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030).md).

judgment . . . justice--It is not a kingdom of mere might, and triumph
of force over enemies, but of righteousness ([Isa
42:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021.md); [Psa
45:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#006).md), attainable only in and by
Messiah.

zeal, &c.--including not only Christ's hidden spiritual victory over
Satan at the first coming, but the open one accompanied with "judgments"
on Antichrist and every enemy at the second coming ([Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md); [Psa
9:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#006).md).

Delivered a little later than the previous one. The ninth and tenth
chapters ought to have been so divided. The present division into
chapters was made by Cardinal Hugo, in A.D. 1250; and into verses, by
Robert Stephens, the famous printer of Paris, in 1551. After the
Assyrian invasion of Syria, that of Ephraim shall follow ([Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009).md); [Isa
9:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md), [Isa
9:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), foretell the intestine
discords in Israel after Hoshea had slain Pekah (A.D. 739), that is,
just after the Assyrian invasions, when for seven years it was stripped
of magistrates and torn into factions. There are four strophes, each
setting forth Ephraim's crime and consequent punishment, and ending with
the formula, "For all this His anger is not turned away," &c. ([Isa
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md), [Isa
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), [Isa
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021.md), and [Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 9:8</span></span>

PROPHECY AS TO THE TEN TRIBES. (Isa. 9:8-10:4)

Heading of the prophecy; ([Isa
9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#008).md), the first strophe.

unto Jacob--against the ten tribes \[LOWTH\].

lighted upon--fallen from heaven by divine revelation ([Dan
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#031).md).

[Isaiah 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 9:9</span></span>

know--to their cost: experimentally ([Hos
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007).md).

Samaria--the capital of Ephraim (compare as to phrase, [Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 9:10</span></span>

bricks--in the East generally sun-dried, and therefore soon dissolved by
rain. Granting, say the Ephraimites to the prophet's threat, that our
affairs are in a ruinous state, we will restore them to more than their
former magnificence. Self-confident unwillingness to see the judgments
of God ([Isa 26:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#011).md).

hewn stones-- ([Kg1 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#017).md).

sycamores--growing abundantly on the low lands of Judea, and though
useful for building on account of their antiseptic property (which
induced the Egyptians to use them for the cases of their mummies), not
very valuable. The cedar, on the other hand, was odorous, free from
knots, durable, and precious ([Kg1
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#027).md). "We will replace cottages with
palaces."

[Isaiah 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 9:11</span></span>

adversaries of Rezin--the Assyrians, who shall first attack Damascus,
shall next advance "against him" (Ephraim). This is the punishment of
Ephraim's pride in making light ([Isa
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#010).md) of the judgment already
inflicted by God through Tiglath-pileser ([Kg2
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029).md). A second Assyrian invasion
(see on [Isa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#001).md) shall follow. The
reading "princes" for "adversaries" in uncalled for.

join--rather, "arm"; cover with armor \[MAURER\].

his--Rezin's.

[Isaiah 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 9:12</span></span>

Syrians--Though now allies of Ephraim, after Rezin's death they shall
join the Assyrians against Ephraim. "Together," in [Isa
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#011.md), refers to this. Conquering
nations often enlist in their armies the subject races ([Isa
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006.md); compare [Kg2
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#009.md); [Jer
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011).md), \[ABEN EZRA, GESENIUS\].
HORSLEY less probably takes "Syrians before," as the Syrians to the
east, that is, not Rezin's subjects, but the Assyrians: "Aram" being the
common name of Syrians and Assyrians.

Philistines--of Palestine.

behind--from the west: in marking the points of the compass,
Orientalists face the east, which is before them: the west is behind.
The right hand is the south: the left, the north.

devour--as a ravenous beast ([Isa
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#020.md); [Jer
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#025.md); [Jer
30:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#016.md); [Num
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#009).md).

For all this, &c.--The burden of each strophe.

[Isaiah 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 9:13</span></span>

Second strophe.

turneth not--the design of God's chastisements; not fulfilled in their
case; a new cause for punishment ([Jer
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#020.md); [Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003).md).

[Isaiah 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 9:14</span></span>

head and tail--proverbial for the highest and lowest ([Deu
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013.md), [Deu
28:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#044).md).

branch and rush--another image for the same thought ([Isa
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#015).md). The branch is elevated on the
top of the tree: the rush is coarse and low.

[Isaiah 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 9:15</span></span>

ancient--the older.

honourable--the man of rank.

prophet . . . lies, . . . tail--There were many such in Samaria ([Kg1
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#006.md), [Kg1
22:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022.md); compare as to "tail," [Rev
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev009.htm#019).md).

[Isaiah 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 9:16</span></span>

leaders, &c.--(See [Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012.md), Margin,
and see on [Isa 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#012)..md)

[Isaiah 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 9:17</span></span>

no joy--the parallelism, "neither . . . mercy," shows that this means,
He shall have no such delight in their youthful warriors, however much
they be the nation's delight and reliance, as to save them from the
enemy's sword ([Isa 31:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#008.md); compare [Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021).md).

fatherless, &c.--not even the usual objects of His pity ([Psa
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#014.md), [Psa
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#018.md); [Psa
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md); [Jer
49:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#011.md); [Hos
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#003).md) shall be spared.

hypocrite--rather, a libertine, polluted \[HORSLEY\].

folly--wickedness ([Psa 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001).md).

still--Notwithstanding all these judgments, more remain.

[Isaiah 9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 9:18</span></span>

Third strophe.

burneth--maketh consumption, not only spreading rapidly, but also
consuming like fire: sin is its own punishment.

briers . . . thorns--emblem of the wicked; especially those of low rank
([Isa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#004.md); [Sa2
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006).md).

forest--from the humble shrubbery the flame spreads to the vast forest;
it reaches the high, as well as the low.

mount up like . . . smoke--rather. "They (the thickets of the forest)
shall lift themselves proudly aloft \[the Hebrew is from a Syriac root,
a cock, expressing stateliness of motion, from his strutting gait,
HORSLEY\], in (in passing into) volumes of ascending smoke" \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 9:19</span></span>

darkened--namely, with smoke ([Isa
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#018).md). The Septuagint and Chaldee
render it, "is burnt up," so MAURER, from an Arabic root meaning
"suffocating heat."

no man . . . spare . . . brother--intestine discord snapping asunder the
dearest ties of nature.

[Isaiah 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 9:20</span></span>

hungry--not literally. Image from unappeasable hunger, to picture
internal factions, reckless of the most tender ties ([Isa
9:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#019).md), and insatiably spreading misery
and death on every side ([Jer 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009).md).

eat--not literally, but destroy ([Psa
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#002.md); [Job
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/job019.htm#022).md).

flesh of . . . arm--those nearest akin: their former support (helper)
([Isa 32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002).md) \[MAURER\].

between them but one tribe; but now about to be rent into factions,
thirsting for each other's blood. Disunited in all things else, but
united "together against their brother Judah" ([Kg2
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010.md), [Kg2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030).md).
