### [Isaiah Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 12:2</span></span>

THANKSGIVING HYMN OF THE RESTORED AND CONVERTED JEWS. ([Isa
12:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#001).md)

Lord JEHOVAH--Jah, Jehovah. The repetition of the name denotes emphasis,
and the unchangeableness of God's character.

strength . . . song . . . salvation--derived from [Exo
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#002.md); [Psa
118:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#014.md). The idea of salvation was
peculiarly associated with the feast of tabernacles (see [Isa
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003).md). Hence the cry "Hosanna," "Save,
we beseech thee," that accompanied Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem
on that day (the fifteenth of the seventh month) ([Mat
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#009.md); compare with [Psa
118:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025).md); the earnest of the
perfected "salvation" which He shall bring to His people at His glorious
second appearance at Jerusalem ([Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028).md). "He shall appear the second
time without sin unto salvation." Compare [Rev
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#003.md), "The tabernacle of God is with
men." Compare [Luk 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033.md), "three
tabernacles: one for thee," &c. (the transfiguration being a pledge of
the future kingdom), ([Psa 118:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#015.md);
[Zac 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#016).md). As the Jew was reminded
by the feast of tabernacles of his wanderings in tents in the
wilderness, so the Jew-Gentile Church to come shall call to mind, with
thanksgiving, the various past ways whereby God has at last brought them
to the heavenly "city of habitation" ([Psa
107:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#007).md).

[Isaiah 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 12:3</span></span>

draw water . . . salvation--an expressive image in a hot country. On the
last day of the feast of tabernacles the Jews used to bring water in a
golden pitcher from the fountain of Siloam, and pour it, mingled with
wine, on the sacrifice on the altar, with great rejoicing. This is the
allusion in Jesus' words on "the last day of the feast" ([Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002.md), [Joh
7:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037).md). The pouring out of water
indicated repentance ([Sa1 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#006.md);
compare, as to the Jews' repentance hereafter, [Zac
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010).md). There shall be a latter
outpouring of the Spirit like the former one on pentecost ([Joe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#023).md).

wells--not mere streams, which may run dry, but ever-flowing fountains
([Joh 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md); [Joh
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038).md), "Out of his belly (that is, in
and from himself)--living water" ([Isa
42:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#018.md); [Psa
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md); [Zac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md); [Rev
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017).md).

[Isaiah 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 12:4</span></span>

make mention--Hebrew, "cause it to be remembered."

[Isaiah 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 12:5</span></span>

Sing, &c.--alluding to [Exo 15:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#021.md).

[Isaiah 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 12:6</span></span>

inhabitant of Zion--Hebrew, "inhabitress"; so "daughter of Zion," that
is, Zion and its people.

in the midst of thee--of Jerusalem literally ([Jer
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md); [Eze
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035.md); [Zep
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#015.md), [Zep
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#017.md); [Zac
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010).md).

The predictions as to foreign nations are for the sake of the covenant
people, to preserve them from despair, or reliance on human
confederacies, and to strengthen their faith in God: also in order to
extirpate narrow-minded nationality: God is Jehovah to Israel, not for
Israel's sake alone, but that He may be thereby Elohim to the nations.
These prophecies are in their right chronological place, in the
beginning of Hezekiah's reign; then the nations of Western Asia, on the
Tigris and Euphrates, first assumed a most menacing aspect.
