### [James Introduction](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

[James](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)

THIS is called by EUSEBIUS (\[Ecclesiastical History, 2.23\], about the
year 330 A.D.) the first of the Catholic Epistles, that is, the Epistles
intended for general circulation, as distinguished from Paul's Epistles,
which were addressed to particular churches or individuals. In the
oldest manuscripts of the New Testament extant, they stand before the
Epistles of Paul. Of them, two only are mentioned by EUSEBIUS as
universally acknowledged (Homologoumena), namely, the First Epistle of
Peter, and the First Epistle of John. All, however, are found in every
existing manuscript of the whole New Testament.

It is not to be wondered at that Epistles not addressed to particular
churches (and particularly one like that of James, addressed to the
Israelite believers scattered abroad) should be for a time less known.
The first mention of James' Epistle by name occurs early in the third
century, in ORIGEN \[Commentary on John 1:19, 4.306\], who was born
about 185, and died A.D. 254. CLEMENT OF ROME (\[First Epistle to the
Corinthians, 10\]; compare [Jam 2:21](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021.md),
[Jam 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md); \[First Epistle to the
Corinthians, 11\]; compare [Jam 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md);
[Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031).md) quotes it. So also HERMAS
\[Shepherd\] quotes [Jam 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md). IRENÃ†US
\[Against Heresies, 4.16.2\] is thought to refer to [Jam
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#023.md). CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA commented
on it, according to CASSIODORUS. EPHREM THE SYRIAN \[Against the Greeks,
3.51\] quotes [Jam 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001.md). An especially
strong proof of its authenticity is afforded by its forming part of the
old Syriac version, which contains no other of the disputed books
(Antilegomena, \[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 3.25\]), except the
Epistle to the Hebrews. None of the Latin fathers before the fourth
century quote it; but soon after the Council of Nicea it was admitted as
canonical both by the East and West churches, and specified as such in
the Councils of Hippo and Carthage (397 A.D.). This is just what we
might expect; a writing known only partially at first, when subsequently
it obtained a wider circulation, and the proofs were better known of its
having been recognized in apostolic churches, having in them men endowed
with the discernment of spirits, which qualified them for discriminating
between inspired and uninspired writings, was universally accepted.
Though doubted for a time, at last the disputed books (James, Second
Peter, Second and Third John, Jude, and Revelation) were universally and
undoubtingly accepted, so that no argument for the Old Testament
Apocrypha can be drawn from their case: as to it the Jewish Church had
no doubt; it was known not to be inspired.

LUTHER'S objection to it ("an Epistle of straw, and destitute of an
evangelic character") was due to his mistaken idea that it ([Jam
2:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014).md) opposes the doctrine of
justification by faith, and not by works, taught by Paul. But the two
apostles, while looking at justification from distinct standpoints,
perfectly harmonize and mutually complement the definitions of one
another. Faith precedes love and the works of love; but without them it
is dead. Paul regards faith in the justification of the sinner before
God; James, in the justification of the believer evidently before men.
The error which James meets was the Jewish notion that their possession
and knowledge of the law of God would justify them, even though they
disobeyed it (compare [Jam 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#022.md) with
[Rom 2:17-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017).md). [Jam
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#003.md); [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md), [Jam
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md) seem plainly to allude to [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md); [Rom
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md); [Rom
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023.md); [Rom
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md). Also the tenor of [Jam
2:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#014.md) on "justification," seems to
allude to Paul's teaching, so as to correct false Jewish notions of a
different kind from those which he combatted, though not unnoticed by
him also ([Rom 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017), &c..md).

Paul ([Gal 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009).md) arranges the names
"James, Cephas, John," in the order in which their Epistles stand. James
who wrote this Epistle (according to most ancient writers) is called
([Gal 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md), "the Lord's brother." He
was son of Alpheus or Cleopas ([Luk
24:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013).md) and Mary, sister of the
Virgin Mary. Compare [Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040.md) with
[Joh 19:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md), which seems to identify
the mother of James the Less with the wife of Cleopas, not with the
Virgin Mary, Cleopas' wife's sister. Cleopas is the Hebrew, Alpheus the
Greek mode of writing the same name. Many, however, as HEGESIPPUS
\[EUSEBIUS, Ecclesiastical History, 23.1\], distinguish the Lord's
brother from the son of Alpheus. But the Gospel according to the
Hebrews, quoted by JEROME, represents James, the Lord's brother, as
present at the institution of the Eucharist, and therefore identical
with the apostle James. So the Apocryphal Gospel of James. In Acts,
James who is put foremost in Jerusalem after the death of James, the son
of Zebedee, is not distinguished from James, the son of Alpheus. He is
not mentioned as one of the Lord's brethren in [Act
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#014.md); but as one of the "apostles"
([Gal 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019).md). He is called "the Less"
(literally, "the little," [Mar 15:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#040).md),
to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. ALFORD considers
James, the brother of the Lord, the author of the Epistle, to have been
the eldest of the sons of Joseph and Mary, after Jesus (compare [Mat
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#055).md), and that James the son of
Alpheus is distinguished from him by the latter being called "the Less,"
(that is, junior). His arguments against the Lord's brother, the bishop
of Jerusalem, being the apostle, are: (1) The Lord's brethren did not
believe on Jesus at a time when the apostles had been already called
([Joh 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003.md), [Joh
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#005).md), therefore none of the Lord's
brethren could be among the apostles (but it does not follow from [Joh
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003) that no one of them believed). (2.md)
The apostles' commission was to preach the Gospel everywhere, not to be
bishops in a particular locality (but it is unlikely that one not an
apostle should be bishop of Jerusalem, to whom even apostles yield
deference, [Act 15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md), [Act
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md); [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md), [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md). The Saviour's last command to
the apostles collectively to preach the Gospel everywhere, is not
inconsistent with each having a particular sphere of labor in which he
should be a missionary bishop, as Peter is said to have been at
Antioch).

He was surnamed "the Just." It needed peculiar wisdom so to preach the
Gospel as not to disparage the law. As bishop of Jerusalem writing to
the twelve tribes, he sets forth the Gospel in its aspect of relation to
the law, which the Jews so reverenced. As Paul's Epistles are a
commentary on the doctrines flowing from the death and resurrection of
Christ, so James's Epistle has a close connection with His teaching
during His life on earth, especially His Sermon on the Mount. In both,
the law is represented as fulfilled in love: the very language is
palpably similar (compare [Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md)
with [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md); [Jam
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#004.md) with [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048.md); [Jam
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md); [Jam
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#015.md) with [Mat
7:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md) with [Mat
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md); [Mat
6:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014.md); [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md) with [Mat
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019.md); [Jam
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md) with [Mat
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024.md); [Jam
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md) with [Mat
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#001.md); [Jam
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#002.md) with [Mat
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019).md). The whole spirit of this
Epistle breathes the same Gospel-righteousness which the Sermon on the
Mount inculcates as the highest realization of the law. James's own
character as "the Just," or legally righteous, disposed him to this
coincidence (compare [Jam 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020.md); [Jam
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010.md); [Jam
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#018.md) with [Mat
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020).md). It also fitted him for
presiding over a Church still zealous for the law ([Act
21:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md); [Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012).md). If any could win the Jews to
the Gospel, he was most likely who presented a pattern of Old Testament
righteousness, combined with evangelical faith (compare also [Jam
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md) with [Mat
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md), [Mat
5:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048).md). Practice, not profession, is
the test of obedience (compare [Jam
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#017.md); [Jam
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#017) with Mat. 7:2-23.md). Sins of the
tongue, however lightly regarded by the world, are an offense against
the law of love (compare [Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026.md);
Jam. 3:2-18 with [Mat 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md); also any
swearing, [Jam 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#012.md); compare [Mat
5:33-37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033).md).

The absence of the apostolic benediction in this Epistle is probably due
to its being addressed, not merely to the believing, but also indirectly
to unbelieving, Israelites. To the former he commends humility,
patience, and prayer; to the latter he addresses awful warnings ([Jam
5:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007.md); [Jam
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#009.md); [Jam
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001).md).

James was martyred at the Passover. This Epistle was probably written
just before it. The destruction of Jerusalem foretold in it ([Jam
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#001), &c..md), ensued a year after his
martyrdom, A.D. 69. HEGESIPPUS (quoted in EUSEBIUS \[Ecclesiastical
History, 2.23\]) narrates that he was set on a pinnacle of the temple by
the scribes and Pharisees, who begged him to restrain the people who
were in large numbers embracing Christianity. "Tell us," said they in
the presence of the people gathered at the feast, "which is the door of
Jesus?" James replied with a loud voice, "Why ask ye me concerning Jesus
the Son of man? He sitteth at the right hand of power, and will come
again on the clouds of heaven." Many thereupon cried, Hosanna to the Son
of David. But James was cast down headlong by the Pharisees; and
praying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," he was
stoned and beaten to death with a fuller's club. The Jews, we know from
Acts, were exasperated at Paul's rescue from their hands, and therefore
determined to wreak their vengeance on James. The publication of his
Epistle to the dispersed Israelites, to whom it was probably carried by
those who came up to the periodical feasts, made him obnoxious to them,
especially to the higher classes, because it foretold the woes soon
about to fall on them and their country. Their taunting question, "Which
is the door of Jesus?" (that is, by what door will He come when He
returns?), alludes to his prophecy, "the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
. . . behold the Judge standeth before the door" ([Jam
5:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#008).md). [Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007.md) probably refers to the martyrdom
of James, who had been so long bishop over the Jewish Christians at
Jerusalem, "Remember them which have (rather, 'had') the rule
(spiritually) over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God; whose
faith follow, considering the end of their conversation."

His inspiration as an apostle is expressly referred to in [Act
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md), [Act
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md), "My sentence is," &c.: "It
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us," &c. His episcopal authority
is implied in the deference paid to him by Peter and Paul ([Act
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#017.md); [Act
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md); [Gal
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019.md); [Gal
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009).md). The Lord had appeared specially
to him after the resurrection ([Co1
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007).md). Peter in his First Epistle
(universally from the first received as canonical) tacitly confirms the
inspiration of James's Epistle, by incorporating with his own inspired
writings no less than ten passages from James. The "apostle of the
circumcision," Peter, and the first bishop of Jerusalem, would naturally
have much in common. Compare [Jam 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)
with [Pe1 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#001.md); [Jam
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md) with [Pe1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#006.md); [Pe1
4:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#012.md); [Jam
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#011.md) with [Pe1
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md); [Jam
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018.md) with [Pe1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003.md); [Jam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007.md) with [Pe1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#014.md); [Jam
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md) with [Pe1
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012.md); [Jam
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md) with [Pe1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md); [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md) with [Pe1
5:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md); [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md) with [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md), [Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009.md); [Jam
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#010.md) with [Pe1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md); [Jam
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020.md) with [Pe1
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#006.md). Its being written in the purest
Greek shows it was intended not only for the Jews at Jerusalem, but also
for the Hellenistic, that is, Greek-speaking, Jews.

The style is close, curt, and sententious, gnome following after gnome.
A Hebraic character pervades the Epistle, as appears in the occasional
poetic parallelisms ([Jam 3:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001).md).
Compare "assembly": Greek, "synagogue," [Jam
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#002.md), Margin. The images are analogical
arguments, combining at once logic and poetry. Eloquence and
persuasiveness are prominent characteristics.

The similarity to Matthew, the most Hebrew of the Gospels, is just what
we might expect from the bishop of Jerusalem writing to Israelites. In
it the higher spirit of Christianity is seen putting the Jewish law in
its proper place. The law is enforced in its everlasting spirit, not in
the letter for which the Jews were so zealous. The doctrines of grace,
the distinguishing features of Paul's teaching to the Hellenists and
Gentiles, are less prominent as being already taught by that apostle.
James complements Paul's teaching, and shows to the Jewish Christians
who still kept the legal ordinances down to the fall of Jerusalem, the
spiritual principle of the law, namely, love manifested in obedience. To
sketch "the perfect man" continuing in the Gospel law of liberty, is his
theme.
