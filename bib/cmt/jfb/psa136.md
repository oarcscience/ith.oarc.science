### [Psalms Chapter 136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 136:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 136:1</span></span>

The theme is the same as that of Psalm 135. God should be praised for
His works of creation and providence, His deliverance and care of His
people, and judgments on their enemies, and His goodness to all. The
chorus to every verse is in terms of that of [Psa
106:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md); [Psa
118:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md), and was perhaps used as the
Amen by the people, in worship (compare [Ch1
16:36](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#036.md); [Psa
105:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#045)). (Psa. 136:1-26.md)

The divine titles denote supremacy.

[Psalms 136:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 136:4</span></span>

alone--excluding all help.

[Psalms 136:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 136:5</span></span>

by wisdom--or, "in wisdom" ([Psa
104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024).md).

made--literally, "maker of."

above the waters--or, "higher than the waters" ([Psa
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002).md).

[Psalms 136:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 136:12</span></span>

Compare similar expressions ([Exo
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#020.md); [Deu
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#034), &c..md).

[Psalms 136:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 136:15</span></span>

overthrew--literally, "shook off," as in [Exo
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md), as a contemptuous rejection of
a reptile.

[Psalms 136:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 136:23</span></span>

remembered us--or, "for us" ([Psa
132:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#001).md).

our low estate--that is, captivity.

[Psalms 136:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">psa 136:24</span></span>

And hath redeemed us--or, literally, "snatched us"--alluding to the
sudden deliverance effected by the overthrow of Babylon.

[Psalms 136:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 136:25</span></span>

To the special favors to His people is added the record of God's
goodness to all His creatures (compare [Mat
6:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#030).md).

[Psalms 136:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 136:26</span></span>

God of heaven--occurs but once ([Jon
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#009).md) before the captivity. It is used
by the later writers as specially distinguishing God from idols.
