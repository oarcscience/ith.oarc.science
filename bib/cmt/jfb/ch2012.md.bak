### [2 Chronicles Chapter 12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 12:1</span></span>

REHOBOAM, FORSAKING GOD, IS PUNISHED BY SHISHAK. ([Ch2
12:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#001).md)

when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened
himself--(See on [Ch2 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#017).md). During
the first three years of his reign his royal influence was exerted in
the encouragement of the true religion. Security and ease led to
religious decline, which, in the fourth year, ended in open apostasy.
The example of the court was speedily followed by his subjects, for "all
Israel was with him," that is, the people in his own kingdom. The very
next year, the fifth of his reign, punishment was inflicted by the
invasion of Shishak.

[2 Chronicles 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 12:2</span></span>

Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem--He was the first king
of the twenty-second or Bubastic Dynasty. What was the immediate cause
of this invasion? Whether it was in resentment for some provocation from
the king of Judah, or in pursuance of ambitious views of conquest, is
not said. But the invading army was a vast horde, for Shishak brought
along with his native Egyptians an immense number of foreign
auxiliaries.

[2 Chronicles 12:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 12:3</span></span>

the Lubims--the Libyans of northeastern Africa.

the Sukkiims--Some think these were the Kenite Arabs, dwellers in tents,
but others maintain more justly that these were Arab troglodytes, who
inhabited the caverns of a mountain range on the western coast of the
Red Sea.

and the Ethiopians--from the regions south of Egypt. By the overwhelming
force of numbers, they took the fortresses of Judah which had been
recently put in a state of defense, and marched to lay siege to the
capital. While Shishak and his army was before Jerusalem, the prophet
Shemaiah addressed Rehoboam and the princes, tracing this calamity to
the national apostasy and threatening them with utter destruction in
consequence of having forsaken God ([Ch2
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006).md).

[2 Chronicles 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 12:6</span></span>

the princes of Israel--(compare [Ch2
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005), "the princes of Judah".md).

[2 Chronicles 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ch2 12:7</span></span>

when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves--Their repentance and
contrition was followed by the best effects; for Shemaiah was
commissioned to announce that the phial of divine judgment would not be
fully poured out on them--that the entire overthrow of the kingdom of
Judah would not take place at that time, nor through the agency of
Shishak; and yet, although it should enjoy a respite from total
subversion, \[Judah\] should become a tributary province of Egypt in
order that the people might learn how much lighter and better is the
service of God than that of idolatrous foreign despots.

[2 Chronicles 12:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ch2 12:9</span></span>

So Shishak . . . came up against Jerusalem--After the parenthetical
clause ([Ch2 12:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#005).md) describing the
feelings and state of the beleaguered court, the historian resumes his
narrative of the attack upon Jerusalem, and the consequent pillage both
of the temple and the palace.

he took all--that is, everything valuable he found. The cost of the
targets and shields has been estimated at about Â£239,000 \[NAPIER,
Ancient Workers in Metal\].

the shields of gold--made by Solomon, were kept in the house of the
forest of Lebanon ([Ch2 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2009.htm#016).md). They
seem to have been borne, like maces, by the guards of the palace, when
they attended the king to the temple or on other public processions.
Those splendid insignia having been plundered by the Egyptian conqueror,
others were made of inferior metal and kept in the guard room of the
palace, to be ready for use; as, notwithstanding the tarnished glory of
the court, the old state etiquette was kept up on public and solemn
occasions. An account of this conquest of Judah, with the name of "king
of Judah" in the cartouche of the principal captive, according to the
interpreters, is carved and written in hieroglyphics on the walls of the
great palace of Karnak, where it may be seen at the present day. This
sculpture is about twenty-seven hundred years old, and is of peculiar
interest as a striking testimony from Egypt to the truth of Scripture
history.

[2 Chronicles 12:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ch2 12:12</span></span>

when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him--The
promise ([Ch2 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#007).md) was verified.
Divine providence preserved the kingdom in existence, a reformation was
made in the court, while true religion and piety were diffused
throughout the land.

[2 Chronicles 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ch2 12:13</span></span>

HIS REIGN AND DEATH. ([Ch2 12:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#013).md)

Rehoboam strengthened . . . and reigned--The Egyptian invasion had been
a mere predatory expedition, not extending beyond the limits of Judah,
and probably, ere long, repelled by the invaded. Rehoboam's government
acquired new life and vigor by the general revival of true religion, and
his reign continued many years after the departure of Shishak. But

he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord--that is, he did not adhere
firmly to the good course of reformation he had begun, "and he did
evil," for through the unhappy influence of his mother, a heathen
foreigner, he had no doubt received in his youth a strong bias towards
idolatry (see on [Kg1 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#021).md).
