### [Psalms Chapter 18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 18:1</span></span>

"The servant of the LORD," which in the Hebrew precedes "David," is a
significant part of the title (and not a mere epithet of David),
denoting the inspired character of the song, as the production of one
entrusted with the execution of God's will. He was not favored by God
because he served Him, but served Him because selected and appointed by
God in His sovereign mercy. After a general expression of praise and
confidence in God for the future, David gives a sublimely poetical
description of God's deliverance, which he characterizes as an
illustration of God's justice to the innocent and His righteous
government. His own prowess and success are celebrated as the results of
divine aid, and, confident of its continuance, he closes in terms of
triumphant praise. 2Sa. 22:1-51 is a copy of this Psalm, with a few
unimportant variations recorded there as a part of the history, and
repeated here as part of a collection designed for permanent use. (Psa.
18:1-50)

I will love thee--with most tender affection.

[Psalms 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 18:2</span></span>

The various terms used describe God as an object of the most implicit
and reliable trust.

rock--literally, "a cleft rock," for concealment.

strength--a firm, immovable rock.

horn of my salvation--The horn, as the means of attack or defense of
some of the strongest animals, is a frequent emblem of power or strength
efficiently exercised (compare [Deu
33:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#017.md); [Luk
1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069).md).

tower--literally, "high place," beyond reach of danger.

[Psalms 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 18:3</span></span>

to be praised--for past favors, and worthy of confidence.

[Psalms 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 18:4</span></span>

sorrows--literally, "bands as of a net" ([Psa
116:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#003).md).

floods--denotes "multitude."

[Psalms 18:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 18:5</span></span>

death--and hell (compare [Psa 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010).md)
are personified as man's great enemies (compare [Rev
20:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#013).md).

prevented--encountered me, crossed my path, and endangered my safety. He
does not mean he was in their power.

[Psalms 18:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 18:6</span></span>

He relates his methods to procure relief when distressed, and his
success.

temple--(Compare [Psa 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 18:7</span></span>

God's coming described in figures drawn from His appearance on Sinai
(compare [Deu 32:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#022).md).

[Psalms 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 18:8</span></span>

smoke out . . . his nostrils--bitter in His wrath (compare [Psa
74:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#001).md).

by it--that is, the fire ([Exo 19:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018).md).

[Psalms 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 18:9</span></span>

darkness--or, a dense cloud ([Exo
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md); [Deu
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022).md).

[Psalms 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">psa 18:10</span></span>

cherub--angelic agents (compare [Gen
3:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024).md), the figures of which were
placed over the ark ([Sa1 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#004).md),
representing God's dwelling; used here to enhance the majesty of the
divine advent. Angels and winds may represent all rational and
irrational agencies of God's providence (compare [Psa
104:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003).md).

did fly--Rapidity of motion adds to the grandeur of the scene.

[Psalms 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">psa 18:11</span></span>

dark waters--or, clouds heavy with vapor.

[Psalms 18:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 18:12</span></span>

Out of this obscurity, which impresses the beholder with awe and dread,
He reveals Himself by sudden light and the means of His terrible wrath
([Jos 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md); [Psa
78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047).md).

[Psalms 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 18:13</span></span>

The storm breaks forth--thunder follows lightning, and hail with
repeated lightning, as often seen, like balls or coals of fire, succeed
([Exo 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023).md).

[Psalms 18:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">psa 18:14</span></span>

The fiery brightness of lightning, in shape like burning arrows rapidly
shot through the air, well represents the most terrible part of an awful
storm. Before the terrors of such a scene the enemies are confounded and
overthrown in dismay.

[Psalms 18:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 18:15</span></span>

The tempest of the air is attended by appropriate results on earth. The
language, though not expressive of any special physical changes,
represents the utter subversion of the order of nature. Before such a
God none can stand.

[Psalms 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 18:16</span></span>

from above--As seated on a throne, directing these terrible scenes,
God--

sent--His hand ([Psa 144:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#007).md), reached
down to His humble worshipper, and delivered him.

many waters--calamities ([Job 30:14](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#014.md);
[Psa 124:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 18:18</span></span>

prevented-- ([Psa 18:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 18:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 18:19</span></span>

a large place--denotes safety or relief, as contrasted with the straits
of distress ([Psa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#001).md). All his
deliverance is ascribed to God, and this sublime poetical representation
is given to inspire the pious with confidence and the wicked with dread.

[Psalms 18:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 18:20</span></span>

The statements of innocence, righteousness, &c., refer, doubtless, to
his personal and official conduct and his purposes, during all the
trials to which he was subjected in Saul's persecutions and Absalom's
rebellions, as well as the various wars in which he had been engaged as
the head and defender of God's Church and people.

[Psalms 18:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 18:23</span></span>

upright before him--In my relation to God I have been perfect as to all
parts of His law. The perfection does not relate to degree.

mine iniquity--perhaps the thought of his heart to kill Saul ([Sa1
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006).md). That David does not allude to
all his conduct, in all relations, is evident from [Psa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md), &c.

[Psalms 18:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 18:25</span></span>

God renders to men according to their deeds in a penal, not vindictive,
sense ([Lev 26:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023).md).

merciful--or, "kind" ([Psa 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003).md).

[Psalms 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 18:26</span></span>

froward--contrary to.

[Psalms 18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">psa 18:27</span></span>

the afflicted people--that is, the humbly pious.

high looks--pride ([Psa 101:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#005.md); [Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 18:28</span></span>

To give one light is to make prosperous ([Job
18:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#005.md); [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017).md).

thou--is emphatic, as if to say, I can fully confide in Thee for help.

[Psalms 18:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 18:29</span></span>

And this on past experience in his military life, set forth by these
figures.

[Psalms 18:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 18:30</span></span>

God's perfection is the source of his own, which has resulted from his
trust on the one hand, and God's promised help on the other.

tried--"as metals are tried by fire and proved genuine" ([Psa
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#006).md). Shield ([Psa
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003).md). Girding was essential to free
motion on account of the looseness of Oriental dresses; hence it is an
expressive figure for describing the gift of strength.

[Psalms 18:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 18:33</span></span>

God's help farther described. He gives swiftness to pursue or elude his
enemies ([Hab 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#019).md), strength,
protection, and a firm footing.

[Psalms 18:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 18:35</span></span>

thy gentleness--as applied to God--condescension--or that which He
gives, in the sense of humility (compare [Pro
22:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 18:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 18:36</span></span>

enlarged my steps--made ample room (compare [Pro
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#012).md).

[Psalms 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 18:37</span></span>

In actual conflict, with God's aid, the defeat of his enemies is
certain. A present and continued success is expressed.

[Psalms 18:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 18:39</span></span>

that rose up against me--literally, "insurgents" ([Psa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#001.md); [Psa
44:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#005).md).

[Psalms 18:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 18:40</span></span>

given me the necks--literally, "backs of the necks"; made them retreat
([Exo 23:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027.md); [Jos
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 18:42](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">psa 18:42</span></span>

This conquest was complete.

[Psalms 18:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 18:43</span></span>

Not only does He conquer civil foes, but foreigners, who are driven from
their places of refuge.

[Psalms 18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">psa 18:44</span></span>

submit, &c.--(compare Margin)--that is, show a forced subjection.

[Psalms 18:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 18:46</span></span>

The Lord liveth--contrasts Him with idols ([Co1
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 18:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 18:47</span></span>

avengeth me--His cause is espoused by God as His own.

[Psalms 18:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 18:48</span></span>

liftest me up--to safety and honors.

[Psalms 18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 18:49</span></span>

Paul ([Rom 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009).md) quotes from this
doxology to show that under the Old Testament economy, others than the
Jews were regarded as subjects of that spiritual government of which
David was head, and in which character his deliverances and victories
were typical of the more illustrious triumphs of David's greater Son.
The language of [Psa 18:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#050.md) justifies
this view in its distinct allusion to the great promise (compare [Sa2
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012).md). In all David's successes he saw
the pledges of a fulfilment of that promise, and he mourned in all his
adversities, not only in view of his personal suffering, but because he
saw in them evidences of danger to the great interests which were
committed to his keeping. It is in these aspects of his character that
we are led properly to appreciate the importance attached to his sorrows
and sufferings, his joys and successes.
