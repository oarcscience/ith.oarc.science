Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

[Luke 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 9:1</span></span>

MISSION OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES. ([Luk
9:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#001))

[Luke 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#007)

said of some, that John was risen--Among many opinions, this was the one
which Herod himself adopted, for the reason, no doubt, mentioned on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014).

[Luke 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">luk 9:9</span></span>

desired to see him--but did not, till as a prisoner He was sent to him
by Pilate just before His death, as we learn from [Luk
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#008).

[Luke 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 9:24</span></span>

PETER'S CONFESSION OF CHRIST--OUR LORD'S FIRST EXPLICIT ANNOUNCEMENT OF
HIS APPROACHING DEATH, AND WARNINGS ARISING OUT OF IT. ([Luk
9:18-27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#018))

will save--"Is minded to save," bent on saving. The pith of this maxim
depends--as often in such weighty sayings (for example, "Let the dead
bury the dead," [Mat 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#022)) --on the
double sense attached to the word "life," a lower and a higher, the
natural and the spiritual, temporal and eternal. An entire sacrifice of
the lower, or a willingness to make it, is indispensable to the
preservation of the higher life; and he who cannot bring himself to
surrender the one for the sake of the other shall eventually lose both.

[Luke 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 9:26</span></span>

ashamed of me, and of my words--The sense of shame is one of the
strongest in our nature, one of the social affections founded on our
love of reputation, which causes instinctive aversion to what is fitted
to lower it, and was given us as a preservative from all that is
properly shameful. When one is, in this sense of it, lost to shame, he
is nearly past hope ([Zac 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005); [Jer
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015); [Jer
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#003)). But when Christ and "His
words"--Christianity, especially in its more spiritual and
uncompromising features--are unpopular, the same instinctive desire to
stand well with others begets the temptation to be ashamed of Him, which
only the 'expulsive power' of a higher affection can effectually
counteract.

Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh, &c.--He will render to that man
his own treatment; He will disown him before the most august of all
assemblies, and put him to "shame and everlasting contempt" ([Dan
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002)). "Oh shame, to be put to shame
before God, Christ, and angels!" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 9:27</span></span>

not taste of death fill they see the kingdom of God--"see it come with
power" ([Mar 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#001)); or see "the Son of
man coming in His kingdom" ([Mat
16:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#028)). The reference, beyond doubt,
is to the firm establishment and victorious progress, in the lifetime of
some then present, of that new Kingdom of Christ, which was destined to
work the greatest of all changes on this earth, and be the grand pledge
of His final coming in glory.

[Luke 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 9:28</span></span>

JESUS TRANSFIGURED. ([Luk 9:28-36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#028))

an eight days after these sayings--including the day on which this was
spoken and that of the Transfiguration. Matthew and Mark say ([Mat
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001); [Mar
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#002)) "after six days," excluding these
two days. As the "sayings" so definitely connected with the
transfiguration scene are those announcing His death--at which Peter and
all the Twelve were so startled and scandalized--so this scene was
designed to show to the eyes as well as the heart how glorious that
death was in the view of Heaven.

Peter, James, and John--partners before in secular business; now sole
witnesses of the resurrection of Jairus' daughter ([Mar
5:37](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#037)), the transfiguration, and the
agony in the garden ([Mar 14:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#033)).

a mountain--not Tabor, according to long tradition, with which the facts
ill comport, but some one near the lake.

to pray--for the period He had now reached was a critical and anxious
one. (See on [Mat 16:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#013)). But who can
adequately translate those "strong cryings and tears?" Methinks, as I
steal by His side, I hear from Him these plaintive sounds, "Lord, who
hath believed Our report? I am come unto Mine own and Mine own receive
Me not; I am become a stranger unto My brethren, an alien to My mother's
children: Consider Mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate Me
with cruel hatred. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail. Thou that
dwellest between the cherubim, shine forth: Show Me a token for good:
Father, glorify Thy name."

[Luke 9:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 9:29</span></span>

as he prayed, the fashion, &c.--Before He cried He was answered, and
while He was yet speaking He was heard. Blessed interruption to prayer
this! Thanks to God, transfiguring manifestations are not quite
strangers here. Ofttimes in the deepest depths, out of groanings which
cannot be uttered, God's dear children are suddenly transported to a
kind of heaven upon earth, and their soul is made as the chariots of
Amminadab. Their prayers fetch down such light, strength, holy gladness,
as make their face to shine, putting a kind of celestial radiance upon
it ([Co2 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018), with [Exo
34:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#029)).

raiment white, &c.--Matthew says, "His face did shine as the sun" ([Mat
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#002)), and Mark says ([Mar
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003)), "His raiment became shining,
exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can white them" ([Mar
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#003)). The light, then, it would seem,
shone not upon Him from without, but out of Him from within; He was all
irradiated, was in one blaze of celestial glory. What a contrast to that
"visage more marred than men, and His form than the sons of men!" ([Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014)).

[Luke 9:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 9:30</span></span>

there talked with him two men . . . Moses and Elias . . . appeared in
glory--"Who would have believed these were not angels had not their
human names been subjoined?" \[BENGEL\]. (Compare [Act
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010); [Mar
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#005)). Moses represented "the law,"
Elijah "the prophets," and both together the whole testimony of the Old
Testament Scriptures, and the Old Testament saints, to Christ; now not
borne in a book, but by living men, not to a coming, but a come Messiah,
visibly, for they "appeared," and audibly, for they "spake."

[Luke 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">luk 9:31</span></span>

spake--"were speaking."

of his decease--"departure"; beautiful euphemism (softened term) for
death, which Peter, who witnessed the scene, uses to express his own
expected death, and the use of which single term seems to have recalled
the whole by a sudden rush of recollection, and occasioned that
delightful allusion to this scene which we find in [Pe2
1:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015).

which he should accomplish--"was to fulfil."

at Jerusalem--Mark the historical character and local features which
Christ's death assumed to these glorified men--as important as it is
charming--and see on [Luk 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011). What
now may be gathered from this statement? (1) That a dying Messiah is the
great article of the true Jewish theology. For a long time the Church
had fallen clean away from the faith of this article, and even from a
preparedness to receive it. But here we have that jewel raked out of the
dunghill of Jewish traditions, and by the true representatives of the
Church of old made the one subject of talk with Christ Himself. (2) The
adoring gratitude of glorified men for His undertaking to accomplish
such a decease; their felt dependence upon it for the glory in which
they appeared; their profound interest in the progress of it, their
humble solaces and encouragements to go through with it; and their sense
of its peerless and overwhelming glory. "Go, matchless, adored One, a
Lamb to the slaughter! rejected of men, but chosen of God and precious;
dishonored, abhorred, and soon to be slain by men, but worshipped by
cherubim, ready to be greeted by all heaven. In virtue of that decease
we are here; our all is suspended on it and wrapped up in it. Thine
every step is watched by us with ineffable interest; and though it were
too high an honor to us to be permitted to drop a word of cheer into
that precious but now clouded spirit, yet, as the first-fruits of
harvest; the very joy set before Him, we cannot choose but tell Him that
what is the depth of shame to Him is covered with glory in the eyes of
Heaven, that the Cross to Him is the Crown to us, that that 'decease' is
all our salvation and all our desire." And who can doubt that such a
scene did minister deep cheer to that spirit? It is said they "talked"
not to Him, but "with Him"; and if they told Him how glorious His
decease was, might He not fitly reply, "I know it, but your voice, as
messengers from heaven come down to tell it Me, is music in Mine ears."

[Luke 9:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 9:32</span></span>

and when they were awake--so, certainly, the most commentators: but if
we translate literally, it should be "but having kept awake" \[MEYER,
ALFORD\]. Perhaps "having roused themselves up" \[OLSHAUSEN\] may come
near enough to the literal sense; but from the word used we can gather
no more than that they shook off their drowsiness. It was night, and the
Lord seems to have spent the whole night on the mountain ([Luk
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037)).

saw his glory, &c.--The emphasis lies on "saw," qualifying them to
become "eye-witnesses of His majesty" ([Pe2
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#016)).

[Luke 9:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">luk 9:33</span></span>

they departed--Ah! bright manifestations in this vale of tears are
always "departing" manifestations.

[Luke 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">luk 9:34</span></span>

a cloud--not one of our watery clouds, but the Shekinah-cloud (see on
[Mat 23:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#039)), the pavilion of the
manifested presence of God with His people, what Peter calls "the
excellent" of "magnificent glory" ([Pe2
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017)).

a voice--"such a voice," says Peter emphatically; "and this voice \[he
adds\] we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount" ([Pe2
1:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#017)).

[Luke 9:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">luk 9:35</span></span>

my beloved Son . . . hear him--reverentially, implicitly, alone.

[Luke 9:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#036)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 9:36</span></span>

Jesus was found alone--Moses and Elias are gone. Their work is done, and
they have disappeared from the scene, feeling no doubt with their fellow
servant the Baptist, "He must increase, but I must decrease." The cloud
too is gone, and the naked majestic Christ, braced in spirit, and
enshrined in the reverent affection of His disciples, is left--to
suffer!

kept it close--feeling, for once at least, that such things were unmeet
as yet for the general gaze.

[Luke 9:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#043)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 9:43</span></span>

DEMONIAC AND LUNATIC BOY HEALED--CHRIST'S SECOND EXPLICIT ANNOUNCEMENT
OF HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION. ([Luk
9:37-45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#037))

the mighty power of God--"the majesty" or "mightiness" of God in this
last miracle, the transfiguration, &c.: the divine grandeur of Christ
rising upon them daily. By comparing [Mat
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022), and [Mar
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#030), we gather that this had been the
subject of conversation between the Twelve and their Master as they
journeyed along.

[Luke 9:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#044)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 9:44</span></span>

these sayings--not what was passing between them about His grandeur
\[MEYER, &c.\], but what He was now to repeat for the second time about
His sufferings \[DE WETTE, STIER, ALFORD, &c.\]; that is, "Be not
carried off your feet by all this grandeur of Mine, but bear in mind
what I have already told you, and now distinctly repeat, that that Sun
in whose beams ye now rejoice is soon to set in midnight gloom." "The
Son of man," says Christ, "into the hands of men"--a remarkable
antithesis (also in [Mat 17:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#022), and
[Mar 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#031)).

[Luke 9:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 9:45</span></span>

and they feared--"insomuch that they feared." Their most cherished ideas
were so completely dashed by such announcements, that they were afraid
of laying themselves open to rebuke by asking Him any questions.

[Luke 9:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 9:46</span></span>

STRIFE AMONG THE TWELVE WHO SHOULD BE GREATEST--JOHN REBUKED FOR
EXCLUSIVENESS. ([Luk 9:46-48](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#046))

(See on [Mat 18:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#001)).

[Luke 9:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 9:49</span></span>

John answered, &c.--The link of connection here with the foregoing
context lies in the words "in My name" ([Luk
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#048)). "Oh, as to that," said John,
young, warm, but not sufficiently apprehending Christ's teaching in
these things, "we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we forbade
him: Were we wrong?" "Ye were wrong." "But we did because he followeth
not us,'" "No matter. For (1) There is no man which shall do a miracle
in My name that can lightly \[soon\] speak evil of Me' \[[Mar
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#039)\]. And (2) If such a person
cannot be supposed to be 'against us,' you are to consider him 'for
us.'" Two principles of immense importance. Christ does not say this man
should not have followed "with them," but simply teaches how he was to
be regarded though he did not--as a reverer of His name and a promoter
of His cause. Surely this condemns not only those horrible attempts by
force to shut up all within one visible pale of discipleship, which have
deluged Christendom with blood in Christ's name, but the same spirit in
its milder form of proud ecclesiastic scowl upon all who "after the form
which they call a sect (as the word signifies, [Act
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014)), do so worship the God of their
fathers." Visible unity in Christ's Church is devoutly to be sought, but
this is not the way to it. See the noble spirit of Moses ([Num
11:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#024)).

[Luke 9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 9:51</span></span>

THE PERIOD OF HIS ASSUMPTION APPROACHING CHRIST TAKES HIS LAST LEAVE OF
GALILEE--THE SAMARITANS REFUSE TO RECEIVE HIM. ([Luk
9:51-56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051))

the time was come--rather, "the days were being fulfilled," or
approaching their fulfilment.

that he should be received up--"of His assumption," meaning His
exaltation to the Father; a sublime expression, taking the sweep of His
whole career, as if at one bound He was about to vault into glory. The
work of Christ in the flesh is here divided into two great stages; all
that preceded this belonging to the one, and all that follows it to the
other. During the one, He formally "came to His own," and "would have
gathered them"; during the other, the awful consequences of "His own
receiving Him not" rapidly revealed themselves.

he steadfastly set his face--the "He" here is emphatic--"He Himself
then." See His own prophetic language, "I have set my face like a flint"
([Isa 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)).

go to Jerusalem--as His goal, but including His preparatory visits to it
at the feasts of tabernacles and of dedication ([Joh
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#002), [Joh
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#010); [Joh
10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022)), and all the intermediate
movements and events.

[Luke 9:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 9:52</span></span>

messengers before his face . . . to make ready for him--He had not done
this before; but now, instead of avoiding, He seems to court
publicity--all now hastening to maturity.

[Luke 9:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#053)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 9:53</span></span>

did not receive him, because, &c.--The Galileans, in going to the
festivals at Jerusalem, usually took the Samaritan route \[JOSEPHUS,
Antiquities, 20.6.1\], and yet seem to have met with no such
inhospitality. But if they were asked to prepare quarters for the
Messiah, in the person of one whose "face was as though He would go to
Jerusalem," their national prejudices would be raised at so marked a
slight upon their claims. (See on [Joh
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020)).

[Luke 9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">luk 9:54</span></span>

James and John--not Peter, as we should have expected, but those "sons
of thunder" ([Mar 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017)), who
afterwards wanted to have all the highest honors of the Kingdom to
themselves, and the younger of whom had been rebuked already for his
exclusiveness ([Luk 9:49-50](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#049)). Yet this
was "the disciple whom Jesus loved," while the other willingly drank of
His Lord's bitter cup. (See on [Mar
10:38-40](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#038); and [Act
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002)). That same fiery zeal, in a
mellowed and hallowed form, in the beloved disciple, we find in [Jo1
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#010); [Jo3
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo3001.htm#010).

fire . . . as Elias--a plausible case, occurring also in Samaria ([Kg2
1:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 9:55</span></span>

know not what . . . spirit--The thing ye demand, though in keeping with
the legal, is unsuited to the genius of the evangelical dispensation.
The sparks of unholy indignation would seize readily enough on this
example of Elias, though our Lord's rebuke (as is plain from [Luk
9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056)) is directed to the principle
involved rather than the animal heat which doubtless prompted the
reference. "It is a golden sentence of Tillotson, Let us never do
anything for religion which is contrary to religion" \[WEBSTER and
WILKINSON\].

[Luke 9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">luk 9:56</span></span>

For the Son of man, &c.--a saying truly divine, of which all His
miracles--for salvation, never destruction--were one continued

went to another--illustrating His own precept ([Mat
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#023)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">luk 9:61</span></span>

INCIDENTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF DISCIPLESHIP. ([Luk
9:57-62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#057))

I will follow . . . but--The second disciple had a "but" too--a
difficulty in the way just then. Yet the different treatment of the two
cases shows how different was the spirit of the two, and to that our
Lord addressed Himself. The case of Elisha ([Kg1
19:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#019)), though apparently similar
to this, will be found quite different from the "looking back" of this
case, the best illustration of which is that of those Hindu converts of
our day who, when once persuaded to leave their spiritual fathers in
order to "bid them farewell which are at home at their house," very
rarely return to them. (Also see on [Mat
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021).)

[Luke 9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">luk 9:62</span></span>

No man, &c.--As ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be
made, and is marred the instant one turns about, so will they come short
of salvation who prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention,
a divided heart. Though the reference seems chiefly to ministers, the
application is general. The expression "looking back" has a manifest
reference to "Lot's wife" ([Gen 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026);
and see on [Luk 17:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#032)). It is not
actual return to the world, but a reluctance to break with it. (Also see
on [Mat 8:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021).)
