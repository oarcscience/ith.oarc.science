### [Psalms Chapter 56](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)

[Psalms 56:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 56:1</span></span>

Upon Jonath-elem-rechokim--literally, "upon the dove of silence" of
distant places; either denoting a melody (see on [Psa
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#001)) of that name, to which this Psalm
was to be performed; or it is an enigmatical form of denoting the
subject, as given in the history referred to ([Sa1
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#011), &c.), David being regarded as
an uncomplaining, meek dove, driven from his native home to wander in
exile. Beset by domestic and foreign foes, David appeals confidently to
God, recites his complaints, and closes with joyful and assured
anticipations of God's continued help. ([Psa
56:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#001))

would swallow--literally, "pants as a raging beast" ([Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)).

[Psalms 56:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 56:2</span></span>

enemies--watchers ([Psa 54:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa054.htm#005)).

most High--As it is not elsewhere used absolutely for God, some render
the word here, arrogantly, or proudly, as qualifying "those who fight,"
&c.

[Psalms 56:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 56:3</span></span>

in--or literally, "unto."

thee--to whom he turns in trouble.

[Psalms 56:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">psa 56:4</span></span>

in God . . . his word--By His grace or aid ([Psa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#012); [Psa
108:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#013)), or, "I will boast in God as
to His word"; in either case His word is the special matter and cause of
praise.

flesh--for mankind ([Psa 65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002); [Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003)), intimating frailty.

[Psalms 56:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 56:5</span></span>

A vivid picture of the conduct of malicious enemies.

[Psalms 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">psa 56:7</span></span>

Shall they escape? &c.--or better, "Their escape is by iniquity."

cast . . . people--humble those who so proudly oppose Thy servant.

[Psalms 56:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 56:8</span></span>

God is mindful of his exile and remembers his tears. The custom of
bottling the tears of mourners as a memorial, which has existed in some
Eastern nations, may explain the figure.

[Psalms 56:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 56:9</span></span>

God is for me--or, "on my side" ([Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006); [Psa
124:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa124.htm#001)); hence he is sure of the
repulse of his foes.

[Psalms 56:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 56:12</span></span>

I will render praises--will pay what I have vowed.

[Psalms 56:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">psa 56:13</span></span>

The question implies an affirmative answer, drawn from past experience.

falling--as from a precipice.

before God--in His favor during life.
