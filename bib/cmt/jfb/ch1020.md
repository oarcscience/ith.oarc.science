[1 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001.md)

RABBAH BESIEGED BY JOAB, SPOILED BY DAVID, AND THE PEOPLE TORTURED.
([Ch1 20:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001).md)

at the time when kings go out to battle--in spring, the usual season in
ancient times for entering on a campaign; that is, a year subsequent to
the Syrian war.

Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country . . . of
Ammon--The former campaign had been disastrous, owing chiefly to the
hired auxiliaries of the Ammonites; and as it was necessary, as well as
just, that they should be severely chastised for their wanton outrage on
the Hebrew ambassadors, Joab ravaged their country and invested their
capital, Rabbah. After a protracted siege, Joab took one part of it, the
lower town or "city of waters," insulated by the winding course of the
Jabbok. Knowing that the fort called "the royal city" would soon fall,
he invited the king to come in person, and have the honor of storming
it. The knowledge of this fact (mentioned in [Sa2
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026).md) enables us to reconcile the two
statements--"David tarried at Jerusalem" ([Ch1
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#001).md), and "David and all the people
returned to Jerusalem" ([Ch1 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#003).md).

[1 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch1 20:2</span></span>

David took the crown of their king . . ., and found it to weigh a talent
of gold--equal to one hundred twenty-five pounds. Some think that
Malcom, rendered in our version "their king," should be taken as a
proper name, Milcom or Molech, the Ammonite idol, which, of course,
might bear a heavy weight. But, like many other state crowns of Eastern
kings, the crown got at Rabbah was not worn on the head, but suspended
by chains of gold above the throne.

precious stones--Hebrew, a "stone," or cluster of precious stones, which
was set on David's head.

cut them with saws, &c.--The Hebrew word, "cut them," is, with the
difference of the final letter, the same as that rendered "put them," in
the parallel passage of Samuel \[[Sa2
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md)\]; and many consider that
putting them to saws, axes, and so forth, means nothing more than that
David condemned the inhabitants of Rabbah to hard and penal servitude.
