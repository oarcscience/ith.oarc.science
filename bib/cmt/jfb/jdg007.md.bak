### [Judges Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

[Judges 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 7:1</span></span>

GIDEON'S ARMY. ([Jdg 7:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#001).md)

Jerubbaal--This had now become Gideon's honorable surname, "the enemy of
Baal."

well--rather "spring of Harod," that is, "fear, trembling"; probably the
same as the fountain in Jezreel ([Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md). It was situated not far from
Gilboa, on the confines of Manasseh, and the name "Harod" was bestowed
on it with evident reference to the panic which seized the majority of
Gideon's troops. The host of the Midianites were on the northern side of
the valley, seemingly deeper down in the descent towards the Jordan,
near a little eminence.

[Judges 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 7:2</span></span>

the Lord said unto Gideon, The people . . . are too many--Although the
Israelitish army mustered only thirty-two thousand (or one-sixth of the
Midianitish host), the number was too great, for it was the Lord's
purpose to teach Israel a memorable lesson of dependence on Him.

[Judges 7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 7:3</span></span>

Now therefore . . ., proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
Whosoever is fearful . . . let him return--This proclamation was in
terms of an established law ([Deu
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#008).md).

[Judges 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jdg 7:4</span></span>

too many--Two reductions were ordered, the last by the application of a
test which was made known to Gideon alone.

[Judges 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 7:5</span></span>

bring them down unto the water--When the wandering people in Asia, on a
journey or in haste, come to water, they do not stoop down with
deliberation on their knees, but only bend forward as much as is
necessary to bring their hand in contact with the stream, and throw it
up with rapidity, and at the same time such address, that they do not
drop a particle. The Israelites, it seems, were acquainted with the
practice; and those who adopted it on this occasion were selected as fit
for a work that required expedition. The rest were dismissed according
to the divine direction.

[Judges 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 7:7</span></span>

the Lord said, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you--It
is scarcely possible to conceive a more severe trial than the command to
attack the overwhelming forces of the enemy with such a handful of
followers. But Gideon's faith in the divine assurance of victory was
steadfast, and it is for this he is so highly commended ([Heb
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032).md).

[Judges 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 7:8</span></span>

the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley--Attention to the
relative position of the parties is of the greatest importance to an
understanding of what follows.

[Judges 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jdg 7:9</span></span>

HE IS ENCOURAGED BY THE DREAM AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BARLEY CAKE.
([Jdg 7:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#009).md)

Arise, get thee down unto the host . . . But if thou fear to go down, go
thou with Phurah thy servant--In ancient times it was reckoned no
degradation for persons of the highest rank and character to act as
spies on an enemy's camp; and so Gideon did on this occasion. But the
secret errand was directed by God, who intended that he should hear
something which might animate his own valor and that of his troops.

[Judges 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jdg 7:11</span></span>

the outside of the armed men that were in the host--"Armed," means
embodied under the five officers established by the ordinary laws and
usages of encampments. The camp seems to have been unprotected by any
rampart, since Gideon had no difficulty in reaching and overhearing a
conversation, so important to him.

[Judges 7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jdg 7:12</span></span>

the Midianites and the Amalekites . . . lay along in the valley like
grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number--a most
graphic description of an Arab encampment. They lay wrapt in sleep, or
resting from their day's plunder, while their innumerable camels were
stretched round about them.

[Judges 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jdg 7:13</span></span>

I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host
of Midian--This was a characteristic and very expressive dream for an
Arab in the circumstances. The rolling down the hill, striking against
the tents, and overturning them, naturally enough connected it in his
mind with the position and meditated attack of the Israelitish leader.
The circumstance of the cake, too, was very significant. Barley was
usually the food of the poor, and of beasts; but most probably, from the
widespread destruction of the crops by the invaders, multitudes must
have been reduced to poor and scanty fare.

[Judges 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jdg 7:15</span></span>

when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation . . .
he worshipped--The incident originated in the secret overruling
providence of God, and Gideon, from his expression of pious gratitude,
regarded it as such. On his mind, as well as that of his followers, it
produced the intended effect--that of imparting new animation and
impulse to their patriotism.

[Judges 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 7:16</span></span>

HIS STRATAGEM AGAINST MIDIAN. ([Jdg
7:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#016).md)

he divided the three hundred men into three companies--The object of
dividing his forces was, that they might seem to be surrounding the
enemy. The pitchers were empty to conceal the torches, and made of
earthenware, so as to be easily broken; and the sudden blaze of the
held-up lights--the loud echo of the trumpets, and the shouts of Israel,
always terrifying ([Num 23:21](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#021).md), and
now more terrible than ever by the use of such striking words, broke
through the stillness of the midnight air. The sleepers started from
their rest; not a blow was dealt by the Israelites; but the enemy ran
tumultuously, uttering the wild, discordant cries peculiar to the Arab
race. They fought indiscriminately, not knowing friend from foe. The
panic being universal, they soon precipitately fled, directing their
flight down to the Jordan, by the foot of the mountains of Ephraim, to
places known as the "house of the acacia" \[Beth-shittah\], and "the
meadow of the dance" \[Abel-meholah\].

[Judges 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">jdg 7:23</span></span>

the men of Israel gathered themselves together--These were evidently the
parties dismissed, who having lingered at a little distance from the
scene of contest, now eagerly joined in the pursuit southwestward
through the valley.

[Judges 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 7:24</span></span>

Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim--The Ephraimites lay
on the south and could render seasonable aid.

Come . . . take before them the waters unto Beth-barah--(See on [Jdg
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#028).md). These were the northern fords
of the Jordan, to the east-northeast of wady Maleh.

the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together . . . unto Beth-barah--A
new conflict ensued, in which two secondary chiefs were seized and slain
on the spots where they were respectively taken. The spots were named
after these chiefs, Oreb, "the Raven," and Zeeb, "the Wolf"--appropriate
designations of Arab leaders.
