### [Jeremiah Chapter 40](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 40:1</span></span>

JEREMIAH IS SET FREE AT RAMAH, AND GOES TO GEDALIAH, TO WHOM THE REMNANT
OF JEWS REPAIR. JOHANAN WARNS GEDALIAH OF ISHMAEL'S CONSPIRACY IN VAIN.
(Jer. 40:1-16)

word that came--the heading of a new part of the book (the forty-first
through forty-fourth chapters), namely, the prophecies to the Jews in
Judea and Egypt after the taking of the city, blended with history. The
prophecy does not begin till [Jer
42:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#007), and the previous history is
introductory to it.

bound in chains--Though released from the court of the prison (see on
[Jer 39:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#014)), in the confusion at the
burning of the city he seems to have been led away in chains with the
other captives, and not till he reached Ramah to have gained full
liberty. Nebuzara-dan had his quarters at Ramah, in Benjamin; and there
he collected the captives previous to their removal to Babylon ([Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015)). He in releasing Jeremiah
obeyed the king's commands ([Jer
39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011)). Jeremiah's "chains" for a time
were due to the negligence of those to whom he had been committed; or
else to Nebuzara-dan's wish to upbraid the people with their perverse
ingratitude in imprisoning Jeremiah \[CALVIN\]; hence he addresses the
people (ye . . . you) as much as Jeremiah ([Jer
40:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002)).

[Jeremiah 40:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 40:2</span></span>

The Babylonians were in some measure aware, through Jeremiah's
prophecies ([Jer 39:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011)), that they
were the instruments of God's wrath on His people.

[Jeremiah 40:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 40:3</span></span>

ye--(See on [Jer 40:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#001)). His address is
directed to the Jews as well as to Jeremiah. God makes the very heathen
testify for Him against them ([Deu
29:24-25](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#024)).

[Jeremiah 40:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 40:4</span></span>

look well unto thee--the very words of Nebuchadnezzar's charge ([Jer
39:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#012)).

all the land is before thee . . . seemeth good-- ([Gen
20:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#015), Margin). Jeremiah alone had the
option given him of staying where he pleased, when all the rest were
either carried off or forced to remain there.

[Jeremiah 40:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 40:5</span></span>

while he was not yet gone back--parenthetical. When Jeremiah hesitated
whether it would be best for him to go, Nebuzara-dan proceeded to say,
"Go, then, to Gedaliah," (not as English Version, "Go back, also"), if
thou preferrest (as Nebuzara-dan inferred from Jeremiah's hesitancy) to
stop here rather than go with me.

victuals-- ([Isa 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#016)).

reward--rather, "a present." This must have been a seasonable relief to
the prophet, who probably lost his all in the siege.

[Jeremiah 40:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 40:6</span></span>

Mizpah--in Benjamin, northwest of Jerusalem ([Jer
41:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#005), [Jer
41:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#009)). Not the Mizpah in Gilead,
beyond Jordan ([Jdg 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg010.htm#017)). Jeremiah
showed his patriotism and piety in remaining in his country amidst
afflictions and notwithstanding the ingratitude of the Jews, rather than
go to enjoy honors and pleasures in a heathen court ([Heb
11:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#024)). This vindicates his purity
of motive in his withdrawal ([Jer
37:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 40:7</span></span>

captains . . . in the fields--The leaders of the Jewish army had been
"scattered" throughout the country on the capture of Zedekiah ([Jer
52:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#008)), in order to escape the notice
of the Chaldeans.

[Jeremiah 40:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 40:8</span></span>

Netophathite--from Netophah, a town in Judah ([Sa2
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#028)).

Maachathite--from Maachathi, at the foot of Mount Hermon ([Deu
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014)).

[Jeremiah 40:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 40:9</span></span>

Fear not--They were afraid that they should not obtain pardon from the
Chaldeans for their acts. He therefore assured them of safety by an
oath.

serve--literally, "to stand before" ([Jer
40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010); [Jer
52:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#012)), that is, to be at hand ready
to execute the commands of the king of Babylon.

[Jeremiah 40:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 40:10</span></span>

Mizpah--lying on the way between Babylon and Judah, and so convenient
for transacting business between the two countries.

As for me . . . but ye--He artfully, in order to conciliate them,
represents the burden of the service to the Chaldeans as falling on him,
while they may freely gather their wine, fruits, and oil. He does not
now add that these very fruits were to constitute the chief part of the
tribute to be paid to Babylon: which, though fruitful in corn, was less
productive of grapes, figs, and olives \[HERODOTUS, 1.193\]. The grant
of "vineyards" to the "poor" ([Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010)) would give hope to the
discontended of enjoying the best fruits ([Jer
40:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#012)).

[Jeremiah 40:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 40:11</span></span>

Jews . . . in Moab--who had fled thither at the approach of the
Chaldeans. God thus tempered the severity of His vengeance that a
remnant might be left.

[Jeremiah 40:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 40:13</span></span>

in the fields--not in the city, but scattered in the country ([Jer
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 40:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 40:14</span></span>

Baalis--named from the idol Baal, as was often the case in heathen
names.

Ammonites--So it was to them that Ishmael went after murdering Gedaliah
([Jer 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#010)).

slay--literally, "strike thee in the soul," that is, a deadly stroke.

Ishmael--Being of the royal seed of David ([Jer
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#001)), he envied Gedaliah the
presidency to which he thought himself entitled; therefore he leagued
himself with the ancient heathen enemy of Judah.

believed . . . not--generous, but unwise unsuspiciousness ([Ecc
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 40:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jer 40:16</span></span>

thou speakest falsely--a mystery of providence that God should permit
the righteous, in spite of warning, thus to rush into the trap laid for
them! [Isa 57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001) suggests a solution.
