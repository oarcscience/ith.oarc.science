### [Ephesians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)

[Ephesians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">eph 6:1</span></span>

MUTUAL DUTIES OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN: MASTERS AND SERVANTS: OUR LIFE A
WARFARE: THE SPIRITUAL ARMOUR NEEDED AGAINST SPIRITUAL FOES. CONCLUSION.
(Eph. 6:1-24)

obey--stronger than the expression as to wives, "submitting," or "being
subject" ([Eph 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#021)). Obedience is
more unreasoning and implicit; submission is the willing subjection of
an inferior in point of order to one who has a right to command.

in the Lord--Both parents and children being Christians "in the Lord,"
expresses the element in which the obedience is to take place, and the
motive to obedience. In [Col 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#020), it
is, "Children, obey your parents in all things." This clause, "in the
Lord," would suggest the due limitation of the obedience required ([Act
5:29](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#029); compare on the other hand, the
abuse, [Mar 7:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011)).

right--Even by natural law we should render obedience to them from whom
we have derived life.

[Ephesians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eph 6:2</span></span>

Here the authority of revealed law is added to that of natural law.

which is . . . promise--The "promise" is not made the main motive to
obedience, but an incidental one. The main motive is, because it is
God's will ([Deu 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#016), "Honor thy
father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath COMMANDED thee"); and that
it is so peculiarly, is shown by His accompanying it "with a promise."

first--in the decalogue with a special promise. The promise in the
second commandment is a general one. Their duty is more expressly
prescribed to children than to parents; for love descends rather than
ascends \[BENGEL\]. This verse proves the law in the Old Testament is
not abolished.

[Ephesians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eph 6:3</span></span>

long on the earth--In [Exo 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012),
"long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee," which Paul
adapts to Gospel times, by taking away the local and limited reference
peculiar to the Jews in Canaan. The godly are equally blessed in every
land, as the Jews were in the land which God gave them. This promise is
always fulfilled, either literally, or by the substitution of a higher
blessing, namely, one spiritual and eternal ([Job
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#026); [Pro
10:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#027)). The substance and essence of
the law are eternally in force: its accidents alone (applying to Israel
of old) are abolished ([Rom 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#015)).

[Ephesians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eph 6:4</span></span>

fathers--including mothers; the fathers are specified as being the
fountains of domestic authority. Fathers are more prone to passion in
relation to their children than mothers, whose fault is rather
over-indulgence.

provoke not--irritate not, by vexatious commands, unreasonable blame,
and uncertain temper \[ALFORD\]. [Col
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#021), "lest they be discouraged."

nurture--Greek, "discipline," namely, training by chastening in act
where needed ([Job 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#017); [Heb
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#007)).

admonition--training by words ([Deu
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007); "catechise," [Pro
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#006), Margin), whether of
encouragement, or remonstrance, or reproof, according as is required
\[TRENCH\]. Contrast [Sa1 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#013),
Margin.

of the Lord--such as the Lord approves, and by His Spirit dictates.

[Ephesians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eph 6:5</span></span>

Servants--literally, "slaves."

masters according to the flesh--in contrast to your true and heavenly
Master ([Eph 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#004)). A consolatory him
that the mastership to which they were subject, was but for a time
\[CHRYSOSTOM\]; and that their real liberty was still their own ([Co1
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022)).

fear and trembling--not slavish terror, but (See on [Co1
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#003); [Co2
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015)) an anxious eagerness to do your
duty, and a fear of displeasing, as great as is produced in the ordinary
slave by "threatenings" ([Eph 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)).

singleness--without double-mindedness, or "eye service" ([Eph
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006)), which seeks to please outwardly,
without the sincere desire to make the master's interest at all times
the first consideration ([Ch1 29:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1029.htm#017);
[Mat 6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#022); [Luk
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#034)). "Simplicity."

[Ephesians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eph 6:6</span></span>

([Col 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022)). Seeking to please their
masters only so long as these have their eyes on them: as Gehazi was a
very different man in his master's presence from what he was in his
absence (2Ki. 5:1-18).

men-pleasers--not Christ-pleasers (compare [Gal
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010); [Th1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#004)).

doing the will of God--the unseen but ever present Master: the best
guarantee for your serving faithfully your earthly master alike when
present and when absent.

from the heart--literally, soul ([Psa
111:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#001); [Rom
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005)).

[Ephesians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eph 6:7</span></span>

good will--expressing his feeling towards his master; as "doing the will
of God from the heart" expresses the source of that feeling ([Col
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#023)). "Good will" is stated by
XENOPHON \[Economics\] to be the principal virtue of a slave towards his
master: a real regard to his master's interest as if his own, a good
will which not even a master's severity can extinguish.

[Ephesians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eph 6:8</span></span>

any man doeth--Greek, "any man shall have done," that is, shall be found
at the Lord's coming to have done.

the same--in full payment, in heaven's currency.

shall . . . receive-- ([Co2 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010); [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025); but all of grace, [Luk
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010)).

bond or free-- ([Co1 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#022); [Co1
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#013); [Gal
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028); [Col
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#011)). Christ does not regard such
distinctions in His present dealings of grace, or in His future
judgment. The slave that has acted faithfully for the Lord's sake to his
master, though the latter may not repay his faithfulness, shall have the
Lord for his Paymaster. So the freeman who has done good for the Lord's
sake, though man may not pay him, has the Lord for his Debtor ([Pro
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)).

[Ephesians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eph 6:9</span></span>

the same things--Mutatis mutandis. Show the same regard to God's will,
and to your servants' well-being, in your relation to them, as they
ought to have in their relation to you. Love regulates the duties both
of servants and masters, as one and the same light attempers various
colors. Equality of nature and faith is superior to distinctions of rank
\[BENGEL\]. Christianity makes all men brothers: compare [Lev
25:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#042); [Deu
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#012); [Jer
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#014) as to how the Hebrews were bound
to treat their brethren in service; much more ought Christians to act
with love.

threatening--Greek, "the threatening" which masters commonly use.
"Masters" in the Greek, is not so strong a term as "despots": it implies
authority, but not absolute domination.

your Master also--The oldest manuscripts read, "the Master both of them
and you": "their Master and yours." This more forcibly brings out the
equality of slaves and masters in the sight of God. SENECA \[Thyestes,
607\], says, "Whatever an inferior dreads from you, this a superior
Master threatens yourselves with: every authority here is under a higher
above." As you treat your servants, so will He treat you.

neither . . . respect of persons--He will not, in judging, acquit thee
because thou art a master, or condemn him because he is a servant ([Act
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034); [Rom
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011); [Gal
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006); [Col
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#025); [Pe1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017)). Derived from [Deu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#017); [Ch2
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#007).

[Ephesians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eph 6:10</span></span>

my brethren--Some of the oldest manuscripts omit these words. Some with
Vulgate retain them. The phrase occurs nowhere else in the Epistle (see,
however, [Eph 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023)); if genuine, it is
appropriate here in the close of the Epistle, where he is urging his
fellow soldiers to the good fight in the Christian armor. Most of the
oldest manuscripts for "finally," read, "henceforward," or "from
henceforth" ([Gal 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)).

be strong--Greek, "be strengthened."

in the power of his might--Christ's might: as in [Eph
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019), it is the Father's might.

[Ephesians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eph 6:11</span></span>

the whole armour--the armor of light ([Rom
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012)); on the right hand and left
([Co2 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#007)). The panoply offensive and
defensive. An image readily suggested by the Roman armory, Paul being
now in Rome. Repeated emphatically, [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013). In [Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014) it is, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ"; in putting on Him, and the new man in Him, we put on "the whole
armor of God." No opening at the head, the feet, the heart, the belly,
the eye, the ear, or the tongue, is to be given to Satan. Believers have
once for all overcome him; but on the ground of this fundamental victory
gained over him, they are ever again to fight against and overcome him,
even as they who once die with Christ have continually to mortify their
members upon earth ([Rom 6:2-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002); [Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003), [Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005)).

of God--furnished by God; not our own, else it would not stand ([Psa
35:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#001)). Spiritual, therefore, and
mighty through God, not carnal ([Co2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#004)).

wiles--literally, "schemes sought out" for deceiving (compare [Co2
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014)).

the devil--the ruling chief of the foes ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)) organized into a kingdom of
darkness ([Mat 12:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026)), opposed to the
kingdom of light.

[Ephesians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eph 6:12</span></span>

Greek, "For our wrestling ('the wrestling' in which we are engaged) is
not against flesh," &c. Flesh and blood foes are Satan's mere tools, the
real foe lurking behind them is Satan himself, with whom our conflict
is. "Wrestling" implies that it is a hand-to-hand and foot-to-foot
struggle for the mastery: to wrestle successfully with Satan, we must
wrestle with GOD in irresistible prayer like Jacob ([Gen
32:24-29](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024); [Hos
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#004)). Translate, "The principalities
. . . the powers" ([Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021); [Col
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016); see on [Eph
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)). The same grades of powers are
specified in the case of the demons here, as in that of angels there
(compare [Rom 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038); [Co1
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024); [Col
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#015)). The Ephesians had practiced
sorcery ([Act 19:19](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019)), so that he
appropriately treats of evil spirits in addressing them. The more
clearly any book of Scripture, as this, treats of the economy of the
kingdom of light, the more clearly does it set forth the kingdom of
darkness. Hence, nowhere does the satanic kingdom come more clearly into
view than in the Gospels which treat of Christ, the true Light.

rulers of the darkness of this world--Greek, "age" or "course of the
world." But the oldest manuscripts omit "of world." Translate, "Against
the world rulers of this (present) darkness" ([Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002); [Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008); [Luk
22:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053); [Col
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013)). On Satan and his demons being
"world rulers," compare [Joh 12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031);
[Joh 14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030); [Joh
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011); [Luk
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#006); [Co2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004); [Jo1
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019), Greek, "lieth in the wicked
one." Though they be "world rulers," they are not the ruler of the
universe; and their usurped rule of the world is soon to cease, when He
shall "come whose right it is" ([Eze
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027)). Two cases prove Satan not to
be a mere subjective fancy: (1) Christ's temptation; (2) the entrance of
demons into the swine (for these are incapable of such fancies). Satan
tries to parody, or imitate in a perverted way, God's working ([Co2
11:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#013)). So when God became
incarnate, Satan, by his demons, took forcible possession of human
bodies. Thus the demoniacally possessed were not peculiarly wicked, but
miserable, and so fit subjects for Jesus' pity. Paul makes no mention of
demoniacal possession, so that in the time he wrote, it seems to have
ceased; it probably was restricted to the period of the Lord's
incarnation, and of the foundation of His Church.

spiritual wickedness--rather as Greek, "The spiritual hosts of
wickedness." As three of the clauses describe the power, so this fourth,
the wickedness of our spiritual foes ([Mat
12:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#045)).

in high places--Greek, "heavenly places": in [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002), "the air," see on [Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002). The alteration of expression to
"in heavenly places," is in order to mark the higher range of their
powers than ours, they having been, up to the ascension ([Rev
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#005), [Rev
12:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009)), dwellers "in the heavenly
places" ([Job 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#007)), and being now in
the regions of the air which are called the heavens. Moreover, pride and
presumption are the sins in heavenly places to which they tempt
especially, being those by which they themselves fell from heavenly
places ([Isa 14:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012)). But believers
have naught to fear, being "blessed with all spiritual blessings in the
heavenly places" ([Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)).

[Ephesians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eph 6:13</span></span>

take . . . of God--not "make," God has done that: you have only to "take
up" and put it on. The Ephesians were familiar with the idea of the gods
giving armor to mythical heroes: thus Paul's allusion would be
appropriate.

the evil day--the day of Satan's special assaults ([Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012), [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016)) in life and at the dying hour
(compare [Rev 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#010)). We must have our
armor always on, to be ready against the evil day which may come at any
moment, the war being perpetual ([Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001), Margin).

done all--rather, "accomplished all things," namely, necessary to the
fight, and becoming a good soldier.

[Ephesians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eph 6:14</span></span>

Stand--The repetition in [Eph 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011),
[Eph 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014), shows that standing, that
is, maintaining our ground, not yielding or fleeing, is the grand aim of
the Christian soldier. Translate as Greek, "Having girt about your loins
with truth," that is, with truthfulness, sincerity, a good conscience
([Co2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012); [Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018); [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009)). Truth is the band that girds up
and keeps together the flowing robes, so as that the Christian soldier
may be unencumbered for action. So the Passover was eaten with the loins
girt, and the shoes on the feet ([Exo
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#011); compare [Isa
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027); [Luk
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035)). Faithfulness (Septuagint,
"truth") is the girdle of Messiah ([Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)) : so truth of His followers.

having on--Greek, "having put on."

breastplate of righteousness-- ([Isa
59:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017)), similarly of Messiah.
"Righteousness" is here joined with "truth," as in [Eph
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#009) : righteousness in works, truth in
words \[ESTIUS\] ([Jo1 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#007)). Christ's
righteousness inwrought in us by the Spirit. "Faith and love," that is,
faith working righteousness by love, are "the breastplate" in [Th1
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008).

[Ephesians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eph 6:15</span></span>

Translate, "Having shod your feet" (referring to the sandals, or to the
military shoes then used).

the preparation--rather, "the preparedness," or "readiness of," that is,
arising from the "Gospel" ([Psa
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017)). Preparedness to do and suffer
all that God wills; readiness for march, as a Christian soldier.

gospel of peace--(compare [Luk 1:79](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#079);
[Rom 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015)). The "peace" within forms
a beautiful contrast to the raging of the outward conflict ([Isa
26:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003); [Phi
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)).

[Ephesians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eph 6:16</span></span>

Above all--rather, "Over all"; so as to cover all that has been put on
before. Three integuments are specified, the breastplate, girdle, and
shoes; two defenses, the helmet and shield; and two offensive weapons,
the sword and the spear (prayer). ALFORD translates, "Besides all," as
the Greek is translated, [Luk 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#020).
But if it meant this, it would have come last in the list (compare [Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)).

shield--the large oblong oval door-like shield of the Romans, four feet
long by two and a half feet broad; not the small round buckler.

ye shall be able--not merely, "ye may." The shield of faith will
certainly intercept, and so "quench, all the fiery darts" (an image from
the ancient fire-darts, formed of cane, with tow and combustibles
ignited on the head of the shaft, so as to set fire to woodwork, tents,
&c.).

of the wicked--rather "of the EVIL ONE." Faith conquers him ([Pe1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009)), and his darts of temptation to
wrath, lust, revenge, despair, &c. It overcomes the world ([Jo1
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)), and so the prince of the world
([Jo1 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#018)).

[Ephesians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eph 6:17</span></span>

take--a different Greek word from that in [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013), [Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016); translate, therefore, "receive,"
"accept," namely, the helmet offered by the Lord, namely, "salvation"
appropriated, as [Th1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#008), "Helmet,
the hope of salvation"; not an uncertain hope, but one that brings with
it no shame of disappointment ([Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)). It is subjoined to the shield of
faith, as being its inseparable accompaniment (compare [Rom
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001), [Rom
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005)). The head of the soldier was
among the principal parts to be defended, as on it the deadliest strokes
might fall, and it is the head that commands the whole body. The head is
the seat of the mind, which, when it has laid hold of the sure Gospel
"hope" of eternal life, will not receive false doctrine, or give way to
Satan's temptations to despair. God, by this hope, "lifts up the head"
([Psa 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa003.htm#003); [Luk
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028)).

sword of the Spirit--that is, furnished by the Spirit, who inspired the
writers of the word of God ([Pe2
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)). Again the Trinity is implied:
the Spirit here; and Christ in "salvation" and God the Father, [Eph
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013) (compare [Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012); [Rev
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#016); [Rev
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#012)). The two-edged sword, cutting
both ways ([Psa 45:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#003), [Psa
45:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#005)), striking some with conviction
and conversion, and others with condemnation ([Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015)), is in the mouth of Christ
([Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002)), in the hand of His saints
([Psa 149:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa149.htm#006)). Christ's use of this
sword in the temptation is our pattern as to how we are to wield it
against Satan ([Mat 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004), [Mat
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007), [Mat
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010)). There is no armor specified for
the back, but only for the front of the body; implying that we must
never turn our back to the foe ([Luk
9:62](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#062)); our only safety is in resisting
ceaselessly ([Mat 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011); [Jam
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007)).

[Ephesians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">eph 6:18</span></span>

always--Greek, "in every season"; implying opportunity and exigency
([Col 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#002)). Paul uses the very words
of Jesus in [Luk 21:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036) (a Gospel which
he quotes elsewhere, in undesigned consonance with the fact of Luke
being his associate in travel, [Co1
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023), &c.; [Ti1
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018)). Compare [Luk
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001); [Rom
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#012); [Th1
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017).

with all--that is, every kind of.

prayer--a sacred term for prayer in general.

supplication--a common term for a special kind of prayer \[HARLESS\], an
imploring request. "Prayer" for obtaining blessings, "supplication" for
averting evils which we fear \[GROTIUS\].

in the Spirit--to be joined with "praying." It is he in us, as the
Spirit of adoption, who prays, and enables us to pray ([Rom
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015), [Rom
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026); [Gal
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006); [Jde
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#020)).

watching--not sleeping ([Eph 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#014);
[Psa 88:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#013); [Mat
26:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041)). So in the temple a perpetual
watch was maintained (compare Anna, [Luk
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037)).

thereunto--"watching unto" (with a view to) prayer and supplication.

with--Greek, "in." Persevering constancy ("perseverance") and (that is,
exhibited in) supplication are to be the element in which our
watchfulness is to be exercised.

for all saints--as none is so perfect as not to need the intercessions
of his fellow Christians.

[Ephesians 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eph 6:19</span></span>

for me--a different Greek preposition from that in [Eph
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018); translate, therefore, "on my
behalf."

that I may open my mouth boldly--rather, "that there may be given to me
'utterance,' or 'speech' in the opening of my mouth (when I undertake to
speak; a formula used in set and solemn speech, [Job
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#001); [Dan
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#016)), so as with boldness to make
known," &c. Bold plainness of speech was the more needed, as the Gospel
is a "mystery" undiscoverable by mere reason, and only known by
revelation. Paul looked for utterance to be given him; he did not depend
on his natural or acquired power. The shortest road to any heart is by
way of heaven; pray to God to open the door and to open your mouth, so
as to avail yourself of every opening ([Jer
1:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#007); [Eze
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008), [Eze
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#011); [Co2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)).

[Ephesians 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eph 6:20</span></span>

For--Greek, as in [Eph 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019), "On
behalf of which."

an ambassador in bonds--a paradox. Ambassadors were held inviolable by
the law of nations, and could not, without outrage to every sacred
right, be put in chains. Yet Christ's "ambassador is in a chain!" The
Greek is singular. The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a
single chain, in a kind of free custody. So [Act
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#016), [Act
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020), "I am bound with this chain."
The term, "bonds" (plural), on the other hand, is used when the
prisoner's hands or feet were bound together ([Act
26:29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029)); compare [Act
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006), where the plural marks the
distinction. The singular is only used of the particular kind of custody
described above; an undesigned coincidence \[PALEY\].

[Ephesians 6:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eph 6:21</span></span>

that ye also--as I have been discussing things relating to you, so that
ye also may know about me (compare [Col
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007)). NEANDER takes it, "Ye also,"
as well as the Colossians ([Col 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006)).

my affairs--Greek, "the things concerning me."

how I do--how I fare.

Tychicus--an Asiatic, and so a fit messenger bearing the respective
Epistles to Ephesus and Colosse ([Act
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004); [Ti2
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#012)).

a beloved brother--Greek, "the beloved brother"; the same epithet as in
[Col 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#007).

minister--that is, servant.

in the Lord--in the Lord's work.

[Ephesians 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eph 6:22</span></span>

for the same purpose--Greek, "for this very purpose." [Col
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#008) is almost word for word the same
as this verse.

our affairs--Greek, "the things concerning us," namely, concerning
myself. "Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, and Marcus, sister's son to
Barnabas" ([Col 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010)).

[Ephesians 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eph 6:23</span></span>

love with faith--Faith is presupposed as theirs; he prays that love may
accompany it ([Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006)).

[Ephesians 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eph 6:24</span></span>

Contrast the malediction on all who love Him not ([Co1
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)).

in sincerity--Greek, "in incorruption," that is, not as English Version,
but "with an immortal (constant) love" \[WAHL\]. Compare "that which is
not corruptible" ([Pe1 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#004)). Not a
fleeting, earthly love, but a spiritual and eternal one \[ALFORD\].
Contrast [Col 2:22](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#022), worldly things
"which perish with the using." Compare [Co1
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025), "corruptible . . . incorruptible
crown." "Purely," "holily" \[ESTIUS\], without the corruption of sin
(See on [Co1 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017); [Pe2
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#004); [Jde
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010)). Where the Lord Jesus has a true
believer, there I have a brother \[BISHOP M'IKWAINE\]. He who is good
enough for Christ, is good enough for me \[R. HALL\]. The differences of
opinion among real Christians are comparatively small, and show that
they are not following one another like silly sheep, each trusting the
one before him. Their agreement in the main, while showing their
independence as witnesses by differing in non-essentials, can only be
accounted for by their being all in the right direction ([Act
15:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#008); [Co1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002); [Co1
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#003)).
