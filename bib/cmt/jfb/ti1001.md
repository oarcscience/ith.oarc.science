### [1 Timothy Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

[1 Timothy 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ti1 1:1</span></span>

ADDRESS: PAUL'S DESIGN IN HAVING LEFT TIMOTHY AT EPHESUS, NAMELY, TO
CHECK FALSE TEACHERS; TRUE USE OF THE LAW; HARMONIZING WITH THE GOSPEL;
GOD'S GRACE IN CALLING PAUL, ONCE A BLASPHEMER, TO EXPERIENCE AND TO
PREACH IT; CHARGES TO TIMOTHY. (1Ti. 1:1-20)

by the commandment of God--the authoritative injunction, as well as the
commission, of God. In the earlier Epistles the phrase is, "by the will
of God." Here it is expressed in a manner implying that a necessity was
laid on him to act as an apostle, not that it was merely at his option.
The same expression occurs in the doxology, probably written long after
the Epistle itself \[ALFORD\] ([Rom
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026).md).

God our Saviour--The Father ([Ti1 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#003.md);
[Ti1 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md); [Luk
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#047.md); [Ti2
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#009.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md); [Tit
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#010.md); [Tit
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md); [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025).md). It was a Jewish expression in
devotion, drawn from the Old Testament (compare [Psa
106:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#021).md).

our hope-- ([Col 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#027.md); [Tit
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013).md).

[1 Timothy 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ti1 1:2</span></span>

my own son--literally, "a genuine son" (compare [Act
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md); [Co1
4:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014).md). See Introduction.

mercy--added here, in addressing Timothy, to the ordinary salutation,
"Grace unto you ([Rom 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md); [Co1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003), &c..md), and peace." In [Gal
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md), "peace and mercy" occur. There
are many similarities of style between the Epistle to the Galatians and
the Pastoral Epistles (see Introduction); perhaps owing to his there, as
here, having, as a leading object in writing, the correction of false
teachers, especially as to the right and wrong use of the law ([Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md). If the earlier date be assigned
to First Timothy, it will fall not long after, or before (according as
the Epistle to the Galatians was written at Ephesus or at Corinth) the
writing of the Epistle to the Galatians, which also would account for
some similarity of style. "Mercy" is grace of a more tender kind,
exercised towards the miserable, the experience of which in one's own
case especially fits for the Gospel MINISTRY. Compare as to Paul himself
([Ti1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md), [Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md); [Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md); [Co2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md); [Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017).md) \[BENGEL\]. He did not use
"mercy" as to the churches, because "mercy" in all its fulness already
existed towards them; but in the case of an individual minister, fresh
measures of it were continually needed. "Grace" has reference to the
sins of men; "mercy" to their misery. God extends His grace to men as
they are guilty; His "mercy" to them as they are miserable \[TRENCH\].

Jesus Christ--The oldest manuscripts read the order, "Christ Jesus." In
the Pastoral Epistles "Christ" is often put before "Jesus," to give
prominence to the fact that the Messianic promises of the Old Testament,
well known to Timothy ([Ti2 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#015).md),
were fulfilled in Jesus.

[1 Timothy 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ti1 1:3</span></span>

Timothy's superintendence of the Church at Ephesus was as locum tenens
for the apostle, and so was temporary. Thus, the office of
superintending overseer, needed for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in the
absence of the presiding apostle, subsequently became a permanent
institution on the removal, by death, of the apostles who heretofore
superintended the churches. The first title of these overseers seems to
have been "angels" ([Rev 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#020).md).

As I besought thee to abide still--He meant to have added, "so I still
beseech thee," but does not complete the sentence until he does so
virtually, not formally, at [Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md).

at Ephesus--Paul, in [Act 20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025.md),
declared to the Ephesian elders, "I know that ye all shall see my face
no more." If, then, as the balance of arguments seems to favor (see
Introduction), this Epistle was written subsequently to Paul's first
imprisonment, the apparent discrepancy between his prophecy and the
event may be reconciled by considering that the terms of the former were
not that he should never visit Ephesus again (which this verse implies
he did), but that they all should "see his face no more." I cannot think
with BIRKS, that this verse is compatible with his theory, that Paul did
not actually visit Ephesus, though in its immediate neighborhood
(compare [Ti1 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014.md); [Ti1
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013).md). The corresponding conjunction
to "as" is not given, the sentence not being completed till it is
virtually so at [Ti1 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md).

I besought--a mild word, instead of authoritative command, to Timothy,
as a fellow helper.

some--The indefinite pronoun is slightly contemptuous as to them ([Gal
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012.md); [Jde
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004).md), \[ELLICOTT\].

teach no other doctrine--than what I have taught ([Gal
1:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006).md). His prophetic bodings some
years before ([Act 20:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029).md) were now
being realized (compare [Ti1 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003).md).

[1 Timothy 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ti1 1:4</span></span>

fables--legends about the origin and propagation of angels, such as the
false teachers taught at Colosse ([Col
2:18-23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018).md). "Jewish fables" ([Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014).md). "Profane, and old wives'
fables" ([Ti1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004).md).

genealogies--not merely such civil genealogies as were common among the
Jews, whereby they traced their descent from the patriarchs, to which
Paul would not object, and which he would not as here class with
"fables," but Gnostic genealogies of spirits and aeons, as they called
them, "Lists of Gnostic emanations" \[ALFORD\]. So TERTULLIAN \[Against
Valentinian, c. 3\], and IRENÃ†US \[Preface\]. The Judaizers here
alluded to, while maintaining the perpetual obligation of the Mosaic
law, joined with it a theosophic ascetic tendency, pretending to see in
it mysteries deeper than others could see. The seeds, not the full-grown
Gnosticism of the post-apostolic age, then existed. This formed the
transition stage between Judaism and Gnosticism. "Endless" refers to the
tedious unprofitableness of their lengthy genealogies (compare [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).md). Paul opposes to their "aeons,"
the "King of the aeons (so the Greek, [Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md), whom be glory throughout the
aeons of aeons." The word "aeons" was probably not used in the technical
sense of the latter Gnostics as yet; but "the only wise God" ([Ti1
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017).md), by anticipation, confutes the
subsequently adopted notions in the Gnostics' own phraseology.

questions--of mere speculation ([Act
25:20](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#020).md), not practical; generating
merely curious discussions. "Questions and strifes of words" ([Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004).md): "to no profit" ([Ti2
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#014).md); "gendering strifes" ([Ti2
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#023).md). "Vain jangling" ([Ti1
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).md) of would-be "teachers of the
law."

godly edifying--The oldest manuscripts read, "the dispensation of God,"
the Gospel dispensation of God towards man ([Co1
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017)), "which is (has its element.md) in
faith." CONYBEARE translates, "The exercising of the stewardship of God"
([Co1 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017).md). He infers that the false
teachers in Ephesus were presbyters, which accords with the prophecy,
[Act 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#030.md). However, the oldest Latin
versions, and IRENÃ†US and HILARY, support English Version reading.
Compare [Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md), "faith unfeigned."

[1 Timothy 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ti1 1:5</span></span>

But--in contrast to the doctrine of the false teachers.

the end--the aim.

the commandment--Greek, "of the charge" which you ought to urge on your
flock. Referring to the same Greek word as in [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003.md), [Ti1
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md); here, however, in a larger
sense, as including the Gospel "dispensation of God" (see on [Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004.md); [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011).md), which was the sum and substance
of the "charge" committed to Timothy wherewith he should "charge" his
flock.

charity--LOVE; the sum and end of the law and of the Gospel alike, and
that wherein the Gospel is the fulfilment of the spirit of the law in
its every essential jot and tittle ([Rom
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010).md). The foundation is faith ([Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).md), the "end" is love ([Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md); [Tit
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#015).md).

out of--springing as from a fountain.

pure heart--a heart purified by faith ([Act
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md); [Ti2
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#022.md); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015).md).

good conscience--a conscience cleared from guilt by the effect of sound
faith in Christ ([Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md); [Ti1
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md); [Ti2
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md); [Pe1
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021).md). Contrast [Ti1
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#002.md); [Tit
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#015.md); compare [Act
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md). John uses "heart," where Paul
would use "conscience." In Paul the understanding is the seat of
conscience; the heart is the seat of love \[BENGEL\]. A good conscience
is joined with sound faith; a bad conscience with unsoundness in the
faith (compare [Heb 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014).md).

faith unfeigned--not a hypocritical, dead, and unfruitful faith, but
faith working by love ([Gal 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006).md). The
false teachers drew men off from such a loving, working, real faith, to
profitless, speculative "questions" ([Ti1
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004).md) and jangling ([Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).md).

[1 Timothy 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ti1 1:6</span></span>

From which--namely, from a pure heart, good conscience, and faith
unfeigned, the well-spring of love.

having swerved--literally, "having missed the mark (the 'end') to be
aimed at." It is translated, "erred," [Ti1
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#021.md); [Ti2
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md). Instead of aiming at and
attaining the graces above named, they "have turned aside ([Ti1
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015.md); [Ti2
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md); [Heb
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#013).md) unto vain jangling"; literally,
"vain talk," about the law and genealogies of angels ([Ti1
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md); [Tit
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009.md); [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010).md); [Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md), "vain babblings and
oppositions." It is the greatest vanity when divine things are not
truthfully discussed ([Rom 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#021).md)
\[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ti1 1:7</span></span>

Sample of their "vain talk" ([Ti1
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#006).md).

Desiring--They are would-be teachers, not really so.

the law--the Jewish law ([Tit 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014.md);
[Tit 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#009).md). The Judaizers here meant
seem to be distinct from those impugned in the Epistles to the Galatians
and Romans, who made the works of the law necessary to justification in
opposition to Gospel grace. The Judaizers here meant corrupted the law
with "fables," which they pretended to found on it, subversive of morals
as well as of truth. Their error was not in maintaining the obligation
of the law, but in abusing it by fabulous and immoral interpretations
of, and additions to, it.

neither what they say, nor whereof--neither understanding their own
assertions, nor the object itself about which they make them. They
understand as little about the one as the other \[ALFORD\].

[1 Timothy 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ti1 1:8</span></span>

But--"Now we know" ([Rom 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#019.md); [Rom
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014).md).

law is good--in full agreement with God's holiness and goodness.

if a man--primarily, a teacher; then, every Christian.

use it lawfully--in its lawful place in the Gospel economy, namely, not
as a means of a "'righteous man" attaining higher perfection than could
be attained by the Gospel alone ([Ti1
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md); [Tit
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#014).md), which was the perverted use to
which the false teachers put it, but as a means of awakening the sense
of sin in the ungodly ([Ti1 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md);
compare [Rom 7:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md); [Gal
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021).md).

[1 Timothy 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ti1 1:9</span></span>

law is not made for a righteous man--not for one standing by faith in
the righteousness of Christ put on him for justification,and imparted
inwardly by the Spirit for sanctification. "One not forensically
amenable to the law" \[ALFORD\]. For sanctification, the law gives no
inward power to fulfil it; but ALFORD goes too far in speaking of the
righteous man as "not morally needing the law." Doubtless, in proportion
as he is inwardly led by the Spirit, the justified man needs not the
law, which is only an outward rule ([Rom
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014.md); [Gal
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#018.md), [Gal
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#023).md). But as the justified man often
does not give himself up wholly to the inward leading of the Spirit, he
morally needs the outward law to show him his sin and God's
requirements. The reason why the ten commandments have no power to
condemn the Christian, is not that they have no authority over him, but
because Christ has fulfilled them as our surety ([Rom
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004).md).

disobedient--Greek, "not subject"; insubordinate; it is translated
"unruly," [Tit 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md), [Tit
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010.md); "lawless and disobedient" refer
to opposers of the law, for whom it is "enacted" (so the Greek, for "is
made").

ungodly and . . . sinners--Greek, he who does not reverence God, and he
who openly sins against Him; the opposers of God, from the law comes.

unholy and profane--those inwardly impure, and those deserving exclusion
from the outward participation in services of the sanctuary; sinners
against the third and fourth commandments.

murderers--or, as the Greek may mean, "smiters" of fathers and . . .
mothers; sinners against the fifth commandment.

manslayers--sinners against the sixth commandment.

[1 Timothy 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ti1 1:10</span></span>

whoremongers, &c.--sinners against the seventh commandment.

men-stealers--that is, slave dealers. The most heinous offense against
the eighth commandment. No stealing of a man's goods can equal in
atrocity the stealing of a man's liberty. Slavery is not directly
assailed in the New Testament; to have done so would have been to
revolutionize violently the existing order of things. But Christianity
teaches principles sure to undermine, and at last overthrow it, wherever
Christianity has had its natural development ([Mat
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012).md).

liars . . . perjured--offenders against the ninth commandment.

if there be any other thing--answering to the tenth commandment in its
widest aspect. He does not particularly specify it because his object is
to bring out the grosser forms of transgression; whereas the tenth is
deeply spiritual, so much so indeed, that it was by it that the sense of
sin, in its subtlest form of "lust," Paul tells us ([Rom
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007).md), was brought home to his own
conscience. Thus, Paul argues, these would-be teachers of the law, while
boasting of a higher perfection through it, really bring themselves down
from the Gospel elevation to the level of the grossly "lawless," for
whom, not for Gospel believers, the law was designed. And in actual
practice the greatest sticklers for the law as the means of moral
perfection, as in this case, are those ultimately liable to fall utterly
from the morality of the law. Gospel grace is the only true means of
sanctification as well as of justification.

sound--healthy, spiritually wholesome ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md); [Ti2
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md); [Tit
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#013.md); [Tit
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#002).md), as opposed to sickly, morbid (as
the Greek of "doting" means, [Ti1
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#004).md), and "canker" ([Ti2
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017).md). "The doctrine," or "teaching,
which is according to godliness" ([Ti1
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003).md).

[1 Timothy 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ti1 1:11</span></span>

According to the glorious gospel--The Christian's freedom from the law
as a sanctifier, as well as a justifier, implied in the previous, [Ti1
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md), is what this [Ti1
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#011.md) is connected with. This exemption
of the righteous from the law, and assignment of it to the lawless as
its true object, is "according to the Gospel of the glory (so the Greek,
compare Note, see on [Co2 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004).md) of the
blessed God." The Gospel manifests God's glory ([Eph
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#017.md); [Eph
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#016).md) in accounting "righteous" the
believer, through the righteousness of Christ, without "the law" ([Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md); and in imparting that
righteousness whereby he loathes all those sins against which ([Ti1
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md) the law is directed. The term,
"blessed," indicates at once immortality and supreme happiness. The
supremely blessed One is He from whom all blessedness flows. This term,
as applied to GOD, occurs only here and in [Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md) : appropriate in speaking here of
the Gospel blessedness, in contrast to the curse on those under the law
([Ti1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md); [Gal
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010).md).

committed to my trust--Translate as in the Greek order, which brings
into prominent emphasis Paul, "committed in trust to me"; in contrast to
the kind of law-teaching which they (who had no Gospel commission), the
false teachers, assumed to themselves ([Ti1
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#008.md); [Tit
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003).md).

[1 Timothy 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ti1 1:12</span></span>

The honor done him in having the Gospel ministry committed to him
suggests the digression to what he once was, no better ([Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md) than those lawless ones
described above ([Ti1 1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009).md), when
the grace of our Lord ([Ti1 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014).md)
visited him.

And--omitted in most (not all) of the oldest manuscripts.

I thank--Greek, "I have (that is, feel) gratitude."

enabled me--the same Greek verb as in [Act
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022.md), "Saul increased the more in
strength." An undesigned coincidence between Paul and Luke, his
companion. Enabled me, namely, for the ministry. "It is not in my own
strength that I bring this doctrine to men, but as strengthened and
nerved by Him who saved me" \[THEODORET\]. Man is by nature "without
strength" ([Rom 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006).md). True conversion
and calling confer power \[BENGEL\].

for that--the main ground of his "thanking Christ."

he counted me faithful--He foreordered and foresaw that I would be
faithful to the trust committed to me. Paul's thanking God for this
shows that the merit of his faithfulness was due solely to God's grace,
not to his own natural strength ([Co1
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025).md). Faithfulness is the quality
required in a steward ([Co1 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#002).md).

putting me into--rather as in [Th1
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#009.md), "appointing me (in His sovereign
purposes of grace) unto the ministry" ([Act
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#024).md).

[1 Timothy 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ti1 1:13</span></span>

Who was before--Greek, "Formerly being a blasphemer." "Notwithstanding
that I was before a blasphemer," &c. ([Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md), [Act
26:11](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#011).md).

persecutor-- ([Gal 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#013).md).

injurious--Greek, "insulter"; one who acts injuriously from arrogant
contempt of others. Translate, [Rom
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md), "despiteful." One who added
insult to injury. BENGEL translates, "a despiser." I prefer the idea,
contumelious to others \[WAHL\]. Still I agree with BENGEL that
"blasphemer" is against God, "persecutor," against holy men, and
"insolently injurious" includes, with the idea of injuring others, that
of insolent "uppishness" \[DONALDSON\] in relation to one's self. This
threefold relation to God, to one's neighbor, and to one's self, occurs
often in this Epistle ([Ti1 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md), [Ti1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009.md), [Ti1
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md); [Tit
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#012).md).

I obtained mercy--God's mercy, and Paul's want of it, stand in sharp
contrast \[ELLICOTT\]; Greek, "I was made the object of mercy." The
sense of mercy was perpetual in the mind of the apostle (compare Note,
see on [Ti1 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002).md). Those who have felt
mercy can best have mercy on those out of the way ([Heb
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002).md).

because I did it ignorantly--Ignorance does not in itself deserve
pardon; but it is a less culpable cause of unbelief than pride and
wilful hardening of one's self against the truth ([Joh
9:41](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#041.md); [Act
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009).md). Hence it is Christ's plea of
intercession for His murderers ([Luk
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034).md); and it is made by the apostles
a mitigating circumstance in the Jews' sin, and one giving a hope of a
door of repentance ([Act 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md); [Rom
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002).md). The "because," &c., does not
imply that ignorance was a sufficient reason for mercy being bestowed;
but shows how it was possible that such a sinner could obtain mercy. The
positive ground of mercy being shown to him, lies solely in the
compassion of God ([Tit 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#005).md). The
ground of the ignorance lies in the unbelief, which implies that this
ignorance is not unaccompanied with guilt. But there is a great
difference between his honest zeal for the law, and a wilful striving
against the Spirit of God ([Mat
12:24-32](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md); [Luk
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#052).md) \[WIESINGER\].

[1 Timothy 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ti1 1:14</span></span>

And--Greek, "But." Not only so (was mercy shown me), but

the grace--by which "I obtained mercy" ([Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md).

was exceeding abundant--Greek, "superabounded." Where sin abounded,
grace did much more abound" ([Rom
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020).md).

with faith--accompanied with faith, the opposite of "unbelief" ([Ti1
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013).md).

love--in contrast to "a blasphemer, persecutor, and injurious."

which is in Christ--as its element and home \[ALFORD\]: here as its
source whence it flows to us.

[1 Timothy 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ti1 1:15</span></span>

faithful--worthy of credit, because "God" who says it "is faithful" to
His word ([Co1 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md); [Rev
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#005.md); [Rev
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#006).md). This seems to have become an
axiomatic saying among Christians the phrase, "faithful saying," is
peculiar to the Pastoral Epistles ([Ti1
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#011.md); [Ti1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#009.md); [Tit
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008).md). Translate as Greek, "Faithful is
the saying."

all--all possible; full; to be received by all, and with all the
faculties of the soul, mind, and heart. Paul, unlike the false teachers
([Ti1 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#007).md), understands what he is
saying, and whereof he affirms; and by his simplicity of style and
subject, setting forth the grand fundamental truth of salvation through
Christ, confutes the false teachers' abstruse and unpractical
speculations ([Co1 1:18-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018.md); [Tit
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001).md).

acceptation--reception (as of a boon) into the heart, as well as the
understanding, with all gladness; this is faith acting on the Gospel
offer, and welcoming and appropriating it ([Act
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041).md).

Christ--as promised.

Jesus--as manifested \[BENGEL\].

came into the world--which was full of sin ([Joh
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md); [Rom
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md); [Jo1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002).md). This implies His pre-existence.
[Joh 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md), Greek, "the true Light that,
coming into the world, lighteth every man."

to save sinners--even notable sinners like Saul of Tarsus. His instance
was without a rival since the ascension, in point of the greatness of
the sin and the greatness of the mercy: that the consenter to Stephen,
the proto-martyr's death, should be the successor of the same!

I am--not merely, "I was chief" ([Co1
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008.md); compare [Luk
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013).md). To each believer his own sins
must always appear, as long as he lives, greater than those of others,
which he never can know as he can know his own.

chief--the same Greek as in [Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md),
"first," which alludes to this fifteenth verse, Translate in both
verses, "foremost." Well might he infer where there was mercy for him,
there is mercy for all who will come to Christ ([Mat
18:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011.md); [Luk
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010).md).

[1 Timothy 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ti1 1:16</span></span>

Howbeit--Greek, "But"; contrasting his own conscious sinfulness with
God's gracious visitation of him in mercy.

for this cause--for this very purpose.

that in me--in my case.

first--"foremost." As I was "foremost" (Greek for chief, [Ti1
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015).md) in sin, so God has made me the
"foremost" sample of mercy.

show--to His own glory (the middle Greek, voice), [Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007.md).

all long-suffering--Greek, "the whole (of His) long-suffering," namely,
in bearing so long with me while I was a persecutor.

a pattern--a sample ([Co1 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md), [Co1
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011).md) to assure the greatest sinners
of the certainty that they shall not be rejected in coming to Christ,
since even Saul found mercy. So David made his own case of pardon,
notwithstanding the greatness of his sin, a sample to encourage other
sinners to seek pardon ([Psa 32:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005).md).
The Greek for "pattern" is sometimes used for a "sketch" or outline--the
filling up to take place in each man's own case.

believe on him--Belief rests ON Him as the only foundation on which
faith relies.

to life everlasting--the ultimate aim which faith always keeps in view
([Tit 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002).md).

[1 Timothy 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ti1 1:17</span></span>

A suitable conclusion to the beautifully simple enunciation of the
Gospel, of which his own history is a living sample or pattern. It is
from the experimental sense of grace that the doxology flows \[BENGEL\].

the King, eternal--literally, "King of the (eternal) ages." The
Septuagint translates [Exo 15:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#018.md), "The
Lord shall reign for ages and beyond them." [Psa
145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013.md), Margin, "Thy kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom," literally, "a kingdom of all ages." The "life
everlasting" ([Ti1 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016).md) suggested
here "the King eternal," or everlasting. It answers also to "for ever
and ever" at the close, literally, "to the ages of the ages" (the
countless succession of ages made up of ages).

immortal--The oldest manuscripts read, "incorruptible." The Vulgate,
however, and one very old manuscript read as English Version ([Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023).md).

invisible-- ([Ti1 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md); [Exo
33:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#020.md); [Joh
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md); [Heb
11:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#027).md).

the only wise God--The oldest manuscripts omit "wise," which probably
crept in from [Rom 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md), where it is
more appropriate to the context than here (compare [Jde
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#025).md). "The only Potentate" ([Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015.md); [Psa
86:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#010.md); [Joh
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044).md).

for ever, &c.--See note, above. The thought of eternity (terrible as it
is to unbelievers) is delightful to those assured of grace ([Ti1
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#016).md) \[BENGEL\].

[1 Timothy 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ti1 1:18</span></span>

He resumes the subject begun at [Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003). The conclusion (apodosis.md) to the
foregoing, "as I besought thee . . . charge" ([Ti1
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003).md), is here given, if not formally,
at least substantially.

This charge--namely, "that thou in them (so the Greek) mightest war,"
that is, fulfil thy high calling, not only as a Christian, but as a
minister officially, one function of which is, to "charge some that they
teach no other doctrine" ([Ti1 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003).md).

I commit--as a sacred deposit ([Ti1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md); [Ti2
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002).md) to be laid before thy hearers.

according to--in pursuance of; in consonance with.

the prophecies which went before on thee--the intimations given by
prophets respecting thee at thy ordination, [Ti1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md) (as, probably, by Silas, a
companion of Paul, and "a prophet," [Act
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032).md). Such prophetical intimation,
as well as the good report given of Timothy by the brethren ([Act
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002).md), may have induced Paul to take
him as his companion. Compare similar prophecies as to others: [Act
13:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md), in connection with laying on
of hands; [Act 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md); [Act
21:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#010.md); compare [Co1
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#010.md); [Co1
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#001.md); [Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md). In [Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md), it is expressly said that "the
Holy Ghost had made them (the Ephesian presbyters) overseers." CLEMENT
OF ROME \[Epistle to the Corinthians\], states it was the custom of the
apostles "to make trial by the Spirit," that is, by the "power of
discerning," in order to determine who were to be overseers and deacons
in the several churches planted. So CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA says as to the
churches near Ephesus, that the overseers were marked out for ordination
by a revelation of the Holy Ghost to St. John.

by them--Greek, "in them"; arrayed as it were in them; armed with them.

warfare--not the mere "fight" ([Ti1
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md); [Ti2
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007).md), but the whole campaign; the
military service. Translate as Greek, not "a," but "the good warfare."

[1 Timothy 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ti1 1:19</span></span>

Holding--Keeping hold of "faith" and "good conscience" ([Ti1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005).md); not "putting the latter away" as
"some." Faith is like a very precious liquor; a good conscience is the
clean, pure glass that contains it \[BENGEL\]. The loss of good
conscience entails the shipwreck of faith. Consciousness of sin
(unrepented of and forgiven) kills the germ of faith in man
\[WIESINGER\].

which--Greek singular, namely, "good conscience," not "faith" also;
however, the result of putting away good conscience is, one loses faith
also.

put away--a wilful act. They thrust it from them as a troublesome
monitor. It reluctantly withdraws, extruded by force, when its owner is
tired of its importunity, and is resolved to retain his sin at the cost
of losing it. One cannot be on friendly terms with it and with sin at
one and the same time.

made shipwreck--"with respect to THE faith." Faith is the vessel in
which they had professedly embarked, of which "good conscience" is the
anchor. The ancient Church often used this image, comparing the course
of faith to navigation. The Greek does not imply that one having once
had faith makes shipwreck of it, but that they who put away good
conscience "make shipwreck with respect to THE faith."

[1 Timothy 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ti1 1:20</span></span>

Hymenaeus--There is no difficulty in supposing him to be the
HymenÃ&brvbr;us of [Ti2 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md). Though
"delivered over to Satan" (the lord of all outside the Church, [Act
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018.md), and the executor of wrath, when
judicially allowed by God, on the disobedient, [Co1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md); [Co2
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007).md), he probably was restored to the
Church subsequently, and again troubled it. Paul, as an apostle, though
distant at Rome pronounced the sentence to be executed at Ephesus,
involving, probably, the excommunication of the offenders ([Mat
18:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#017).md). The sentence operated not
only spiritually, but also physically, sickness, or some such visitation
of God, falling on the person excommunicated, in order to bring him to
repentance and salvation. Alexander here is probably "the coppersmith"
who did Paul "much evil" when the latter visited Ephesus. The
"delivering him to Satan" was probably the consequence of his
withstanding the apostle ([Ti2
4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014).md); as the same sentence on
HymenÃ&brvbr;us was the consequence of "saying that the resurrection is
past already" ([Ti2 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md); his putting
away good conscience, naturally producing shipwreck concerning FAITH,
[Ti1 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md). If one's religion better
not his morals, his moral deficiencies will corrupt his religion. The
rain which falls pure from heaven will not continue pure if it be
received in an unclean vessel \[ARCHBISHOP WHATELY\]). It is possible
that he is the Alexander, then a Jew, put forward by the Jews, doubtless
against Paul, at the riot in Ephesus ([Act
19:33](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033).md).

that they may--not "might"; implying that the effect still
continues--the sentence is as yet unremoved.

learn--Greek, "be disciplined," namely, by chastisement and suffering.

blaspheme--the name of God and Christ, by doings and teachings unworthy
of their Christian profession ([Rom
2:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023.md); [Jam
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#007).md). Though the apostles had the
power of excommunication, accompanied with bodily inflictions,
miraculously sent ([Co2 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008).md), it does
not follow that fallible ministers now have any power, save that of
excluding from church fellowship notorious bad livers.
