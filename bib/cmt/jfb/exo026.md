### [Exodus Chapter 26](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 26:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 26:1</span></span>

TEN CURTAINS (Exo. 26:1-37)

cunning work--that is, of elegant texture, richly embroidered. The word
"cunning," in old English, is synonymous with "skilful."

[Exodus 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">exo 26:2</span></span>

length--Each curtain was to be fifteen yards in length and a little
exceeding two in breadth.

[Exodus 26:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 26:3</span></span>

The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another, &c.--so as
to form two grand divisions, each eleven yards wide.

[Exodus 26:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">exo 26:6</span></span>

taches--clasps; supposed in shape, as well as in use, to be the same as
hooks and eyes.

[Exodus 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">exo 26:7</span></span>

curtains of goats' hair--These coarse curtains were to be one more in
number than the others, and to extend a yard lower on each side, the use
of them being to protect and conceal the richer curtains.

[Exodus 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">exo 26:14</span></span>

a covering . . . of rams' skins dyed red--that is, of Turkey red
leather. \[See on [Exo 39:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo039.htm#034.md).\]

[Exodus 26:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">exo 26:15</span></span>

thou shalt make boards . . . rear up the tabernacle according to the
fashion . . . which was showed thee--The tabernacle, from its name as
well as from its general appearance and arrangements, was a tent; but
from the description given in these verses, the boards that formed its
walls, the five (cross) bars that strengthened them, and the middle bar
that "reached from end to end," and gave it solidity and compactness, it
was evidently a more substantial fabric than a light and fragile tent,
probably on account of the weight of its various coverings as well as
for the protection of its precious furniture.

[Exodus 26:36](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">exo 26:36</span></span>

an hanging for the door of the tent--Curtains of rich and elaborate
embroidery, made by the women, are suspended over the doors or entrances
of the tents occupied by Eastern chiefs and princes. In a similar style
of elegance was the hanging finished which was to cover the door of this
tabernacle--the chosen habitation of the God and King of Israel. It
appears from [Exo 26:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#012.md), [Exo
26:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#022.md), that the ark and mercy seat
were placed in the west end of the tabernacle, and consequently the door
or entrance fronted the east, so that the Israelites in worshipping
Jehovah, turned their faces towards the west; that they might be thus
figuratively taught to turn from the worship of that luminary which was
the great idol of the nations, and to adore the God who made it and them
\[HEWLETT\].
