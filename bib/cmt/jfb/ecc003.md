### [Ecclesiastes Chapter 3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)

[Ecclesiastes 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ecc 3:1</span></span>

(Ecc. 3:1-22)

Man has his appointed cycle of seasons and vicissitudes, as the sun,
wind, and water ([Ecc 1:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#005)).

purpose--as there is a fixed "season" in God's "purposes" (for example,
He has fixed the "time" when man is "to be born," and "to die," [Ecc
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002)), so there is a lawful "time" for
man to carry out his "purposes" and inclinations. God does not condemn,
but approves of, the use of earthly blessings ([Ecc
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012)); it is the abuse that He
condemns, the making them the chief end ([Co1
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031)). The earth, without human
desires, love, taste, joy, sorrow, would be a dreary waste, without
water; but, on the other hand, the misplacing and excess of them, as of
a flood, need control. Reason and revelation are given to control them.

[Ecclesiastes 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ecc 3:2</span></span>

time to die-- ([Psa 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#015); [Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027)).

plant--A man can no more reverse the times and order of "planting," and
of "digging up," and transplanting, than he can alter the times fixed
for his "birth" and "death." To try to "plant" out of season is vanity,
however good in season; so to make earthly things the chief end is
vanity, however good they be in order and season. GILL takes it, not so
well, figuratively ([Jer 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#007), [Jer
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#009); [Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015); [Mat
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#013)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ecc 3:3</span></span>

time to kill--namely, judicially, criminals; or, in wars of
self-defense; not in malice. Out of this time and order, killing is
murder.

to heal--God has His times for "healing" (literally, [Isa
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#005), [Isa
38:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#021); figuratively, [Deu
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039); [Hos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001); spiritually, [Psa
147:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#003); [Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019)). To heal spiritually, before
the sinner feels his wound, would be "out of time," and so injurious.

time to break down--cities, as Jerusalem, by Nebuchadnezzar.

build up--as Jerusalem, in the time of Zerubbabel; spiritually ([Amo
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)), "the set time" ([Psa
102:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">ecc 3:4</span></span>

mourn--namely, for the dead ([Gen
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#002)).

dance--as David before the ark ([Sa2
6:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#012); [Psa
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#011)); spiritually ([Mat
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015); [Luk
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021); [Luk
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#025)). The Pharisees, by requiring
sadness out of time, erred seriously.

[Ecclesiastes 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ecc 3:5</span></span>

cast away stones--as out of a garden or vineyard ([Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002)).

gather--for building; figuratively, the Gentiles, once castaway stones,
were in due time made parts of the spiritual building ([Eph
2:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019)), and children of Abraham
([Mat 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)); so the restored Jews
hereafter ([Psa 102:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013); [Zac
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#016)).

refrain . . . embracing-- ([Joe 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#016);
[Co1 7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ecc 3:6</span></span>

time to get--for example, to gain honestly a livelihood ([Eph
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023)).

lose--When God wills losses to us, then is our time to be content.

keep--not to give to the idle beggar ([Th2
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010)).

cast away--in charity ([Pro 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#024)); or
to part with the dearest object, rather than the soul ([Mar
9:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043)). To be careful is right in its
place, but not when it comes between us and Jesus Christ ([Luk
10:40-42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">ecc 3:7</span></span>

rend--garments, in mourning ([Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013)); figuratively, nations, as
Israel from Judah, already foretold, in Solomon's time ([Kg1
11:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#030)), to be "sewed" together
hereafter ([Eze 37:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#015), [Eze
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#022)).

silence-- ([Amo 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#013)), in a national
calamity, or that of a friend ([Job
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#013)); also not to murmur under God's
visitation ([Lev 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#003); [Psa
39:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#001), [Psa
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">ecc 3:8</span></span>

hate--for example, sin, lusts ([Luk
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)); that is, to love God so much
more as to seem in comparison to hate "father or mother," when coming
between us and God.

a time of war . . . peace-- ([Luk
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#031)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">ecc 3:9</span></span>

But these earthly pursuits, while lawful in their season, are
"unprofitable" when made by man, what God never intended them to be, the
chief good. Solomon had tried to create an artificial forced joy, at
times when he ought rather to have been serious; the result, therefore,
of his labor to be happy, out of God's order, was disappointment. "A
time to plant" ([Ecc 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#002)) refers to
his planting ([Ecc 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005)); "laugh" ([Ecc
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#004)), to [Ecc
2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001); "his mirth," "laughter"; "build
up," "gather stones" ([Ecc 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#003), [Ecc
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005)), to his "building" ([Ecc
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004)); "embrace," "love," to his
"princess" (see on [Ecc 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008)); "get"
(perhaps also "gather," [Ecc 3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#005)),
to his "gathering" ([Ecc 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#008)). All
these were of "no profit," because not in God's time and order of
bestowing happiness.

[Ecclesiastes 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">ecc 3:10</span></span>

(See on [Ecc 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#013)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">ecc 3:11</span></span>

his time--that is, in its proper season ([Psa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#003)), opposed to worldlings putting
earthly pursuits out of their proper time and place (see on [Ecc
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#009)).

set the world in their heart--given them capacities to understand the
world of nature as reflecting God's wisdom in its beautiful order and
times ([Rom 1:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)). "Everything"
answers to "world," in the parallelism.

so that--that is, but in such a manner that man only sees a portion, not
the whole "from beginning to end" ([Ecc
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#017); [Job
26:14](../../../bib/kjv/job026.htm#014); [Rom
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033); [Rev
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev015.htm#004)). PARKHURST, for "world,"
translates: "Yet He hath put obscurity in the midst of them," literally,
"a secret," so man's mental dimness of sight as to the full mystery of
God's works. So HOLDEN and WEISS. This incapacity for "finding out"
(comprehending) God's work is chiefly the fruit of the fall. The
worldling ever since, not knowing God's time and order, labors in vain,
because out of time and place.

[Ecclesiastes 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">ecc 3:12</span></span>

in them--in God's works ([Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011)),
as far as relates to man's duty. Man cannot fully comprehend them, but
he ought joyfully to receive ("rejoice in") God's gifts, and "do good"
with them to himself and to others. This is never out of season ([Gal
6:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009)). Not sensual joy and
self-indulgence ([Phi 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004); [Jam
4:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#016)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">ecc 3:13</span></span>

Literally, "And also as to every man who eats . . . this is the gift of
God" ([Ecc 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)). When received as God's gifts,
and to God's glory, the good things of life are enjoyed in their due
time and order ([Act 2:46](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046); [Co1
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031); [Ti1
4:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#003)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ecc 3:14</span></span>

([Sa1 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#012); [Sa2
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005); [Psa
89:34](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#034); [Mat
24:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#035); [Jam
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)).

for ever--as opposed to man's perishing labors ([Ecc
2:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#015)).

any thing taken from it--opposed to man's "crooked and wanting" works
([Ecc 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#015); [Ecc
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#013)). The event of man's labors
depends wholly on God's immutable purpose. Man's part, therefore, is to
do and enjoy every earthly thing in its proper season ([Ecc
3:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012)), not setting aside God's
order, but observing deep reverence towards God; for the mysteriousness
and unchangeableness of God's purposes are designed to lead "man to fear
before Him." Man knows not the event of each act: otherwise he would
think himself independent of God.

[Ecclesiastes 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">ecc 3:15</span></span>

Resumption of [Ecc 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#009). Whatever
changes there be, the succession of events is ordered by God's
"everlasting" laws ([Ecc 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#014)), and
returns in a fixed cycle.

requireth that . . . past--After many changes, God's law requires the
return of the same cycle of events, as in the past, literally, "that
which is driven on." The Septuagint and Syriac translate: "God requireth
(that is, avengeth) the persecuted man"; a transition to [Ecc
3:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016). The parallel clauses of the
verse support English Version.

[Ecclesiastes 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ecc 3:16</span></span>

Here a difficulty is suggested. If God "requires" events to move in
their perpetual cycle, why are the wicked allowed to deal unrighteously
in the place where injustice ought least of all to be; namely, "the
place of judgment" ([Jer 12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001))?

[Ecclesiastes 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">ecc 3:17</span></span>

Solution of it. There is a coming judgment in which God will vindicate
His righteous ways. The sinner's "time" of his unrighteous "work" is
short. God also has His "time" and "work" of judgment; and, meanwhile,
is overruling, for good at last, what seems now dark. Man cannot now
"find out" the plan of God's ways ([Ecc
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011); [Psa
97:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#002)). If judgment instantly followed
every sin, there would be no scope for free will, faith, and
perseverance of saints in spite of difficulties. The previous darkness
will make the light at last the more glorious.

there-- ([Job 3:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#017)) in eternity, in
the presence of the Divine Judge, opposed to the "there," in the human
place of judgment ([Ecc 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#016)): so
"from thence" ([Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ecc 3:18</span></span>

estate--The estate of fallen man is so ordered (these wrongs are
permitted), that God might "manifest," that is, thereby prove them, and
that they might themselves see their mortal frailty, like that of the
beasts.

sons of men--rather, "sons of Adam," a phrase used for "fallen men." The
toleration of injustice until the judgment is designed to "manifest"
men's characters in their fallen state, to see whether the oppressed
will bear themselves aright amidst their wrongs, knowing that the time
is short, and there is a coming judgment. The oppressed share in death,
but the comparison to "beasts" applies especially to the ungodly
oppressors ([Psa 49:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#012), [Psa
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#020)). They too need to be
"manifested" ("proved"), whether, considering that they must soon die as
the "beasts," and fearing the judgment to come, they will repent ([Dan
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#027)).

[Ecclesiastes 3:19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ecc 3:19</span></span>

Literally, "For the sons of men (Adam) are a mere chance, as also the
beast is a mere chance." These words can only be the sentiments of the
skeptical oppressors. God's delay in judgment gives scope for the
"manifestation" of their infidelity ([Ecc
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011); [Psa
55:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#019); [Pe2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003),4). They are "brute beasts,"
morally ([Ecc 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#018); [Jde
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#010)); and they end by maintaining
that man, physically, has no pre-eminence over the beast, both alike
being "fortuities." Probably this was the language of Solomon himself in
his apostasy. He answers it in [Ecc
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021). If [Ecc
3:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#019) be his words, they express
only that as regards liability to death, excluding the future judgment,
as the skeptic oppressors do, man is on a level with the beast. Life is
"vanity," if regarded independently of religion. But [Ecc
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021) points out the vast difference
between them in respect to the future destiny; also ([Ecc
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#017)) beasts have no "judgment" to
come.

breath--vitality.

[Ecclesiastes 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ecc 3:21</span></span>

Who knoweth--Not doubt of the destination of man's spirit ([Ecc
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#007)); but "how few, by reason of the
outward mortality to which man is as liable as the beast and which is
the ground of the skeptic's argument, comprehend the wide difference
between man and the beast" ([Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001)). The Hebrew expresses the
difference strongly, "The spirit of man that ascends, it belongeth to on
high; but the spirit of the beast that descends, it belongeth to below,
even to the earth." Their destinations and proper element differ utterly
\[WEISS\].

[Ecclesiastes 3:22](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ecc 3:22</span></span>

(Compare [Ecc 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#012); [Ecc
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#018)). Inculcating a thankful
enjoyment of God's gifts, and a cheerful discharge of man's duties,
founded on fear of God; not as the sensualist ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)); not as the anxious money-seeker
([Ecc 2:23](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#023); [Ecc
5:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc005.htm#010)).

his portion--in the present life. If it were made his main portion, it
would be "vanity" ([Ecc 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#001); [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025)).

for who, &c.--Our ignorance as to the future, which is God's "time"
([Ecc 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc003.htm#011)), should lead us to use the
present time in the best sense and leave the future to His infinite
wisdom ([Mat 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020), [Mat
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#025), [Mat
6:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#031)).
