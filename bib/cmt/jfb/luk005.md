### [Luke Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001)

[Luke 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 5:3</span></span>

MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES--CALL OF PETER, JAMES, AND JOHN. ([Luk
5:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#001))

taught . . . out of the ship--(See on [Mat
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#002)).

[Luke 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">luk 5:4</span></span>

for a draught--munificent recompense for the use of his boat.

[Luke 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 5:5</span></span>

Master--betokening not surely a first acquaintance, but a relationship
already formed.

all night--the usual time of fishing then ([Joh
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003)), and even now Peter, as a
fisherman, knew how hopeless it was to "let down his net" again, save as
a mere act of faith, "at His word" of command, which carried in it, as
it ever does, assurance of success. (This shows he must have been
already and for some time a follower of Christ.)

[Luke 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 5:6</span></span>

net brake--rather "was breaking," or "beginning to break," as in [Luk
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#007), "beginning to sink."

[Luke 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">luk 5:8</span></span>

Depart, &c.--Did Peter then wish Christ to leave him? Verily no. His all
was wrapt up in Him ([Joh 6:68](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#068)). "It
was rather, Woe is me, Lord! How shall I abide this blaze of glory? A
sinner such as I am is not fit company for Thee." (Compare [Isa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005).)

[Luke 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 5:10</span></span>

Simon, fear not--This shows how the Lord read Peter's speech. The more
highly they deemed Him, ever the more grateful it was to the Redeemer's
spirit. Never did they pain Him by manifesting too lofty conceptions of
Him.

from henceforth--marking a new stage of their connection with Christ.
The last was simply, "I will make you fishers."

fishers of men--"What wilt thou think, Simon, overwhelmed by this
draught of fishes, when I shall bring to thy net what will beggar all
this glory?" (See on [Mat 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#018).)

[Luke 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">luk 5:11</span></span>

forsook all--They did this before ([Mat
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#020)); now they do it again; and yet
after the Crucifixion they are at their boats once more ([Joh
21:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#003)). In such a business this is
easily conceivable. After pentecost, however, they appear to have
finally abandoned their secular calling.

[Luke 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">luk 5:15</span></span>

LEPER HEALED. ([Luk 5:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012))

But so, &c.--(See [Mar 1:45](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#045)).

[Luke 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 5:17</span></span>

PARALYTIC HEALED. ([Luk 5:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#017))

Pharisees and doctors . . . sitting by--the highest testimony yet borne
to our Lord's growing influence, and the necessity increasingly felt by
the ecclesiastics throughout the country of coming to some definite
judgment regarding Him.

power of the Lord . . . present--with Jesus.

to heal them--the sick people.

[Luke 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 5:19</span></span>

housetop--the flat roof.

through the tiling . . . before Jesus--(See on [Mar
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#002)).

[Luke 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">luk 5:24</span></span>

take up thy couch--"sweet saying! The bed had borne the man; now the man
shall bear the bed!" \[BENGEL\].

[Luke 5:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 5:30</span></span>

LEVI'S CALL AND FEAST. ([Luk 5:27-32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#027))

their scribes--a mode of expression showing that Luke was writing for
Gentiles.
