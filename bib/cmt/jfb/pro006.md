### [Proverbs Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001)

[Proverbs 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">pro 6:1</span></span>

After admonitions against suretyship and sloth (compare [Pro
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006)), the character and fate of the
wicked generally are set forth, and the writer (Pro. 6:20-35) resumes
the warnings against incontinence, pointing out its certain and terrible
results. This train of thought seems to intimate the kindred of these
vices. (Pro. 6:1-35)

if--The condition extends through both verses.

be surety--art pledged.

stricken . . . hand--bargained (compare [Job
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#003)).

with a stranger--that is, for a friend (compare [Pro
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#015); [Pro
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro017.htm#018)).

[Proverbs 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">pro 6:3</span></span>

come . . . friend--in his power.

humble . . . sure thy friend--urge as a suppliant; that is, induce the
friend to provide otherwise for his debt, or secure the surety.

[Proverbs 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">pro 6:4</span></span>

The danger requires promptness.

[Proverbs 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">pro 6:6</span></span>

The improvident sluggards usually want sureties. Hence, such are advised
to industry by the ant's example.

[Proverbs 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">pro 6:9</span></span>

Their conduct graphically described;

[Proverbs 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">pro 6:11</span></span>

and the fruits of their self-indulgence and indolence presented.

as . . . travelleth--literally, "one who walks backwards and forwards,"
that is, a highwayman.

armed man--that is, one prepared to destroy.

[Proverbs 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">pro 6:12</span></span>

A naughty person--literally, "A man of Belial," or of worthlessness,
that is, for good, and so depraved, or wicked (compare [Sa1
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025); [Sa1
30:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1030.htm#022), &c.). Idleness and vice are
allied. Though indolent in acts, he actively and habitually (walketh) is
ill-natured in speech ([Pro 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro004.htm#024)).

[Proverbs 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">pro 6:13</span></span>

If, for fear of detection, he does not speak, he uses signs to carry on
his intrigues. These signs are still so used in the East.

[Proverbs 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">pro 6:14</span></span>

Frowardness--as in [Pro 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#014).

deviseth--literally, "constructs, as an artisan."

mischief--evil to others.

discord--especially litigation. Cunning is the talent of the weak and
lazy.

[Proverbs 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">pro 6:15</span></span>

Suddenness aggravates evil (compare [Pro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011); [Pro
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#001)).

calamity--literally, "a crushing weight."

broken--shivered as a potter's vessel; utterly destroyed ([Psa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009)).

[Proverbs 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">pro 6:16</span></span>

six . . . seven--a mode of speaking to arrest attention ([Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015), [Pro
30:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#018); [Job
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">pro 6:17</span></span>

proud look--literally, "eyes of loftiness" ([Psa
131:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#001)). Eyes, tongue, &c., for
persons.

[Proverbs 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">pro 6:19</span></span>

speaketh--literally, "breathes out," habitually speaks ([Psa
27:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#012); [Act
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001)).

[Proverbs 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">pro 6:20</span></span>

(Compare [Pro 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#008); [Pro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003), &c.).

[Proverbs 6:22](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">pro 6:22</span></span>

it--(compare [Pro 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023)); denotes the
instruction of parents ([Pro 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#020)), to
which all the qualities of a safe guide and guard and ready teacher are
ascribed. It prevents the ingress of evil by supplying good thoughts,
even in dreams ([Pro 3:21-23](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#021); [Psa
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#009); [Pe2
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019)).

[Proverbs 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">pro 6:23</span></span>

reproofs-- ([Pro 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#023)) the convictions
of error produced by instruction.

[Proverbs 6:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">pro 6:24</span></span>

A specimen of its benefit. By appreciating truth, men are not affected
by lying flattery.

[Proverbs 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">pro 6:25</span></span>

One of the cautions of this instruction, avoid alluring beauty.

take--or, "ensnare."

eyelids--By painting the lashes, women enhanced beauty.

[Proverbs 6:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">pro 6:26</span></span>

The supplied words give a better sense than the old version: "The price
of a whore is a piece of bread."

adulteress--(Compare Margin), which the parallel and context ([Pro
6:29-35](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#029)) sustain. Of similar results
of this sin, compare [Pro 5:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#009).

will hunt--alluding to the snares spread by harlots (compare [Pro
7:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#006)).

precious life--more valuable than all else.

[Proverbs 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">pro 6:27</span></span>

The guilt and danger most obvious.

[Proverbs 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">pro 6:30</span></span>

[Proverbs 6:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">pro 6:31</span></span>

sevenfold--(compare [Exo 22:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001)), for
many, ample (compare [Gen 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#024); [Mat
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021)), even if all his wealth is
taken.

[Proverbs 6:32](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">pro 6:32</span></span>

lacketh understanding--or, "heart"; destitute of moral principle and
prudence.

[Proverbs 6:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#033)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">pro 6:33</span></span>

dishonour--or, "shame," as well as hurt of body ([Pro
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#035)).

reproach . . . away--No restitution will suffice;

[Proverbs 6:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#034)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">pro 6:34</span></span>

nor any terms of reconciliation be admitted.
