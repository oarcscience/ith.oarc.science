### [Hebrews Chapter 10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

[Hebrews 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">heb 10:1</span></span>

CONCLUSION OF THE FOREGOING ARGUMENT. THE YEARLY RECURRING LAW
SACRIFICES CANNOT PERFECT THE WORSHIPPER, BUT CHRIST'S ONCE-FOR-ALL
OFFERING CAN. (Heb. 10:1-39)

Previously the oneness of Christ's offering was shown; now is shown its
perfection as contrasted with the law sacrifices.

having--inasmuch as it has but "the shadow, not the very image," that
is, not the exact likeness, reality, and full revelation, such as the
Gospel has. The "image" here means the archetype (compare [Heb
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#024).md), the original, solid image
\[BENGEL\] realizing to us those heavenly verities, of which the law
furnished but a shadowy outline before. Compare [Co2
3:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#013.md), [Co2
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md); the Gospel is the very setting
forth by the Word and Spirit of the heavenly realities themselves, out
of which it (the Gospel) is constructed. So ALFORD. As Christ is "the
express image (Greek, 'impress') of the Father's person" ([Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003).md), so the Gospel is the heavenly
verities themselves manifested by revelation--the heavenly very
archetype, of which the law was drawn as a sketch, or outline copy ([Heb
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#005).md). The law was a continual process
of acted prophecy, proving the divine design that its counterparts
should come; and proving the truth of those counterparts when they came.
Thus the imperfect and continued expiatory sacrifices before Christ
foretend, and now prove, the reality of, Christ's one perfect
antitypical expiation.

good things to come-- ([Heb 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#011).md);
belonging to "the world (age) to come." Good things in part made present
by faith to the believer, and to be fully realized hereafter in actual
and perfect enjoyment. Lessing says, "As Christ's Church on earth is a
prediction of the economy of the future life, so the Old Testament
economy is a prediction of the Christian Church." In relation to the
temporal good things of the law, the spiritual and eternal good things
of the Gospel are "good things to come." [Col
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017.md) calls legal ordinances "the
shadow," and Christ "the body."

never--at any time ([Heb 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011).md).

with those sacrifices--rather, "with the same sacrifices.

year by year--This clause in the Greek refers to the whole sentence, not
merely to the words "which they the priests offered" (Greek, "offer").
Thus the sense is, not as English Version, but, the law year by year, by
the repetition of the same sacrifices, testifies its inability to
perfect the worshippers; namely, on the YEARLY day of atonement. The
"daily" sacrifices are referred to, [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md).

continually--Greek, "continuously," implying that they offer a toilsome
and ineffectual "continuous" round of the "same" atonement-sacrifices
recurring "year by year."

comers thereunto--those so coming unto God, namely, the worshippers (the
whole people) coming to God in the person of their representative, the
high priest.

perfect--fully meet man's needs as to justification and sanctification
(see on [Heb 9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009).md).

[Hebrews 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">heb 10:2</span></span>

For--if the law could, by its sacrifices, have perfected the
worshippers.

they--the sacrifices.

once purged--IF they were once for all cleansed ([Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027).md).

conscience--"consciousness of sin" ([Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009).md).

[Hebrews 10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">heb 10:3</span></span>

But--so far from those sacrifices ceasing to be offered ([Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002).md).

in, &c.--in the fact of their being offered, and in the course of their
being offered on the day of atonement. Contrast [Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md).

a remembrance--a recalling to mind by the high priest's confession, on
the day of atonement, of the sins both of each past year and of all
former years, proving that the expiatory sacrifices of former years were
not felt by men's consciences to have fully atoned for former sins; in
fact, the expiation and remission were only legal and typical ([Heb
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md), [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011).md). The Gospel remission, on the
contrary, is so complete, that sins are "remembered no more" ([Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017).md) by God. It is unbelief to
"forget" this once-for-all purgation, and to fear on account of "former
sins" ([Pe2 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009).md). The believer, once
for all bathed, needs only to "wash" his hands and "feet" of soils,
according as he daily contracts them, in Christ's blood ([Joh
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#010).md).

[Hebrews 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">heb 10:4</span></span>

For, &c.--reason why, necessarily, there is a continually recurring
"remembrance of sins" in the legal sacrifices ([Heb
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#003).md). Typically, "the blood of
bulls," &c., sacrificed, had power; but it was only in virtue of the
power of the one real antitypical sacrifice of Christ; they had no power
in themselves; they were not the instrument of perfect vicarious
atonement, but an exhibition of the need of it, suggesting to the
faithful Israelite the sure hope of coming redemption, according to
God's promise.

take away--"take off." The Greek, [Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md), is stronger, explaining the
weaker word here, "take away utterly." The blood of beasts could not
take away the sin of man. A MAN must do that (see on [Heb
9:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012).md).

[Hebrews 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">heb 10:5</span></span>

Christ's voluntary self offering, in contrast to those inefficient
sacrifices, is shown to fulfill perfectly "the will of God" as to our
redemption, by completely atoning "for (our) sins."

Wherefore--seeing that a nobler than animal sacrifices was needed to
"take away sins."

when he cometh--Greek, "coming." The time referred to is the period
before His entrance into the world, when the inefficiency of animal
sacrifices for expiation had been proved \[THOLUCK\]. Or, the time is
that between Jesus' first dawning of reason as a child, and the
beginning of His public ministry, during which, being ripened in human
resolution, He was intently devoting Himself to the doing of His
Father's will \[ALFORD\]. But the time of "coming" is present; not "when
He had come," but "when coming into the world"; so, in order to accord
with ALFORD'S view, "the world" must mean His PUBLIC ministry: when
coming, or about to come, into public. The Greek verbs are in the past:
"sacrifice . . . Thou didst not wish, but a body Thou didst prepare for
Me"; and, "Lo, I am come." Therefore, in order to harmonize these times,
the present coming, or about to come, with the past, "A body Thou didst
prepare for Me," we must either explain as ALFORD, or else, if we take
the period to be before His actual arrival in the world (the earth) or
incarnation, we must explain the past tenses to refer to God's purpose,
which speaks of what He designed from eternity as though it were already
fulfilled. "A body Thou didst prepare in Thy eternal counsel." This
seems to me more likely than explaining "coming into the world," "coming
into public," or entering on His public ministry. David, in the fortieth
Psalm (here quoted), reviews his past troubles and God's having
delivered him from them, and his consequent desire to render willing
obedience to God as more acceptable than sacrifices; but the Spirit puts
into his mouth language finding its partial application to David, and
its full realization only in the divine Son of David. "The more any son
of man approaches the incarnate Son of God in position, or office, or
individual spiritual experience, the more directly may his holy
breathings in the power of Christ's Spirit be taken as utterances of
Christ Himself. Of all men, the prophet-king of Israel resembled and
foreshadowed Him the most" \[ALFORD\].

a body hast thou prepared me--Greek, "Thou didst fit for Me a body." "In
Thy counsels Thou didst determine to make for Me a body, to be given up
to death as a sacrificial victim" \[WAHL\]. In the Hebrew, [Psa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md), it is "mine ears hast thou
opened," or "dug." Perhaps this alludes to the custom of boring the ear
of a slave who volunteers to remain under his master when he might be
free. Christ's assuming a human body, in obedience to the Father's will,
in order to die the death of a slave ([Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014).md), was virtually the same act of
voluntary submission to service as that of a slave suffering his ear to
be bored by his master. His willing obedience to the Father's will is
what is dwelt on as giving especial virtue to His sacrifice ([Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), [Heb
10:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009).md). The preparing, or fitting of
a body for Him, is not with a view to His mere incarnation, but to His
expiatory sacrifice ([Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010).md), as
the contrast to "sacrifice and offering" requires; compare also [Rom
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004.md); [Eph
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#016.md); [Col
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022.md). More probably "opened mine ears"
means opened mine inward ear, so as to be attentively obedient to what
God wills me to do, namely, to assume the body He has prepared for me
for my sacrifice, so [Job 33:16](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#016.md),
Margin; [Job 36:10](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#010.md) (doubtless the
boring of a slave's "ear" was the symbol of such willing obedience);
[Isa 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005.md), "The Lord God hath opened
mine ear," that is, made me obediently attentive as a slave to his
master. Others somewhat similarly explain, "Mine ears hast thou digged,"
or "fashioned," not with allusion to [Exo
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#006.md), but to the true office of the
ear--a willing, submissive attention to the voice of God ([Isa
50:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004).md). The forming of the ear
implies the preparation of the body, that is, the incarnation; this
secondary idea, really in the Hebrew, though less prominent, is the one
which Paul uses for his argument. In either explanation the idea of
Christ taking on Him the form, and becoming obedient as a servant, is
implied. As He assumed a body in which to make His self-sacrifice, so
ought we present our bodies a living sacrifice ([Rom
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001).md).

[Hebrews 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">heb 10:6</span></span>

burnt offerings--Greek, "whole burnt offerings."

thou hast had no pleasure--as if these could in themselves atone for
sin: God had pleasure in (Greek, "approved," or "was well pleased with")
them, in so far as they were an act of obedience to His positive command
under the Old Testament, but not as having an intrinsic efficacy such as
Christ's sacrifice had. Contrast [Mat
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md).

[Hebrews 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">heb 10:7</span></span>

I come--rather, "I am come" (see on [Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md). "Here we have the creed, as it
were, of Jesus: 'I am come to fulfil the law,' [Mat
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md); to preach, [Mar
1:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#038.md); to call sinners to repentance,
[Luk 5:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#032.md); to send a sword and to set
men at variance, [Mat 10:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md); I came
down from heaven to do the will of Him that sent me, [Joh
6:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#038.md) (so here, [Psa
40:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007).md); I am sent to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel, [Mat 15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md); I
am come into this world for judgment, [Joh
9:39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039.md); I am come that they might have
life, and might have it more abundantly, [Joh
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#010.md); to save what had been lost,
[Mat 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011.md); to seek and to save that
which was lost, [Luk 19:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#010.md); compare
[Ti1 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md); to save men's lives, [Luk
9:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#056.md); to send fire on the earth, [Luk
12:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#049.md); to minister, [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md); as "the Light," [Joh
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#046.md); to bear witness unto the truth,
[Joh 18:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#037.md). See, reader, that thy
Saviour obtain what He aimed at in thy case. Moreover, do thou for thy
part say, why thou art come here? Dost thou, then, also, do the will of
God? From what time? and in what way?" \[BENGEL\]. When the two goats on
the day of atonement were presented before the Lord, that goat on which
the lot of the Lord should fall was to be offered as a sin offering; and
that lot was lifted up on high in the hand of the high priest, and then
laid upon the head of the goat which was to die; so the hand of God
determined all that was done to Christ. Besides the covenant of God with
man through Christ's blood, there was another covenant made by the
Father with the Son from eternity. The condition was, "If He shall make
His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed," &c. ([Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010).md). The Son accepted the
condition, "Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God" \[BISHOP PEARSON\].
Oblation, intercession, and benediction, are His three priestly offices.

in the volume, &c.--literally, "the roll": the parchment manuscript
being wrapped around a cylinder headed with knobs. Here, the Scripture
"volume" meant is the fortieth Psalm. "By this very passage 'written of
Me,' I undertake to do Thy will \[namely, that I should die for the sins
of the world, in order that all who believe may be saved, not by animal
sacrifices, [Heb 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006.md), but by My
death\]." This is the written contract of Messiah (compare [Neh
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#038).md), whereby He engaged to be our
surety. So complete is the inspiration of all that is written, so great
the authority of the Psalms, that what David says is really what Christ
then and there said.

[Hebrews 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">heb 10:8</span></span>

he--Christ.

Sacrifice, &c.--The oldest manuscripts read, "Sacrifices and offerings"
(plural). This verse combines the two clauses previously quoted
distinctly, [Heb 10:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md), in contrast
to the sacrifice of Christ with which God was well pleased.

[Hebrews 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">heb 10:9</span></span>

Then said he--"At that time (namely, when speaking by David's mouth in
the fortieth Psalm) He hath said." The rejection of the legal sacrifices
involves, as its concomitant, the voluntary offer of Jesus to make the
self-sacrifice with which God is well pleased (for, indeed, it was God's
own "will" that He came to do in offering it: so that this sacrifice
could not but be well pleasing to God).

I come--"I am come."

taketh away--"sets aside the first," namely, "the legal system of
sacrifices" which God wills not.

the second--"the will of God" ([Heb
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#007.md), [Heb
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#009).md) that Christ should redeem us by
His self-sacrifice.

[Hebrews 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">heb 10:10</span></span>

By--Greek, "In." So "in," and "through," occur in the same sentence,
[Pe1 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#022.md), "Ye have purified your
souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit." Also, [Pe1
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md), in the Greek. The "in (fulfilment
of) which will" (compare the use of in, [Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md), "wherein \[in which grace\] He
hath made us accepted, in the Beloved"), expresses the originating
cause; "THROUGH the offering . . . of Christ," the instrumental or
mediatory cause. The whole work of redemption flows from "the will" of
God the Father, as the First Cause, who decreed redemption from before
the foundation of the world. The "will" here (boulema) is His absolute
sovereign will. His "good will" (eudokia) is a particular aspect of it.

are sanctified--once for all, and as our permanent state (so the Greek).
It is the finished work of Christ in having sanctified us (that is,
having translated us from a state of unholy alienation into a state of
consecration to God, having "no more conscience of sin," [Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002).md) once for all and permanently,
not the process of gradual sanctification, which is here referred to.

the body--"prepared" for Him by the Father ([Heb
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005).md). As the atonement, or
reconciliation, is by the blood of Christ ([Lev
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#011).md), so our sanctification
(consecration to God, holiness and eternal bliss) is by the body of
Christ ([Col 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#022).md). ALFORD quotes the
Book of Common Prayer Communion Service, "that our sinful bodies may be
made clean by His body, and our souls washed through His most precious
blood."

once for all-- ([Heb 7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027.md); [Heb
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#012.md), [Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md), [Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md); [Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md), [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).md).

[Hebrews 10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">heb 10:11</span></span>

And--a new point of contrast; the frequent repetition of the sacrifices.

priest--The oldest manuscripts read, "high priest." Though he did not in
person stand "daily" offering sacrifices, he did so by the subordinate
priests of whom, as well as of all Israel, he was the representative
head. So "daily" is applied to the high priests ([Heb
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#027).md).

standeth--the attitude of one ministering; in contrast to "sat down on
the right hand of God," [Heb 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md),
said of Christ; the posture of one being ministered to as a king.

which--Greek, "the which," that is, of such a kind as.

take away--utterly; literally, "strip off all round." Legal sacrifices
might, in part, produce the sense of forgiveness, yet scarcely even that
(see on [Heb 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#004).md); but entirely to
strip off one's guilt they never could.

[Hebrews 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">heb 10:12</span></span>

this man--emphatic ([Heb 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#003).md).

for ever--joined in English Version with "offered one sacrifice";
offered one sacrifice, the efficacy of which endures for ever;
literally. "continuously," (compare [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014).md). "The offering of Christ, once
for all made, will continue the one and only oblation for ever; no other
will supersede it" \[BENGEL\]. The mass, which professes to be the
frequent repetition of one and the same sacrifice of Christ's body, is
hence disproved. For not only is Christ's body one, but also His
offering is one, and that inseparable from His suffering ([Heb
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026).md). The mass would be much the same
as the Jewish sacrifices which Paul sets aside as abrogated, for they
were anticipations of the one sacrifice, just as Rome makes masses
continuations of it, in opposition to Paul's argument. A repetition
would imply that the former once-for-all offering of the one sacrifice
was imperfect, and so would be dishonoring to it ([Heb
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md), [Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md). [Heb
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md), on the contrary, says, "He hath
PERFECTED FOR EVER them that are sanctified." If Christ offered Himself
at the last supper, then He offered Himself again on the cross, and
there would be two offerings; but Paul says there was only one, once for
all. Compare Note, see on [Heb 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#026.md).
English Version is favored by the usage in this Epistle, of putting the
Greek "for ever" after that which it qualifies. Also, "one sacrifice for
ever," stands in contrast to "the same sacrifices oftentimes" ([Heb
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#011).md). Also, [Co1
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#025.md), [Co1
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028.md), agrees with [Heb
10:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md), taken as English Version,
not joining, as ALFORD does, "for ever" with "sat down," for Jesus is to
give up the mediatorial throne "when all things shall be subdued unto
Him," and not to sit on it for ever.

[Hebrews 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">heb 10:13</span></span>

expecting--"waiting." Awaiting the execution of His Father's will, that
all His foes should be subjected to Him. The Son waits till the Father
shall "send Him forth to triumph over all His foes." He is now sitting
at rest ([Heb 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md), invisibly
reigning, and having His foes virtually, by right of His death, subject
to Him. His present sitting on the unseen throne is a necessary
preliminary to His coming forth to subject His foes openly. He shall
then come forth to a visibly manifested kingdom and conquest over His
foes. Thus He fulfils [Psa 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md). This
agrees with [Co1 15:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md). He is, by
His Spirit and His providence, now subjecting His foes to Him in part
([Psa 110:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001).md). The subjection of His
foes fully shall be at His second advent, and from that time to the
general judgment (Rev. 19:1-20:15); then comes the subjection of Himself
as Head of the Church to the Father (the mediatorial economy ceasing
when its end shall have been accomplished), that God may be all in all.
Eastern conquerors used to tread on the necks of the vanquished, as
Joshua did to the five kings. So Christ's total and absolute conquest at
His coming is symbolized.

be made his footstool--literally, "be placed (rendered) footstool of His
feet."

his enemies--Satan and Death, whose strength consists in "sin"; this
being taken away ([Heb 10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md), the
power of the foes is taken away, and their destruction necessarily

[Hebrews 10:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">heb 10:14</span></span>

For--The sacrifice being "for ever" in its efficacy ([Heb
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012).md) needs no renewal.

them that are sanctified--rather as Greek, "them that are being
sanctified." The sanctification (consecration to God) of the elect ([Pe1
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002).md) believers is perfect in Christ
once for all (see on [Heb 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010).md).
(Contrast the law, [Heb 7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009.md); [Heb
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#001).md). The development of that
sanctification is progressive.

[Hebrews 10:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">heb 10:15</span></span>

The Greek, has "moreover," or "now."

is a witness--of the truth which I am setting forth. The Father's
witness is given [Heb 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#010.md). The Son's,
[Heb 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005.md). Now is added that of the
Holy Spirit, called accordingly "the Spirit of grace," [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md). The testimony of all Three
leads to the same conclusion ([Heb
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018).md).

for after that he had said before--The conclusion to the sentence is in
[Heb 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md), "After He had said before,
This is the covenant that I will make with them (with the house of
Israel, [Heb 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md); here extended to
the spiritual Israel) . . . saith the Lord; I will put (literally,
'giving,' referring to the giving of the law; not now as then, giving
into the hands, but giving) My laws into their hearts ('mind,' [Heb
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010).md) and in their minds ('hearts,'
[Heb 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010).md); I will inscribe (so the
Greek) them (here He omits the addition quoted in [Heb
8:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#010.md), I will be to them a God . . .
and they shall not teach every man his neighbor . . .), and (that is,
after He had said the foregoing, HE THEN ADDS) their sins . . . will I
remember no more." The great object of the quotation here is to prove
that, there being in the Gospel covenant, "REMISSION of sins" ([Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017).md), there is no more need of a
sacrifice for sins. The object of the same quotation in [Heb
8:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008.md) is to show that, there being a
"NEW covenant," the old is antiquated.

[Hebrews 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">heb 10:18</span></span>

where remission of these is--as there is under the Gospel covenant ([Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017).md). "Here ends the finale (Heb.
10:1-18) of the great tripartite arrangement (Heb. 7:1-25; 7:26-9:12;
9:13-10:18) of the middle portion of the Epistle. Its great theme was
Christ a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. What it is
to be a high priest after the order of Melchisedec is set forth, Heb.
7:1-25, as contrasted with the Aaronic order. That Christ, however, as
High Priest, is Aaron's antitype in the true holy place, by virtue of
His self-sacrifice here on earth, and Mediator of a better covenant,
whose essential character the old only typified, we learn, Heb.
7:26-9:12. And that Christ's self-sacrifice, offered through the Eternal
Spirit, is of everlasting power, as contrasted with the unavailing cycle
of legal offerings, is established in the third part, Heb. 9:13-10:18;
the first half of this last portion \[Heb. 9:13-28\], showing that both
our present possession of salvation, and our future completion of it,
are as certain to us as that He is with God, ruling as a Priest and
reigning as a King, once more to appear, no more as a bearer of our
sins, but in glory as a Judge. The second half, Heb. 10:1-18,
reiterating the main position of the whole, the High Priesthood of
Christ, grounded on His offering of Himself--its kingly character its
eternal accomplishment of its end, confirmed by Psalms 40 and 110 and
Jeremiah 31" \[DELITZSCH in ALFORD\].

[Hebrews 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">heb 10:19</span></span>

Here begins the third and last division of the Epistle; our duty now
while waiting for the Lord's second advent. Resumption and expansion of
the exhortation ([Heb 4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md); compare
[Heb 10:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022) here.md) wherewith he
closed the first part of the Epistle, preparatory to his great doctrinal
argument, beginning at [Heb 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md).

boldness--"free confidence," grounded on the consciousness that our sins
have been forgiven.

to enter--literally, "as regards the entering."

by--Greek, "in"; it is in the blood of Jesus that our boldness to enter
is grounded. Compare [Eph 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#012.md), "In
whom we have boldness and access with confidence." It is His having once
for all entered as our Forerunner ([Heb
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#020).md) and High Priest ([Heb
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021).md), making atonement for us with
His blood, which is continually there ([Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024).md) before God, that gives us
confident access. No priestly caste now mediates between the sinner and
his Judge. We may come boldly with loving confidence, not with slavish
fear, directly through Christ, the only mediating Priest. The minister
is not officially nearer God than the layman; nor can the latter serve
God at a distance or by deputy, as the natural man would like. Each must
come for himself, and all are accepted when they come by the new and
living way opened by Christ. Thus all Christians are, in respect to
access directly to God, virtually high priests ([Rev
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006).md). They draw nigh in and through
Christ, the only proper High Priest ([Heb
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#025).md).

[Hebrews 10:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">heb 10:20</span></span>

which, &c.--The antecedent in the Greek is "the entering"; not as
English Version, "way." Translate, "which (entering) He has consecrated
(not as though it were already existing, but has been the first to open,
INAUGURATED as a new thing; see on [Heb
9:18](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#018), where the Greek is the same.md) for
us (as) a new (Greek, 'recent'; recently opened, [Rom
16:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025).md) and living way" (not like
the lifeless way through the law offering of the blood of dead victims,
but real, vital, and of perpetual efficacy, because the living and
life-giving Saviour is that way. It is a living hope that we have,
producing not dead, but living, works). Christ, the first-fruits of our
nature, has ascended, and the rest is sanctified thereby. "Christ's
ascension is our promotion; and whither the glory of the Head hath
preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called" \[LEO\].

the veil--As the veil had to be passed through in order to enter the
holiest place, so the weak, human suffering flesh ([Heb
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#007).md) of Christ's humanity (which
veiled His God head) had to be passed through by Him in entering the
heavenly holiest place for us; in putting off His rent flesh, the temple
veil, its type, was simultaneously rent from top to bottom ([Mat
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051).md). Not His body, but His weak
suffering flesh, was the veil; His body was the temple ([Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019).md).

[Hebrews 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">heb 10:21</span></span>

high priest--As a different Greek term (archiereus) is used always
elsewhere in this Epistle for "high priest," translate as Greek here, "A
Great Priest"; one who is at once King and "Priest on His throne" ([Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013).md); a royal Priest, and a priestly
King.

house of God--the spiritual house, the Church, made up of believers,
whose home is heaven, where Jesus now is ([Heb
12:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#022).md). Thus, by "the house of
God," over which Jesus is, heaven is included in meaning, as well as the
Church, whose home it is.

[Hebrews 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">heb 10:22</span></span>

([Heb 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#016.md); [Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019)..md)

with a true heart--without hypocrisy; "in truth, and with a perfect
heart"; a heart thoroughly imbued with "the truth" ([Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md).

full assurance-- ([Heb 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011).md); with no
doubt as to our acceptance when coming to God by the blood of Christ. As
"faith" occurs here, so "hope," and "love," [Heb
10:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md).

sprinkled from--that is, sprinkled so as to be cleansed from.

evil conscience--a consciousness of guilt unatoned for, and uncleansed
away ([Heb 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md); [Heb
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#009).md). Both the hearts and the bodies
are cleansed. The legal purifications were with blood of animal victims
and with water, and could only cleanse the flesh ([Heb
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#013.md), [Heb
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#021).md). Christ's blood purifies the
heart and conscience. The Aaronic priest, in entering the holy place,
washed with water ([Heb 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#019).md) in the
brazen laver. Believers, as priests to God, are once for all washed in
BODY (as distinguished from "hearts") at baptism. As we have an
immaterial, and a material nature, the cleansing of both is expressed by
"hearts" and "body," the inner and the outer man; so the whole man,
material and immaterial. The baptism of the body, however, is not the
mere putting away of material filth, nor an act operating by intrinsic
efficacy, but the sacramental seal, applied to the outer man, of a
spiritual washing ([Pe1 3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021).md). "Body"
(not merely "flesh," the carnal part, as [Co2
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001).md) includes the whole material man,
which needs cleansing, as being redeemed, as well as the soul. The body,
once polluted with sin, is washed, so as to be fitted like Christ's holy
body, and by His body, to be spiritually a pure and living offering. On
the "pure water," the symbol of consecration and sanctification, compare
[Joh 19:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#034.md); [Co1
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#011.md); [Jo1
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006.md); [Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md). The perfects "having . . .
hearts sprinkled . . . body (the Greek is singular) washed," imply a
continuing state produced by a once-for-all accomplished act, namely,
our justification by faith through Christ's blood, and consecration to
God, sealed sacramentally by the baptism of our body.

[Hebrews 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">heb 10:23</span></span>

([Heb 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006.md), [Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md); [Heb
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014)..md)

profession--Greek, "confession."

our faith--rather as Greek, "our hope"; which is indeed faith exercised
as to the future inheritance. Hope rests on faith, and at the same time
quickens faith, and is the ground of our bold confession ([Pe1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015).md). Hope is similarly ([Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022).md) connected with purification
([Jo1 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#003).md).

without wavering--without declension ([Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014).md), "steadfast unto the end."

he--God is faithful to His promises ([Heb
6:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#017.md); [Heb
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#011.md); [Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026.md), [Heb
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#028.md); [Co1
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#009.md); [Co1
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013.md); [Th1
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#024.md); [Th2
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#003.md); see also Christ's promise, [Joh
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#026).md); but man is too often
unfaithful to his duties.

[Hebrews 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">heb 10:24</span></span>

Here, as elsewhere, hope and love follow faith; the Pauline triad of
Christian graces.

consider--with the mind attentively fixed on "one another" (see on [Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001).md), contemplating with continual
consideration the characters and wants of our brethren, so as to render
mutual help and counsel. Compare "consider," [Psa
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md), and [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015), "(All.md) looking diligently lest
any fail of the grace of God."

to provoke--Greek, "with a view to provoking unto love," instead of
provoking to hatred, as is too often the case.

[Hebrews 10:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">heb 10:25</span></span>

assembling of ourselves together--The Greek, "episunagoge," is only
found here and [Th2 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md) (the gathering
together of the elect to Christ at His coming, [Mat
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#031).md). The assembling or gathering of
ourselves for Christian communion in private and public, is an earnest
of our being gathered together to Him at His appearing. Union is
strength; continual assemblings together beget and foster love, and give
good opportunities for "provoking to good works," by "exhorting one
another" ([Heb 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#013).md). IGNATIUS says,
"When ye frequently, and in numbers meet together, the powers of Satan
are overthrown, and his mischief is neutralized by your likemindedness
in the faith." To neglect such assemblings together might end in
apostasy at last. He avoids the Greek term "sunagoge," as suggesting the
Jewish synagogue meetings (compare [Rev
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#009).md).

as the manner of some is--"manner," that is, habit, custom. This gentle
expression proves he is not here as yet speaking of apostasy.

the day approaching--This, the shortest designation of the day of the
Lord's coming, occurs elsewhere only in [Co1
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#013.md); a confirmation of the Pauline
authorship of this Epistle. The Church being in all ages kept uncertain
how soon Christ is coming, the day is, and has been, in each age,
practically always near; whence, believers have been called on always to
be watching for it as nigh at hand. The Hebrews were now living close
upon One of those great types and foretastes of it, the destruction of
Jerusalem ([Mat 24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#001).md), "the bloody
and fiery dawn of the great day; that day is the day of days, the ending
day of all days, the settling day of all days, the day of the promotion
of time into eternity, the day which, for the Church, breaks through and
breaks off the night of the present world" \[DELITZSCH in ALFORD\].

[Hebrews 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">heb 10:26</span></span>

Compare on this and following verses, [Heb
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md), &c. There the warning was that if
there be not diligence in progressing, a falling off will take place,
and apostasy may ensue: here it is, that if there be lukewarmness in
Christian communion, apostasy may ensue.

if we sin--Greek present participle: if we be found sinning, that is,
not isolated acts, but a state of sin \[ALFORD\]. A violation not only
of the law, but of the whole economy of the New Testament ([Heb
10:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028).md).

wilfully--presumptuously, Greek "willingly." After receiving "full
knowledge (so the Greek, compare [Ti1
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004).md) of the truth," by having been
"enlightened," and by having "tasted" a certain measure even of grace of
"the Holy Ghost" (the Spirit of truth, [Joh
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#017.md); and "the Spirit of grace," [Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029).md): to fall away (as "sin" here
means, [Heb 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012.md), [Heb
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#017.md); compare [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006).md) and apostatize ([Heb
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#012).md) to Judaism or infidelity, is not
a sin of ignorance, or error ("out of the way," the result) of
infirmity, but a deliberate sinning against the Spirit ([Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md); [Heb
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#002).md): such sinning, where a
consciousness of Gospel obligations not only was, but is present: a
sinning presumptuously and preseveringly against Christ's redemption for
us, and the Spirit of grace in us. "He only who stands high can fall
low. A lively reference in the soul to what is good is necessary in
order to be thoroughly wicked; hence, man can be more reprobate than the
beasts, and the apostate angels than apostate man" \[THOLUCK\].

remaineth no more sacrifice--For there is but ONE Sacrifice that can
atone for sin; they, after having fully known that sacrifice,
deliberately reject it.

[Hebrews 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">heb 10:27</span></span>

a certain--an extraordinary and indescribable. The indefiniteness, as of
something peculiar of its kind, makes the description the more terrible
(compare Greek, [Jam 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#018).md).

looking for--"expectation": a later sense of the Greek. ALFORD strangely
translates, as the Greek usually means elsewhere, "reception." The
transition is easy from "giving a reception to" something or someone, to
"looking for." Contrast the "expecting" (the very same Greek as here),
[Heb 10:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#013.md), which refutes ALFORD.

fiery indignation--literally, "zeal of fire." Fire is personified: glow
or ardor of fire, that is, of Him who is "a consuming fire."

devour--continually.

[Hebrews 10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">heb 10:28</span></span>

Compare [Heb 2:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md).

despised--"set at naught" \[ALFORD\]: utterly and heinously violated,
not merely some minor detail, but the whole law and covenant; for
example, by idolatry ([Deu 17:2-7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#002).md). So
here apostasy answers to such an utter violation of the old covenant.

died--Greek, "dies": the normal punishment of such transgression, then
still in force.

without mercy--literally, "mercies": removal out of the pale of
mitigation, or a respite of his doom.

under--on the evidence of.

[Hebrews 10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">heb 10:29</span></span>

sorer--Greek, "worse," namely, "punishment" (literally, "vengeance")
than any mere temporal punishment of the body.

suppose ye--an appeal to the Hebrews' reason and conscience.

thought worthy--by God at the judgment.

trodden under foot the Son of God--by "wilful" apostasy. So he treads
under foot God Himself who "glorified His Son as an high priest" ([Heb
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#005.md); [Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006).md).

an unholy thing--literally, "common," as opposed to "sanctified." No
better than the blood of a common man, thus involving the consequence
that Christ, in claiming to be God, was guilty of blasphemy, and so
deserved to die!

wherewith he was sanctified--for Christ died even for him. "Sanctified,"
in the fullest sense, belongs only to the saved elect. But in some sense
it belongs also to those who have gone a far way in Christian
experience, and yet fall away at last. The higher such a one's past
Christian experiences, the deeper his fall.

done despite unto--by repelling in fact: as "blasphemy" is despite in
words ([Mar 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#029).md). "Of the Jews who
became Christians and relapsed to Judaism, we find from the history of
Uriel Acosta, that they required a blasphemy against Christ. 'They
applied to Him epithets used against Molech the adulterous branch,' &c."
\[THOLUCK\].

the Spirit of grace--the Spirit that confers grace. "He who does not
accept the benefit, insults Him who confers it. He hath made thee a son:
wilt thou become a slave? He has come to take up His abode with thee;
but thou art introducing evil into thyself" \[CHRYSOSTOM\]. "It is the
curse of evil eternally to propagate evil: so, for him who profanes the
Christ without him, and blasphemes the Christ within him, there is
subjectively no renewal of a change of mind ([Heb
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#006).md), and objectively no new sacrifice
for sins" ([Heb 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md) \[THOLUCK\].

[Hebrews 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">heb 10:30</span></span>

him--God, who enters no empty threats.

Vengeance belongeth unto me--Greek, "To Me belongeth vengeance": exactly
according with Paul's quotation, [Rom
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md), of the same text.

Lord shall judge his people--in grace, or else anger, according as each
deserves: here, "judge," so as to punish the reprobate apostate; there,
"judge," so as to interpose in behalf of, and save His people ([Deu
32:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#036).md).

[Hebrews 10:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">heb 10:31</span></span>

fearful . . . to fall into the hands--It is good like David to fall into
the hands of God, rather than man, when one does so with filial faith in
his father's love, though God chastises him. "It is fearful" to fall
into His hands as a reprobate and presumptuous sinner doomed to His just
vengeance as Judge ([Heb 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#027).md).

living God--therefore able to punish for ever ([Mat
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#028).md).

[Hebrews 10:32](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">heb 10:32</span></span>

As previously he has warned them by the awful end of apostates, so here
he stirs them up by the remembrance of their own former faith, patience,
and self-sacrificing love. So [Rev
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#003.md).

call to remembrance--habitually: so the present tense means.

illuminated--"enlightened": come to "the knowledge of the truth" ([Heb
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026).md) in connection with baptism (see
on [Heb 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004).md). In spiritual baptism,
Christ, who is "the Light," is put on. "On the one hand, we are not to
sever the sign and the grace signified where the sacrifice truly answers
its designs; on the other, the glass is not to be mistaken for the
liquor, nor the sheath for the sword" \[BENGEL\].

fight of--that is, consisting of afflictions.

[Hebrews 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">heb 10:33</span></span>

The persecutions here referred to seem to have been endured by the
Hebrew Christians at their first conversion, not only in Palestine, but
also in Rome and elsewhere, the Jews in every city inciting the populace
and the Roman authorities against Christians.

gazing-stock--as in a theater (so the Greek): often used as the place of
punishment in the presence of the assembled multitudes. [Act
19:29](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md); [Co1
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009.md), "Made a theatrical spectacle to
the world."

ye became--of your own accord: attesting your Christian sympathy with
your suffering brethren.

companions of--sharers in affliction with.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">heb 10:34</span></span>

ye had compassion on me in my bonds--The oldest manuscripts and versions
omit "me," and read, "Ye both sympathized with those in bonds (answering
to the last clause of [Heb 10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033.md);
compare [Heb 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md), [Heb
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md); [Heb
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md), and accepted (so the Greek is
translated in [Heb 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035).md) with joy
([Jam 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002.md); joy in tribulations, as
exercising faith and other graces, [Rom
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md); and the pledge of the coming
glory, [Mat 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012).md) the plundering of
your (own) goods (answering to the first clause of [Heb
10:33](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#033).md)."

in yourselves--The oldest manuscripts omit "in": translate, "knowing
that ye have for (or 'to') yourselves."

better--a heavenly ([Heb 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016).md).

enduring--not liable to spoiling.

substance--possession: peculiarly our own, if we will not cast away our
birthright.

[Hebrews 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">heb 10:35</span></span>

Consequent exhortation to confidence and endurance, as Christ is soon
coming.

Cast not away--implying that they now have "confidence," and that it
will not withdraw of itself, unless they "cast it away" wilfully
(compare [Heb 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014).md).

which--Greek, "the which": inasmuch as being such as.

hath--present tense: it is as certain as if you had it in your hand
([Heb 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037).md). It hath in reversion.

recompense of reward--of grace not of debt: a reward of a kind which no
mercenary self-seeker would seek: holiness will be its own reward;
self-devoting unselfishness for Christ's sake will be its own rich
recompense (see on [Heb 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md); [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026).md).

[Hebrews 10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">heb 10:36</span></span>

patience--Greek, "waiting endurance," or "enduring perseverance": the
kindred Greek verb in the Septuagint, [Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md), is translated, "wait for it"
(compare [Jam 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007).md).

after ye have done the will of God--"that whereas ye have done the will
of God" hitherto ([Heb 10:32-35](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#032).md), ye
may now show also patient, persevering endurance, and so "receive the
promise," that is, the promised reward: eternal life and bliss
commensurate with our work of faith and love ([Heb
6:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010).md). We must not only do, but
also suffer ([Pe1 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#019).md). God first
uses the active talents of His servants; then polishes the other side of
the stone, making the passive graces shine, patience, meekness, &c. It
may be also translated, "That ye may do the will of God, and receive,"
&c. \[ALFORD\]: "patience" itself is a further and a persevering doing
of "God's will"; otherwise it would be profitless and no real grace
([Mat 7:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021).md). We should look, not
merely for individual bliss now and at death, but for the great and
general consummation of bliss of all saints, both in body and soul.

[Hebrews 10:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">heb 10:37</span></span>

Encouragement to patient endurance by consideration of the shortness of
the time till Christ shall come, and God's rejection of him that draws
back, taken from [Hab 2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003.md).

a little while-- ([Joh 16:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016).md).

he that shall come--literally, "the Comer." In Habakkuk, it is the
vision that is said to be about to come. Christ, being the grand and
ultimate subject of all prophetical vision, is here made by Paul, under
inspiration, the subject of the Spirit's prophecy by Habakkuk, in its
final and exhaustive fulfilment.

[Hebrews 10:38](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">heb 10:38</span></span>

just--The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "my just man." God is the
speaker: "He who is just in My sight." BENGEL translates, "The just
shall live by my faith": answering to the Hebrew, [Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md); literally, "the just shall live
by the faith of Him," namely, Christ, the final subject of "the vision,"
who "will not lie," that is, disappoint. Here not merely the first
beginning, as in [Gal 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md), but the
continuance, of the spiritual life of the justified man is referred to,
as opposed to declension and apostasy. As the justified man receives his
first spiritual life by faith, so it is by faith that he shall continue
to live ([Luk 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#004).md). The faith meant
here is that fully developed living trust in the unseen ([Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001).md) Saviour, which can keep men
steadfast amidst persecutions and temptations ([Heb
10:34-36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#034).md).

but--Greek, "and."

if any man draw back--So the Greek admits: though it might also be
translated, as ALFORD approves, "if he (the just man) draw back." Even
so, it would not disprove the final perseverance of saints. For "the
just man" in this latter clause would mean one seemingly, and in part
really, though not savingly, "just" or justified: as in [Eze
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md), [Eze
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#026.md). In the Hebrew, this latter half
of the verse stands first, and is, "Behold, his soul which is lifted up,
is not upright in him." Habakkuk states the cause of drawing back: a
soul lifted up, and in self-inflated unbelief setting itself up against
God. Paul, by the Spirit, states the effect, it draws back. Also, what
in Habakkuk is, "His soul is not upright in him," is in Paul, "My soul
shall have no pleasure in him." Habakkuk states the cause, Paul the
effect: He who is not right in his own soul, does not stand right with
God; God has no pleasure in him. BENGEL translates Habakkuk, "His soul
is not upright in respect to him," namely, Christ, the subject of "the
vision," that is, Christ has no pleasure in him (compare [Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025).md). Every flower in spring is not
a fruit in autumn.

[Hebrews 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">heb 10:39</span></span>

A Pauline elegant turning-off from denunciatory warnings to charitable
hopes of his readers ([Rom 8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#012).md).

saving of the soul--literally, "acquisition (or obtaining) of the soul."
The kindred Greek verb is applied to Christ's acquiring the Church as
the purchase of His blood ([Act
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028).md). If we acquire or obtain our
soul's salvation, it is through Him who has obtained it for us by His
bloodshedding. "The unbelieving man loses his soul: for not being God's,
neither is he his own \[compare [Mat
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#026.md), with [Luk
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#025.md)\]: faith saves the soul by
linking it to God" \[DELITZSCH in ALFORD\].
