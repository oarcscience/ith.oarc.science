### [Luke Chapter 8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001)

[Luke 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">luk 8:1</span></span>

A GALILEAN CIRCUIT, WITH THE TWELVE AND CERTAIN MINISTERING WOMEN. (In
Luke only). ([Luk 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001))

went--travelled, made a progress.

throughout every city and village--through town and village.

preaching, &c.--the Prince of itinerant preachers scattering far and
wide the seed of the Kingdom.

[Luke 8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">luk 8:2</span></span>

certain women . . . healed, &c.--on whom He had the double claim of
having brought healing to their bodies and new life to their souls.
Drawn to Him by an attraction more than magnetic, they accompany Him on
this tour as His almoners--ministering unto Him of their substance.
Blessed Saviour! It melts us to see Thee living upon the love of Thy
ransomed people. That they bring Thee their poor offerings we wonder
not. Thou hast sown unto them spiritual things, and they think it, as
well they might, a small thing that Thou shouldst reap their material
things ([Co1 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011)). But dost Thou take
it at their hand, and subsist upon it? "Oh, the depth of the riches"
([Rom 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033)) --of this poverty of His!

Mary Magdalene--that is, probably, of Magdala (on which see [Mat
15:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#039); see on [Mar
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#010)).

went--rather, "had gone."

seven devils-- ([Mar 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)). It is a
great wrong to this honored woman to identify her with the once
profligate woman of [Luk 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037), and to
call all such penitents Magdalenes. The mistake has arisen from
confounding unhappy demoniacal possession with the conscious
entertainment of diabolic impurity, or supposing the one to have been
afflicted as a punishment for the other--for which there is not the
least scriptural ground.

[Luke 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">luk 8:3</span></span>

Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward--If the steward of such a
godless, cruel, and licentious wretch as Herod Antipas (see on [Mar
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#014), &c.) differed greatly from
himself, his post would be no easy or enviable one. That he was a
disciple of Christ is very improbable, though he might be favorably
disposed towards Him. But what we know not of him, and may fear he
lacked, we are sure his wife possessed. Healed either of "evil spirits"
or of some one of the "infirmities" here referred to--the ordinary
diseases of humanity--she joins in the Saviour's train of grateful,
clinging followers. Of "Susanna," next mentioned, we know nothing but
the name, and that here only. But her services on this memorable
occasion have immortalized her name. "Wheresoever this gospel shall be
preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done," in
ministering to the Lord of her substance on His Galilean tour, "shall be
spoken of as a memorial of her" ([Mar
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#009)).

many others--that is, many other healed women. What a train! and all
ministering unto Him of their substance, and He allowing them to do it
and subsisting upon it! "He who was the support of the spiritual life of
His people disdained not to be supported by them in the body. He was not
ashamed to penetrate so far into the depths of poverty as to live upon
the alms of love. He only fed others miraculously; for Himself, He lived
upon the love of His people. He gave all things to men, His brethren,
and received all things from them, enjoying thereby the pure blessing of
love: which is then only perfect when it is at the same time both giving
and receiving. Who could invent such things as these? It was necessary
to live in this manner that it might be so recorded" \[OLSHAUSEN\].

[Luke 8:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">luk 8:16</span></span>

PARABLE OF THE SOWER. ([Luk 8:4-18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#004))

No man, &c.--(see on [Mat 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#015), of
which this is nearly a repetition).

[Luke 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 8:17</span></span>

For nothing, &c.--(See on [Luk 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#002)).

[Luke 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 8:18</span></span>

how ye--in [Mar 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#024), "what ye hear."
The one implies the other. The precept is very weighty.

seemeth to have--or, "thinketh that he hath" (Margin). The "having" of
[Mat 13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012) (on which see), and this
"thinking he hath," are not different. Hanging loosely on him, and not
appropriated, it is and is not his.

[Luke 8:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">luk 8:23</span></span>

JESUS CROSSING THE LAKE, STILLS THE STORM. ([Luk
8:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#022))

filled--literally, "were getting filled," that is, those who sailed;
meaning that their ship was so.

[Luke 8:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">luk 8:40</span></span>

JAIRUS' DAUGHTER RAISED AND ISSUE OF BLOOD HEALED. (Luke 8:40-56)

gladly received him, for . . . all waiting for him--The abundant
teaching of that day (in Mat. 13:1-58; and see [Mar
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#036)), had only whetted the people's
appetite; and disappointed, as would seem, that He had left them in the
evening to cross the lake, they remain hanging about the beach, having
got a hint, probably through some of His disciples, that He would be
back the same evening. Perhaps they witnessed at a distance the sudden
calming of the tempest. Here at least they are, watching for His return,
and welcoming Him to the shore. The tide of His popularity was now fast
rising.

[Luke 8:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 8:45</span></span>

Who touched me?--"Askest Thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who
touched Thee not in such a throng."

[Luke 8:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 8:46</span></span>

Somebody hath touched--yes, the multitude "thronged" and pressed
Him--"they jostled against Him," but all involuntarily; they were merely
carried along; but one, one only--"Somebody TOUCHED" HIM, with the
conscious, voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its hands
expressly to have contact with Him. This and this only Jesus
acknowledges and seeks out. Even so, as the Church Father AUGUSTINE long
ago said, multitudes still come similarly close to Christ in the means
of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the crowd. The
voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric conductor which
alone draws virtue out of Him.

[Luke 8:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 8:47</span></span>

declared . . . before all--This, though a great trial to the shrinking
modesty of the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging
her forth, her public testimony to the facts of her case--both her
disease, with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and
perfect relief which her touch of the Great Healer had brought her.

[Luke 8:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#055)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">luk 8:55</span></span>

give her meat--(See on [Mar 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#043)).
