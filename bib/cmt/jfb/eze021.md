Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Ezekiel Chapter 21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#001)

[Ezekiel 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 21:2</span></span>

PROPHECY AGAINST ISRAEL AND JERUSALEM, AND AGAINST AMMON. (Eze. 21:1-32)

the holy places--the three parts of the temple: the courts, the holy
place, and the holiest. If "synagogues" existed before the Babylonian
captivity, as [Psa 74:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#008) seems to
imply, they and the proseuchÃ&brvbr;, or oratories, may be included in
the "holy places" here.

[Ezekiel 21:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 21:3</span></span>

righteous . . . wicked--not contradictory of [Eze
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004), [Eze
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#009) and [Gen
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023). Ezekiel here views the mere
outward aspect of the indiscriminate universality of the national
calamity. But really the same captivity to the "righteous" would prove a
blessing as a wholesome discipline, which to the "wicked" would be an
unmitigated punishment. The godly were sealed with a mark ([Eze
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#004)), not for outward exemption from
the common calamity, but as marked for the secret interpositions of
Providence, overruling even evil to their good. The godly were by
comparison so few, that not their salvation but the universality of the
judgment is brought into view here.

[Ezekiel 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 21:4</span></span>

The "sword" did not, literally, slay all; but the judgments of God by
the foe swept through the land "from the south to the north."

[Ezekiel 21:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 21:6</span></span>

with the breaking of thy loins--as one afflicted with pleurisy; or as a
woman, in labor-throes, clasps her loins in pain, and heaves and sighs
till the girdle of the loins is broken by the violent action of the body
([Jer 30:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#006)).

[Ezekiel 21:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 21:7</span></span>

The abrupt sentences and mournful repetitions imply violent emotions.

[Ezekiel 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 21:9</span></span>

sword--namely, of God ([Deu 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#041)).
The Chaldeans are His instrument.

[Ezekiel 21:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">eze 21:10</span></span>

to make a sore slaughter--literally, "that killing it may kill."

glitter--literally, "glitter as the lightning flash": flashing terror
into the foe.

should we . . . make mirth--It is no time for levity when such a
calamity is impending ([Isa 22:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012)).

it contemneth the rod of my son, &c.--The sword has no more respect to
the trivial "rod" or scepter of Judah ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)) than if it were any common
"tree." "Tree" is the image retained from [Eze
20:47](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#047); explained in [Eze
21:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#002). God calls Judah "My son"
(compare [Exo 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022); [Hos
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)). FAIRBAIRN arbitrarily
translates, "Perchance the scepter of My son rejoiceth; it (the sword)
despiseth every tree."

[Ezekiel 21:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 21:11</span></span>

the slayer--the Babylonian king in this case; in general, all the
instruments of God's wrath ([Rev
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#015)).

[Ezekiel 21:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 21:12</span></span>

terrors by reason of the sword, &c.--rather, "they (the princes of
Israel) are delivered up to the sword together with My people"
\[GLASSIUS\].

smite . . . upon . . . thigh--a mark of grief ([Jer
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#019)).

[Ezekiel 21:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">eze 21:13</span></span>

it is a trial--rather, "There is a trial" being made: the sword of the
Lord will subject all to the ordeal. "What, then, if it contemn even the
rod" (scepter of Judah)? Compare as to a similar scourge of unsparing
trial, [Job 9:23](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#023).

it shall be no more--the scepter, that is, the state, must necessarily
then come to an end. Fulfilled in part at the overthrow of Judah by
Nebuchadnezzar, but fully at the time of "Shiloh's" (Messiah's) coming
([Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)), when Judea became a
Roman province.

[Ezekiel 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 21:14</span></span>

smite . . . hands together-- ([Num
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#010)), indicative of the indignant
fury with which God will "smite" the people.

sword . . . doubled the third time--referring to the threefold
calamity:--(1) The taking of Zedekiah (to whom the "rod," or scepter,
may refer); (2) the taking of the city; (3) the removal of all those who
remained with Gedaliah. "Doubled" means "multiplied" or "repeated." The
stroke shall be doubled and even trebled.

of the slain--that is, by which many are slain. As the Hebrew is
singular, FAIRBAIRN makes it refer to the king, "the sword of the great
one that is slain," or "pierced through."

entereth . . . privy chambers-- ([Jer
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#021)). The sword shall overtake them,
not merely in the open battlefield, but in the chambers whither they
flee to hide themselves ([Kg1 20:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#030);
[Kg1 22:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#025)). MAURER translates, "which
besieged them"; FAIRBAIRN, "which penetrates to them." English Version
is more literal.

[Ezekiel 21:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">eze 21:15</span></span>

point--"the whirling glance of the sword" \[FAIRBAIRN\]. "The naked
(bared) sword" \[HENDERSON\].

ruins--literally, "stumbling-blocks." Their own houses and walls shall
be stumbling-blocks in their way, whether they wish to fight or flee.

made bright--made to glitter.

wrapped, &c.--namely, in the hand of him who holds the hilt, or in its
scabbard, that the edge may not be blunt when it is presently drawn
forth to strike. GESENIUS, translates, "sharpened," &c.

[Ezekiel 21:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">eze 21:16</span></span>

Apostrophe to the sword.

Go . . . one way--or, "Concentrate thyself"; "Unite thy forces on the
right hand" \[GROTIUS\]. The sword is commanded to take the nearest
route for Jerusalem, "whither their face was set," whether south or
north ("right hand or left"), according to where the several parts of
the Chaldean host may be.

or other, . . . on the left--rather "set thyself on the left." The verbs
are well-chosen. The main "concentration" of forces was to be on "the
right hand," or south, the part of Judea in which Jerusalem was, and
which lay south in marching from Babylon, whereas the Chaldean forces
advancing on Jerusalem from Egypt, of which Jerusalem was north, were
fewer, and therefore "set thyself" is the verb used.

[Ezekiel 21:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">eze 21:17</span></span>

Jehovah Himself smites His hands together, doing what He had commanded
Ezekiel to do (see on [Eze 21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014)), in
token of His smiting Jerusalem; compare the similar symbolical action
([Kg2 13:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#018)).

cause . . . fury to rest--give it full vent, and so satisfy it ([Eze
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#013)).

[Ezekiel 21:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">eze 21:19</span></span>

two ways--The king coming from Babylon is represented in the graphic
style of Ezekiel as reaching the point where the road branched off in
two ways, one leading by the south, by Tadmor or Palmyra, to Rabbath of
Ammon, east of Jordan; the other by the north, by Riblah in Syria, to
Jerusalem--and hesitating which way to take. Ezekiel is told to "appoint
the two ways" (as in [Eze 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#001)); for
Nebuchadnezzar, though knowing no other control but his own will and
superstition, had really this path "appointed" for him by the all-ruling
God.

out of one land--namely, Babylon.

choose . . . a place--literally "a hand." So it is translated by
FAIRBAIRN, "make a finger-post," namely, at the head of the two ways,
the hand post pointing Nebuchadnezzar to the way to Jerusalem as the way
he should select. But MAURER rightly supports English Version. Ezekiel
is told to "choose the place" where Nebuchadnezzar should do as is
described in [Eze 21:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020); so
entirely does God order by the prophet every particular of place and
time in the movements of the invader.

[Ezekiel 21:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">eze 21:20</span></span>

Rabbath of the Ammonites--distinct from Rabbah in Judah ([Sa2
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026)). Rabbath is put first, as it
was from her that Jerusalem, that doomed city, had borrowed many of her
idols.

to Judah in Jerusalem--instead of simply putting "Jerusalem," to imply
the sword was to come not merely to Judah, but to its people within
Jerusalem, defended though it was; its defenses on which the Jews relied
so much would not keep the foe out.

[Ezekiel 21:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">eze 21:21</span></span>

parting--literally, "mother of the way." As "head of the two ways"
follows, which seems tautology after "parting of the way," HAVERNICK
translates, according to Arabic idiom, "the highway," or principal road.
English Version is not tautology, "head of the two ways" defining more
accurately "parting of the way."

made . . . bright--rather, "shook," from an Arabic root.

arrows--Divination by arrows is here referred to: they were put into a
quiver marked with the names of particular places to be attacked, and
then shaken together; whichever came forth first intimated the one
selected as the first to be attacked \[JEROME\]. The same usage existed
among the Arabs, and is mentioned in the Koran. In the Nineveh
sculptures the king is represented with a cup in his right hand, his
left resting on a bow; also with two arrows in the right, and the bow in
the left, probably practising divination.

images--Hebrew, "teraphim"; household gods, worshipped as family
talismans, to obtain direction as to the future and other blessings.
First mentioned in Mesopotamia, whence Rachel brought them ([Gen
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019), [Gen
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#034)); put away by Jacob ([Gen
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#004)); set up by Micah as his
household gods ([Jdg 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg017.htm#005));
stigmatized as idolatry ([Sa1 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#023),
Hebrew; [Zac 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#002), Margin).

liver--They judged of the success, or failure, of an undertaking by the
healthy, or unhealthy, state of the liver and entrails of a sacrifice.

[Ezekiel 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">eze 21:22</span></span>

Rather, "In his right hand was \[is\] the divination," that is, he holds
up in his right hand the arrow marked with "Jerusalem," to encourage his
army to march for it.

captains--The Margin, "battering-rams," adopted by FAIRBAIRN, is less
appropriate, for "battering-rams" follow presently after \[GROTIUS\].

open the mouth in . . . slaughter--that is, commanding slaughter:
raising the war cry of death. Not as GESENIUS, "to open the mouth with
the war shout."

[Ezekiel 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#023)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">eze 21:23</span></span>

Unto the Jews, though credulous of divinations when in their favor,
Nebuchadnezzar's divination "shall be (seen) as false." This gives the
reason which makes the Jews fancy themselves safe from the Chaldeans,
namely, that they "have sworn" to the latter "oaths" of allegiance,
forgetting that they had violated them ([Eze
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#013), [Eze
17:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#015), [Eze
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#018)).

but he, &c.--Nebuchadnezzar will remember in consulting his idols that
he swore to Zedekiah by them, but that Zedekiah broke the league
\[GROTIUS\]. Rather, God will remember against them ([Rev
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/rev016.htm#019)) their violating their oath
sworn by the true God, whereas Nebuchadnezzar kept his oath sworn by a
false god; [Eze 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024) confirms this.

[Ezekiel 21:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#024)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">eze 21:24</span></span>

Their unfaithfulness to Nebuchadnezzar was a type of their general
unfaithfulness to their covenant God.

with the hand--namely, of the king of Babylon.

[Ezekiel 21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">eze 21:25</span></span>

profane--as having desecrated by idolatry and perjury his office as the
Lord's anointed. HAVERNICK translates, as in [Eze
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014), "slain," that is, not
literally, but virtually; to Ezekiel's idealizing view Zedekiah was the
grand victim "pierced through" by God's sword of judgment, as his sons
were slain before his eyes, which were then put out, and he was led a
captive in chains to Babylon. English Version is better: so GESENIUS
([Ch2 36:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#013); [Jer
52:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#002)).

when iniquity shall have an end-- ([Eze
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029)). When thine iniquity, having
reached its last stage of guilt, shall be put an end to by judgment
([Eze 35:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze035.htm#005)).

[Ezekiel 21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">eze 21:26</span></span>

diadem--rather, "the miter" of the holy priest ([Exo
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#004); [Zac
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005)). His priestly emblem as
representative of the priestly people. Both this and "the crown," the
emblem of the kingdom, were to be removed, until they should be restored
and united in the Mediator, Messiah ([Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002), [Psa
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004); [Zac
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#013)), \[FAIRBAIRN\]. As, however,
King Zedekiah alone, not the high priest also, is referred to in the
context, English Version is supported by GESENIUS.

this shall not be the same--The diadem shall not be as it was
\[ROSENMULLER\]. Nothing shall remain what it was \[FAIRBAIRN\].

exalt . . . low, . . . abase . . . high--not the general truth expressed
([Pro 3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034); [Luk
1:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#052); [Jam
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006); [Pe1
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)); but specially referring to
Messiah and Zedekiah contrasted together. The "tender plant . . . out of
the dry ground" ([Isa 53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)) is to be
"exalted" in the end ([Eze 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027)); the
now "high" representative on David's throne, Zedekiah, is to be
"abased." The outward relations of things shall be made to change places
in just retaliation on the people for having so perverted the moral
relations of things \[HENGSTENBERG\].

[Ezekiel 21:27](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#027)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">eze 21:27</span></span>

Literally, "An overturning, overturning, overturning, will I make it."
The threefold repetition denotes the awful certainty of the event; not
as ROSENMULLER explains, the overthrow of the three, Jehoiakim,
Jeconiah, and Zedekiah; for Zedekiah alone is referred to.

it shall be no more, until he come whose fight it is--strikingly
parallel to [Gen 49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010). Nowhere shall
there be rest or permanence; all things shall be in fluctuation until He
comes who, as the rightful Heir, shall restore the throne of David that
fell with Zedekiah. The Hebrew for "right" is "judgment"; it perhaps
includes, besides the right to rule, the idea of His rule being one in
righteousness ([Psa 72:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#002); [Isa
9:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006); [Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004); [Rev
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#011)). Others (Nebuchadnezzar, &c.),
who held the rule of the earth delegated to them by God, abused it by
unrighteousness, and so forfeited the "right." He both has the truest
"right" to the rule, and exercises it in "right." It is true the tribal
"scepter" continued with Judah "till Shiloh came" ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)); but there was no kingly
scepter till Messiah came, as the spiritual King then ([Joh
18:36-37](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036)); this spiritual kingdom
being about to pass into the literal, personal kingdom over Israel at
His second coming, when, and not before, this prophecy shall have its
exhaustive fulfilment ([Luk 1:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#032);
[Jer 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017); [Jer
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#007); "To thee doth it appertain").

[Ezekiel 21:28](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">eze 21:28</span></span>

Lest Ammon should think to escape because Nebuchadnezzar had taken the
route to Jerusalem, Ezekiel denounces judgment against Ammon, without
the prospect of a restoration such as awaited Israel. [Jer
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#006), it is true, speaks of a
"bringing again of its captivity," but this probably refers to its
spiritual restoration under Messiah; or, if referring to it politically,
must refer to but a partial restoration at the downfall of Babylon under
Cyrus.

their reproach--This constituted a leading feature in their guilt; they
treated with proud contumely the covenant-people after the taking of
Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar ([Eze
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#003), [Eze
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#006); [Zep
2:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#009)), and appropriated Israel's
territory ([Jer 49:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#001); [Amo
1:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#013)).

furbished, to consume--MAURER punctuates thus, "Drawn for the slaughter,
it is furbished to devour ('consume'), to glitter." English Version, "to
consume because of the glittering," means, "to consume by reason of the
lightning, flash-like rapidity with which it falls." Five years after
the fall of Jerusalem, Ammon was destroyed for aiding Ishmael in
usurping the government of Judea against the will of the king of Babylon
([Kg2 25:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#025); [Jer
41:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#015)) \[GROTIUS\].

[Ezekiel 21:29](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#029)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">eze 21:29</span></span>

see vanity . . . divine a lie--Ammon, too, had false diviners who
flattered them with assurances of safety; the only result of which will
be to "bring Ammon upon the necks," &c., that is, to add the Ammonites
to the headless trunks of the slain of Judah, whose bad example Ammon
followed, and "whose day" of visitation for their guilt "is come."

when their iniquity shall have an end--See on [Eze
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#025).

[Ezekiel 21:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#030)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">eze 21:30</span></span>

Shall I cause it to return into his sheath--namely, without first
destroying Ammon. Certainly not ([Jer
47:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006)). Others, as the Margin, less
suitably read it imperatively, "Cause it to return," that is, after it
has done the work appointed to it.

in the land of thy nativity--Ammon was not to be carried away captive as
Judah, but to perish in his own land.

[Ezekiel 21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">eze 21:31</span></span>

blow against thee in, &c.--rather, "blow upon thee with the fire," &c.
Image from smelting metals ([Eze
22:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#020)).

brutish--ferocious.

skilful to destroy--literally, "artificers of destruction"; alluding to
[Isa 54:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#016).

[Ezekiel 21:32](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#032)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">eze 21:32</span></span>

thy blood shall be--that is, shall flow.

be no more remembered--be consigned as a nation to oblivion.

Repetition of the charges in the twentieth chapter only that there they
were stated in an historical review of the past and present; here the
present sins of the nation exclusively are brought forward.
