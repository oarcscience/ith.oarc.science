### [Ezekiel Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001.md)

[Ezekiel 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">eze 6:2</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT. ([Eze
6:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#001).md)

mountains of Israel--that is, of Palestine in general. The mountains are
addressed by personification; implying that the Israelites themselves
are incurable and unworthy of any more appeals; so the prophet sent to
Jeroboam did not deign to address the king, but addressed the altar
([Kg1 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#002).md). The mountains are
specified as being the scene of Jewish idolatries on "the high places"
([Eze 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md); [Lev
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030).md).

[Ezekiel 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">eze 6:3</span></span>

rivers--literally, the "channels" of torrents. Rivers were often the
scene and objects of idolatrous worship.

[Ezekiel 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">eze 6:4</span></span>

images--called so from a Hebrew root, "to wax hot," implying the mad
ardor of Israel after idolatry \[CALVIN\]. Others translate it, "sun
images"; and so in [Eze 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md) (see [Kg2
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md); [Ch2
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#004.md); [Isa
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#008), Margin.md).

cast your slain men before your idols--The foolish objects of their
trust in the day of evil should witness their ruin.

[Ezekiel 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">eze 6:5</span></span>

carcasses . . . before . . . idols--polluting thus with the dead bones
of you, the worshippers, the idols which seemed to you so sacrosanct.

[Ezekiel 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">eze 6:6</span></span>

your works--not gods, as you supposed, but the mere work of men's hands
([Isa 40:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018).md).

[Ezekiel 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">eze 6:7</span></span>

ye shall know that I am the Lord--and not your idols, lords. Ye shall
know Me as the all-powerful Punisher of sin.

[Ezekiel 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">eze 6:8</span></span>

Mitigation of the extreme severity of their punishment; still their life
shall be a wretched one, and linked with exile ([Eze
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#002.md), [Eze
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze005.htm#012.md); [Eze
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#016.md); [Eze
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md); [Jer
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028).md).

[Ezekiel 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">eze 6:9</span></span>

they that escape of you shall remember me--The object of God's
chastisements shall at last be effected by working in them true
contrition. This partially took place in the complete eradication of
idolatry from the Jews ever since the Babylonian captivity. But they
have yet to repent of their crowning sin, the crucifixion of Messiah;
their full repentance is therefore future, after the ordeal of trials
for many centuries, ending with that foretold in [Zac
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009.md); [Zac
13:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#008.md); [Zac
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#001.md), [Zac
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#011.md). "They shall remember me in far
countries" ([Eze 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md); [Deu
30:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001).md).

I am broken with their whorish heart--FAIRBAIRN translates, actively, "I
will break" their whorish heart; English Version is better. In their
exile they shall remember how long I bore with them, but was at last
compelled to punish, after I was "broken" (My long-suffering wearied
out) by their desperate ([Num 15:39](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#039).md)
spiritual whorishness \[CALVIN\], ([Psa
78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md); [Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013.md); [Isa
43:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#024.md); [Isa
63:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#010).md).

loathe themselves-- ([Lev 26:39-45](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md);
[Job 42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006).md). They shall not wait for
men to condemn them but shall condemn themselves ([Eze
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#043.md); [Eze
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#031.md); [Job
42:6](../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006.md); [Co1
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031).md).

[Ezekiel 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">eze 6:11</span></span>

Gesticulations vividly setting before the hearers the greatness of the
calamity about to be inflicted. In indignation at the abominations of
Israel extend thine hand towards Judea, as if about to "strike," and
"stamp," shaking off the dust with thy foot, in token of how God shall
"stretch out His hand upon them," and tread them down ([Eze
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md); [Eze
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#014).md).

[Ezekiel 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">eze 6:12</span></span>

He that is far off--namely, from the foe; those who in a distant exile
fear no evil.

he that remaineth--he that is left in the city; not carried away into
captivity, nor having escaped into the country. Distinct from "he that
is near," namely, those outside the city who are within reach of "the
sword" of the foe, and so fall by it; not by "famine," as those left in
the city.

[Ezekiel 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">eze 6:14</span></span>

Diblath--another form of Diblathaim, a city in Moab ([Num
33:46](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#046.md); [Jer
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#022).md), near which, east and south of
the Dead Sea, was the wilderness of Arabia-Deserta.
