### [Acts Chapter 7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001.md)

[Acts 7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">act 7:2</span></span>

DEFENSE AND MARTYRDOM OF STEPHEN. (Acts 7:1-60)

The God of glory--A magnificent appellation, fitted at the very outset
to rivet the devout attention of his audience; denoting not that visible
glory which attended many of the divine manifestations, but the glory of
those manifestations themselves, of which this was regarded by every Jew
as the fundamental one. It is the glory of absolutely free grace.

appeared unto our father Abraham before he dwelt in Charran, and said,
&c.--Though this first call is not expressly recorded in Genesis, it is
clearly implied in [Gen 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007.md) and [Neh
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#007.md); and the Jewish writers speak the
same language.

[Acts 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">act 7:4</span></span>

when his father was dead, he removed into this land--Though Abraham was
in Canaan before Terah's death, his settlement in it as the land of
promise is here said to be after it, as being in no way dependent on the
family movement, but a transaction purely between Jehovah and Abraham
himself.

[Acts 7:6](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">act 7:6</span></span>

four hundred years--using round numbers, as in [Gen
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md), [Gen
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md) (see on [Gal
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#017).md).

[Acts 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">act 7:7</span></span>

after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place--Here the
promise to Abraham ([Gen 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016).md), and
that to Moses ([Exo 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012).md), are
combined; Stephen's object being merely to give a rapid summary of the
leading facts.

[Acts 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">act 7:8</span></span>

the covenant of circumcision--that is, the covenant of which
circumcision was the token.

and so--that is, according to the terms of this covenant, on which Paul
reasons (Gal. 3:1-26).

the twelve patriarchs--so called as the founders of the twelve tribes of
Israel.

[Acts 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">act 7:9</span></span>

the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt, but God was
with him--Here Stephen gives his first example of Israel's opposition to
God's purposes, in spite of which and by means of which those purposes
were accomplished.

[Acts 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">act 7:14</span></span>

threescore and fifteen souls--according to the Septuagint version of
[Gen 46:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#027.md), which Stephen follows,
including the five children and grandchildren of Joseph's two sons.

[Acts 7:17](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">act 7:17</span></span>

But when--rather, "as."

the time of the promise--that is, for its fulfilment.

the people grew and multiplied in Egypt--For more than two hundred years
they amounted to no more than seventy-five souls; how prodigious, then,
must have been their multiplication during the latter two centuries,
when six hundred thousand men, fit for war, besides women and children,
left Egypt!

[Acts 7:20](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">act 7:20</span></span>

In which time--of deepest depression.

Moses was born--the destined deliverer.

exceeding fair--literally, "fair to God" (Margin), or, perhaps, divinely
"fair" (see on [Heb 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#023).md).

[Acts 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">act 7:22</span></span>

mighty in words--Though defective in utterance ([Exo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010).md); his recorded speeches fully
bear out what is here said.

and deeds--referring probably to unrecorded circumstances in his early
life. If we are to believe JOSEPHUS, his ability was acknowledged ere he
left Egypt.

[Acts 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">act 7:23</span></span>

In [Act 7:23](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#023.md), [Act
7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md), [Act
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#036.md), the life of Moses is represented
as embracing three periods, of forty years each; the Jewish writers say
the same; and though this is not expressly stated in the Old Testament,
his age at death, one hundred twenty years ([Deu
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007).md), agrees with it.

it came into his heart to visit his brethren--his heart yearning with
love to them as God's chosen people, and heaving with the consciousness
of a divine vocation to set them free.

[Acts 7:24](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">act 7:24</span></span>

avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian--going farther in
the heat of his indignation than he probably intended.

[Acts 7:25](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">act 7:25</span></span>

For he supposed his brethren would have understood, &c.--and perhaps
imagined this a suitable occasion for rousing and rallying them under
him as their leader; thus anticipating his work, and so running unsent.

but they understood not--Reckoning on a spirit in them congenial with
his own, he had the mortification to find it far otherwise. This
furnishes to Stephen another example of Israel's slowness to apprehend
and fall in with the divine purposes of love.

[Acts 7:26](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">act 7:26</span></span>

next day he showed himself unto them as they strove--Here, not an
Israelite and an Egyptian, but two parties in Israel itself, are in
collision with each other; Moses, grieved at the spectacle, interposes
as a mediator; but his interference, as unauthorized, is resented by the
party in the wrong, whom Stephen identifies with the mass of the nation
([Act 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035).md), just as Messiah's own
interposition had been spurned.

[Acts 7:28](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">act 7:28</span></span>

Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?--Moses had
thought the deed unseen ([Exo 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012).md),
but it now appeared he was mistaken.

[Acts 7:29](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">act 7:29</span></span>

Then fled Moses, &c.--for "when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to
slay Moses" ([Exo 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015).md).

[Acts 7:30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">act 7:30</span></span>

an angel of the Lord--rather, "the Angel of the Covenant," who
immediately calls Himself JEHOVAH (Compare [Act
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038).md).

[Acts 7:35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">act 7:35</span></span>

This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge,
&c.--Here, again, "the stone which the builders refused is made the head
of the corner" ([Psa 118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022).md).

[Acts 7:37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">act 7:37</span></span>

This is that Moses which said . . . A prophet . . . him shall ye
hear--This is quoted to remind his Moses-worshipping audience of the
grand testimony of their faithful lawgiver, that he himself was not the
last and proper object of the Church's faith, but only a humble
precursor and small model of Him to whom their absolute submission was
due.

[Acts 7:38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">act 7:38</span></span>

in the church--the collective body of God's chosen people; hence used to
denote the whole body of the faithful under the Gospel, or particular
sections of them.

This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel . .
. and with our fathers--alike near to the Angel of the Covenant, from
whom he received all the institutions of the ancient economy, and to the
people, to whom he faithfully reported the living oracles and among whom
he set up the prescribed institutions. By this high testimony to Moses,
Stephen rebuts the main charge for which he was on trial.

[Acts 7:39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">act 7:39</span></span>

To whom our fathers would not obey, &c.--Here he shows that the deepest
dishonor done to Moses came from the nation that now professed the
greatest jealousy for his honor.

in their hearts turned back . . . into Egypt--"In this Stephen would
have his hearers read the downward career on which they were themselves
entering."

[Acts 7:42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">act 7:42</span></span>

gave them up--judicially.

as . . . written in the book of the prophets--the twelve minor prophets,
reckoned as one: the passage is from [Amo
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md).

have ye offered to me . . . sacrifices?--The answer is, Yes, but as if
ye did it not; for "neither did ye offer to Me only, nor always, nor
with a perfect and willing heart" \[BENGEL\].

[Acts 7:43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">act 7:43</span></span>

Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Molech, &c.--Two kinds of idolatry are
charged upon the Israelites: that of the golden calf and that of the
heavenly bodies; Molech and Remphan being deities, representing
apparently the divine powers ascribed to nature, under different
aspects.

carry you beyond Babylon--the well-known region of the captivity of
Judah; while "Damascus" is used by the prophet ([Amo
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#027).md), whither the ten tribes were
carried.

[Acts 7:44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">act 7:44</span></span>

Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness--which
aggravated the guilt of that idolatry in which they indulged, with the
tokens of the divine presence constantly in the midst of them.

[Acts 7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">act 7:45</span></span>

which . . . our fathers that came after--rather, "having received it by
succession" (Margin), that is, the custody of the tabernacle from their
ancestors.

brought in with Jesus--or Joshua.

into the possession--rather, "at the taking possession of \[the
territory of\] the Gentiles."

unto the days of David--for till then Jerusalem continued in the hands
of the Jebusites. But Stephen's object in mentioning David is to hasten
from the tabernacle which he set up, to the temple which his son built,
in Jerusalem; and this only to show, from their own Scripture ([Isa
66:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001).md), that even that temple,
magnificent though it was, was not the proper resting-place of Jehovah
upon earth; as his audience and the nations had all along been prone to
imagine. (What that resting-place was, even "the contrite heart, that
trembleth at God's word," he leaves to be gathered from the prophet
referred to).

[Acts 7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">act 7:51</span></span>

Ye stiffnecked . . . ye do always resist the Holy Ghost, &c.--It has
been thought that symptoms of impatience and irritation in the audience
induced Stephen to cut short his historical sketch. But as little
farther light could have been thrown upon Israel's obstinacy from
subsequent periods of the national history on the testimony of their own
Scriptures, we should view this as the summing up, the brief import of
the whole Israelitish history--grossness of heart, spiritual deafness,
continuous resistance of the Holy Ghost, down to the very council before
whom Stephen was pleading.

[Acts 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">act 7:52</span></span>

Which of, &c.--Deadly hostility to the messengers of God, whose high
office it was to tell of "the Righteous One," that well-known prophetic
title of Messiah ([Isa 53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011.md); [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006), &c..md), and this consummated by
the betrayal and murder of Messiah Himself, on the part of those now
sitting in judgment on the speaker, are the still darker features of the
national character depicted in these withering words.

[Acts 7:53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">act 7:53</span></span>

Who have received the law by the disposition--"at the appointment" or
"ordination," that is, by the ministry.

of angels, and have not kept it--This closing word is designed to shut
up those idolizers of the law under the guilt of high disobedience to
it, aggravated by the august manner in which they had received it.

[Acts 7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_054">act 7:54</span></span>

When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, &c.--If they
could have answered him, how different would have been their temper of
mind!

[Acts 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">act 7:55</span></span>

But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven,
and saw the glory of God--You who can transfer to canvas such scenes as
these, in which the rage of hell grins horribly from men, as they sit
condemned by a frail prisoner of their own, and see heaven beaming from
his countenance and opening full upon his view--I envy you, for I find
no words to paint what, in the majesty of the divine text, is here so
simply told. "But how could Stephen, in the council-chamber, see heaven
at all? I suppose this question never occurred but to critics of narrow
soul, one of whom \[MEYER\] conjectures that he saw it through the
window! and another, of better mould, that the scene lay in one of the
courts of the temple" \[ALFORD\]. As the sight was witnessed by Stephen
alone, the opened heavens are to be viewed as revealed to his bright
beaming spirit.

and Jesus standing on the right hand of God--Why "standing," and not
sitting, the posture in which the glorified Saviour is elsewhere
represented? Clearly, to express the eager interest with which He
watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber, and the full
tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged in pouring into
the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in radiance from his
very countenance.

[Acts 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">act 7:56</span></span>

I see . . . the Son of man standing, &c.--This is the only time that our
Lord is by human lips called THE SON OF MAN after His ascension ([Rev
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md); [Rev
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#014) are not instances.md). And why
here? Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, speaking now not of himself at
all ([Act 7:55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055).md), but entirely by the
Spirit, is led to repeat the very words in which Jesus Himself, before
this same council, had foretold His glorification ([Mat
26:64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064).md), assuring them that that
exaltation of the SON OF MAN which they should hereafter witness to
their dismay, was already begun and actual \[ALFORD\].

[Acts 7:57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_057">act 7:57</span></span>

Then they cried out . . . and ran upon him with one accord--To men of
their mould and in their temper, Stephen's last seraphic words could but
bring matters to extremities, though that only revealed the diabolical
spirit which they breathed.

[Acts 7:58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">act 7:58</span></span>

cast him out of the city--according to [Lev
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#014.md); [Num
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#035.md); [Kg1
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#013.md); and see [Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012.md).

and stoned--"proceeded to stone" him. The actual stoning is recorded in
[Act 7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md).

and the witnesses--whose hands were to be first upon the criminal ([Deu
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#007).md).

laid down their clothes--their loose outer garments, to have them taken
charge of.

at a young man's feet whose name was Saul--How thrilling is this our
first introduction to one to whom Christianity--whether as developed in
the New Testament or as established in the world--owes more perhaps than
to all the other apostles together! Here he is, having perhaps already a
seat in the Sanhedrim, some thirty years of age, in the thick of this
tumultuous murder of a distinguished witness for Christ, not only
"consenting unto his death" ([Act
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001).md), but doing his own part of the
dark deed.

[Acts 7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_059">act 7:59</span></span>

calling upon God and saying, Lord Jesus, &c.--An unhappy supplement of
our translators is the word "God" here; as if, while addressing the Son,
he was really calling upon the Father. The sense is perfectly clear
without any supplement at all--"calling upon \[invoking\] and saying,
Lord Jesus"; Christ being the Person directly invoked and addressed by
name (compare [Act 9:14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014).md). Even
GROTIUS, DE WETTE, MEYER, &c., admit this, adding several other examples
of direct prayer to Christ; and PLINY, in his well-known letter to the
Emperor Trajan (A.D. 110 or 111), says it was part of the regular
Christian service to sing, in alternate strains, a hymn to Christ as
God.

Lord Jesus, receive my spirit--In presenting to Jesus the identical
prayer which He Himself had on the cross offered to His Father, Stephen
renders to his glorified Lord absolute divine worship, in the most
sublime form, and at the most solemn moment of his life. In this
commitment of his spirit to Jesus, Paul afterwards followed his
footsteps with a calm, exultant confidence that with Him it was safe for
eternity ([Ti2 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012).md).

[Acts 7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">act 7:60</span></span>

cried with a loud voice--with something of the gathered energy of his
dying Lord (see on [Joh 19:16-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#016).md).

Lord--that is, JESUS, beyond doubt, whom he had just before addressed as
Lord.

lay not this sin to their charge--Comparing this with nearly the same
prayer of his dying Lord, it will be seen how very richly this martyr of
Jesus had drunk into his Master's spirit, in its divinest form.

he fell asleep--never said of the death of Christ. (See on [Th1
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#014).md). How bright the record of this
first martyrdom for Christ, amidst all the darkness of its perpetrators;
and how many have been cheered by it to like faithfulness even unto
death!
