### [Isaiah Chapter 5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

[Isaiah 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 5:1</span></span>

PARABLE OF JEHOVAH'S VINEYARD. (Isa. 5:1-30)

to--rather, "concerning" \[GESENIUS\], that is, in the person of My
beloved, as His representative \[VITRINGA\]. Isaiah gives a hint of the
distinction and yet unity of the Divine Persons (compare He with I, [Isa
5:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002).md).

of my beloved--inspired by Him; or else, a tender song \[CASTALIO\]. By
a slight change of reading "a song of His love" \[HOUBIGANT\]. "The
Beloved" is Jehovah, the Second Person, the "Angel" of God the Father,
not in His character as incarnate Messiah, but as God of the Jews ([Exo
23:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#020.md); [Exo
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md); [Exo
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#014).md).

vineyard-- ([Isa 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#014.md); [Psa
80:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#008), &c..md). The Jewish
covenant-people, separated from the nations for His glory, as the object
of His peculiar care ([Mat 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#001.md); [Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md). Jesus Christ in the "vineyard"
of the New Testament Church is the same as the Old Testament Angel of
the Jewish covenant.

fruitful hill--literally, "a horn" ("peak," as the Swiss shreckhorn) of
the son of oil; poetically, for very fruitful. Suggestive of isolation,
security, and a sunny aspect. Isaiah alludes plainly to the Song of
Solomon ([Sol 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#003.md); [Sol
8:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#011).md), in the words "His vineyard"
and "my Beloved" (compare [Isa 26:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#020.md);
[Isa 61:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#010.md), with [Sol
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004.md); [Sol
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#010).md). The transition from "branch"
([Isa 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002).md) to "vineyard" here is not
unnatural.

[Isaiah 5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 5:2</span></span>

fenced--rather, "digged and trenched" the ground to prepare it for
planting the vines \[MAURER\].

choicest vine--Hebrew, sorek; called still in Morocco, serki; the grapes
had scarcely perceptible seeds; the Persian kishmish or bedana, that is,
"without seed" ([Gen 49:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#011).md).

tower--to watch the vineyard against the depredations of man or beast,
and for the use of the owner ([Mat
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#033).md).

wine-press--including the wine-fat; both hewn, for coolness, out of the
rocky undersoil of the vineyard.

wild grapes--The Hebrew expresses offensive putrefaction, answering to
the corrupt state of the Jews. Fetid fruit of the wild vine \[MAURER\],
instead of "choicest" grapes. Of the poisonous monk's hood \[GESENIUS\].
The Arabs call the fruit of the nightshade "wolf grapes" ([Deu
32:32-33](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#032.md); [Kg2
4:39-41](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#039).md). JEROME tries to specify the
details of the parable; the "fence," angels; the "stones gathered out,"
idols; the "tower," the "temple in the midst" of Judea; the
"wine-press," the altar.

[Isaiah 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 5:3</span></span>

And now, &c.--appeal of God to themselves, as in [Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Mic
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md). So Jesus Christ, in [Mat
21:40-41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#040.md), alluding in the very form of
expression to this, makes them pass sentence on themselves. God condemns
sinners "out of their own mouth" ([Deu
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#006.md); [Job
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#006.md); [Luk
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#022.md); [Rom
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004).md).

[Isaiah 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 5:4</span></span>

God has done all that could be done for the salvation of sinners,
consistently with His justice and goodness. The God of nature is, as it
were, amazed at the unnatural fruit of so well-cared a vineyard.

[Isaiah 5:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 5:5</span></span>

go to--that is, attend to me.

hedge . . . wall--It had both; a proof of the care of the owner. But now
it shall be trodden down by wild beasts (enemies) ([Psa
80:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 5:6</span></span>

I will . . . command--The parable is partly dropped and Jehovah, as in
[Isa 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md), is implied to be the Owner:
for He alone, not an ordinary husbandman ([Mat
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md); [Luk
17:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#022).md), could give such a "command."

no rain--antitypically, the heaven-sent teachings of the prophets ([Amo
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#011).md). Not accomplished in the
Babylonish captivity; for Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, and
Zechariah prophesied during or after it. But in gospel times.

[Isaiah 5:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 5:7</span></span>

Isaiah here applies the parable. It is no mere human owner, nor a
literal vineyard that is meant.

vineyard of the Lord--His only one ([Exo
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md); [Amo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#002).md).

pleasant--"the plant of his delight"; just as the husbandman was at
pains to select the sorek, or "choicest vine" ([Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002).md); so God's election of the Jews.

judgment--justice. The play upon words is striking in the Hebrew, He
looked for mishpat, but behold mispat ("bloodshed"); for tsedaqua, but
behold tseaqua (the cry that attends anarchy, covetousness, and
dissipation, [Isa 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md), [Isa
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md); compare the cry of the rabble
by which justice was overborne in the case of Jesus Christ, [Mat
27:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#023).md).

[Isaiah 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 5:8</span></span>

SIX DISTINCT WOES AGAINST CRIMES. (Isa. 5:8-23)

([Lev 25:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#013.md); [Mic
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#002).md). The jubilee restoration of
possessions was intended as a guard against avarice.

till there be no place--left for any one else.

that they may be--rather, and ye be.

the earth--the land.

[Isaiah 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 5:9</span></span>

In mine ears . . . the Lord--namely, has revealed it, as in [Isa
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#014.md).

desolate--literally, "a desolation," namely, on account of the national
sins.

great and fair--houses.

[Isaiah 5:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 5:10</span></span>

acres--literally, "yokes"; as much as one yoke of oxen could plow in a
day.

one--only.

bath--of wine; seven and a half gallons.

homer . . . ephah--Eight bushels of seed would yield only three pecks of
produce ([Eze 45:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze045.htm#011).md). The ephah and
bath, one-tenth of an homer.

[Isaiah 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 5:11</span></span>

Second Woe--against intemperance.

early--when it was regarded especially shameful to drink ([Act
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md); [Th1
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007).md). Banquets for revelry began
earlier than usual ([Ecc 10:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/ecc010.htm#016).md).

strong drink--Hebrew, sichar, implying intoxication.

continue--drinking all day till evening.

[Isaiah 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 5:12</span></span>

Music was common at ancient feasts ([Isa
24:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#008.md); [Amo
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005).md).

viol--an instrument with twelve strings \[JOSEPHUS, Antiquities, 8.10\].

tabret--Hebrew, toph, from the use of which in drowning the cries of
children sacrificed to Moloch, Tophet received its name. Arabic, duf. A
kettle drum, or tambourine.

pipe--flute or flageolet: from a Hebrew root "to bore through"; or else,
"to dance" (compare [Job 21:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#011).md).

regard not . . . Lord--a frequent effect of feasting ([Job
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md); [Psa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#005).md).

work . . . operation--in punishing the guilty ([Isa
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md); [Isa
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#012).md).

[Isaiah 5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">isa 5:13</span></span>

are gone--The prophet sees the future as if it were before his eyes.

no knowledge--because of their foolish recklessness ([Isa
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012.md); [Isa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#003.md); [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md); [Luk
19:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#044).md).

famished--awful contrast to their luxurious feasts ([Isa
5:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md).

multitude--plebeians in contradistinction to the "honorable men," or
nobles.

thirst-- ([Psa 107:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#004).md). Contrast to
their drinking ([Isa 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#011).md). In their
deportation and exile, they shall hunger and thirst.

[Isaiah 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">isa 5:14</span></span>

hell--the grave; Hebrew, sheol; Greek, hades; "the unseen world of
spirits." Not here, "the place of torment." Poetically, it is
represented as enlarging itself immensely, in order to receive the
countless hosts of Jews, which should perish ([Num
16:30](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#030).md).

their--that is, of the Jewish people.

he that rejoiceth--the drunken reveller in Jerusalem.

[Isaiah 5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">isa 5:15</span></span>

(Compare [Isa 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md), [Isa
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#011.md), [Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017).md). All ranks, "mean" and "mighty"
alike; so "honorable" and "multitude" ([Isa
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#013).md).

[Isaiah 5:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">isa 5:16</span></span>

God shall be "exalted" in man's view, because of His manifestation of
His "justice" in punishing the guilty.

sanctified--regarded as holy by reason of His "righteous" dealings.

[Isaiah 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">isa 5:17</span></span>

after their manner--literally, "according to their own word," that is,
at will. Otherwise, as in their own pasture \[GESENIUS\]: so the Hebrew
in [Mic 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#012.md). The lands of the Scenite
tent dwellers ([Jer 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#007).md). Arab
shepherds in the neighborhood shall roam at large, the whole of Judea
being so desolate as to become a vast pasturage.

waste . . . fat ones--the deserted lands of the rich ("fat," [Psa
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#029).md), then gone into captivity;
"strangers," that is, nomad tribes shall make their flocks to feed on
\[MAURER\]. Figuratively, "the lambs" are the pious, "the fat ones" the
impious. So tender disciples of Jesus Christ ([Joh
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015).md) are called "lambs"; being meek,
harmless, poor, and persecuted. Compare [Eze
39:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze039.htm#018.md), where the fatlings are the rich
and great ([Co1 1:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026).md). The
"strangers" are in this view the "other sheep not of the" the Jewish
"fold" ([Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016).md), the Gentiles whom
Jesus Christ shall "bring" to be partakers of the rich privileges ([Rom
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017).md) which the Jews ("fat ones,"
[Eze 34:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#016).md) fell from. Thus "after
their (own) manner" will express that the Christian Church should
worship God in freedom, released from legal bondage ([Joh
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023.md); [Gal
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001).md).

[Isaiah 5:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">isa 5:18</span></span>

Third Woe--against obstinate perseverance in sin, as if they wished to
provoke divine judgments.

iniquity--guilt, incurring punishment \[MAURER\].

cords, &c.--cart-rope--Rabbins say, "An evil inclination is at first
like a fine hair-string, but the finishing like a cart-rope." The
antithesis is between the slender cords of sophistry, like the spider's
web ([Isa 59:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#005.md); [Job
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014).md), with which one sin draws on
another, until they at last bind themselves with great guilt as with a
cart-rope. They strain every nerve in sin.

vanity--wickedness.

sin--substantive, not a verb: they draw on themselves "sin" and its
penalty recklessly.

[Isaiah 5:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">isa 5:19</span></span>

work--vengeance ([Isa 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#012).md). Language
of defiance to God. So Lamech's boast of impunity ([Gen
4:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#023.md); compare [Jer
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#015.md); [Pe2
3:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#003).md).

counsel--God's threatened purpose to punish.

[Isaiah 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">isa 5:20</span></span>

Fourth Woe--against those who confound the distinctions of right and
wrong (compare [Rom 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028).md),
"reprobate," Greek, "undiscriminating: the moral perception darkened."

bitter . . . sweet--sin is bitter ([Jer
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#019.md); [Jer
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md); [Act
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023.md); [Heb
12:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015).md); though it seem sweet for a
time ([Pro 9:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#017).md). Religion is sweet
([Psa 119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103).md).

[Isaiah 5:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">isa 5:21</span></span>

Fifth Woe--against those who were so "wise in their own eyes" as to
think they knew better than the prophet, and therefore rejected his
warnings ([Isa 29:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014).md).

[Isaiah 5:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">isa 5:22</span></span>

Sixth Woe--against corrupt judges, who, "mighty" in drinking "wine" (a
boast still not uncommon), if not in defending their country, obtain the
means of self-indulgence by taking bribes ("reward"). The two verses are
closely joined \[MAURER\].

mingle strong drink--not with water, but spices to make it intoxicating
([Pro 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#002.md), [Pro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#005.md); [Sol
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/sol008.htm#002).md).

take away the righteousness--set aside the just claims of those having a
righteous cause.

[Isaiah 5:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">isa 5:24</span></span>

Literally, "tongue of fire eateth" ([Act
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#003).md).

flame consumeth the chaff--rather, withered grass falleth before the
flame ([Mat 3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012).md).

root . . . blossom--entire decay, both the hidden source and outward
manifestations of prosperity, perishing ([Job
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#016.md); [Mal
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#001).md).

cast away . . . law--in its spirit, while retaining the letter.

[Isaiah 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">isa 5:25</span></span>

anger . . . kindled-- ([Kg2 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#013.md),
[Kg2 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2022.htm#017).md).

hills . . . tremble--This probably fixes the date of this chapter, as it
refers to the earthquake in the days of Uzziah ([Amo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo001.htm#001.md); [Zac
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#005).md). The earth trembled as if
conscious of the presence of God ([Jer
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#024.md); [Hab
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#006).md).

torn--rather, were as dung ([Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010).md).

For all this, &c.--This burden of the prophet's strains, with dirge-like
monotony, is repeated at [Isa 9:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#012.md),
[Isa 9:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#017.md), [Isa
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#021.md); [Isa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#004.md). With all the past calamities,
still heavier judgments are impending; which he specifies in the rest of
the chapter ([Lev 26:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#014), &c..md).

[Isaiah 5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">isa 5:26</span></span>

lift . . . ensign--to call together the hostile nations to execute His
judgments on Judea ([Isa 10:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md); [Isa
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001).md). But for mercy to it, in [Isa
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Isa
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa018.htm#003.md).

hiss-- ([Isa 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018).md). Bees were drawn
out of their hives by the sound of a flute, or hissing, or whistling
([Zac 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#008).md). God will collect the
nations round Judea like bees ([Deu
1:44](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#044.md); [Psa
118:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#012).md).

end of the earth--the widely distant subject races of which the Assyrian
army was made up ([Isa 22:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#006).md). The
ulterior fulfilment took place in the siege under Roman Titus. Compare
"end of the earth" ([Deu 28:49](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049), &c..md).
So the pronoun is singular in the Hebrew, for "them," "their," "whose"
(him, his, &c.), [Isa 5:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md);
referring to some particular nation and person \[HORSLEY\].

[Isaiah 5:27](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">isa 5:27</span></span>

weary--with long marches ([Deu 25:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#018).md).

none . . . slumber--requiring no rest.

girdle--with which the ancient loose robes used to be girded for action.
Ever ready for march or battle.

nor the latchet . . . broken--The soles were attached to the feet, not
by upper leather as with us, but by straps. So securely clad that not
even a strap of their sandals gives way, so as to impede their march.

[Isaiah 5:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">isa 5:28</span></span>

bent--ready for battle.

hoofs . . . flint--The ancients did not shoe their horses: hence the
value of hard hoofs for long marches.

wheels--of their chariots. The Assyrian army abounded in cavalry and

unsettled state of things), and darkness arises in, &c. \[MAURER\].

heavens--literally, "clouds," that is, its sky is rather "clouds" than
sky. Otherwise from a different Hebrew root, "in its destruction" or
ruins. HORSLEY takes "sea . . . look unto the land" as a new image taken
from mariners in a coasting vessel (such as all ancient vessels were),
looking for the nearest land, which the darkness of the storm conceals,
so that darkness and distress alone may be said to be visible.

Isaiah is outside, near the altar in front of the temple. The doors are
supposed to open, and the veil hiding the Holy of Holies to be
withdrawn, unfolding to his view a vision of God represented as an
Eastern monarch, attended by seraphim as His ministers of state ([Kg1
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#019).md), and with a robe and flowing
train (a badge of dignity in the East), which filled the temple. This
assertion that he had seen God was, according to tradition (not
sanctioned by [Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md); see
Introduction), the pretext for sawing him asunder in Manasseh's reign
([Heb 11:37](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#037).md). Visions often occur in
the other prophets: in Isaiah there is only this one, and it is marked
by characteristic clearness and simplicity.
