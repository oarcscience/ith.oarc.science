### [Judges Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

[Judges 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jdg 1:1</span></span>

THE ACTS OF JUDAH AND SIMEON. ([Jdg
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#001).md)

Now after the death of Joshua--probably not a long period, for the
Canaanites seem to have taken advantage of that event to attempt
recovering their lost position, and the Israelites were obliged to renew
the war.

the children of Israel asked the Lord--The divine counsel on this, as on
other occasions, was sought by Urim and Thummim, by applying to the high
priest, who, according to JOSEPHUS, was Phinehas.

saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first--The elders,
who exercised the government in their respective tribes, judged rightly,
that in entering upon an important expedition, they should have a leader
nominated by divine appointment; and in consulting the oracle, they
adopted a prudent course, whether the object of their inquiry related to
the choice of an individual commander, or to the honor of precedency
among the tribes.

[Judges 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jdg 1:2</span></span>

the Lord said, Judah shall go up--The predicted pre-eminence ([Gen
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#008).md) was thus conferred upon Judah by
divine direction, and its appointment to take the lead in the ensuing
hostilities was of great importance, as the measure of success by which
its arms were crowned, would animate the other tribes to make similar
attempts against the Canaanites within their respective territories.

I have delivered the land into his hand--not the whole country, but the
district assigned for his inheritance.

[Judges 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jdg 1:3</span></span>

Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me . . ., that we may
fight against the Canaanites--Being conterminous tribes ([Jos
19:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001).md), they had a common interest,
and were naturally associated in this enterprise.

[Judges 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jdg 1:5</span></span>

ADONI-BEZEK JUSTLY REQUITED. (Jdg. 1:4-21)

Bezek--This place lay within the domain of Judah, about twelve miles
south of Jerusalem.

found Adoni-bezek--that is, "lord of Bezek"--he was "found," that is,
surprised and routed in a pitched battle, whence he fled; but being
taken prisoner, he was treated with a severity unusual among the
Israelites, for they "cut off his thumbs and great toes." Barbarities of
various kinds were commonly practised on prisoners of war in ancient
times, and the object of this particular mutilation of the hands and
feet was to disable them for military service ever after. The infliction
of such a horrid cruelty on this Canaanite chief would have been a foul
stain on the character of the Israelites if there were not reason for
believing it was done by them as an act of retributive justice, and as
such it was regarded by Adoni-bezek himself, whose conscience read his
atrocious crimes in their punishment.

[Judges 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jdg 1:7</span></span>

Threescore and ten kings--So great a number will not appear strange,
when it is considered that anciently every ruler of a city or large town
was called a king. It is not improbable that in that southern region of
Canaan, there might, in earlier times, have been even more till a
turbulent chief like Adoni-bezek devoured them in his insatiable
ambition.

[Judges 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jdg 1:8</span></span>

Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
it--The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early
incidents in the war of invasion ([Jos
15:63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#063).md), is here noticed to account for
its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought
Adoni-bezek thither \[[Jdg 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#007.md)\], in
order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire
terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other
unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance \[[Jdg
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#009.md)\]. The story of Caleb's
acquisition of Hebron is here repeated ([Jos
15:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016).md). \[See on [Jos
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#016.md).\]

[Judges 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">jdg 1:16</span></span>

the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the
city of palm trees with the children of Judah--called "the Kenite," as
probably descended from the people of that name ([Num
24:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#021).md). If he might not himself,
his posterity did accept the invitation of Moses ([Num
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#032).md) to accompany the Israelites to
Canaan. Their first encampment was in the "city of palm trees"--not
Jericho, of course, which was utterly destroyed, but the surrounding
district, perhaps En-gedi, in early times called Hazezon-tamar ([Gen
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007).md), from the palm-grove which
sheltered it. Thence they removed for some unknown cause, and
associating themselves with Judah, joined in an expedition against Arad,
in the southern part of Canaan ([Num
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#001).md). On the conquest of that
district, some of this pastoral people pitched their tents there, while
others migrated to the north ([Jdg
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#017).md).

[Judges 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">jdg 1:17</span></span>

And Judah went with Simeon his brother--The course of the narrative is
here resumed from [Jdg 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#009.md), and an
account given of Judah returning the services of Simeon ([Jdg
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#003).md), by aiding in the prosecution of
the war within the neighboring tribes.

slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath--or Zephathah ([Ch2
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#010).md), a valley lying in the southern
portion of Canaan.

Hormah--destroyed in fulfilment of an early vow of the Israelites (see
on [Num 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#002).md). The confederate tribes,
pursuing their incursions in that quarter, came successively to Gaza,
Askelon, and Ekron, which they took. But the Philistines seem soon to
have regained possession of these cities.

[Judges 1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">jdg 1:19</span></span>

the Lord was with Judah; . . . but they could not drive out the
inhabitants of the valley--The war was of the Lord, whose omnipotent aid
would have ensured their success in every encounter, whether on the
mountains or the plains, with foot soldiers or cavalry. It was distrust,
the want of a simple and firm reliance on the promise of God, that made
them afraid of the iron chariots (see on [Jos
11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#004).md).

[Judges 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">jdg 1:21</span></span>

the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited
Jerusalem--Judah had expelled the people from their part of Jerusalem
([Jdg 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#008).md). The border of the two
tribes ran through the city--Israelites and natives must have been
closely intermingled.

[Judges 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jdg 1:22</span></span>

SOME CANAANITES LEFT. ([Jdg 1:22-26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#022).md)

the house of Joseph--the tribe of Ephraim, as distinguished from
Manasseh ([Jdg 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027).md).

[Judges 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jdg 1:24</span></span>

the spies . . . said, . . . Show us, . . . the entrance into the
city--that is, the avenues to the city, and the weakest part of the
walls.

we will show thee mercy--The Israelites might employ these means of
getting possession of a place which was divinely appropriated to them:
they might promise life and rewards to this man, though he and all the
Canaanites were doomed to destruction ([Jos
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#012).md); but we may assume the
promise was suspended on his embracing the true religion, or quitting
the country, as he did. If they had seen him to be firmly opposed to
either of these alternatives, they would not have constrained him by
promises any more than by threats to betray his countrymen. But if they
found him disposed to be serviceable, and to aid the invaders in
executing the will of God, they might promise to spare him.

[Judges 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jdg 1:26</span></span>

Luz--(See on [Gen 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md); [Gen
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#018).md).

[Judges 1:27](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jdg 1:27</span></span>

The same course of subjugation was carried on in the other tribes to a
partial extent, and with varying success. Many of the natives, no doubt,
during the progress of this exterminating war, saved themselves by
flight and became, it is thought, the first colonists in Greece, Italy,
and other countries. But a large portion made a stout resistance and
retained possession of their old abodes in Canaan. In other cases, when
the natives were vanquished, avarice led the Israelites to spare the
idolaters, contrary to the express command of God; and their
disobedience to His orders in this matter involved them in many troubles
which this book describes.
