### [Hosea Chapter 4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 4:1</span></span>

HENCEFORTH THE PROPHET SPEAKS PLAINLY AND WITHOUT SYMBOL, IN TERSE,
SENTENTIOUS PROPOSITIONS. (Hos. 4:1-19)

In this chapter he reproves the people and priests for their sins in the
interregnum which followed Jeroboam's death; hence there is no mention
of the king or his family; and in [Hos
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md) bloodshed and other evils usual in
a civil war are specified.

Israel--the ten tribes.

controversy--judicial ground of complaint ([Isa
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#018.md); [Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md); [Mic
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#002).md).

no . . . knowledge of God--exhibited in practice ([Jer
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#016).md).

[Hosea 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 4:2</span></span>

they break out--bursting through every restraint.

blood toucheth blood--literally, "bloods." One act of bloodshed follows
another without any interval between (see [Kg2
15:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008.md), [Kg2
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#025.md); [Mic
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#002).md).

[Hosea 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 4:3</span></span>

land . . . languish-- ([Isa 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#008.md); [Isa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#004.md); [Joe
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#010.md), [Joe
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#012).md).

sea--including all bodies of water, as pools and even rivers (see on
[Isa 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#005).md). A general drought, the
greatest calamity in the East, is threatened.

[Hosea 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 4:4</span></span>

let no man . . . reprove--Great as is the sin of Israel, it is hopeless
to reprove them; for their presumptuous guilt is as great as that of one
who refuses to obey the priest when giving judgment in the name of
Jehovah, and who therefore is to be put to death ([Deu
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#012).md). They rush on to their own
destruction as wilfully as such a one.

thy people--the ten tribes of Israel; distinct from Judah ([Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 4:5</span></span>

fall in the day--in broad daylight, a time when an attack would not be
expected (see on [Jer 6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md); [Jer
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008).md).

in . . . night--No time, night or day, shall be free from the slaughter
of individuals of the people, as well as of the false prophets.

thy mother--the Israelitish state, of which the citizens are the
children ([Hos 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002).md).

[Hosea 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 4:6</span></span>

lack of knowledge--"of God" ([Hos
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001).md), that is, lack of piety. Their
ignorance was wilful, as the epithet, "My people," implies; they ought
to have known, having the opportunity, as the people of God.

thou--O priest, so-called. Not regularly constituted, but still bearing
the name, while confounding the worship of Jehovah and of the calves in
Beth-el ([Kg1 12:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#029.md), [Kg1
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031).md).

I will . . . forget thy children--Not only those who then were alive
should be deprived of the priesthood, but their children who, in the
ordinary course would have succeeded them, should be set aside.

[Hosea 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 4:7</span></span>

As they were increased--in numbers and power. Compare [Hos
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#006.md), "thy children," to which their
"increase" in numbers refers.

so they sinned--(Compare [Hos 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#001.md) and
[Hos 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006).md).

will I change their glory into shame--that is, I will strip them of all
they now glory in (their numbers and power), and give them shame
instead. A just retribution: as they changed their glory into shame, by
idolatry ([Psa 106:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#020.md); [Jer
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#011.md); [Rom
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#023.md); [Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019).md).

[Hosea 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 4:8</span></span>

eat . . . sin of my people--that is, the sin offerings ([Lev
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#026.md); [Lev
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#017).md). The priests greedily devoured
them.

set their heart on their iniquity--literally "lift up the animal soul to
lust after," or strongly desire. Compare [Deu
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md), Margin; [Psa
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#004.md); [Jer
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#027.md). The priests set their own
hearts on the iniquity of the people, instead of trying to suppress it.
For the more the people sinned, the more sacrificial victims in
atonement for sin the priests gained.

[Hosea 4:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 4:9</span></span>

like people, like priest--They are one in guilt; therefore they shall be
one in punishment ([Isa 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#002).md).

reward them their doings--in homely phrase, "pay them back in their own
coin" ([Pro 1:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#031).md).

[Hosea 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 4:10</span></span>

eat, and not have enough--just retribution on those who "eat up
(greedily) the sin of My people" ([Hos
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md); [Mic
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#014.md); [Hag
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#006).md).

whoredom, and . . . not increase--literally "break forth"; used of
giving birth to children ([Gen 28:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#014.md),
Margin; compare [Gen 38:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#029).md). Not only
their wives, but their concubines, shall be barren. To be childless was
considered a great calamity among the Jews.

[Hosea 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 4:11</span></span>

A moral truth applicable to all times. The special reference here is to
the licentious orgies connected with the Syrian worship, which lured
Israel away from the pure worship of God ([Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md), [Isa
28:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#007.md); [Amo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#001).md).

take away the heart--that is, the understanding; make men blind to their
own true good ([Ecc 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#007).md).

[Hosea 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">hos 4:12</span></span>

Instances of their understanding ("heart") being "taken away."

stocks--wooden idols ([Jer 2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md); [Hab
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#019).md).

staff--alluding to divination by rods (see on [Eze
21:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#021).md). The diviner, says
ROSENMULLER, threw a rod from him, which was stripped of its bark on one
side, not on the other: if the bare side turned uppermost, it was a good
omen; if the side with the bark, it was a bad omen. The Arabs used two
rods, the one marked God bids, the other, God forbids; whichever came
out first, in drawing them out of a case, gave the omen for, or against,
an undertaking.

declareth--that is, is consulted to inform them of future events.

spirit of whoredoms--a general disposition on the part of all towards
idolatry ([Hos 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#004).md).

err--go astray from the true God.

from under their God--They have gone away from God under whom they were,
as a wife is under the dominion of her husband.

[Hosea 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">hos 4:13</span></span>

upon . . . mountains--High places were selected by idolaters on which to
sacrifice, because of their greater nearness to the heavenly hosts which
they worshipped ([Deu 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#002).md).

elms--rather, "terebinths" \[MAURER\].

shadow . . . good--screening the lascivious worshippers from the heat of
the sun.

daughters . . . commit whoredom . . . spouses . . . adultery--in the
polluted worship of Astarte, the PhÅ“nician goddess of love.

[Hosea 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">hos 4:14</span></span>

I will not punish . . . daughters--I will visit with the heaviest
punishments "not" the unchaste "daughters and spouses," but the fathers
and husbands; for it is these who "themselves" have set the bad example,
so that as compared with the punishment of the latter, that of the
former shall seem as nothing \[MUNSTER\].

separated with whores--withdrawn from the assembly of worshippers to
some receptacle of impurity for carnal connection with whores.

sacrifice with harlots--They commit lewdness with women who devote their
persons to be violated in honor of Astarte. (So the Hebrew for "harlots"
means, as distinguished from "whores"). Compare [Num
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md); and the prohibition, [Deu
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#018.md).

not understand-- ([Isa 44:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#018.md); [Isa
45:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#020).md).

shall fall--shall be cast down.

[Hosea 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">hos 4:15</span></span>

Though Israel's ten tribes indulge in spiritual harlotry, at least thou,
Judah, who hast the legal priesthood, and the temple rites, and
Jerusalem, do not follow her bad example.

Gilgal--situated between Jordan and Jericho on the confines of Samaria;
once a holy place to Jehovah ([Jos
5:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md); [Sa1
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#008.md); [Sa1
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021).md); afterwards desecrated by
idol-worship ([Hos 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#015.md); 12-11; [Amo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004.md); [Amo
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005.md); compare [Jdg
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg003.htm#019), Margin.md).

Beth-aven--that is, "house of vanity" or idols: a name substituted in
contempt for Beth-el, "the house of God"; once sacred to Jehovah ([Gen
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017.md), [Gen
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#019.md); [Gen
35:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#007).md), but made by Jeroboam the seat
of the worship of the calves ([Kg1
12:28-33](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md); [Kg1
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1013.htm#001.md); [Jer
48:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013.md); [Amo
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#014.md); [Amo
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#013).md). "Go up" refers to the fact that
Beth-el was on a hill ([Jos 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos016.htm#001).md).

nor swear, The Lord liveth--This formula of oath was appointed by God
Himself ([Deu 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013.md); [Deu
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#020.md); [Jer
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002).md). It is therefore here forbidden
not absolutely, but in conjunction with idolatry and falsehood ([Isa
48:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#001.md); [Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039.md); [Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005).md).

[Hosea 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">hos 4:16</span></span>

backsliding--Translate, "Israel is refractory, as a refractory heifer,"
namely, one that throws the yoke off her neck. Israel had represented
God under the form of "calves" ([Kg1
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028).md); but it is she herself who is
one.

lamb in a large place--not in a good sense, as in [Isa
30:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#023.md). Here there is irony: lambs like
a large pasture; but it is not so safe for them as a small one, duly
fenced from wild beasts. God will "feed" them, but it shall be with the
"rod" ([Mic 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014).md). It shall be no
longer in the narrow territory of Israel, but "in a large place,"
namely, they shall be scattered in exile over the wide realm of Assyria,
a prey to their foes; as lambs, which are timid, gregarious, and not
solitary, are a prey when scattered asunder to wild beasts.

[Hosea 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">hos 4:17</span></span>

Ephraim--the ten tribes. Judah was at this time not so given to idolatry
as afterwards.

joined to--closely and voluntarily; identifying themselves with them as
a whoremonger becomes one flesh with the harlot ([Num
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#003.md); [Co1
6:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#016).md).

idols--The Hebrew means also "sorrows," "pains," implying the pain which
idolatry brings on its votaries.

let him alone--Leave him to himself. Let him reap the fruits of his own
perverse choice; his case is desperate; say nothing to him (compare [Jer
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016).md). Here [Hos
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015.md) shows the address is to Judah, to
avoid the contagion of Israel's bad example. He is bent on his own ruin;
leave him to his fate, lest, instead of saving him, thou fall thyself
([Isa 48:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#020.md); [Jer
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md); [Jer
51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md), [Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045.md); [Co2
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#017).md).

[Hosea 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">hos 4:18</span></span>

Their drink is sour--metaphor for utter degeneracy of principle ([Isa
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022).md). Or, unbridled licentiousness;
not mere ordinary sin, but as abandoned as drunkards who vomit and smell
sour with wine potations \[CALVIN\]. MAURER not so well translates,
"When their drinking is over, they commit whoredoms," namely, in honor
of Astarte ([Hos 4:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#013).md).

her rulers--Israel's; literally, "shields" (compare [Psa
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#009).md).

with shame . . . love, Give ye-- ([Pro
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#015).md). No remedy could be effectual
against their corruptions since the very rulers sold justice for gifts
\[CALVIN\]. MAURER translates, "The rulers are marvelously enamored of
shame." English Version is better.

[Hosea 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">hos 4:19</span></span>

Israel shall be swept away from her land ([Hos
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016).md) suddenly and violently as if by
"the wings of the wind" ([Psa 18:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#010.md);
[Psa 104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md); [Jer
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011).md).

ashamed . . . of their sacrifices--disappointed to their shame in their
hope of help through their sacrifices to idols.
