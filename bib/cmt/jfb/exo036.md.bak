### [Exodus Chapter 36](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001.md)

[Exodus 36:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">exo 36:1</span></span>

OFFERINGS DELIVERED TO THE WORKMEN. (Exo. 36:1-38)

Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, &c.--Here
is an illustrious example of zeal and activity in the work of the Lord.
No unnecessary delay was allowed to take place; and from the moment the
first pole was stuck in the ground till the final completion of the
sacred edifice, he and his associates labored with all the energies both
of mind and body engaged in the work. And what was the mainspring of
their arduous and untiring diligence? They could be actuated by none of
the ordinary motives that give impulse to human industry, by no desire
for the acquisition of gain; no ambition for honor; no view of
gratifying a mere love of power in directing the labors of a large body
of men. They felt the stimulus--the strong irresistible impulse of
higher and holier motives--obedience to the authority, zeal for the
glory, and love to the service of God.

[Exodus 36:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">exo 36:3</span></span>

they (the workmen)

received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had
brought, &c.--It appears that the building was begun after the first few
contributions were made; it was progressively carried on, and no
necessity occurred to suspend operations even for the shortest interval,
from want of the requisite materials.

they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning, &c.--Moses, in
common with other Oriental magistrates, had his morning levees for
receiving the people (see on [Exo
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013).md); and it was while he was
performing his magisterial duties that the people brought unto him
freewill offerings every morning. Some who had nothing but their manual
labor to give would spend a great part of the night in hastening to
complete their self-imposed task before the early dawn; others might
find their hearts constrained by silent meditations on their beds to
open their coffers and give a part of their hoarded treasure to the
pious object. All whose hearts were touched by piety, penitence, or
gratitude, repaired with eager haste into the presence of Moses, not as
heretofore, to have their controversies settled, but to lay on his
tribunal their contributions to the sanctuary of God ([Co2
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007).md).

[Exodus 36:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">exo 36:5</span></span>

they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough,
&c.--By the calculations which the practised eyes of the workmen enabled
them to make, they were unanimously of the opinion that the supply
already far exceeded the demand and that no more contributions were
required. Such a report reflects the highest honor on their character as
men of the strictest honor and integrity, who, notwithstanding they had
command of an untold amount of the most precious things and might,
without any risk of human discovery, have appropriated much to their own
use, were too high principled for such acts of peculation. Forthwith, a
proclamation was issued to stop further contributions \[[Exo
36:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#006.md)\].

[Exodus 36:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">exo 36:35</span></span>

he made a veil of blue--the second or inner veil, which separated the
holy from the most holy place, embroidered with cherubim and of great
size and thickness.

[Exodus 36:37](../../../bib/kjv/exo036.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">exo 36:37</span></span>

made an hanging for the . . . door--Curtains of elaborately wrought
needlework are often suspended over the entrance to tents of the great
nomad sheiks, and throughout Persia, at the entrance of summer tents,
mosques, and palaces. They are preferred as cooler and more elegant than
wooden doors. This chapter contains an instructive narrative: it is the
first instance of donations made for the worship of God, given from the
wages of the people's sufferings and toils. They were acceptable to God
([Phi 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018).md), and if the Israelites
showed such liberality, how much more should those whose privilege it is
to live under the Christian dispensation ([Co1
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md); [Co1
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002).md).
