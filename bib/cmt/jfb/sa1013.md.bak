### [1 Kings (1 Samuel) Chapter 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">sa1 13:1</span></span>

SAUL'S SELECTED BAND. ([Sa1 13:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#001).md)

Saul reigned one year--(see Margin). The transactions recorded in the
eleventh and twelfth chapters were the principal incidents comprising
the first year of Saul's reign; and the events about to be described in
this happened in the second year.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">sa1 13:2</span></span>

Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel--This band of picked men was
a bodyguard, who were kept constantly on duty, while the rest of the
people were dismissed till their services might be needed. It seems to
have been his tactics to attack the Philistine garrisons in the country
by different detachments, rather than by risking a general engagement;
and his first operations were directed to rid his native territory of
Benjamin of these enemies.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">sa1 13:3</span></span>

HE CALLS THE HEBREWS TO GILGAL AGAINST THE PHILISTINES. ([Sa1
13:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#003).md)

And Jonathan--that is, "God-given."

smote the garrison of the Philistines . . . in Geba--Geba and Gibeah
were towns in Benjamin, very close to each other ([Jos
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#024.md), [Jos
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#028).md). The word rendered "garrison"
is different from that of [Sa1 13:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#023.md);
[Sa1 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#001.md), and signifies, literally,
something erected; probably a pillar or flagstaff, indicative of
Philistine ascendency. That the secret demolition of this standard, so
obnoxious to a young and noble-hearted patriot, was the feat of Jonathan
referred to, is evident from the words, "the Philistines heard of it,"
which is not the way we should expect an attack on a fortress to be
noticed.

Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land--This, a well-known sound,
was the usual Hebrew war-summons; the first blast was answered by the
beacon fire in the neighboring places. A second blast was blown--then
answered by a fire in a more distant locality, whence the proclamation
was speedily diffused over the whole country. As the Philistines
resented what Jonathan had done as an overt attempt to throw off their
yoke, a levy, en masse, of the people was immediately ordered, the
rendezvous to be the old camping-ground at Gilgal.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">sa1 13:5</span></span>

THE PHILISTINES' GREAT HOST. ([Sa1
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#005).md)

The Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel,
thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen--Either this number
must include chariots of every kind--or the word "chariots" must mean
the men fighting in them ([Sa2 10:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#018.md);
[Kg1 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#021.md); [Ch1
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#018).md); or, as some eminent critics
maintain, Sheloshim ("thirty"), has crept into the text, instead of
Shelosh ("three"). The gathering of the chariots and horsemen must be
understood to be on the Philistine plain, before they ascended the
western passes and pitched in the heart of the Benjamite hills, in
"Michmash," (now Mukmas), a "steep precipitous valley" \[ROBINSON\],
eastward from Beth-aven (Beth-el).

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">sa1 13:6</span></span>

THE ISRAELITES' DISTRESS. ([Sa1
13:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#006).md)

When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait--Though Saul's
gallantry was unabated, his subjects displayed no degree of zeal and
energy. Instead of venturing an encounter, they fled in all directions.
Some, in their panic, left the country ([Sa1
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#007).md), but most took refuge in the
hiding-places which the broken ridges of the neighborhood abundantly
afford. The rocks are perforated in every direction with "caves," and
"holes," and "pits"--crevices and fissures sunk deep in the rocky soil,
subterranean granaries or dry wells in the adjoining fields. The name of
Michmash ("hidden treasure") seems to be derived from this natural
peculiarity \[STANLEY\].

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">sa1 13:8</span></span>

he--that is, Saul.

tarried seven days--He was still in the eastern borders of his kingdom,
in the valley of Jordan. Some bolder spirits had ventured to join the
camp at Gilgal; but even the courage of those stout-hearted men gave way
in prospect of this terrible visitation; and as many of them were
stealing away, he thought some immediate and decided step must be taken.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">sa1 13:9</span></span>

SAUL, WEARY OF WAITING FOR SAMUEL, SACRIFICES. ([Sa1
13:9-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#009).md)

Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
offerings--Saul, though patriotic enough in his own way, was more
ambitious of gaining the glory of a triumph to himself than ascribing it
to God. He did not understand his proper position as king of Israel; and
although aware of the restrictions under which he held the sovereignty,
he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute power both in
civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first trial. Samuel
waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put the
constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in his
impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed ([Sa1
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#012).md) by invading the priest's office
and thus showing his unfitness for his high office (as he showed nothing
of the faith of Gideon and other Hebrew generals), he incurred a threat
of the rejection which his subsequent waywardness confirmed.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">sa1 13:15</span></span>

Samuel . . . gat him . . . unto Gibeah . . . and Saul, and Jonathan his
son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah--Saul
removed his camp thither, either in the hope that, it being his native
town, he would gain an increase of followers or that he might enjoy the
counsels and influence of the prophet.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">sa1 13:17</span></span>

the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three
companies--ravaging through the three valleys which radiate from the
uplands of Michmash to Ophrah on the north, through the pass of
Beth-horon on the west, and down the ravines of Zeboim ("the
hyÃ&brvbr;nas"), towards the Ghor or Jordan valley on the east.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">sa1 13:19</span></span>

Now there was no smith found throughout . . . Israel--The country was in
the lowest state of depression and degradation. The Philistines, after
the great victory over the sons of Eli, had become the virtual masters
of the land. Their policy in disarming the natives has been often
followed in the East. For repairing any serious damage to their
agricultural implements, they had to apply to the neighboring forts.

[1 Kings (1 Samuel) 13:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1013.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">sa1 13:21</span></span>

Yet they had a file--as a kind of privilege, for the purpose of
sharpening sundry smaller utensils of husbandry.
