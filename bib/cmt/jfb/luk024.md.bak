Testaments*, by Robert Jamieson, A.R. Fausset and David Brown \[1882\]

### [Luke Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md)

[Luke 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">luk 24:5</span></span>

ANGELIC ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE WOMEN THAT CHRIST IS RISEN--PETER'S VISIT TO
THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE. ([Luk 24:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001).md)

Why, &c.--Astonishing question! not "the risen," but "the Living One"
(compare [Rev 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#018).md); and the surprise
expressed in it implies an incongruity in His being there at all, as if,
though He might submit to it, "it was impossible He should be holden of
it" ([Act 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024).md).

[Luke 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">luk 24:6</span></span>

in Galilee--to which these women themselves belonged ([Luk
23:55](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#055).md).

[Luke 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">luk 24:7</span></span>

Saying, &c.--How remarkable it is to hear angels quoting a whole
sentence of Christ's to the disciples, mentioning where it was uttered,
and wondering it was not fresh in their memory, as doubtless it was in
theirs! ([Ti1 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md), "seen of angels,"
and [Pe1 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012).md).

[Luke 24:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">luk 24:10</span></span>

Joanna--(See on [Luk 8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#001).md).

[Luke 24:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">luk 24:12</span></span>

Peter, &c.--(See on [Joh 20:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001).md).

[Luke 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">luk 24:13</span></span>

CHRIST APPEARS TO THE TWO GOING TO EMMAUS. (Luke 24:13-35)

two of them--One was Cleopas ([Luk
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018).md); who the other was is mere
conjecture.

Emmaus--about seven and a half miles from Jerusalem. They probably lived
there and were going home after the Passover.

[Luke 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">luk 24:14</span></span>

communed and reasoned--exchanged views and feelings, weighing afresh all
the facts, as detailed in [Luk
24:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018.md).

drew near--coming up behind them as from Jerusalem.

eyes holden--Partly He was "in another form" ([Mar
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#012).md), and partly there seems to have
been an operation on their own vision; though certainly, as they did not
believe that He was alive, His company as a fellow traveller was the
last thing they would expect,

[Luke 24:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">luk 24:17</span></span>

communications, &c.--The words imply the earnest discussion that had
appeared in their manner.

[Luke 24:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">luk 24:18</span></span>

knowest not, &c.--If he knew not the events of the last few days in
Jerusalem, he must be a mere sojourner; if he did, how could he suppose
they would be talking of anything else? How artless all this!

[Luke 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">luk 24:19</span></span>

Concerning Jesus, &c.--As if feeling it a relief to have someone to
unburden his thoughts and feelings to, this disciple goes over the main
facts in his own desponding style, and this was just what our Lord
wished.

[Luke 24:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">luk 24:21</span></span>

we trusted, &c.--They expected the promised Deliverance at His hand, but
in the current sense of it, not by His death.

besides all this--not only did His death seem to give the fatal blow to
their hopes, but He had been two days dead already, and this was the
third. It is true, they add, some of our women gave us a surprise,
telling us of a vision of angels they had at the empty grave this
morning that said He was alive, and some of ourselves who went thither
confirmed their statement; but then Himself they saw not. A doleful tale
truly, told out of the deepest despondency.

[Luke 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">luk 24:25</span></span>

fools--senseless, without understanding.

[Luke 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">luk 24:26</span></span>

Ought not Christ--"the Christ," "the Messiah."

to suffer . . . and enter--that is, through the gate of suffering (and
suffering "these things," or such a death) to enter into His glory. "Ye
believe in the glory; but these very sufferings are the predicted gate
of entrance into it."

[Luke 24:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">luk 24:27</span></span>

Moses and all the prophets, &c.--Here our Lord both teaches us the
reverence due to Old Testament Scripture, and the great burden of
it--"Himself."

[Luke 24:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">luk 24:28</span></span>

made as though, &c.--(Compare [Mar
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048.md); [Gen
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#003.md), [Gen
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#005.md); [Gen
32:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#024).md).

[Luke 24:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">luk 24:29</span></span>

constrained, &c.--But for this, the whole design of the interview had
been lost; but it was not to be lost, for He who only wished to be
constrained had kindled a longing in the hearts of His travelling
companions which was not to be so easily put off. And does not this
still repeat itself in the interviews of the Saviour with His loving,
longing disciples? Else why do they say,

Abide with me from morn to eve,

For without Thee I cannot live;

Abide with me when night is nigh,

For without Thee I cannot die.

KEBLE

[Luke 24:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">luk 24:30</span></span>

he took . . . and blessed . . . and their eyes were opened--The stranger
first startles them by taking the place of master at their own table,
but on proceeding to that act which reproduced the whole scene of the
last Supper, a rush of associations and recollections disclosed their
guest, and He stood confessed before their astonished gaze--THEIR RISEN
LORD! They were going to gaze on Him, perhaps embrace Him, but that
moment He is gone! It was enough.

[Luke 24:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">luk 24:32</span></span>

They now tell each to the other how their hearts burned--were
fired--within them at His talk and His expositions of Scripture. "Ah!
this accounts for it: We could not understand the glow of
self-evidencing light, love, glory that ravished our hearts; but now we
do." They cannot rest--how could they?--they must go straight back and
tell the news. They find the eleven, but ere they have time to tell
their tale, their ears are saluted with the thrilling news, "The Lord is
risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon." Most touching and precious
intelligence this. The only one of the Eleven to whom He appeared alone
was he, it seems, who had so shamefully denied Him. What passed at that
interview we shall never know here. Probably it was too sacred for
disclosure. (See on [Mar 16:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#007).md). The
two from Emmaus now relate what had happened to them, and while thus
comparing notes of their Lord's appearances, lo! Christ Himself stands
in the midst of them. What encouragement to doubting, dark, true-hearted
disciples!

[Luke 24:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">luk 24:36</span></span>

JESUS APPEARS TO THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES--HIS ASCENSION. (Luke 24:36-53)

Jesus . . . stood--(See on [Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019).md).

[Luke 24:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">luk 24:37</span></span>

a spirit--the ghost of their dead Lord, but not Himself in the body
([Act 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#015.md); [Mat
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026).md).

thoughts--rather, "reasonings"; that is, whether He were risen or no,
and whether this was His very self.

[Luke 24:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">luk 24:39</span></span>

Behold, &c.--lovingly offering them both ocular and tangible
demonstration of the reality of His resurrection.

a spirit hath not--an important statement regarding "spirits."

flesh and bones--He says not "flesh and blood"; for the blood is the
life of the animal and corruptible body ([Gen
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004).md), which "cannot inherit the
kingdom of God" ([Co1 15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050).md); but
"flesh and bones," implying the identity, but with diversity of laws, of
the resurrection body. (See on [Joh
20:24-28](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024).md).

[Luke 24:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">luk 24:41</span></span>

believed not for joy, &c.--They did believe, else they had not rejoiced
\[BENGEL\]. But it seemed too good to be true ([Psa
126:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001).md).

[Luke 24:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#042.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_042">luk 24:42</span></span>

honeycomb--common frugal fare, anciently.

[Luke 24:43](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">luk 24:43</span></span>

eat before them--that is, let them see Him doing it: not for His own
necessity, but their conviction.

[Luke 24:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">luk 24:44</span></span>

These are the words, &c.--that is, "Now you will understand what seemed
so dark to you when I told you about the Son of man being put to death
and rising again" ([Luk 18:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#031).md).

while . . . yet with you--a striking expression, implying that He was
now, as the dead and risen Saviour, virtually dissevered from this scene
of mortality, and from all ordinary intercourse with His mortal
disciples.

law . . . prophets . . . psalms--the three Jewish divisions of the Old
Testament Scriptures.

[Luke 24:45](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#045.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">luk 24:45</span></span>

Then opened he, &c.--a statement of unspeakable value; expressing, on
the one hand, Christ's immediate access to the human spirit and absolute
power over it, to the adjustment of its vision, and permanent
rectification for spiritual discernment (than which it is impossible to
conceive a stronger evidence of His proper divinity); and, on the other
hand, making it certain that the manner of interpreting the ld Testament
which the apostles afterwards employed (see the Acts and Epistles), has
the direct sanction of Christ Himself.

[Luke 24:46](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">luk 24:46</span></span>

behoved Christ--(See on [Luk 24:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026).md).

[Luke 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">luk 24:47</span></span>

beginning at Jerusalem--(1) As the metropolis and heart of the then
existing kingdom of God:--"to the Jew first" ([Rom
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md); [Act
13:46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md); [Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md), see on [Mat
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006)). (2.md) As the great reservoir and
laboratory of all the sin and crime of the nation, thus proclaiming for
all time that there is mercy in Christ for the chief of sinners. (See on
[Mat 23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037).md).

[Luke 24:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">luk 24:48</span></span>

witnesses--(Compare [Act 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md), [Act
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022).md).

[Luke 24:49](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">luk 24:49</span></span>

I send--the present tense, to intimate its nearness.

promise of my Father--that is, what My Father hath promised; the Holy
Ghost, of which Christ is the authoritative Dispenser ([Joh
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007.md); [Rev
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md); [Rev
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#006).md).

endued--invested, or clothed with; implying, as the parallels show ([Rom
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md); [Co1
15:53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md); [Gal
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027.md); [Col
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009).md), their being so penetrated and
acted upon by conscious supernatural power (in the full sense of that
word) as to stamp with divine authority the whole exercise of their
apostolic office, including, of course, their pen as well as their
mouth.

Mount Olivet.

[Luke 24:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">luk 24:51</span></span>

while he blessed . . . parted, &c.--Sweet intimation! Incarnate Love,
Crucified Love, Risen Love, now on the wing for heaven, waiting only
those odorous gales which were to waft Him to the skies, goes away in
benedictions, that in the character of Glorified, Enthroned Love, He
might continue His benedictions, but in yet higher form, until He come
again! And oh, if angels were so transported at His birth into this
scene of tears and death, what must have been their ecstasy as they
welcomed and attended Him "far above all heavens" into the
presence-chamber, and conducted Him to the right hand of the Majesty on
High! Thou hast an everlasting right, O my Saviour, to that august
place. The brightness of the Father's glory, enshrined in our nature,
hath won it well; for He poured out His soul unto death, and led
captivity captive, receiving gifts for men, yea for the rebellious, that
the Lord God might dwell among them. Thou art the King of glory, O
Christ. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, be lifted up, ye everlasting
doors, that the King of glory may come in! Even so wilt Thou change
these vile bodies of ours, that they may be like unto Thine own glorious
body; and then with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought, they
shall enter into the King's palace!

[Luke 24:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">luk 24:52</span></span>

worshipped him--certainly in the strictest sense of adoration.

returned to Jerusalem--as instructed to do: but not till after gazing,
as if entranced, up into the blue vault in which He had disappeared,
they were gently checked by two shining ones, who assured them He would
come again to them in the like manner as He had gone into heaven. (See
on [Act 1:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010).md). This made them
return, not with disappointment at His removal, but "with great joy."

[Luke 24:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#053.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_053">luk 24:53</span></span>

of prayer till the day of Pentecost.
