<p>
<p>caterpillar--rather, "the wingless locust"; as it gathers; the Hebrew word for "gathers" is properly used of the gathering of the fruits of harvest (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#010">Isa 32:10</A>).

<p>thy--Hezekiah's; or rather, "Judea's." "His" refers to the same; such changes from the pronoun possessive of the second person to that of the third are common in Hebrew poetry. 
<p>
<p>treasure--Not so much material wealth as piety shall constitute the riches of the nation (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#022">Pro 10:22</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#016">Pro 15:16</A>).

<p>Lebanon--personified; the allusion may be to the Assyrian cutting down its choice trees (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#008">Isa 14:8</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024">Isa 37:24</A>). 
<p>
<p>Sharon--south of Carmel, along the Mediterranean, proverbial for fertility (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#002">Isa 35:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>Bashan--afterwards called Batanea (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#013">Isa 2:13</A>).

<p>fruits--rather, understand "leaves"; they lie as desolate as in winter.

Perhaps alluding to their being about to be burnt on the funeral pyre (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033">Isa 30:33</A>). 
<p>
<p>thorns--the wicked (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#006">Sa2 23:6-7</A>).

<p>
<p>hypocrites--rather, "the profane"; "the abandoned" [HORSLEY]. 
<p>
<p>who, &amp;c.--If Jehovah's wrath could thus consume such a host in one night, who could abide it, if continued for ever (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#046">Mar 9:46-48</A>)? Fire is a common image for the divine judgments (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#006">Isa 29:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#030">Isa 30:30</A>).

<p>
<p>bread . . . waters--image from the expected siege by Sennacherib; however besieged by trials without, the godly shall have literal and spiritual food, as God sees good for them (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017">Isa 41:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025">Psa 37:25</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010">Psa 34:10</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#015">Psa 132:15</A>).

<p>
<p>king in . . . beauty--not as now, Hezekiah in sackcloth, oppressed by the enemy, but King Messiah (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#001">Isa 32:1</A>) "in His beauty" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#010">Sol 5:10</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sol005.htm#016">Sol 5:16</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev004.htm#003">Rev 4:3</A>). 
<p>
<p>land . . . very far off--rather, "the land in its remotest extent" (no longer pent up as Hezekiah was with the siege); see Margin. For Jerusalem is made the scene of the king's glory (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020">Isa 33:20</A>, &amp;c.), and it could not be said to be "very far off," unless the far-off land be heaven, the Jerusalem above, which is to follow the earthly reign of Messiah at literal Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017">Isa 65:17-19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017">Jer 3:17</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001">Rev 21:1-2</A>, <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#010">Rev 21:10</A>).

<p>
<p>where, &amp;c.--the language of the Jews exulting over their escape from danger. 
<p>
<p>scribe--who enrolled the army [MAURER]; or, who prescribed the tribute to be paid [ROSENMULLER]; or, who kept an account of the spoil. "The principal scribe of the host" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019">Kg2 25:19</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#025">Jer 52:25</A>). The Assyrian records are free from the exaggerations of Egyptian records. Two scribes are seen in every Assyrian bas-relief, writing down the various objects brought to them, the heads of the slain, prisoners, cattle, sheep, &amp;c. 
<p>
<p>receiver--"weigher," Margin. LAYARD mentions, among the Assyrian inscriptions, "a pair a scales for weighing the spoils." 
<p>
<p>counted . . . towers--he whose duty it was to reconnoitre and report the strength of the city to be besieged.
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_019">isa 33:19</A></FONT></span></p>fierce people--The Assyrians shall not be allowed to enter Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#032">Kg2 19:32</A>). Or, thou shalt not any longer see fierce enemies threatening thee as previously; such as the Assyrians, Romans, and the last Antichristian host that is yet to assail Jerusalem (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#049">Deu 28:49-50</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#015">Jer 5:15</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#002">Zac 14:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>stammering--barbarous; so "deeper," &amp;c., that is, unintelligible. The Assyrian tongue differed only in dialect from the Hebrew, but in the Assyrian levies were many of non-Semitic race and language, as the Medes, Elamites, &amp;c. (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011">Isa 28:11</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#020">Isaiah 33:20</A></p> 
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_020">isa 33:20</A></FONT></span></p>solemnities--solemn assemblies at the great feasts (see on <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#029">Isa 30:29</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004">Psa 42:4</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#012">Psa 48:12</A>). 
<p>
<p>not . . . taken down . . . removed--image from captives "removed" from their land (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa036.htm#017">Isa 36:17</A>). There shall be no more "taking away" to an enemy's land. Or else, from nomads living in shifting tents. The saints, who sojourned once in tabernacles as pilgrims, shall have a "building of God--eternal in the heavens" (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#009">Heb 11:9-10</A>; compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#002">Isa 54:2</A>). 
<p>
<p>stakes--driven into the ground; to these the "cords" were fastened. Christ's Church shall never fall (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018">Mat 16:18</A>). So individual believers (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#012">Rev 3:12</A>).
<p> 
<p align="center"><A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#021">Isaiah 33:21</A></p>

<p>
<p>will be . . . rivers--Jehovah will be as a broad river surrounding our city (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006">Isa 19:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#008">Nah 3:8</A>), and this, too, a river of such a kind as no ship of war can pass (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001">Isa 26:1</A>). Jerusalem had not the advantage of a river; Jehovah will be as one to it, affording all the advantages, without any of the disadvantages of one. 
<p>
<p>galley with oars--war vessels of a long shape, and propelled by oars; merchant vessels were broader and carried sail. 
<p>
<p>gallant--same Hebrew word as for "glorious," previously; "mighty" will suit both places; a ship of war is meant. No "mighty vessel" will dare to pass where the "mighty Lord" stands as our defense.

<p>
<p>they--the tacklings, "hold not firm the base of the mast." 
<p>
<p>then--when the Assyrian host shall have been discomfited. Hezekiah had given Sennacherib three hundred talents of silver, and thirty of gold (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#014">Kg2 18:14-16</A>), and had stripped the temple of its gold to give it to him; this treasure was probably part of the prey found in the foe's camp. After the invasion, Hezekiah had so much wealth that he made an improper display of it (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#013">Kg2 20:13-15</A>); this wealth, probably, was in part got from the Assyrian. 
<p>
<p>the lame--Even the most feeble shall spoil the Assyrian camp (compare <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006">Isa 35:6</A>; <A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/sa2005.htm#006">Sa2 5:6</A>).

In the Jerusalem to come there shall be no "sickness," because there will be no "iniquity," it being forgiven (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#003">Psa 103:3</A>). The latter clause of the verse contains the cause of the former (<A HREF="../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#005">Mar 2:5-9</A>).
<p>
<p>The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth chapters form one prophecy, the former part of which denounces God's judgment against His people's enemies, of whom Edom is the representative; the second part, of the flourishing state of the Church consequent on those judgments. This forms the termination of the prophecies of the first part of Isaiah (the thirty-sixth through thirty-ninth chapters being historical) and is a kind of summary of what went before, setting forth the one main truth, Israel shall be delivered from all its foes, and happier times shall succeed under Messiah.
