### [Jeremiah Chapter 24](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001)

[Jeremiah 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 24:1</span></span>

THE RESTORATION OF THE CAPTIVES IN BABYLON AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
REFRACTORY PARTY IN JUDEA AND IN EGYPT, REPRESENTED UNDER THE TYPE OF A
BASKET OF GOOD, AND ONE OF BAD, FIGS. ([Jer
24:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001))

Lord showed me-- [Amo 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#001), [Amo
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004), [Amo
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007); [Amo
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo008.htm#001), contains the same formula, with
the addition of "thus" prefixed.

carried . . . captive Jeconiah-- ([Jer
22:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#024); [Kg2
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012), &c.; [Ch2
36:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#010)).

carpenters, &c.--One thousand artisans were carried to Babylon, both to
work for the king there, and to deprive Jerusalem of their services in
the event of a future siege ([Kg2
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016)).

[Jeremiah 24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 24:2</span></span>

figs . . . first ripe--the "boccora," or early fig (see on [Isa
28:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#004)). Baskets of figs used to be
offered as first-fruits in the temple. The good figs represent Jeconiah
and the exiles in Babylon; the bad, Zedekiah and the obstinate Jews in
Judea. They are called good and bad respectively, not in an absolute,
but a comparative sense, and in reference to the punishment of the
latter. This prophecy was designed to encourage the despairing exiles,
and to reprove the people at home, who prided themselves as superior to
those in Babylon and abused the forbearance of God (compare [Jer
52:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#031)).

[Jeremiah 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 24:5</span></span>

acknowledge--regard with favor, like as thou lookest on the good figs
favorably.

for their good--Their removal to Babylon saved them from the calamities
which befell the rest of the nation and led them to repentance there: so
God bettered their condition ([Kg2
25:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#027)). Daniel and Ezekiel were
among these captives.

[Jeremiah 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 24:6</span></span>

([Jer 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#015)).

not pull . . . down . . . not pluck . . . up--only partially fulfilled
in the restoration from Babylon; antitypically and fully to be fulfilled
hereafter ([Jer 32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041); [Jer
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#007)).

[Jeremiah 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 24:7</span></span>

([Jer 30:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#022); [Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033); [Jer
32:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#038)). Their conversion from idolatry
to the one true God, through the chastening effect of the Babylonish
captivity, is here expressed in language which, in its fulness, applies
to the more complete conversion hereafter of the Jews, "with their whole
heart" ([Jer 29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013)), through the
painful discipline of their present dispersion. The source of their
conversion is here stated to be God's prevenient grace.

for they shall return--Repentance, though not the cause of pardon, is
its invariable accompaniment: it is the effect of God's giving a heart
to know Him.

[Jeremiah 24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 24:8</span></span>

in . . . Egypt--Many Jews had fled for refuge to Egypt, which was
leagued with Judea against Babylon.

[Jeremiah 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 24:9</span></span>

removed, &c.-- ([Jer 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004)). CALVIN
translates, "I will give them up to agitation, in all," &c.; This verse
quotes the curse ([Deu 28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025), [Deu
28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037)). Compare [Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018), [Jer
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022); [Psa
44:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#013).
