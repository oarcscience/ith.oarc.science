### [2 Chronicles Chapter 20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

[2 Chronicles 20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">ch2 20:1</span></span>

JEHOSHAPHAT, INVADED BY THE MOABITES, PROCLAIMS A FAST. (2Ch. 20:1-21)

the children of Moab . . . Ammon, and with them other beside the
Ammonites--supposed to be rather the name of a certain people called
Mohammonim or Mehunim ([Ch2 26:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2026.htm#007).md), who
dwelt in Mount Seir--either a branch of the old Edomite race or a
separate tribe who were settled there.

[2 Chronicles 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">ch2 20:2</span></span>

from beyond the sea on this side Syria--Instead of "Syria," some
versions read "Edom," and many able critics prefer this reading, both
because the nomad tribes here mentioned were far from Syria, and because
express mention is made of Mount Seir, that is, Edom. The meaning then
is: this confederate horde was composed of the different tribes that
inhabited the far distant regions bordering on the northern and eastern
coasts of the Red Sea. Their progress was apparently by the southern
point of the Dead Sea, as far as En-gedi, which, more anciently, was
called Hazezon-tamar ([Gen 14:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#007).md). This
is the uniform route taken by the Arabs in their marauding expeditions
at the present day; and in coming round the southern end of the Dead
Sea, they can penetrate along the low-lying Ghor far north, without
letting their movements be known to the tribes and villages west of the
mountain chain \[ROBINSON\]. Thus, anciently, the invading horde in
Jehoshaphat's time had marched as far north as En-gedi, before
intelligence of their advance was conveyed to the court. En-gedi is
recognized in the modern Ainjidy and is situated at a point of the
western shore, nearly equidistant from both extremities of the lake
\[ROBINSON\].

[2 Chronicles 20:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">ch2 20:3</span></span>

Jehoshaphat . . . proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah--Alarmed by the
intelligence and conscious of his total inability to repel this host of
invaders, Jehoshaphat felt his only refuge was at the horns of the
altar. He resolved to employ the aid of his God, and, in conformity with
this resolution, he summoned all his subjects to observe a solemn fast
at the sanctuary. It was customary with the Hebrew kings to proclaim
fasts in perilous circumstances, either in a city, a district, or
throughout the entire kingdom, according to the greatness of the
emergency. On this occasion, it was a universal fast, which extended to
infants ([Ch2 20:13](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#013.md); see also [Joe
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#015.md); [Jon
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#007).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:5](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">ch2 20:5</span></span>

Jehoshaphat stood . . . in the house of the Lord, before the new
court--that is, the great or outer court ([Ch2
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#009).md) called the new court, probably
from having been at that time enlarged or beautified.

[2 Chronicles 20:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">ch2 20:6</span></span>

And said, O Lord God of our fathers--This earnest and impressive prayer
embraces every topic and argument which, as king and representative of
the chosen people, he could urge. Then it concludes with an earnest
appeal to the justice of God to protect those who, without provocation,
were attacked and who were unable to defend themselves against
overwhelming numbers.

[2 Chronicles 20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">ch2 20:14</span></span>

Then upon Jahaziel . . . came the Spirit of the Lord--This prophet is
not elsewhere mentioned, but his claim to the inspiration of a prophetic
spirit was verified by the calm and distinct announcement he gave, both
of the manner and the completeness of the deliverance he predicted.

[2 Chronicles 20:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">ch2 20:16</span></span>

they come up by the cliff of Ziz--This seems to have been nothing else
than the present pass which leads northwards, by an ascent from En-gedi
to Jerusalem, issuing a little below Tekoa. The wilderness of Jeruel was
probably the large flat district adjoining the desert of Tekoa, called
El-Husasah, from a wady on its northern side \[ROBINSON\].

[2 Chronicles 20:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">ch2 20:18</span></span>

Jehoshaphat bowed his head . . . and all Judah, &c.--This attitude was
expressive of reverence to God and His Word, of confidence in His
promise, and thankfulness for so extraordinary a favor.

[2 Chronicles 20:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">ch2 20:19</span></span>

the Levites . . . stood up to praise the Lord--doubtless by the king's
command. Their anthem was sung with such a joyful acclaim as showed that
they universally regarded the victory as already obtained.

[2 Chronicles 20:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">ch2 20:20</span></span>

as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood . . . Hear me, O Judah, and ye
inhabitants of Jerusalem--probably in the gate of Jerusalem, the place
of general rendezvous; and as the people were on the eve of setting out,
he exhorted them to repose implicit trust in the Lord and His prophet,
not to be timid or desponding at sight of the enemy, but to remain firm
in the confident assurance of a miraculous deliverance, without their
striking a single stroke.

[2 Chronicles 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">ch2 20:21</span></span>

he appointed singers . . . that they should praise . . . as they went
out before the army--Having arranged the line of procession, he gave the
signal to move forwards. The Levites led the van with their musical
instruments; and singing the 136th Psalm, the people went on, not as an
army marching against an enemy, but returning in joyful triumph after a
victory.

[2 Chronicles 20:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">ch2 20:22</span></span>

THE OVERTHROW OF HIS ENEMIES. ([Ch2
20:22-30](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022).md)

when they began to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against
the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir--Some think that this was
done by angels in human form, whose sudden appearance diffused an
uncontrollable panic. Others entertain the more probable opinion that,
in the camp of this vast horde, composed of different tribes, jealousies
and animosities had sprung up, which led to widespread dissensions and
fierce feuds, in which they drew the sword against each other. The
consequence was, that as the mutual strife commenced when the Hebrew
procession set out from Jerusalem, the work of destruction was completed
before Jehoshaphat and his people arrived at the battlefield. Thus easy
is it for God to make the wrath of man to praise Him, to confound the
counsels of His enemies and employ their own passions in defeating the
machinations they have devised for the overthrow of His Church and
people.

[2 Chronicles 20:24](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">ch2 20:24</span></span>

when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness--Most probably
the conical hill, Jebel Fereidis, or Frank Mountain, from the summit of
which they obtained the first view of the scene of slaughter.
Jehoshaphat and his people found the field strewed with dead bodies, so
that they had not to fight at all, but rather to take possession of an
immense booty, the collection of which occupied three days. On the
fourth they set out on their return to Jerusalem in the same order and
joyful mood as they came. The place where they mustered previous to
departure was, from their public thanksgiving service, called, "The
Valley of Berachah" ("benediction"), now Wady Bereikut.

[2 Chronicles 20:31](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">ch2 20:31</span></span>

HIS REIGN. ([Ch2 20:31-37](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#031).md)

Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah--(See [Ch2
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#001).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:32](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">ch2 20:32</span></span>

walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it--He was
more steadfast and consistently religious (compare [Ch2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch2015.htm#018).md).

[2 Chronicles 20:33](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">ch2 20:33</span></span>

the high places were not taken away--Those on which idolatry was
practised were entirely destroyed ([Ch2
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2017.htm#006).md); but those where the people,
notwithstanding the erection of the temple, continued to worship the
true God, prudence required to be slowly and gradually abolished, in
deference to popular prejudice.

[2 Chronicles 20:35](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">ch2 20:35</span></span>

after this did Jehoshaphat . . . join himself with Ahaziah . . . to make
ships--A combined fleet was built at Ezion-geber, the destination of
which was to voyage to Tartessus, but it was wrecked. Jehoshaphat's
motive for entering into this partnership was to secure a free passage
through Israel, for the vessels were to be conveyed across the Isthmus
of Suez, and to sail to the west of Europe from one of the ports of
Palestine on the Mediterranean. Eliezer, a prophet, denounced this
unholy alliance, and foretold, as divine judgment, the total wreck of
the whole fleet. The consequence was, that although Jehoshaphat broke
off--in obedience to the divine will--his league with Ahaziah, he formed
a new scheme of a merchant fleet, and Ahaziah wished to be admitted a
partner \[[Kg1 22:48](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#048.md)\]. The proposal
of the Israelitish king was respectfully declined \[[Kg1
22:49](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#049.md)\]. The destination of this new
fleet was to Ophir, because the Israelitish seaports were not accessible
to him for the Tartessus trade; but the ships, when just off the docks,
were wrecked in the rocky creek of Ezion-geber.
