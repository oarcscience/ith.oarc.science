### [Romans Chapter 11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md)

[Romans 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">rom 11:1</span></span>

SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED AND CONCLUDED--THE ULTIMATE INBRINGING OF ALL
ISRAEL, TO BE, WITH THE GENTILES, ONE KINGDOM OF GOD ON THE EARTH. (Rom.
11:1-36)

I say then, Hath--"Did"

God cast away his people? God forbid--Our Lord did indeed announce that
"the kingdom of God should be taken from Israel" ([Mat
21:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041).md); and when asked by the Eleven,
after His resurrection, if He would at that time "restore the kingdom to
Israel," His reply is a virtual admission that Israel was in some sense
already out of covenant ([Act 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009).md).
Yet here the apostle teaches that, in two respects, Israel was not "cast
away"; First, Not totally; Second, Not finally. FIRST, Israel is not
wholly cast away.

for I also am an Israelite--See [Phi
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005.md), and so a living witness to the
contrary.

of the seed of Abraham--of pure descent from the father of the faithful.

of the tribe of Benjamin-- ([Phi 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005).md),
that tribe which, on the revolt of the ten tribes, constituted, with
Judah, the one faithful kingdom of God ([Kg1
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021).md), and after the captivity was,
along with Judah, the kernel of the Jewish nation ([Ezr
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001.md); [Ezr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr010.htm#009).md).

[Romans 11:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">rom 11:2</span></span>

God hath--"did"

not cast away his people--that is, wholly

which he foreknew--On the word "foreknew," see on [Rom
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md).

Wot--that is, "Know"

ye not that the scripture saith of--literally, "in," that is, in the
section which relates to

Elias? how he maketh intercession--"pleadeth"

against Israel--(The word "saying," which follows, as also the particle
"and" before "digged down," should be omitted, as without manuscript
authority).

[Romans 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">rom 11:3</span></span>

and I am left alone--"I only am left."

[Romans 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">rom 11:4</span></span>

seven thousand, that have not bowed the knee to Baal--not "the image of
Baal," according to the supplement of our version.

[Romans 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">rom 11:5</span></span>

Even so at this present time--"in this present season"; this period of
Israel's rejection. (See [Act 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007.md),
Greek).

there is--"there obtains," or "hath remained"

a remnant according to the election of grace--"As in Elijah's time the
apostasy of Israel was not so universal as it seemed to be, and as he in
his despondency concluded it to be, so now, the rejection of Christ by
Israel is not so appalling in extent as one would be apt to think: There
is now, as there was then, a faithful remnant; not however of persons
naturally better than the unbelieving mass, but of persons graciously
chosen to salvation." (See [Co1 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md);
[Th2 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013).md). This establishes our view
of the argument on Election in Rom. 9:1-29, as not being an election of
Gentiles in the place of Jews, and merely to religious advantages, but a
sovereign choice of some of Israel itself, from among others, to believe
and be saved. (See on [Rom 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006)..md)

[Romans 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">rom 11:6</span></span>

And, &c.--better, "Now if it (the election) be by grace, it is no more
of works; for \[then\] grace becomes no more grace: but if it be of
works," &c. (The authority of ancient manuscripts against this latter
clause, as superfluous and not originally in the text, though strong, is
not sufficient, we think, to justify its exclusion. Such seeming
redundancies are not unusual with our apostle). The general position
here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two possible
sources of salvation--men's works, and God's grace; and that these are
so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot be of any
combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either of the one or
of the other. (See on [Rom 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md), Note
3.)

[Romans 11:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">rom 11:7</span></span>

What then?--How stands the fact?

Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for--better, "What Israel
is in search of (that is, Justification, or acceptance with God--see on
[Rom 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031).md); this he found not; but the
election (the elect remnant of Israel) found it, and the rest were
hardened," or judicially given over to the "hardness of their own
hearts."

[Romans 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">rom 11:8</span></span>

as it is written-- ([Isa 29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010.md); [Deu
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004).md).

God hath given--"gave"

them the spirit of slumber--"stupor"

unto this day--"this present day."

[Romans 11:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">rom 11:9</span></span>

And David saith-- ([Psa 69:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023).md), which
in such a Messianic psalm must be meant of the rejecters of Christ.

Let their table, &c.--that is, Let their very blessings prove a curse to
them, and their enjoyments only sting and take vengeance on them.

[Romans 11:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">rom 11:10</span></span>

Let their eyes be darkened . . . and bow down their back
alway--expressive either of the decrepitude, or of the servile
condition, to come on the nation through the just judgment of God. The
apostle's object in making these quotations is to show that what he had
been compelled to say of the then condition and prospects of his nation
was more than borne out by their own Scriptures. But, SECONDLY, God has
not cast away His people finally. The illustration of this point
extends, Rom. 11:11-31.

[Romans 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">rom 11:11</span></span>

I say then, Have they stumbled--"Did they stumble"

that they should fall? God forbid; but--the supplement "rather" is
better omitted.

through their fall--literally, "trespass," but here best rendered "false
step" \[DE WETTE\]; not "fall," as in our version.

salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy--Here, as
also in [Rom 10:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019.md) (quoted from [Deu
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021).md), we see that emulation is a
legitimate stimulus to what is good.

[Romans 11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">rom 11:12</span></span>

Now if the fall of them--"But if their trespass," or "false step"

be the riches of the--Gentile

world--as being the occasion of their accession to Christ.

and the diminishing of them--that is, the reduction of the true Israel
to so small a remnant.

the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness!--that is, their
full recovery (see on [Rom 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md);
that is, "If an event so untoward as Israel's fall was the occasion of
such unspeakable good to the Gentile world, of how much greater good may
we expect an event so blessed as their full recovery to be productive?"

[Romans 11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">rom 11:13</span></span>

I speak--"am speaking"

to you Gentiles--another proof that this Epistle was addressed to
Gentile believers. (See on [Rom 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013).md).

I magnify--"glorify"

mine office--The clause beginning with "inasmuch" should be read as a
parenthesis.

[Romans 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">rom 11:14</span></span>

If . . . I may provoke, &c. (See on [Rom
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011)..md)

my flesh--Compare [Isa 58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007.md).

[Romans 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">rom 11:15</span></span>

For if the casting away of them--The apostle had denied that they were
east away ([Rom 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001).md); here he affirms
it. But both are true; they were cast away, though neither totally nor
finally, and it is of this partial and temporary rejection that the
apostle here speaks.

be the reconciling of the--Gentile

world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?--The
reception of the whole family of Israel, scattered as they are among all
nations under heaven, and the most inveterate enemies of the Lord Jesus,
will be such a stupendous manifestation of the power of God upon the
spirits of men, and of His glorious presence with the heralds of the
Cross, as will not only kindle devout astonishment far and wide, but so
change the dominant mode of thinking and feeling on all spiritual things
as to seem like a resurrection from the dead.

[Romans 11:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">rom 11:16</span></span>

For--"But"

if the first-fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root . . .
so the branches--The Israelites were required to offer to God the
first-fruits of the earth--both in their raw state, in a sheaf of newly
reaped grain ([Lev 23:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010).md), and in
their prepared state, made into cakes of dough ([Num
15:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#019).md) --by which the whole produce
of that season was regarded as hallowed. It is probable that the latter
of these offerings is here intended, as to it the word "lump" best
applies; and the argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the
parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as
that which hallowed the produce of the earth, so, in the divine
estimation, it was as real a separation of the mass or "lump" of that
nation in all time to God. The figure of the "root" and its "branches"
is of like import--the consecration of the one of them extending to the
other.

[Romans 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">rom 11:17</span></span>

And if--rather, "But if"; that is, "If notwithstanding this consecration
of Abraham's race to God.

some of the branches--The mass of the unbelieving and rejected
Israelites are here called "some," not, as before, to meet Jewish
prejudice (see on [Rom 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md), and on
"not all" in [Rom 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#016).md), but with the
opposite view of checking Gentile pride.

and thou, being a wild olive, wert--"wast"

grafted in among them--Though it is more usual to graft the superior
cutting upon the inferior stem, the opposite method, which is intended
here, is not without example.

and with them partakest--"wast made partaker," along with the branches
left, the believing remnant.

of the root and fatness of the olive tree--the rich grace secured by
covenant to the true seed of Abraham.

[Romans 11:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">rom 11:18</span></span>

Boast not against the--rejected

branches. But if thou--"do"

boast--remember that

thou bearest not--"it is not thou that bearest"

the root, but the root thee--"If the branches may not boast over the
root that bears them, then may not the Gentile boast over the seed of
Abraham; for what is thy standing, O Gentile, in relation to Israel, but
that of a branch in relation to the root? From Israel hath come all that
thou art and hast in the family of God; for "salvation is of the Jews"
([Joh 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022).md).

[Romans 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">rom 11:19</span></span>

Thou wilt say then--as a plea for boasting.

The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.

[Romans 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">rom 11:20</span></span>

Well--"Be it so, but remember that"

because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest--not as a
Gentile, but solely

by faith--But as faith cannot live in those "whose soul is lifted up"
([Hab 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004).md).

Be not high-minded, but fear-- ([Pro
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014.md); [Phi
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012).md):

[Romans 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">rom 11:21</span></span>

For if God spared not the natural branches--sprung from the parent stem.

take heed lest he also spare not thee--a mere wild graft. The former
might, beforehand, have been thought very improbable; but, after that,
no one can wonder at the latter.

[Romans 11:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">rom 11:22</span></span>

Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell,
severity--in rejecting the chosen seed.

but toward thee, goodness--"God's goodness" is the true reading, that
is, His sovereign goodness in admitting thee to a covenant standing who
before wert a "stranger to the covenants of promise" ([Eph
2:12-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012).md).

if thou continue in his goodness--in believing dependence on that pure
goodness which made thee what thou art.

[Romans 11:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">rom 11:23</span></span>

And they also--"Yea, and they"

if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is
able to graft them in again--This appeal to the power of God to effect
the recovery of His ancient people implies the vast difficulty of
it--which all who have ever labored for the conversion of the Jews are
made depressingly to feel. That intelligent expositors should think that
this was meant of individual Jews, reintroduced from time to time into
the family of God on their believing on the Lord Jesus, is surprising;
and yet those who deny the national recovery of Israel must and do so
interpret the apostle. But this is to confound the two things which the
apostle carefully distinguishes. Individual Jews have been at all times
admissible, and have been admitted, to the Church through the gate of
faith in the Lord Jesus. This is the "remnant, even at this present
time, according to the election of grace," of which the apostle, in the
first part of the chapter, had cited himself as one. But here he
manifestly speaks of something not then existing, but to be looked
forward to as a great future event in the economy of God, the
reingrafting of the nation as such, when they "abide not in unbelief."
And though this is here spoken of merely as a supposition (if their
unbelief shall cease)--in order to set it over against the other
supposition, of what will happen to the Gentiles if they shall not abide
in the faith--the supposition is turned into an explicit prediction in
the verses following.

[Romans 11:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">rom 11:24</span></span>

For if thou wert cut--"wert cut off"

from the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wast grafted contrary
to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, &c.--This
is just the converse of [Rom 11:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md) :
"As the excision of the merely engrafted Gentiles through unbelief is a
thing much more to be expected than was the excision of the natural
Israel, before it happened; so the restoration of Israel, when they
shall be brought to believe in Jesus, is a thing far more in the line of
what we should expect, than the admission of the Gentiles to a standing
which they never before enjoyed."

[Romans 11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">rom 11:25</span></span>

For I would not . . . that ye should be ignorant of this mystery--The
word "mystery," so often used by our apostle, does not mean (as with us)
something incomprehensible, but "something before kept secret, either
wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed" (compare [Rom
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md); [Co1
2:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#007.md); [Eph
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009.md); [Eph
3:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003.md), [Eph
3:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#009).md).

lest ye should be wise in your own conceits--as if ye alone were in all
time coming to be the family of God.

that blindness--"hardness"

in part is happened to--"hath come upon"

Israel--that is, hath come partially, or upon a portion of Israel.

until the fulness of the Gentiles be--"have"

come in--that is, not the general conversion of the world to Christ, as
many take it; for this would seem to contradict the latter part of this
chapter, and throw the national recovery of Israel too far into the
future: besides, in [Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md), the
apostle seems to speak of the receiving of Israel, not as following, but
as contributing largely to bring about the general conversion of the
world--but, "until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible
Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till
the Gentiles were brought in." (See [Luk
21:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024).md).

[Romans 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">rom 11:26</span></span>

And so all Israel shall be saved--To understand this great statement, as
some still do, merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews,
that there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest
violence both to it and to the whole context. It can only mean the
ultimate ingathering of Israel as a nation, in contrast with the present
"remnant." (So THOLUCK, MEYER, DE WETTE, PHILIPPI, ALFORD, HODGE). Three
confirmations of this now follow: two from the prophets, and a third
from the Abrahamic covenant itself. First, as it is written, There shall
come out of Sion the Deliverer, and

shall--or, according to what seems the true reading, without the
"and"--"He shall"

turn away ungodliness from Jacob--The apostle, having drawn his
illustrations of man's sinfulness chiefly from [Psa
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001.md) and Isa. 59:1-21, now seems to
combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's salvation
from it \[BENGEL\]. In the one place the Psalmist longs to see the
"salvation of Israel coming out of Zion" ([Psa
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007).md); in the other, the prophet
announces that "the Redeemer (or, 'Deliverer') shall come to (or 'for')
Zion" ([Isa 59:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020).md). But as all the
glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as issuing out of
Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory ([Psa
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#002.md); [Psa
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md); [Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009).md), the turn which the apostle
gives to the words merely adds to them that familiar idea. And whereas
the prophet announces that He "shall come to (or, 'for') them that turn
from transgression in Jacob," while the apostle makes Him say that He
shall come "to turn away ungodliness from Jacob," this is taken from the
Septuagint version, and seems to indicate a different reading of the
original text. The sense, however, is substantially the same in both.
Second,

[Romans 11:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">rom 11:27</span></span>

For--rather, "and" (again); introducing a new quotation.

this is my covenant with them--literally, "this is the covenant from me
unto them."

when I shall take away their sins--This, we believe, is rather a brief
summary of [Jer 31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md) than the
express words of any prediction, Those who believe that there are no
predictions regarding the literal Israel in the Old Testament, that
stretch beyond the end of the Jewish economy, are obliged to view these
quotations by the apostle as mere adaptations of Old Testament language
to express his own predictions \[ALEXANDER on Isaiah, &c.\]. But how
forced this is, we shall presently see.

[Romans 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">rom 11:28</span></span>

As concerning the Gospel they are enemies for your sakes--that is, they
are regarded and treated as enemies (in a state of exclusion through
unbelief, from the family of God) for the benefit of you Gentiles; in
the sense of [Rom 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md), [Rom
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md).

but as touching, the election--of Abraham and his seed.

they are beloved--even in their state of exclusion for the fathers'
sakes.

[Romans 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">rom 11:29</span></span>

For the gifts and calling--"and the calling"

of God are without repentance--"not to be," or "cannot be repented of."
By the "calling of God," in this case, is meant that sovereign act by
which God, in the exercise of His free choice, "called" Abraham to be
the father of a peculiar people; while "the gifts of God" here denote
the articles of the covenant which God made with Abraham, and which
constituted the real distinction between his and all other families of
the earth. Both these, says the apostle, are irrevocable; and as the
point for which he refers to this at all is the final destiny of the
Israelitish nation, it is clear that the perpetuity through all time of
the Abrahamic covenant is the thing here affirmed. And lest any should
say that though Israel, as a nation, has no destiny at all under the
Gospel, but as a people disappeared from the stage when the middle wall
of partition was broken down, yet the Abrahamic covenant still endures
in the spiritual seed of Abraham, made up of Jews and Gentiles in one
undistinguished mass of redeemed men under the Gospel--the apostle, as
if to preclude that supposition, expressly states that the very Israel
who, as concerning the Gospel, are regarded as "enemies for the
Gentiles' sakes," are "beloved for the fathers' sakes"; and it is in
proof of this that he adds, "For the gifts and the calling of God are
without repentance." But in what sense are the now unbelieving and
excluded children of Israel "beloved for the fathers' sakes?" Not merely
from ancestral recollections, as one looks with fond interest on the
child of a dear friend for that friend's sake \[DR. ARNOLD\]--a
beautiful thought, and not foreign to Scripture, in this very matter
(see [Ch2 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#007.md); [Isa
41:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#008).md) --but it is from ancestral
connections and obligations, or their lineal descent from and oneness in
covenant with the fathers with whom God originally established it. In
other words, the natural Israel--not "the remnant of them according to
the election of grace," but THE NATION, sprung from Abraham according to
the flesh--are still an elect people, and as such, "beloved." The very
same love which chose the fathers, and rested on the fathers as a parent
stem of the nation, still rests on their descendants at large, and will
yet recover them from unbelief, and reinstate them in the family of God.

[Romans 11:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">rom 11:30</span></span>

For as ye in times past have not believed--or, "obeyed"

God--that is, yielded not to God "the obedience of faith," while
strangers to Christ.

yet now have obtained mercy through--by occasion of

their unbelief--(See on [Rom 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md);
[Rom 11:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md); [Rom
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028).md).

Even so have these--the Jews.

now not believed--or, "now been disobedient"

that through your mercy--the mercy shown to you.

they also may obtain mercy--Here is an entirely new idea. The apostle
has hitherto dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the
faith of the Gentiles--the exclusion of the one occasioning the
reception of the other; a truth yielding to generous, believing Gentiles
but mingled satisfaction. Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he
speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's
recovery; which seems to mean that it will be by the instrumentality of
believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to "look on Him
whom they have pierced and mourn for Him," and so to "obtain mercy."
(See [Co2 3:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015).md).

[Romans 11:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">rom 11:32</span></span>

For God hath concluded them all in unbelief--"hath shut them all up to
unbelief"

that he might have mercy upon all--that is, those "all" of whom he had
been discoursing; the Gentiles first, and after them the Jews
\[FRITZSCHE, THOLUCK, OLSHAUSEN, DE WETTE, PHILIPPI, STUART, HODGE\].
Certainly it is not "all mankind individually" \[MEYER, ALFORD\]; for
the apostle is not here dealing with individuals, but with those great
divisions of mankind, Jew and Gentile. And what he here says is that
God's purpose was to shut each of these divisions of men to the
experience first of an humbled, condemned state, without Christ, and
then to the experience of His mercy in Christ.

[Romans 11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">rom 11:33</span></span>

Oh, the depth, &c.--The apostle now yields himself up to the admiring
contemplation of the grandeur of that divine plan which he had sketched
out.

of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God--Many able
expositors render this, "of the riches and wisdom and knowledge," &c.
\[ERASMUS, GROTIUS, BENGEL, MEYER, DE WETTE, THOLUCK, OLSHAUSEN,
FRITZSCHE, PHILIPPI, ALFORD, Revised Version\]. The words will certainly
bear this sense, "the depth of God's riches." But "the riches of God" is
a much rarer expression with our apostle than the riches of this or that
perfection of God; and the words immediately following limit our
attention to the unsearchableness of God's "judgments," which probably
means His decrees or plans ([Psa
119:75](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#075).md), and of "His ways," or the
method by which He carries these into effect. (So LUTHER, CALVIN, BEZA,
HODGE, &c.). Besides, all that follows to the end of the chapter seems
to show that while the Grace of God to guilty men in Christ Jesus is
presupposed to be the whole theme of this chapter, that which called
forth the special admiration of the apostle, after sketching at some
length the divine purposes and methods in the bestowment of this grace,
was "the depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge" in these
purposes and methods. The "knowledge," then, points probably to the vast
sweep of divine comprehension herein displayed; the "wisdom" to that
fitness to accomplish the ends intended, which is stamped on all this
procedure.

[Romans 11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">rom 11:34</span></span>

For who hath known the mind of the Lord?--See [Job
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#008.md); [Jer
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#018.md).

or who hath been his counsellor--See [Isa
40:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md).

[Romans 11:35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">rom 11:35</span></span>

Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him--"and
shall have recompense made to him"

again--see [Job 35:7](../../../bib/kjv/job035.htm#007.md); [Job
41:11](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011.md). These questions, it will thus
be seen, are just quotations from the Old Testament, as if to show how
familiar to God's ancient people was the great truth which the apostle
himself had just uttered, that God's plans and methods in the
dispensation of His Grace have a reach of comprehension and wisdom
stamped upon them which finite mortals cannot fathom, much less could
ever have imagined, before they were disclosed.

[Romans 11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">rom 11:36</span></span>

For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom--"to
Him"

be glory for ever. Amen--Thus worthily--with a brevity only equalled by
its sublimity--does the apostle here sum up this whole matter. "OF Him
are all things," as their eternal Source: "THROUGH HIM are all things,"
inasmuch as He brings all to pass which in His eternal counsels He
purposed: "To Him are all things," as being His own last End; the
manifestation of the glory of His own perfections being the ultimate,
because the highest possible, design of all His procedure from first to
last.

On this rich chapter, Note, (1) It is an unspeakable consolation to know
that in times of deepest religious declension and most extensive
defection from the truth, the lamp of God has never been permitted to go
out, and that a faithful remnant has ever existed--a remnant larger than
their own drooping spirits could easily believe ([Rom
11:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001)). (2.md) The preservation of this
remnant, even as their separation at the first, is all of mere grace
([Rom 11:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)). (3.md) When individuals
and communities, after many fruitless warnings, are abandoned of God,
they go from bad to worse ([Rom
11:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#007)). (4.md) God has so ordered His
dealings with the great divisions of mankind, "that no flesh should
glory in His presence." Gentile and Jew have each in turn been "shut up
to unbelief," that each in turn may experience the "mercy" which saves
the chief of sinners (Rom. 11:11-32). (5) As we are "justified by
faith," so are we "kept by the power of God through faith"--faith
alone--unto salvation ([Rom 11:20-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020).md).
(6) God's covenant with Abraham and his natural seed is a perpetual
covenant, in equal force under the Gospel as before it. Therefore it is,
that the Jews as a nation still survive, in spite of all the laws which,
in similar circumstances, have either extinguished or destroyed the
identity of other nations. And therefore it is that the Jews as a nation
will yet be restored to the family of God, through the subjection of
their proud hearts to Him whom they have pierced. And as believing
Gentiles will be honored to be the instruments of this stupendous
change, so shall the vast Gentile world reap such benefit from it, that
it shall be like the communication of life to them from the dead. (7)
Thus has the Christian Church the highest motive to the establishment
and vigorous prosecution of missions to the Jews; God having not only
promised that there shall be a remnant of them gathered in every age,
but pledged Himself to the final ingathering of the whole nation
assigned the honor of that ingathering to the Gentile Church, and
assured them that the event, when it does arrive, shall have a
life-giving effect upon the whole world ([Rom
11:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md), [Rom
11:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)). (8.md) Those who think that in
all the evangelical prophecies of the Old Testament the terms "Jacob,"
"Israel," &c., are to be understood solely of the Christian Church,
would appear to read the Old Testament differently from the apostle,
who, from the use of those very terms in Old Testament prophecy, draws
arguments to prove that God has mercy in store for the natural Israel
([Rom 11:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026)). (9.md) Mere intellectual
investigations into divine truth in general, and the sense of the living
oracles in particular, as they have a hardening effect, so they are a
great contrast to the spirit of our apostle, whose lengthened sketch of
God's majestic procedure towards men in Christ Jesus ends here in a
burst of admiration, which loses itself in the still loftier frame of
adoration ([Rom 11:33-36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033).md).
