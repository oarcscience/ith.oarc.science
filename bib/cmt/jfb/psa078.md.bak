### [Psalms Chapter 78](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001.md)

[Psalms 78:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 78:1</span></span>

This Psalm appears to have been occasioned by the removal of the
sanctuary from Shiloh in the tribe of Ephraim to Zion in the tribe of
Judah, and the coincident transfer of pre-eminence in Israel from the
former to the latter tribe, as clearly evinced by David's settlement as
the head of the Church and nation. Though this was the execution of
God's purpose, the writer here shows that it also proceeded from the
divine judgment on Ephraim, under whose leadership the people had
manifested the same sinful and rebellious character which had
distinguished their ancestors in Egypt. (Psa. 78:1-72)

my people . . . my law--the language of a religious teacher ([Psa
78:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#002.md); [Lam
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#014.md); [Rom
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md), [Rom
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027.md); compare [Psa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#004).md). The history which follows was a
"dark saying," or riddle, if left unexplained, and its right
apprehension required wisdom and attention.

[Psalms 78:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 78:3</span></span>

This history had been handed down ([Exo
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#014.md); [Deu
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#020).md) for God's honor, and that the
principles of His law might be known and observed by posterity. This
important sentiment is reiterated in ([Psa
78:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#007).md) negative form.

[Psalms 78:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">psa 78:5</span></span>

testimony-- ([Psa 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#007).md).

[Psalms 78:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 78:8</span></span>

stubborn and rebellious-- ([Deu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#018).md).

set not their heart--on God's service ([Ch2
12:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#014).md).

[Psalms 78:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">psa 78:9</span></span>

The privileges of the first-born which belonged to Joseph ([Ch1
5:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#001).md) were assigned to Ephraim by
Jacob ([Gen 48:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#001).md). The supremacy of
the tribe thus intimated was recognized by its position (in the marching
of the nation to Canaan) next to the ark ([Num
2:18-24](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#018).md), by the selection of the
first permanent locality for the ark within its borders at Shiloh, and
by the extensive and fertile province given for its possession. Traces
of this prominence remained after the schism under Rehoboam, in the use,
by later writers, of Ephraim for Israel (compare [Hos
5:3-14](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#003.md); [Hos
11:3-12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003).md). Though a strong, well-armed
tribe, and, from an early period, emulous and haughty (compare [Jos
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#014.md); [Jdg
8:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#001.md); [Sa2
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#041).md), it appears, in this place,
that it had rather led the rest in cowardice than courage; and had
incurred God's displeasure, because, diffident of His promise, though
often heretofore fulfilled, it had failed as a leader to carry out the
terms of the covenant, by not driving out the heathen ([Exo
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024.md); [Deu
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#016.md); [Kg2
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#015).md).

[Psalms 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 78:12</span></span>

A record of God's dealings and the sins of the people is now made. The
writer gives the history from the exode to the retreat from Kadesh; then
contrasts their sins with their reasons for confidence, shown by a
detail of God's dealings in Egypt, and presents a summary of the
subsequent history to David's time.

Zoan--for Egypt, as its ancient capital ([Num
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md); [Isa
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 78:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 78:15</span></span>

There were two similar miracles ([Exo
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md); [Num
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#011).md).

great depths--and--rivers--denote abundance.

[Psalms 78:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#017.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">psa 78:17</span></span>

yet more--literally, "added to sin," instead of being led to repentance
([Rom 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 78:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#018.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 78:18</span></span>

in their heart-- ([Mat 15:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019).md).

for their lust--literally, "soul," or, "desire."

provoking--and--tempted--illustrated by their absurd doubts,

[Psalms 78:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 78:19</span></span>

in the face of His admitted power.

[Psalms 78:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#021.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 78:21</span></span>

fire--the effect of the "anger" ([Num
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 78:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 78:22</span></span>

(Compare [Heb 8:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 78:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#023.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_023">psa 78:23</span></span>

(Compare [Exo 16:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#011.md); [Num
11:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#004).md).

[Psalms 78:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 78:25</span></span>

angels' food--literally, "bread of the mighty" (compare [Psa
105:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#040).md); so called, as it came from
heaven.

meat--literally, "victuals," as for a journey.

[Psalms 78:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#029.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_029">psa 78:29</span></span>

their . . . desire--what they longed for.

[Psalms 78:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">psa 78:30</span></span>

not estranged . . . lust--or, "desire"--that is, were indulging it.

[Psalms 78:31](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">psa 78:31</span></span>

slew . . . fattest--or, "among the fattest"; some of them--

chosen--the young and strong ([Isa
40:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#031).md), and so none could resist.

[Psalms 78:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">psa 78:33</span></span>

Though there were partial reformations after chastisement, and God, in
pity, withdrew His hand for a time, yet their general conduct was
rebellious, and He was thus provoked to waste and destroy them, by long
and fruitless wandering in the desert.

[Psalms 78:36](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#036.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_036">psa 78:36</span></span>

lied . . . tongues--a feigned obedience ([Psa
18:44](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#044).md).

[Psalms 78:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#037.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 78:37</span></span>

heart . . . not right--or, "firm" (compare [Psa
78:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#008.md); [Psa
51:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 78:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 78:39</span></span>

a wind . . . again--literally, "a breath," thin air (compare [Psa
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016.md); [Jam
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#014).md).

[Psalms 78:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#040.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 78:40</span></span>

There were ten temptations ([Num
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#022).md).

[Psalms 78:41](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#041.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_041">psa 78:41</span></span>

limited--as in [Psa 78:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#019.md). Though
some prefer "grieved" or "provoked." The retreat from Kadesh ([Deu
1:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019).md) is meant, whether--

turned--be for turning back, or to denote repetition of offense.

[Psalms 78:43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_043">psa 78:43</span></span>

wrought--set or held forth.

[Psalms 78:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#046.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 78:46</span></span>

caterpillar--the Hebrew name, from its voracity, and that of--

locust--from its multitude.

[Psalms 78:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#047.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 78:47</span></span>

The additional effects of the storm here mentioned (compare [Exo
9:23-34](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#023).md) are consistent with Moses'
account.

[Psalms 78:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#048.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 78:48</span></span>

31:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#008).md).

[Psalms 78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 78:49</span></span>

evil angels--or, "angels of evil"--many were perhaps employed, and other
evils inflicted.

[Psalms 78:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#050.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 78:50</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">psa 78:51</span></span>

([Gen 49:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#003.md); [Deu
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#017).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">psa 78:52</span></span>

made his . . . forth--or, brought them by periodical journeys (compare
[Exo 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001).md).

border of his sanctuary--or, "holy border"--i. e., region of which--

this mountain--(Zion) was, as the seat of civil and religious
government, the representative, used for the whole land, as afterwards
for the Church ([Isa 25:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006).md).

6:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#011).md).

[Psalms 78:56](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#056.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_056">psa 78:56</span></span>

a deceitful bow--which turns back, and so fails to project the arrow
([Sa2 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#022.md); [Hos
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016).md). They relapsed.

[Psalms 78:58](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#058.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_058">psa 78:58</span></span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_060">psa 78:60</span></span>

tent . . . placed--literally, "caused to dwell," set up ([Jos
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos018.htm#001).md).

[Psalms 78:61](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#061.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_061">psa 78:61</span></span>

his strength--the ark, as symbolical of it ([Psa
96:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#006).md).

[Psalms 78:62](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#062.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_062">psa 78:62</span></span>

gave--or, "shut up."

his people-- ([Psa 78:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#048.md); [Sa1
4:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 78:63](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#063.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_063">psa 78:63</span></span>

fire--either figure of the slaughter ([Sa1
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#010).md), or a literal burning by the
heathen.

given to marriage--literally, "praised"--that is, as brides.

[Psalms 78:64](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#064.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_064">psa 78:64</span></span>

(Compare [Sa1 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017).md); and there were,
doubtless, others.

made no lamentation--either because stupefied by grief, or hindered by
the enemy.

[Psalms 78:65](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#065.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_065">psa 78:65</span></span>

[Psalms 78:66](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#066.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_066">psa 78:66</span></span>

And he smote . . . part--or, "struck His enemies' back." The Philistines
never regained their position after their defeats by David.

[Psalms 78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_067">psa 78:67</span></span>

tabernacle of Joseph--or, "home," or, "tribe," to which--

tribe of Ephraim--is parallel (compare [Rev
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#008).md). Its pre-eminence was, like
Saul's, only permitted. Judah had been the choice ([Gen
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010).md).

[Psalms 78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069.md)

Exalted as--

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_070">psa 78:70</span></span>

God's sovereignty was illustrated in this choice. The contrast is
striking--humility and exaltation--and the correspondence is beautiful.

[Psalms 78:71](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#071.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_071">psa 78:71</span></span>

following . . . ewes, &c.--literally, "ewes giving suck" (compare [Isa
40:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#011).md). On the pastoral terms, compare
[Psa 79:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#013.md).
