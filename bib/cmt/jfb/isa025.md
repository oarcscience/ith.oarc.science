### [Isaiah Chapter 25](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001)

[Isaiah 25:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 25:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER. THANKSGIVING FOR THE
OVERTHROW OF THE APOSTATE FACTION, AND THE SETTING UP OF JEHOVAH'S
THRONE ON ZION. ([Isa 25:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#001))

wonderful-- ([Isa 9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)).

counsels of old-- ([Isa 42:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009); [Isa
46:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa046.htm#010)). Purposes planned long ago;
here, as to the deliverance of His people.

truth--Hebrew, Amen; covenant-keeping, faithful to promises; the
peculiar characteristic of Jesus ([Rev
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#014)).

[Isaiah 25:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 25:2</span></span>

a city . . . heap--Babylon, type of the seat of Antichrist, to be
destroyed in the last days (compare [Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037), with Rev. 18:1-24, followed, as
here, by the song of the saints' thanksgiving in Rev. 19:1-21). "Heaps"
is a graphic picture of Babylon and Nineveh as they now are.

palace--Babylon regarded, on account of its splendor, as a vast palace.
But MAURER translates, "a citadel."

of strangers--foreigners, whose capital pre-eminently Babylon was, the
metropolis of the pagan world. "Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
strangers from the covenants of promise" ([Isa
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#005); [Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012); see in contrast, [Joe
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#017)).

never be built-- ([Isa 13:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#019), &c.).

[Isaiah 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 25:3</span></span>

strong people--This cannot apply to the Jews; but other nations on which
Babylon had exercised its cruelty ([Isa
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#012)) shall worship Jehovah, awed by
the judgment inflicted on Babylon ([Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018)).

city--not Babylon, which shall then be destroyed, but collectively for
the cities of the surrounding nations.

[Isaiah 25:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 25:4</span></span>

the poor . . . needy--the Jews, exiles from their country ([Isa
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#006); [Isa
41:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#017)).

heat--calamity ([Isa 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#006); [Isa
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#002)).

blast--that is, wrath.

storm--a tempest of rain, a winter flood, rushing against and
overthrowing the wall of a house.

[Isaiah 25:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 25:5</span></span>

Translate, "As the heat in a dry land (is brought down by the shadow of
a cloud, so) thou shalt bring down the tumult (the shout of triumph over
their enemies) of strangers (foreigners); and as the heat by the shadow
of the cloud (is brought low), so the branch (the offspring) of the
terrible ones shall be brought low." PARKHURST translates the Hebrew for
"branch," the exulting song. JEROME translates the last clause, "And as
when the heat burns under a cloud, thou shalt make the branch of the
terrible ones to wither"; the branch withering even under the friendly
shade of a cloud typifies the wicked brought to ruin, not for want of
natural means of prosperity, but by the immediate act of God.

[Isaiah 25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 25:6</span></span>

in this mountain--Zion: Messiah's kingdom was to begin, and is to have
its central seat hereafter, at Jerusalem, as the common country of "all
nations" ([Isa 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002), &c.).

all people-- ([Isa 56:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#007); [Dan
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014); [Luk
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#010)).

feast--image of felicity ([Psa
22:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#026); [Mat
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011); [Luk
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#015); [Rev
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#009); compare [Psa
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#008); [Psa
87:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001)).

fat things--delicacies; the rich mercies of God in Christ ([Isa
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#002); [Jer
31:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#014); [Job
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/job036.htm#016)).

wines on the lees--wine which has been long kept on the lees; that is,
the oldest and most generous wine ([Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011)).

marrow--the choicest dainties ([Psa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005)).

well refined--cleared of all dregs.

[Isaiah 25:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 25:7</span></span>

face of . . . covering--image from mourning, in which it was usual to
cover the face with a veil ([Sa2
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#030)). "Face of covering," that is,
the covering itself; as in [Job 41:13](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#013),
"the face of his garment," the garment itself. The covering or veil is
the mist of ignorance as to a future state, and the way to eternal life,
which enveloped the nations ([Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018)) and the unbelieving Jew ([Co2
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015)). The Jew, however, is first to
be converted before the conversion of "all nations"; for it is "in this
mountain," namely, Zion, that the latter are to have the veil taken off
([Psa 102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013), [Psa
102:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#015), [Psa
102:21-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#021); [Rom
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 25:8</span></span>

Quoted in [Co1 15:54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054), in support of
the resurrection.

swallow up . . . in victory--completely and permanently "abolish" ([Ti2
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#010); [Rev
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#014); [Rev
21:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004); compare [Gen
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017); [Gen
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)).

rebuke--(Compare [Mar 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#038); [Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026)).

[Isaiah 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 25:9</span></span>

And it shall be said in that day, &c.--"After death has been swallowed
up for ever, the people of God, who had been delivered from the hand of
death, shall say to the Lord, Lo, this is our God, whom unbelievers
regarded as only a man" \[JEROME\]. "The words are so moulded as to
point us specially to the person of the Son of God, who 'saves' us; as
He vouchsafed to Israel temporal saving, so to His elect He appears for
the purpose of conferring eternal salvation" \[VITRINGA\]. The Jews,
however, have a special share in the words, This is our God (see on [Isa
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#006)).

we have waited--"Waited" is characteristic of God's people in all ages
([Gen 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018); [Tit
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#013)).

we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation--compare [Psa
118:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024), which refers to the second
coming of Jesus (compare [Psa 118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026),
with [Luk 13:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#035)).

[Isaiah 25:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 25:10</span></span>

rest--as its permanent protector; on "hand" in this sense; compare [Ezr
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#006), [Ezr
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/ezr007.htm#028).

Moab--while Israel is being protected, the foe is destroyed; Moab is the
representative of all the foes of God's people.

under him--Rather, "in his own place" or "country" ([Exo
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#023); [Exo
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#029)).

for the dunghill--Rather, "in the water of the dung heap," in which
straw was trodden to make it manure ([Psa
83:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#010)). HORSLEY translates either, "in
the waters of Madmenah," namely, for the making of bricks; or as the
Septuagint, "as the threshing-floor is trampled by the corn-drag" (see
Margin; [Mic 4:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011)).

[Isaiah 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 25:11</span></span>

he--Jehovah shall spread His hands to strike the foe on this side and on
that, with as little effort as a swimmer spreads forth his arms to
cleave a passage through the water \[CALVIN\]. ([Zac
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#003)). LOWTH takes "he" as Moab, who,
in danger of sinking, shall strain every nerve to save himself; but
Jehovah (and "he") shall cause him to sink ("bring down the pride" of
Moab, [Isa 16:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#006)).

with the spoils of . . . hands--literally, "the craftily acquired
spoils" of his (Moab's) hands \[BARNES\]. Moab's pride, as well as the
sudden gripe of his hands (namely, whereby he tries to save himself from
drowning) \[LOWTH\]. "Together with the joints of his hands," that is,
though Moab struggle against Jehovah hand and foot \[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 25:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">isa 25:12</span></span>

fortress--the strongholds of Moab, the representative of the foes of
God's people \[BARNES\]. Babylon \[MAURER\]. The society of infidels
represented as a city ([Rev 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#008)).

As the overthrow of the apostate faction is described in the
twenty-fifth chapter, so the peace of the faithful is here described
under the image of a well-fortified city.
