### [Galatians Chapter 6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

[Galatians 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">gal 6:1</span></span>

EXHORTATIONS CONTINUED; TO FORBEARANCE AND HUMILITY; LIBERALITY TO
TEACHERS AND IN GENERAL. POSTSCRIPT AND BENEDICTION. (Gal. 6:1-18)

Brethren--An expression of kindness to conciliate attention. Translate
as Greek, "If a man even be overtaken" (that is, caught in the very act
\[ALFORD and ELLICOTT\]: BEFORE he expects: unexpectedly). BENGEL
explains the "before" in the Greek compound verb, "If a man be overtaken
in a fault before ourselves": If another has really been overtaken in a
fault the first; for often he who is first to find fault, is the very
one who has first transgressed.

a fault--Greek, "a transgression," "a fall"; such as a falling back into
legal bondage. Here he gives monition to those who have not so fallen,
"the spiritual," to be not "vainglorious" ([Gal
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#026)), but forbearing to such ([Rom
15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001)).

restore--The Greek is used of a dislocated limb, reduced to its place.
Such is the tenderness with which we should treat a fallen member of the
Church in restoring him to a better state.

the spirit of meekness--the meekness which is the gift of the Holy
Spirit working in our spirit ([Gal
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#022), [Gal
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025)). "Meekness" is that temper of
spirit towards God whereby we accept His dealings without disputing;
then, towards men, whereby we endure meekly their provocations, and do
not withdraw ourselves from the burdens which their sins impose upon us
\[TRENCH\].

considering thyself--Transition from the plural to the singular. When
congregations are addressed collectively, each individual should take
home the monition to himself.

thou also be tempted--as is likely to happen to those who reprove others
without meekness (compare [Mat 7:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002);
[Ti2 2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025); [Jam
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)).

[Galatians 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">gal 6:2</span></span>

If ye, legalists, must "bear burdens," then instead of legal burdens
([Mat 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#004)), "bear one another's
burdens," literally, "weights." Distinguished by BENGEL from "burden,"
[Gal 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004) (a different Greek word,
"load"): "weights" exceed the strength of those under them; "burden" is
proportioned to the strength.

so fulfil--or as other old manuscripts read, "so ye will fulfil," Greek,
"fill up," "thoroughly fulfil."

the law of Christ--namely, "love" ([Gal
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014)). Since ye desire "the law," then
fulfil the law of Christ, which is not made up of various minute
observances, but whose sole "burden" is "love" ([Joh
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034); [Joh
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012)); [Rom
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003) gives Christ as the example in
the particular duty here.

[Galatians 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">gal 6:3</span></span>

Self-conceit, the chief hindrance to forbearance and sympathy towards
our fellow men, must be laid aside.

something--possessed of some spiritual pre-eminence, so as to be exempt
from the frailty of other men.

when he is nothing--The Greek is subjective: "Being, if he would come to
himself, and look on the real fact, nothing" \[ALFORD\] ([Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002), [Gal
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006); [Rom
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003); [Co1
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#002)).

deceiveth himself--literally, "he mentally deceives himself." Compare
[Jam 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#026), "deceiveth his own heart."

[Galatians 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">gal 6:4</span></span>

his own work--not merely his own opinion of himself.

have rejoicing in himself alone--Translate, "Have his (matter for)
glorying in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another
(namely, not in regard to his neighbor, by comparing himself with whom,
he has fancied he has matter for boasting as that neighbor's superior)."
Not that really a man by looking to "himself alone" is likely to find
cause for glorying in himself. Nay, in [Gal
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005), he speaks of a "burden" or load,
not of matter for glorying, as what really belongs to each man. But he
refers to the idea those whom he censures had of themselves: they
thought they had cause for "glorying" in themselves, but it all arose
from unjust self-conceited comparison of themselves with others, instead
of looking at home. The only true glorying, if glorying it is to be
called, is in the testimony of a good conscience, glorying in the cross
of Christ.

[Galatians 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">gal 6:5</span></span>

For (by this way, [Gal 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004), of proving
himself, not depreciating his neighbor by comparison) each man shall
bear his own "burden," or rather, "load" (namely, of sin and infirmity),
the Greek being different from that in [Gal
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002). This verse does not contradict
[Gal 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002). There he tells them to bear
with others' "burdens" of infirmity in sympathy; here, that
self-examination will make a man to feel he has enough to do with "his
own load" of sin, without comparing himself boastfully with his
neighbor. Compare [Gal 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003). Instead of
"thinking himself to be something," he shall feel the "load" of his own
sin: and this will lead him to bear sympathetically with his neighbor's
burden of infirmity. Ã†SOP says a man carries two bags over his
shoulder, the one with his own sins hanging behind, that with his
neighbor's sins in front.

[Galatians 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">gal 6:6</span></span>

From the mention of bearing one another's burdens, he passes to one way
in which those burdens may be borne--by ministering out of their earthly
goods to their spiritual teachers. The "but" in the Greek, beginning of
this verse, expresses this: I said, Each shall bear his own burden; BUT
I do not intend that he should not think of others, and especially of
the wants of his ministers.

communicate unto him--"impart a share unto his teacher": literally, "him
that teacheth catechetically."

in all good things--in every kind of the good things of this life,
according as the case may require ([Rom
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#027); [Co1
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011), [Co1
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014)).

[Galatians 6:7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">gal 6:7</span></span>

God is not mocked--The Greek verb is, literally, to sneer with the
nostrils drawn up in contempt. God does not suffer Himself to be imposed
on by empty words: He will judge according to works, which are seeds
sown for eternity of either joy or woe. Excuses for illiberality in
God's cause ([Gal 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006)) seem valid
before men, but are not so before God ([Psa
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#021)).

soweth--especially of his resources ([Co2
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#006)).

that--Greek, "this"; this and nothing else.

reap--at the harvest, the end of the world ([Mat
13:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#039)).

[Galatians 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">gal 6:8</span></span>

Translate, "He that soweth unto his own flesh," with a view to
fulfilling its desires. He does not say, "His spirit," as he does say,
"His flesh." For in ourselves we are not spiritual, but carnal. The
flesh is devoted to selfishness.

corruption--that is, destruction ([Phi
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#019)). Compare as to the deliverance
of believers from "corruption" ([Rom
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021)). The use of the term
"corruption" instead, implies that destruction is not an arbitrary
punishment of fleshly-mindedness, but is its natural fruit; the corrupt
flesh producing corruption, which is another word for destruction:
corruption is the fault, and corruption the punishment (see on [Co1
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017); [Pe2
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#012)). Future life only expands the
seed sown here. Men cannot mock God because they can deceive themselves.
They who sow tares cannot reap wheat. They alone reap life eternal who
sow to the Spirit ([Psa 126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006); [Pro
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#018); [Pro
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#008); [Hos
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#007); [Hos
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#012); [Luk
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025); [Rom
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011); [Jam
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#007)).

[Galatians 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">gal 6:9</span></span>

([Th2 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013)). And when we do good, let
us also persevere in it without fainting.

in due season--in its own proper season, God's own time ([Ti1
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#015)).

faint not--literally, "be relaxed." Stronger than "be not weary." Weary
of well-doing refers to the will; "faint not" to relaxation of the
powers \[BENGEL\]. No one should faint, as in an earthly harvest
sometimes happens.

[Galatians 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">gal 6:10</span></span>

Translate, "So then, according as (that is, in proportion as) we have
season (that is, opportunity), let us work (a distinct Greek verb from
that for "do," in [Gal 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009)) that which
is (in each case) good." As thou art able, and while thou art able, and
when thou art able ([Ecc 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#010)). We
have now the "season" for sowing, as also there will be hereafter the
"due season" ([Gal 6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009)) for reaping.
The whole life is, in one sense, the "seasonable opportunity" to us:
and, in a narrower sense, there occur in it more especially convenient
seasons. The latter are sometimes lost in looking for still more
convenient seasons ([Act 24:25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025)). We
shall not always have the opportunity "we have" now. Satan is sharpened
to the greater zeal in injuring us, by the shortness of his time ([Rev
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#012)). Let us be sharpened to the
greater zeal in well-doing by the shortness of ours.

them who are of the household--Every right-minded man does well to the
members of his own family ([Ti1 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008));
so believers are to do to those of the household of faith, that is,
those whom faith has made members of "the household of God" ([Eph
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019)): "the house of God" ([Ti1
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015); [Pe1
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)).

[Galatians 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">gal 6:11</span></span>

Rather, "See in how large letters I have written." The Greek is
translated "how great" in [Heb 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#004),
the only other passage where it occurs in the New Testament. Owing to
his weakness of eyes ([Gal 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015)) he
wrote in large letters. So JEROME. All the oldest manuscripts are
written in uncial, that is, capital letters, the "cursive," or small
letters, being of more recent date. Paul seems to have had a difficulty
in writing, which led him to make the uncial letters larger than
ordinary writers did. The mention of these is as a token by which they
would know that he wrote the whole Epistle with his own hand; as he did
also the pastoral Epistle, which this Epistle resembles in style. He
usually dictated his Epistles to an amanuensis, excepting the concluding
salutation, which he wrote himself ([Rom
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022); [Co1
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#021)). This letter, he tells the
Galatians, he writes with his own hand, no doubt in order that they may
see what a regard he had for them, in contrast to the Judaizing teachers
([Gal 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012)), who sought only their own
ease. If English Version be retained, the words, "how large a letter
(literally, 'in how large letters')," will not refer to the length of
the Epistle absolutely, but that it was a large one for him to have
written with his own hand. NEANDER supports English Version, as more
appropriate to the earnestness of the apostle and the tone of the
Epistle: "How large" will thus be put for "how many."

[Galatians 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">gal 6:12</span></span>

Contrast between his zeal in their behalf, implied in [Gal
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011), and the zeal for self on the
part of the Judaizers.

make a fair show-- ([Co2 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#012)).

in the flesh--in outward things.

they--it is "these" who

constrain you--by example ([Gal 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013))
and importuning.

only lest--"only that they may not," &c. (compare [Gal
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#011)).

suffer persecution--They escaped in a great degree the Jews' bitterness
against Christianity and the offense of the cross of Christ, by making
the Mosaic law a necessary preliminary; in fact, making Christian
converts into Jewish proselytes.

[Galatians 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">gal 6:13</span></span>

Translate, "For not even do they who submit to circumcision, keep the
law themselves ([Rom 2:17-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017)), but
they wish you (emphatical) to be circumcised," &c. They arbitrarily
selected circumcision out of the whole law, as though observing it would
stand instead of their non-observance of the rest of the law.

that they may glory in your flesh--namely, in the outward change
(opposed to an inward change wrought by the SPIRIT) which they have
effected in bringing you over to their own Jewish-Christian party.

[Galatians 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">gal 6:14</span></span>

Translate, "But as for me (in opposition to those gloriers 'in your
flesh,' [Gal 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013)), God forbid that
I," &c.

in the cross--the atoning death on the cross. Compare [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003), [Phi
3:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#007), as a specimen of his glorying.
The "cross," the great object of shame to them, and to all carnal men,
is the great object of glorying to me. For by it, the worst of deaths,
Christ has destroyed all kinds of death \[AUGUSTINE, Tract 36, on John,
sec. 4\]. We are to testify the power of Christ's death working in us,
after the manner of crucifixion ([Gal
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#024); [Rom
6:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005)).

our--He reminds the Galatians by this pronoun, that they had a share in
the "Lord Jesus Christ" (the full name is used for greater solemnity),
and therefore ought to glory in Christ's cross, as he did.

the world--inseparably allied to the "flesh" ([Gal
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013)). Legal and fleshly ordinances
are merely outward, and "elements of the world" ([Gal
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003)).

is--rather, as Greek, "has been crucified to me" ([Gal
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)). He used "crucified" for dead
([Col 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#020), "dead with Christ"), to
imply his oneness with Christ crucified ([Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010)): "the fellowship of His
sufferings being made conformable unto His death."

[Galatians 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">gal 6:15</span></span>

availeth--The oldest manuscripts read, "is" (compare [Gal
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006)). Not only are they of no avail,
but they are nothing. So far are they from being matter for "glorying,"
that they are "nothing." But Christ's cross is "all in all," as a
subject for glorying, in "the new creature" ([Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010), [Eph
2:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015)).

new creature-- ([Co2 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)). A
transformation by the renewal of the mind ([Rom
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002)).

[Galatians 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">gal 6:16</span></span>

as many--contrasting with the "as many," [Gal
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012).

rule--literally, a straight rule, to detect crookedness; so a rule of
life.

peace--from God ([Eph 2:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014); [Eph
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023)).

mercy-- ([Rom 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009)).

Israel of God--not the Israel after the flesh, among whom those teachers
wish to enrol you; but the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith ([Gal
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009), [Gal
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029); [Rom
2:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028); [Phi
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003)).

[Galatians 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_017">gal 6:17</span></span>

let no man trouble me--by opposing my apostolic authority, seeing that
it is stamped by a sure seal, namely, "I (in contrast to the Judaizing
teachers who gloried in the flesh) bear (as a high mark of honor from
the King of kings)."

the marks--properly, marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners.
So Paul's scars of wounds received for Christ's sake, indicate to whom
he belongs, and in whose free and glorious service he is ([Co2
11:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)). The Judaizing teachers
gloried in the circumcision mark in the flesh of their followers: Paul
glories in the marks of suffering for Christ on his own body (compare
[Gal 6:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014); [Phi
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010); [Col
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024)).

the Lord--omitted in the oldest manuscripts.

[Galatians 6:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">gal 6:18</span></span>

Brethren--Place it, as Greek, "last" in the sentence, before the "Amen."
After much rebuke and monition, he bids them farewell with the loving
expression of brotherhood as his last parting word (see on [Gal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)).

be with your spirit--which, I trust, will keep down the flesh ([Th1
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023); [Ti2
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022); [Plm
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#025)).
