### [Jeremiah Chapter 51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

[Jeremiah 51:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">jer 51:1</span></span>

CONTINUATION OF THE PROPHECY AGAINST BABYLON BEGUN IN THE FIFTIETH
CHAPTER. (Jer. 51:1-64)

in the midst of them that rise . . . against me--literally, "in the
heart" of them. Compare [Psa 46:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002.md),
"the midst of the sea," Margin; [Eze
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#004.md), "the heart of the seas"; Margin;
[Mat 12:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#040.md). In the center of the
Chaldeans. "Against Me," because they persecute My people. The
cabalistic mode of interpreting Hebrew words (by taking the letters in
the inverse order of the alphabet, the last letter representing the
first, and so on, [Jer 25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md) would
give the very word Chaldeans here; but the mystical method cannot be
intended, as "Babylon" is plainly so called in the immediately preceding
parallel clause.

wind--God needs not warlike weapons to "destroy" His foes; a wind or
blast is sufficient; though, no doubt, the "wind" here is the invading
host of Medes and Persians ([Jer 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md);
[Kg2 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#007).md).

[Jeremiah 51:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">jer 51:2</span></span>

fanners--(See on [Jer 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007).md). The
farmers separate the wheat from the chaff; so God's judgments shall
sweep away guilty Babylon as chaff ([Psa
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 51:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">jer 51:3</span></span>

Against him that bendeth--namely, the bow; that is, the Babylonian
archer.

let the archer bend--that is, the Persian archer ([Jer
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004).md). The Chaldean version and
JEROME, by changing the vowel points, read, "Let not him (the
Babylonian) who bendeth his bow bend it." But the close of the verse is
addressed to the Median invaders; therefore it is more likely that the
first part of the verse is addressed to them, as in English Version, not
to the Babylonians, to warn them against resistance as vain, as in the
Chaldean version. The word "bend" is thrice repeated: "Against him that
bendeth let him that bendeth bend," to imply the utmost straining of the
bow.

[Jeremiah 51:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">jer 51:4</span></span>

(See on [Jer 49:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#026.md); [Jer
50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md); [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037).md).

[Jeremiah 51:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">jer 51:5</span></span>

forsaken--as a widow (Hebrew). Israel is not severed from her husband,
Jehovah ([Isa 54:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005).md), by a perpetual
divorce.

though . . . sin--though the land of Israel has been filled with sin,
that is, with the punishment of their sin, devastation. But, as the
Hebrew means "for," or "and therefore," not "though," translate, "and
therefore their (the Chaldeans') land has been filled with (the penal
consequences of) their sin" \[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">jer 51:6</span></span>

Warning to the Israelite captives to flee from Babylon, lest they should
be involved in the punishment of her "iniquity." So as to spiritual
Babylon and her captives ([Rev 18:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 51:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">jer 51:7</span></span>

Babylon is compared to a cup, because she was the vessel in the hand of
God, to make drunken with His vengeance the other peoples ([Jer
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md); [Jer
25:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015).md). Compare as to spiritual
Babylon, [Rev 14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); [Rev
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#004.md). The cup is termed "golden," to
express the splendor and opulence of Babylon; whence also in the image
seen by Nebuchadnezzar ([Dan 2:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#038).md) the
head representing Babylon is of gold (compare [Isa
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 51:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">jer 51:8</span></span>

Her friends and confederates, who behold her fall, are invited to her
aid. They reply, her case is incurable, and that they must leave her to
her fate. ([Isa 21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009.md); [Rev
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#008.md); [Rev
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#002.md), [Rev
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#009).md).

balm-- ([Jer 8:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#022.md); [Jer
46:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#011).md).

[Jeremiah 51:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">jer 51:9</span></span>

We would have healed--We attempted to heal.

her judgment--her crimes provoking God's "judgments" \[GROTIUS\].

reacheth unto heaven-- ([Gen 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#021.md);
[Jon 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jon001.htm#002.md); [Rev
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#005).md). Even the heathen nations
perceive that her awful fall must be God's judgment for her crying sins
([Psa 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md); [Psa
64:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#009).md).

[Jeremiah 51:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">jer 51:10</span></span>

Next after the speech of the confederates of Babylon, comes that of the
Jews celebrating with thanksgivings the promise-keeping faithfulness of
their covenant God.

brought forth, &c.-- ([Psa 37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006).md).

our righteousness--not the Jews' merits, but God's faithfulness to
Himself and to His covenant, which constituted the "righteousness" of
His people, that is, their justification in their controversy with
Babylon, the cruel enemy of God and His people. Compare [Jer
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#006.md), "The Lord our righteousness";
[Mic 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md). Their righteousness is His
righteousness.

declare in Zion-- ([Psa 102:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013).md).

[Jeremiah 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">jer 51:11</span></span>

Make bright--literally, "pure." Polish and sharpen.

gather--literally, "fill"; that is, gather in full number, so that none
be wanting. So, "gave in full tale" ([Sa1
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#027).md). GESENIUS, not so well,
translates, "Fill with your bodies the shields" (compare [Sol
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/sol004.htm#004).md). He means to tell the
Babylonians, Make what preparations you will, all will be in vain
(compare [Jer 46:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#003).md).

kings of . . . Medes--He names the Medes rather than the Persians,
because Darius, or Cyaxares, was above Cyrus in power and the greatness
of his kingdom.

temple-- ([Jer 50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028).md).

[Jeremiah 51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">jer 51:12</span></span>

With all your efforts, your city shall be taken.

standard--to summon the defenders together to any point threatened by
the besiegers.

[Jeremiah 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_013">jer 51:13</span></span>

waters-- ([Jer 51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md), [Jer
51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md); see on [Isa
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#001).md). The Euphrates surrounded the
city and, being divided into many channels, formed islands. Compare as
to spiritual Babylon "waters," that is, "many peoples," [Rev
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#001.md), [Rev
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev017.htm#015.md). A large lake also was near
Babylon.

measure--literally, "cubit," which was the most common measure, and
therefore is used for a measure in general. The time for putting a limit
to thy covetousness \[GESENIUS\]. There is no "and" in the Hebrew:
translate, "thine end, the retribution for thy covetousness"
\[GROTIUS\]. MAURER takes the image to be from weaving: "the cubit where
thou art to be cut off"; for the web is cut off, when the required
number of cubits is completed ([Isa
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#012).md).

[Jeremiah 51:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#014.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_014">jer 51:14</span></span>

by himself--literally, "by His soul" ([Sa2
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#021.md); [Heb
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013).md).

fill . . . with caterpillars--locusts ([Nah
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015).md). Numerous as are the citizens of
Babylon, the invaders shall be more numerous.

[Jeremiah 51:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">jer 51:15</span></span>

Repeated from [Jer 10:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#012.md); except
that "Israel" is not in the Hebrew of [Jer
51:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#019.md), which ought, therefore, to be
translated, "He is the Former of all things, and (therefore) of the rod
of His inheritance" (that is, of the nation peculiarly His own). In the
tenth chapter the contrast is between the idols and God; here it is
between the power of populous Babylon and that of God: "Thou dwellest
upon many waters" ([Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013).md); but
God can, by merely "uttering His voice," create "many waters" ([Jer
51:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#016).md). The "earth" (in its material
aspect) is the result of His "power"; the "world" (viewed in its orderly
system) is the result of His "wisdom," &c. ([Jer
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#015).md). Such an Almighty Being can be
at no loss for resources to effect His purpose against Babylon.

[Jeremiah 51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">jer 51:20</span></span>

(See on [Jer 50:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023).md). "Break in pieces"
refers to the "hammer" there (compare [Nah
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#001), Margin.md). The club also was often
used by ancient warriors.

[Jeremiah 51:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#022.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">jer 51:22</span></span>

old and young-- ([Ch2 36:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#017).md).

[Jeremiah 51:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#024.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_024">jer 51:24</span></span>

The detail of particulars ([Jer
51:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020).md) is in order to express the
indiscriminate slaughters perpetrated by Babylon on Zion, which, in just
retribution, are all to befall her in turn ([Jer
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md), [Jer
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029).md).

in your sight--addressed to the Jews.

[Jeremiah 51:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#025.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">jer 51:25</span></span>

destroying mountain--called so, not from its position, for it lay low
([Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); [Gen
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#002.md), [Gen
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009).md), but from its eminence above
other nations, many of which it had "destroyed"; also, because of its
lofty palaces, towers, hanging gardens resting on arches, and walls,
fifty royal cubits broad and two hundred high.

roll thee down from the rocks--that is, from thy rock-like
fortifications and walls.

burnt mountain-- ([Rev 8:8](../../../bib/kjv/rev008.htm#008).md). A
volcano, which, after having spent itself in pouring its "destroying"
lava on all the country around, falls into the vacuum and becomes
extinct, the surrounding "rocks" alone marking where the crater had
been. Such was the appearance of Babylon after its destruction, and as
the pumice stones of the volcano are left in their place, being unfit
for building, so Babylon should never rise from its ruins.

[Jeremiah 51:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#026.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">jer 51:26</span></span>

corner . . . stone . . . foundations--The corner-stone was the most
important one in the building, the foundation-stones came next in
importance ([Eph 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020).md). So the sense
is, even as there shall be no stones useful for building left of thee,
so no leading prince, or governors, shall come forth from thy
inhabitants.

[Jeremiah 51:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#027.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_027">jer 51:27</span></span>

([Jer 50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029).md). As in [Jer
51:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#012.md) the Babylonians were told to
"set up the standard," so here her foes are told to do so: the latter,
to good purpose; the former, in vain.

Ararat--Upper or Major Armenia, the regions about Mount Ararat.

Minni--Lower or Lesser Armenia. RAWLINSON says that Van was the capital
of Minni. It was conquered by Tettarrassa, the general of Tetembar II,
the Assyrian king whose wars are recorded on the black obelisk now in
the British Museum.

Ashchenaz--a descendant of Japheth ([Gen
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#003).md), who gave his name to the sea
now called the Black Sea; the region bordering on it is probably here
meant, namely, Asia Minor, including places named Ascania in Phrygia and
Bithynia. Cyrus had subdued Asia Minor and the neighboring regions, and
from these he drew levies in proceeding against Babylon.

rough caterpillars--The horsemen in multitude, and in appearance
bristling with javelins and with crests, resemble "rough caterpillars,"
or locusts of the hairy-crested kind ([Nah
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015).md).

[Jeremiah 51:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#028.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">jer 51:28</span></span>

kings of . . . Medes-- ([Jer 51:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#011).md).
The satraps and tributary kings under Darius, or Cyaxares.

his dominion--the king of Media's dominion.

land shall tremble . . . every purpose of . . . Lord shall be
performed--elegant antithesis between the trembling of the land or
earth, and the stability of "every purpose of the Lord" (compare [Psa
46:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#001).md).

[Jeremiah 51:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#030.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_030">jer 51:30</span></span>

forborne to fight--for the city was not taken by force of arms, but by
stratagem, according to the counsel given to Cyrus by two eunuchs of
Belshazzar who deserted.

remained in . . . holds--not daring to go forth to fight; many, with
Nabonidus, withdrew to the fortified city Borsippa.

[Jeremiah 51:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#031.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_031">jer 51:31</span></span>

(See on [Jer 50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024).md).

One post--One courier after another shall announce the capture of the
city. The couriers despatched from the walls, where Cyrus enters, shall
"meet" those sent by the king. Their confused running to and fro would
result from the sudden panic at the entrance of Cyrus into the city,
which he had so long besieged ineffectually; the Babylonians had laughed
at his attempts and were feasting at the time without fear.

taken at one end--which was not known for a long time to the king and
his courtiers feasting in the middle of the city; so great was its
extent that, when the city was already three days in the enemy's hands,
the fact was not known in some parts of the city \[ARISTOTLE, Politics,
3.2\].

[Jeremiah 51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_032">jer 51:32</span></span>

passages are stopped--The guarded fords of the Euphrates are occupied by
the enemy (see on [Jer 50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038).md).

reeds . . . burned--literally, "the marsh." After draining off the
river, Cyrus "burned" the stockade of dense tree-like "reeds" on its
banks, forming the outworks of the city's fortifications. The burning of
these would give the appearance of the marsh or river itself being on
"fire."

[Jeremiah 51:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#033.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_033">jer 51:33</span></span>

like a threshing-floor, it is time to thresh her--rather, "like a
threshing-floor at the time of threshing," or "at the time when it is
trodden." The treading, or threshing, here put before the harvest, out
of the natural order, because the prominent thought is the treading down
or destruction of Babylon. In the East the treading out of the corn took
place only at harvest-time. Babylon is like a threshing-floor not
trodden for a long time; but the time of harvest, when her citizens
shall be trodden under foot, shall come \[CALVIN\]. "Like a
threshing-floor full of corn, so is Babylon now full of riches, but the
time of harvest shall come, when all her prosperity shall be cut off"
\[LUDOVICUS DE DIEU\]. GROTIUS distinguishes the "harvest" from the
"threshing"; the former is the slaying of her citizens, the latter the
pillaging and destruction of the city (compare [Joe
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#013.md); [Rev
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#015.md), [Rev
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#018).md).

[Jeremiah 51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_034">jer 51:34</span></span>

me--Zion speaks. Her groans are what bring down retribution in kind on
Babylon ([Jer 50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md); [Psa
102:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#013.md), [Psa
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md), [Psa
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020).md).

empty vessel--He has drained me out.

dragon--The serpent often "swallows" its prey whole; or a sea monster
\[GROTIUS\].

filled his belly . . . cast me out--like a beast, which, having "filled"
himself to satiety, "casts out" the rest \[CALVIN\]. After filling all
his storehouses with my goods, he has cast me out of this land
\[GROTIUS\].

[Jeremiah 51:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#035.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">jer 51:35</span></span>

my flesh--which Nebuchadnezzar hath "devoured" ([Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034).md). Zion thus calls her kinsmen
([Rom 11:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014).md) slain throughout the
country or carried captives to Babylon \[GROTIUS\]. Or, as "my blood"
follows, it and "my flesh" constitute the whole man: Zion, in its
totality, its citizens and all its substance, have been a prey to
Babylon's violence ([Psa 137:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#008).md).

[Jeremiah 51:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#036.md)

sea--the Euphrates ([Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); [Jer
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038).md). Compare [Isa

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">jer 51:38</span></span>

The capture of Babylon was effected on the night of a festival in honor
of its idols.

roar . . . yell--The Babylonians were shouting in drunken revelry
(compare [Dan 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan005.htm#004).md).

[Jeremiah 51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">jer 51:39</span></span>

In their heat I will make their feasts--In the midst of their being
heated with wine, I will give them "their" potions,--a very different
cup to drink, but one which is their due, the wine cup of My stupefying
wrath ([Jer 25:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md); [Jer
49:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#012.md); [Isa
51:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#017.md); [Lam

midst of their jubilant exultation sleep the sleep of death ([Jer

Sheshach--Babylon (compare Note, see [Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026).md); called so from the goddess
Shach, to whom a five days' festival was kept, during which, as in the
Roman Saturnalia, the most unbridled licentiousness was permitted;
slaves ruled their masters, and in every house one called Zogan, arrayed
in a royal garment, was chosen to rule all the rest. He calls Babylon
"Sheshach," to imply that it was during this feast the city was taken
\[SCALIGER\].

The sea--the host of Median invaders. The image (compare [Jer
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md); [Isa
8:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007).md) is appropriately taken from the
Euphrates, which, overflowing in spring, is like a "sea" near Babylon
([Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md), [Jer
51:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#032.md), [Jer

Her cities--the cities, her dependencies. So, "Jerusalem and the cities
thereof" ([Jer 34:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001).md). Or, the "cities"
are the inner and outer cities, the two parts into which Babylon was
divided by the Euphrates \[GROTIUS\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_044">jer 51:44</span></span>

Bel . . . swallowed--in allusion to the many sacrifices to the idol
which its priests pretended it swallowed at night; or rather, the
precious gifts taken from other nations and offered to it (which it is
said to have "swallowed"; compare "devoured," "swallowed," [Jer
51:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#034.md); [Jer
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017).md), which it should have to
disgorge (compare [Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013.md); [Jer
50:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#037).md). Of these gifts were the
vessels of Jehovah's temple in Jerusalem ([Ch2
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#007.md); [Dan
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#002).md). The restoration of these, as
foretold here, is recorded in [Ezr
1:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#007.md).

flow--as a river; fitly depicting the influx of pilgrims of all
"nations" to the idol.

13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md); [Deu
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#012.md). "And in order that your heart
may not faint at the (first) rumor" (of war), I will give you some
intimation of the time. In the first "year" there shall "come a rumor"
that Cyrus is preparing for war against Babylon. "After that, in another
year, shall come a rumor," namely, that Cyrus is approaching, and has
already entered Assyria. Then is your time to "go out" ([Jer
51:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#045).md). Babylon was taken the
following or third year of Belshazzar's reign \[GROTIUS\].

rulers in a short space. Belshazzar and Nabonidus, supplanted by Darius
or Cyaxares, who is succeeded by Cyrus.

confounded--at seeing their gods powerless to help them.

her slain--in retribution for "Israel's slain" ([Jer
51:49](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#049).md) who fell by her hand. GROTIUS
translates, "her dancers," as in [Jdg
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#021.md), [Jdg
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#023.md); [Sa1
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006.md), the same Hebrew word is
translated, alluding to the dancing revelry of the festival during which
Cyrus took Babylon.

Babylon made this its one aim to fill all places with the slain of
Israel, so at Babylon shall all the slain of that whole land (not as
English Version, "of all the earth") \[MAURER\]. HENDERSON translates,
"Babylon also shall fall, ye slain of Israel. Those also of Babylon
shall fall, O ye slain of all the earth." But, "in the midst of her,"
[Jer 51:47](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#047.md), plainly answers to "at
Babylon," [Jer 51:49](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#049.md), English Version.

[Jeremiah 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_051">jer 51:51</span></span>

The prophet anticipates the Jews' reply; I know you will say in despair,
"We are confounded," &c. "Wherefore (God saith to you) behold, I will,"
&c. ([Jer 51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052).md) \[CALVIN\]. I prefer
taking [Jer 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051.md) as the prayer which
the Jews are directed to offer in exile ([Jer
51:50](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#050).md), "let Jerusalem come into your
mind" (and say in prayer to God), "We are confounded." This view is
confirmed by [Psa 44:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md); [Psa
79:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#004.md); [Psa
102:17-20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md); [Isa
62:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#006.md).

for strangers--The "reproach," which especially has stung us, came when
they taunted us with the fact that they had burned the temple, our
peculiar glory, as though our religion was a thing of naught.

[Jeremiah 51:52](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#052.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">jer 51:52</span></span>

Wherefore--because of these sighs of the Jews directed to God ([Jer

I . . . judgment upon . . . images--in opposition to the Babylonian
taunt that Jehovah's religion was a thing of naught, since they had
burned His temple ([Jer 51:51](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#051).md): I will
show that, though I have thus visited the Jews neglect of Me, yet those
gods of Babylon cannot save themselves, much less their votaries, who
shall "through all her land" lie and "groan" with wounds.

We are not to measure God's power by what seems to our perceptions
natural or probable. Compare [Oba 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md)
as to Edom ([Amo 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002).md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_055">jer 51:55</span></span>

great voice--Where once was the great din of a mighty city. there shall
be the silence of death \[VATABLUS\]. Or, the "great voice" of the
revellers ([Jer 51:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#038.md); [Isa
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#002).md). Or, the voice of mighty
boasting \[CALVIN\], (compare [Jer
51:53](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#053).md).

her waves--"when" her calamities shall cause her to give forth a widely
different "voice," even such a one as the waves give that lash the
shores ([Jer 51:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#042).md) \[GROTIUS\]. Or,
"when" is connected thus: "the great voice" in her, when her "waves,"
&c. (compare [Jer 51:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#013).md). CALVIN
translates, "their waves," that is, the Medes bursting on her as
impetuous waves; so [Jer 51:42](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#042.md). But
the parallel, "a great voice," belongs to her, therefore the wave-like
"roar" of "their voice" ought also belong to her (compare [Jer
51:54](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#054).md). The "great voice" of
commercial din, boasting, and feasting, is "destroyed"; but in its stead
there is the wave-like roar of her voice in her "destruction" ([Jer
51:54](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#054).md).

broad walls--eighty-seven feet broad \[ROSENMULLER\]; fifty cubits
\[GROTIUS\]. A chariot of four horses abreast could meet another on it
without collision. The walls were two hundred cubits high, and four
hundred and eighty-five stadia, or sixty miles in extent.

gates--one hundred in number, of brass; twenty-five on each of the four
sides, the city being square; between the gates were two hundred and
fifty towers. BEROSUS says triple walls encompassed the outer, and the
same number the inner city. Cyrus caused the outer walls to be
demolished. Taking the extent of the walls to be three hundred and
sixty-five stadia, as DIODORUS states, it is said two hundred thousand
men completed a stadium each day, so that the whole was completed in one
year.

labour . . . in the fire--The event will show that the builders of the
walls have "labored" only for the "fire" in which they shall be
consumed, "In the fire" answers to the parallel, "burned with fire."
Translate, "shall have labored in vain," &c. Compare [Job
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#014.md), "built desolate places for
themselves," that is, grand places, soon about to be desolate ruins.

A special copy of the prophecy prepared by Jeremiah was delivered to
Seraiah, to console the Jews in their Babylonian exile. Though he was to
throw it into the Euphrates, a symbol of Babylon's fate, no doubt he
retained the substance in memory, so as to be able orally to communicate
it to his countrymen.

went with Zedekiah--rather, "in behalf of Zedekiah"; sent by Zedekiah to
appease Nebuchadnezzar's anger at his revolt \[CALVIN\].

fourth year--so that Jeremiah's prediction of Babylon's downfall was
thus solemnly written and sealed by a symbolical action, six whole years
before the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.

quiet prince--Compare [Ch1 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#009.md), "a
man of rest." Seraiah was not one of the courtiers hostile to God's
prophets, but "quiet" and docile; ready to execute Jeremiah's
commission, notwithstanding the risk attending it. GLASSIUS translates,
"prince of Menuchah" (compare [Ch1
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/ch1002.htm#052), Margin.md). MAURER translates,
"commander of the caravan," on whom it devolved to appoint the
resting-place for the night. English Version suits the context best.

but in private, as is to be inferred from his addressing himself
altogether to God ([Jer 51:62](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#062).md)
\[CALVIN\].

they shall be weary--The Babylonians shall be worn out, so as not to be
able to recover their strength.

Thus far . . . Jeremiah--Hence it is to be inferred that the last
chapter is not included in Jeremiah's writings but was added by some
inspired man, mainly at 2Ki. 24:18-25:30 to explain and confirm what
precedes \[CALVIN\].

(See on [Jer 51:64](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#064).md). Jeremiah, having
already (thirty-ninth and fortieth chapters) given the history in the
proper place, was not likely to repeat it here. Its canonical authority
as inspired is shown by its being in the Septuagint version. It contains
the capture and burning of Jerusalem, &c., Zedekiah's punishment, and
the better treatment of Jehoiachin under Evil-merodach, down to his
death. These last events were probably subsequent to Jeremiah's time.
