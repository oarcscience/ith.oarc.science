### [Psalms Chapter 89](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001)

[Psalms 89:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">psa 89:1</span></span>

Of Ethan--(See on [Psa 88:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#001), title).
This Psalm was composed during some season of great national distress,
perhaps Absalom's rebellion. It contrasts the promised prosperity and
perpetuity of David's throne (with reference to the great promise of
[Sa2 7:12-17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)), with a time when God
appeared to have forgotten His covenant. The picture thus drawn may
typify the promises and the adversities of Christ's kingdom, and the
terms of confiding appeal to God provided appropriate prayers for the
divine aid and promised blessing. (Psa. 89:1-52)

mercies--those promised ([Isa 55:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#003);
[Act 13:34](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#034)), and--

faithfulness--that is, in fulfilling them.

[Psalms 89:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">psa 89:2</span></span>

I have said--expressed, as well as felt, my convictions ([Co2
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#013)).

[Psalms 89:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">psa 89:3</span></span>

The object of this faith expressed in God's words ([Sa2
7:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#011)).

with--or literally, "to"

my chosen--as the covenant is in the form of a promise.

[Psalms 89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">psa 89:6</span></span>

This is worthy of our belief, for His faithfulness (is praised) by the
congregation of saints or holy ones; that is, angels (compare [Deu
33:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002); [Dan
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013)).

sons of the mighty--(compare [Psa
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#001)). So is He to be admired on
earth.

[Psalms 89:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">psa 89:8</span></span>

To illustrate His power and faithfulness examples are cited from
history. His control of the sea (the most mighty and unstable object in
nature), and of Egypt ([Psa 87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004)), the
first great foe of Israel (subjected to utter helplessness from pride
and insolence), are specimens. At the same time, the whole frame of
nature founded and sustained by Him, Tabor and Hermon for "east and
west," and "north and south," together representing the whole world,
declare the same truth as to His attributes.

[Psalms 89:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#012)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_012">psa 89:12</span></span>

rejoice in thy name--praise Thy perfections by their very existence.

[Psalms 89:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#015)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_015">psa 89:15</span></span>

His government of righteousness is served by "mercy" and "truth" as
ministers ([Psa 85:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#010)).

know the joyful sound--understand and appreciate the spiritual blessings
symbolized by the feasts to which the people were called by the trumpet
([Lev 25:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#009), &c.).

walk . . . countenance--live in His favor ([Psa
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006); [Psa
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003)).

[Psalms 89:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#016)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_016">psa 89:16</span></span>

in--or, "by"

thy righteousness--Thy faithful just rule.

glory--or, "beauty."

of their strength--They shall be adorned as well as protected.

our horn--exalt our power ([Psa 75:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#010);
[Luk 1:69](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#069)).

[Psalms 89:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#018)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_018">psa 89:18</span></span>

(Margin). Thus is introduced the promise to "our shield," "our king,"
David.

[Psalms 89:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#019)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_019">psa 89:19</span></span>

Then--when the covenant was established, of whose execution the exalted
views of God now given furnish assurance.

thou . . . to thy holy one--or godly saint, object of favor ([Psa
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)). Nathan is meant ([Sa2
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#017); [Ch1
17:3-15](../../../bib/kjv/ch1017.htm#003)).

laid help--literally, "given help." David was chosen and then exalted.

[Psalms 89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_020">psa 89:20</span></span>

I have found--having sought and then selected him ([Sa1
16:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)).

[Psalms 89:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#021)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_021">psa 89:21</span></span>

will protect and sustain ([Isa 41:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#010)),

[Psalms 89:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#022)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_022">psa 89:22</span></span>

by restraining and conquering his enemies, and performing My gracious
purpose of extending his dominion--

[Psalms 89:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#025)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_025">psa 89:25</span></span>

hand \[and\] right hand--power ([Psa
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007); [Psa
60:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#005)).

sea, and . . . rivers--limits of his empire ([Psa
72:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#008)).

[Psalms 89:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#026)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_026">psa 89:26</span></span>

first-born--one who is chief, most beloved or distinguished ([Exo
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022); [Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)). In God's sight and purposes he
was the first among all monarchs, and specially so in his typical
relation to Christ.

[Psalms 89:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#028)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_028">psa 89:28</span></span>

This relation is perpetual with David's descendants, as a whole typical
in official position of his last greatest descendant. Hence though in
personal relations any of them might be faithless and so punished, their
typical relation shall continue. His oath confirms His promise, and the
most enduring objects of earth and heaven illustrate its perpetual force
([Psa 72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005), [Psa
72:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#007), [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)).

[Psalms 89:35](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#035)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_035">psa 89:35</span></span>

Once--one thing ([Psa 27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004)).

by my holiness--as a holy God.

that I will not lie--literally, "if I lie"--part of the form of swearing
([Sa1 24:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#006); [Sa2
3:35](../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#035)).

[Psalms 89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_037">psa 89:37</span></span>

It shall . . . moon . . . heaven--literally, "As the moon, and the
witness in the sky is sure, that is, the moon."

[Psalms 89:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_038">psa 89:38</span></span>

present a striking contrast to these glowing promises, in mournful
evidences of a loss of God's favor.

cast off--and rejected (compare [Psa
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004); [Psa
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#002); [Psa
44:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#009)).

[Psalms 89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_039">psa 89:39</span></span>

An insult to the "crown," as of divine origin, was a profanation.

[Psalms 89:40](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#040)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_040">psa 89:40</span></span>

The ruin is depicted under several figures--a vineyard whose broken
"hedges," and "strongholds," whose ruins invite spoilers and invaders; a
warrior, whose enemies are aided by God, and whose sword's
"edge"--literally, "rock" or "strength" ([Jos
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#002)) is useless; and a youth
prematurely old.

[Psalms 89:45](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#045)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_045">psa 89:45</span></span>

days of his youth--or, "youthful vigor," that is, of the royal line, or
promised perpetual kingdom, under the figure of a man.

[Psalms 89:46](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#046)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_046">psa 89:46</span></span>

How long, &c.--(Compare [Psa 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001);
[Psa 88:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa088.htm#014); [Jer
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004)).

[Psalms 89:47](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#047)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_047">psa 89:47</span></span>

These expostulations are excited in view of the identity of the
prosperity of this kingdom with the welfare of all mankind ([Gen
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018); [Psa
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017); [Isa
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#007); [Isa
11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001)); for if such is the fate of
this chosen royal line.

[Psalms 89:48](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#048)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_048">psa 89:48</span></span>

What man--literally, "strong man--shall live?" and, indeed, have not all
men been made in vain, as to glorifying God?

[Psalms 89:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#049)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_049">psa 89:49</span></span>

The terms of expostulation are used in view of the actual appearance
that God had forsaken His people and forgotten His promise, and the plea
for aid is urged in view of the reproaches of His and His people's
enemies (compare Isa. 37:17-35).

[Psalms 89:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#050)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050">psa 89:50</span></span>

bear in my bosom--as feeling the affliction of the people ([Psa
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)).

footsteps--ways ([Psa 56:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa056.htm#006)).

[Psalms 89:52](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#052)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_052">psa 89:52</span></span>

Blessed, &c.--denotes returning confidence ([Psa
34:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#001)).

Amen, and Amen--closes the third book of Psalms.
