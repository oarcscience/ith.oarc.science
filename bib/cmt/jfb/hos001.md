### [Hosea Chapter 1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

[Hosea 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">hos 1:1</span></span>

INSCRIPTION. ([Hos 1:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001).md)

Spiritual whoredom of Israel set forth by symbolical acts; Gomer taken
to wife at God's command: Jezreel, Lo-ruhamah, and Lo-Ammi, the
children. Yet a promise of Judah and Israel's restoration.

The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea--See Introduction.

Jeroboam--the second; who died in the fifteenth year of Uzziah's
forty-one years' reign. From his time forth all Israel's kings
worshipped false gods: Zachariah ([Kg2
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#009).md), Menahem ([Kg2
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#018).md), Pekahiah ([Kg2
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#024).md), Pekah ([Kg2
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#028).md), Hoshea ([Kg2
17:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#002).md). As Israel was most flourishing
externally under Jeroboam II, who recovered the possessions seized on by
Syria, Hosea's prophecy of its downfall at that time was the more
striking as it could not have been foreseen by mere human sagacity.
Jonah the prophet had promised success to Jeroboam II from God, not for
the king's merit, but from God's mercy to Israel; so the coast of Israel
was restored by Jeroboam II from the entering of Hamath to the sea of
the plain ([Kg2 14:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#023).md).

[Hosea 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">hos 1:2</span></span>

beginning--not of the prophet's predictions generally, but of those
spoken by Hosea.

take . . . wife of whoredoms--not externally acted, but internally and
in vision, as a pictorial illustration of Israel's unfaithfulness
\[HENGSTENBERG\]. Compare [Eze 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008.md),
[Eze 16:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#015.md), &c. Besides the
loathsomeness of such a marriage, if an external act, it would require
years for the birth of three children, which would weaken the symbol
(compare [Eze 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze004.htm#004).md). HENDERSON objects
that there is no hint of the transaction being fictitious: Gomer fell
into lewdness after her union with Hosea, not before; for thus only she
was a fit symbol of Israel, who lapsed into spiritual whoredom after the
marriage contract with God on Sinai, and made even before at the call of
the patriarchs of Israel. Gomer is called "a wife of whoredoms,"
anticipatively.

children of whoredoms--The kingdom collectively is viewed as a mother;
the individual subjects of it are spoken of as her children. "Take"
being applied to both implies that they refer to the same thing viewed
under different aspects. The "children" were not the prophet's own, but
born of adultery, and presented to him as his \[KITTO, Biblical
CyclopÃ&brvbr;dia\]. Rather, "children of whoredoms" means that the
children, like their mother, fell into spiritual fornication. Compare
"bare him a son" (see [Hos 2:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004).md).
Being children of a spiritual whore, they naturally fell into her
whorish ways.

[Hosea 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#003.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">hos 1:3</span></span>

Gomer . . . daughter of Diblaim--symbolical names; literally,
"completion, daughter of grape cakes"; the dual expressing the double
layers in which these dainties were baked. So, one completely given up
to sensuality. MAURER explains "Gomer" as literally, "a burning coal."
Compare [Pro 6:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#027.md), [Pro
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#029.md), as to an adulteress; [Job
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#009.md), [Job
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#012.md).

[Hosea 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">hos 1:4</span></span>

Jezreel--that is, "God will scatter" (compare [Zac
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009).md). It was the royal city of Ahab
and his successors, in the tribe of Issachar. Here Jehu exercised his
greatest cruelties ([Kg2 9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#016.md), [Kg2
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#025.md), [Kg2
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#033.md); [Kg2
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#011.md), [Kg2
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#014.md), [Kg2
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#017).md). There is in the name an
allusion to "Israel" by a play of letters and sounds.

[Hosea 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#005.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">hos 1:5</span></span>

bow--the prowess ([Jer 49:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#035.md); compare
[Gen 49:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#024).md).

valley of Jezreel--afterwards called Esdraelon, extending ten miles in
breadth, and in length from Jordan to the Mediterranean near Mount
Carmel, the great battlefield of Palestine ([Jdg
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#033.md); [Sa1
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1029.htm#001).md).

[Hosea 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">hos 1:6</span></span>

Lo-ruhamah--that is, "not an object of mercy or gracious favor."

take . . . away--Israel, as a kingdom, was never restored from Assyria,
as Judah was from Babylon after seventy years. MAURER translates
according to the primary meaning, "No more will I have mercy on the
house of Israel, so as to pardon them."

[Hosea 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">hos 1:7</span></span>

Judah is only incidentally mentioned to form a contrast to Israel.

by the Lord their God--more emphatic than "by Myself"; by that Jehovah
(Me) whom they worship as their God, whereas ye despise Him.

not . . . by bow--on which ye Israelites rely ([Hos
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#005), "the bow of Israel".md); Jeroboam II
was famous as a warrior ([Kg2 14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md).
Yet it was not by their warlike power Jehovah would save Judah ([Sa1
17:47](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#047.md); [Psa
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007).md). The deliverance of Jerusalem
from Sennacherib ([Kg2 19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035).md), and the
restoration from Babylon, are herein predicted.

[Hosea 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#008.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">hos 1:8</span></span>

weaned--said to complete the symbolical picture, not having any special
signification as to Israel \[HENDERSON\]. Israel was bereft of all the
privileges which were as needful to them as milk is to infants (compare
[Psa 131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md); [Pe1
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002).md) \[VATABLUS\]. Israel was not
suddenly, but gradually cast off; God bore with them with
long-suffering, until they were incurable \[CALVIN\]. But as it is not
God, but Gomer who weans Lo-ruhamah, the weaning may imply the lust of
Gomer, who was hardly weaned when she is again pregnant \[MANGER\].

[Hosea 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">hos 1:9</span></span>

Lo-Ammi--once "My people," but henceforth not so ([Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008).md). The intervals between the
marriage and the successive births of the three children, imply that
three successive generations are intended. Jezreel, the first child,
represents the dynasty of Jeroboam I and his successors, ending with
Jehu's shedding the blood of Jeroboam's line in Jezreel; it was there
that Jezebel was slain, in vengeance for Naboth's blood shed in the same
Jezreel ([Kg1 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#001.md); [Kg2
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#021.md), [Kg2
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030).md). The scenes of Jezreel were to
be enacted over again on Jehu's degenerate race. At Jezreel Assyria
routed Israel \[JEROME\]. The child's name associates past sins,
intermediate punishments, and final overthrow. Lo-ruhamah ("not
pitied"), the second child, is a daughter, representing the effeminate
period which followed the overthrow of the first dynasty, when Israel
was at once abject and impious. Lo-Ammi ("not my people"), the third
child, a son, represents the vigorous dynasty ([Kg2
14:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025).md) of Jeroboam II; but, as
prosperity did not bring with it revived piety, they were still not
God's people.

[Hosea 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">hos 1:10</span></span>

Literally fulfilled in part at the return from Babylon, in which many
Israelites joined with Judah. Spiritually, the believing seed of Jacob
or Israel, Gentiles as well as Jews, numerous "as the sand" ([Gen
32:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#012).md); the Gentiles, once not God's
people, becoming His "sons" ([Joh
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md); [Rom
9:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md); [Pe1
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010.md); [Jo1
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001).md). To be fulfilled in its literal
fulness hereafter in Israel's restoration ([Rom
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026).md).

the living God--opposed to their dead idols.

[Hosea 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#011.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">hos 1:11</span></span>

Judah . . . Israel . . . together-- ([Isa
11:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012.md); [Jer
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#018.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md); [Eze
37:16-24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#016).md).

one head--Zerubbabel typically; Christ antitypically, under whom alone
Israel and Judah are joined, the "Head" of the Church ([Eph
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#022.md); [Eph
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023).md), and of the hereafter united
kingdom of Judah and Israel ([Jer
34:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#005.md); [Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023).md). Though "appointed" by the
Father ([Psa 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006).md), Christ is in
another sense "appointed" as their Head by His people, when they accept
and embrace Him as such.

out of the land--of the Gentiles among whom they sojourn.

the day of Jezreel--"The day of one" is the time of God's special
visitation of him, either in wrath or in mercy. Here "Jezreel" is in a
different sense from that in [Hos 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md),
"God will sow," not "God will scatter"; they shall be the seed of God,
planted by God again in their own land ([Jer
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md); [Jer
31:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#028.md); [Jer
32:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#041.md); [Amo
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#015).md).
