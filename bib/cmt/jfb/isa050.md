### [Isaiah Chapter 50](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

[Isaiah 50:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_001">isa 50:1</span></span>

THE JUDGMENTS ON ISRAEL WERE PROVOKED BY THEIR CRIMES, YET THEY ARE NOT
FINALLY CAST OFF BY GOD. ([Isa
50:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#001))

Where . . . mothers divorcement--Zion is "the mother"; the Jews are the
children; and God the Husband and Father ([Isa
54:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#005); [Isa
62:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#005); [Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014)). GESENIUS thinks that God means
by the question to deny that He had given "a bill of divorcement" to
her, as was often done on slight pretexts by a husband ([Deu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001)), or that He had "sold" His and
her "children," as a poor parent sometimes did ([Exo
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#007); [Kg2
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#001); [Neh
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/neh005.htm#005)) under pressure of his
"creditors"; that it was they who sold themselves through their own
sins. MAURER explains, "Show the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom
. . . ; produce the creditors to whom ye have been sold; so it will be
seen that it was not from any caprice of Mine, but through your own
fault, your mother has been put away, and you sold" ([Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003)). HORSLEY best explains (as the
antithesis between "I" and "yourselves" shows, though LOWTH translates,
"Ye are sold") I have never given your mother a regular bill of
divorcement; I have merely "put her away" for a time, and can,
therefore, by right as her husband still take her back on her
submission; I have not made you, the children, over to any "creditor" to
satisfy a debt; I therefore still have the right of a father over you,
and can take you back on repentance, though as rebellious children you
have sold yourselves to sin and its penalty ([Kg1
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025)).

bill . . . whom--rather, "the bill with which I have put her away"
\[MAURER\].

[Isaiah 50:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#002)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_002">isa 50:2</span></span>

I--Messiah.

no man--willing to believe in and obey Me ([Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001), [Isa
52:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#003)). The same Divine Person had
"come" by His prophets in the Old Testament (appealing to them, but in
vain, [Jer 7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025)), who was about to
come under the New Testament.

hand shortened--the Oriental emblem of weakness, as the long
stretched-out hand is of power ([Isa
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001)). Notwithstanding your sins, I
can still "redeem" you from your bondage and dispersion.

dry up . . . sea-- ([Exo 14:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#021)). The
second exodus shall exceed, while it resembles in wonders, the first
([Isa 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#011), [Isa
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#015); [Isa
51:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#015)).

make . . . rivers . . . wilderness--turn the prosperity of Israel's foes
into adversity.

fish stinketh--the very judgment inflicted on their Egyptian enemies at
the first exodus ([Exo 7:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#018), [Exo
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#021)).

[Isaiah 50:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#003)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_003">isa 50:3</span></span>

heavens . . . blackness--another of the judgments on Egypt to be
repeated hereafter on the last enemy of God's people ([Exo
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#021)).

sackcloth-- ([Rev 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev006.htm#012)).

[Isaiah 50:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#004)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_004">isa 50:4</span></span>

Messiah, as "the servant of Jehovah" ([Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)), declares that the office has
been assigned to Him of encouraging the "weary" exiles of Israel by
"words in season" suited to their case; and that, whatever suffering it
is to cost Himself, He does not shrink from it ([Isa
50:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005)), for that He knows His cause
will triumph at last ([Isa 50:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)).

learned--not in mere human learning, but in divinely taught modes of
instruction and eloquence ([Isa 49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002);
[Exo 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011); [Mat
7:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#028); [Mat
13:54](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#054)).

speak a word in season-- ([Pro 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#023);
[Pro 25:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#011)). Literally, "to succor by
words," namely, in their season of need, the "weary" dispersed ones of
Israel ([Deu 28:65-67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065)). Also, the
spiritual "weary" ([Isa 42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003); [Mat
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)).

wakeneth morning by morning, &c.--Compare "daily rising up early" ([Jer
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025); [Mar
1:35](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#035)). The image is drawn from a
master wakening his pupils early for instruction.

wakeneth . . . ear--prepares me for receiving His divine instructions.

as the learned--as one taught by Him. He "learned obedience,"
experimentally, "by the things which He suffered"; thus gaining that
practical learning which adapted Him for "speaking a word in season" to
suffering men ([Heb 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 50:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#005)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_005">isa 50:5</span></span>

opened . . . ear--(See on [Isa 42:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#020);
[Isa 48:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#008)); that is, hath made me
obediently attentive (but MAURER, "hath informed me of my duty"), as a
servant to his master (compare [Psa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006), with [Phi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007); [Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001); [Isa
49:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003), [Isa
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006); [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013); [Isa
53:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011); [Mat
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028); [Luk
22:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#027)).

not rebellious--but, on the contrary, most willing to do the Father's
will in proclaiming and procuring salvation for man, at the cost of His
own sufferings ([Heb 10:5-10](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005)).

[Isaiah 50:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#006)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_006">isa 50:6</span></span>

smiters--with scourges and with the open hand ([Isa
52:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#014); [Mar
14:65](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#065)). Literally fulfilled ([Mat
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#026); [Mat
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027); [Luk
18:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#033)). To "pluck the hair" is the
highest insult that can be offered an Oriental ([Sa2
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa2010.htm#004); [Lam
3:30](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#030)). "I gave" implies the voluntary
nature of His sufferings; His example corresponds to His precept ([Mat
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039)).

spitting--To spit in another's presence is an insult in the East, much
more on one; most of all in the face ([Job
30:10](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#010); [Mat
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#030); [Luk
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#032)).

[Isaiah 50:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#007)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_007">isa 50:7</span></span>

Sample of His not being "discouraged" ([Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004); [Isa
49:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#005)).

set . . . face like . . . flint--set Myself resolutely, not to be
daunted from My work of love by shame or suffering ([Eze
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 50:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_008">isa 50:8</span></span>

([Isa 49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004)). The believer, by virtue
of his oneness with Christ, uses the same language ([Psa
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008); [Rom
8:32-34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)). But "justify" in His case,
is God's judicial acceptance and vindication of Him on the ground of His
own righteousness ([Luk 23:44-47](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044); [Rom
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004); [Ti1
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016), with which compare [Pe1
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018)); in their case, on the ground of
His righteousness and meritorious death imputed to them ([Rom
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019)).

stand together--in judgment, to try the issue.

adversary--literally, "master of my cause," that is, who has real ground
of accusation against me, so that he can demand judgment to be given in
his favor (compare [Zac 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001), &c. [Rev
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#010)).

[Isaiah 50:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#009)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_009">isa 50:9</span></span>

(Compare "deal," or "proper," [Isa
52:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#013), Margin; [Isa
53:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#010); [Psa
118:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#006); [Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005)).

as a garment-- ([Isa 51:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006), [Isa
51:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#008); [Psa
102:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026)). A leading constituent of
wealth in the East is change of raiment, which is always liable to the
inroads of the moth; hence the frequency of the image in Scripture.

[Isaiah 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_010">isa 50:10</span></span>

Messiah exhorts the godly after His example ([Isa
49:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004); [Isa
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#004)) when in circumstances of trial
("darkness," [Isa 47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005)), to trust in
the arm of Jehovah alone.

Who is, &c.--that is, Whosoever ([Jdg
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#003)).

obeyeth . . . servant--namely, Messiah. The godly "honor the Son, even
as they honor the Father" ([Joh 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023)).

darkness-- ([Mic 7:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008)). God never had
a son who was not sometimes in the dark. For even Christ, His only Son,
cried out, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"

light--rather, "splendor"; bright sunshine; for the servant of God is
never wholly without "light" \[VITRINGA\]. A godly man's way may be
dark, but his end shall be peace and light. A wicked man's way may be
bright, but his end shall be utter darkness ([Psa
112:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#004); [Psa
97:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa097.htm#011); [Psa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#024)).

let him trust in the name of the Lord--as Messiah did ([Isa
50:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#008)).

[Isaiah 50:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#011)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_011">isa 50:11</span></span>

In contrast to the godly ([Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010)),
the wicked, in times of darkness, instead of trusting in God, trust in
themselves (kindle a light for themselves to walk by) ([Ecc
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#009)). The image is continued from
[Isa 50:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa050.htm#010), "darkness"; human devices
for salvation ([Pro 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#021); [Pro
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#009), [Pro
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#025)) are like the spark that goes
out in an instant in darkness (compare [Job
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#006); [Job
21:17](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#017), with [Psa
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#028)).

sparks--not a steady light, but blazing sparks extinguished in a moment.

walk--not a command, but implying that as surely as they would do so,
they should lie down in sorrow ([Jer
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#025)). In exact proportion to mystic
Babylon's previous "glorifying" of herself shall be her sorrow ([Mat
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#030); [Mat
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012); [Rev
18:7](../../../bib/kjv/rev018.htm#007)).
